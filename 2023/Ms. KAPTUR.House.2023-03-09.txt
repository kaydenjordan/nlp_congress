 Mr. Speaker, serving in Ohio's 9th district, and as the  leading Democrat and Ranking Member on the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Energy and Water Development, I am keenly aware that clean and  abundant water resources are vital for the success of our nation's  economy and the health of our communities. The Great Lakes region which  I proudly represent and champion provides drinking water for more than  40 million people and supports a $6 trillion economy. Before us is H.J.  Res. 27, another desperate attempt to weaken the Clean Water Act. After  decades of reckless pollution, a fire on the Cuyahoga River in  Cleveland, OH helped spark an environmental movement that brought us to  the passage of the visionary Clean Water Act in 1972. The 50-year  legacy of the CWA is a testament to the power of bipartisan legislation  that prioritizes people and communities. If successful, H.J. Res. 27.  would return us to a patchwork strategy of water management that  existed prior to 1972.   H.J. Res. 27 is yet another example of partisan politics that do  nothing for constituents in my district in Toledo and along Lake Erie-- or our neighbors throughout the Great Lakes region. Instead, this  resolution undermines long-standing guidance that protects our waters.  This resolution eliminates existing clarity and certainty that  businesses, developers, and farmers rely on, and it creates the  opportunity for our waterways to return to serving only as waste  receptacles. Even with a strong Clean Water Act, much remains to be  done to ensure clean drinking water for all; the 2014 Toledo water  crisis was the direct result of toxins in the water. Further eroding  our ability to protect our waters is a disservice to everyone. Today, I  will vote no on H.J. Res. 27 because protecting our Great Lakes is a  priority, and I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to do the same, so that our waterways can be protected for future  generations to come.    Mr. Speaker, today I am celebrating justice and a victory  over big corruption in Ohio.   A jury in Federal court in Ohio found guilty and convicted the  Republican Ohio Speaker, Larry Householder, and former Ohio Republican  Party Chair, Matt Borges. Guilty of illegally selling off the Ohio  statehouse through bribery, conspiracy, racketeering, and wire fraud,  involving taking $61 million in bribes through FirstEnergy's dark money  fund called Generation Now.   Their conspiracy involved forcing $1.3 billion of FirstEnergy losses  on the ratepayers of Ohio. Shame on them.   What they were not tried for but should have been is their dangerous  malfeasance in allowing FirstEnergy's nuclear plant in my district to  operate in the most dangerous manner, creating the most serious set of  nuclear accidents in this country's history since Three Mile Island.   Onward justice. Onward new clean energy for Ohio and America.                            ____________________
