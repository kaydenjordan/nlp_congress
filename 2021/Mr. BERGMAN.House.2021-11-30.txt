 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of all Americans  who feel that they are being abandoned by the current administration. I  share this sentiment.   To be clear, President Biden is the President of now leaving you  behind. He will leave you behind in Afghanistan. He will leave your job  behind if you don't comply with his mandates. He will leave our borders  behind in favor of illegal immigrants. He will leave our economy behind  for China to surpass. He plain old leads from behind.   I propose we leave President Biden's dangerous policies behind before  our children's futures are ultimately destroyed. It is time for our  leaders to put America first by securing our border, keeping our  Nation's promises to veterans and overseas allies, and in ending the  senseless Washington spending addiction.                            ____________________
