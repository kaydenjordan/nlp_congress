 Madam Speaker, I stand today in support of the  Women's Health Protection Act.   New Mexico is a border State with Texas. Because of the draconian  Texas abortion ban, Texas women are driving hours to receive  reproductive healthcare in New Mexico.   We are receiving women's rights refugees, our Texas sisters, with  open arms, open hearts, and open clinics.   New Mexico knows that a woman's freedom to make difficult health  decisions belongs to her alone. In contrast,  [[Page H5129]]  Texas politicians deputized complete strangers to interfere with her  health choices.   Texas' abortion ban falls most heavily on minority, LGBTQ, and low- income communities who can't afford to travel or access quality  healthcare.   I trust in the wisdom of my House colleagues, who, in passing the  Women's Health Protection Act, are standing with the women of this  country in every State.                            ____________________
