 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, there are times in Washington that go beyond  the mundane, times when you can feel the pull of public sentiment and  the weight of history, times that aren't political but become personal.  For some of us who serve here and for millions more around the country,  this is one of those times.   Yesterday, I was proud to join so many Members of this House to  introduce the Equality Act. This bill will ensure full equality under  the law for the LGBTQ community, an essential step, given that  Americans can still be  [[Page H2737]]  fired or discriminated against in nearly 30 States.   We have made marked progress over recent decades, no doubt, but full  equality for LGBTQ Americans still lies somewhere over the horizon.   We are not asking for anything more or anything less than any other  American enjoys. We are asking to be treated equally, and we are asking  for it right now.   I grew up afraid about whether I would be accepted by the world  around me and convinced I wouldn't be able to live a full life. This  is, unfortunately, a reality today for too many LGBTQ Americans. Too  many still live in fear of sharing their truth or telling their  stories. Too many contend with injustice because of who they are or  whom they love.   There is injustice when more than 4 million workers could face the  risk of employment discrimination in this country.   There is injustice when more than 2 million students are left without  protections against bullying, harassment, and roadblocks on their path  to an education.   There is injustice when nearly 7 million Americans could be subject  to discrimination in public accommodations.   There is injustice when 5\1/2\ million Americans could be denied  equal opportunities to secure housing or credit.   This is heartbreaking. This is not what America stands for, and we  can do something about it.   We can take action to support the values and the Constitution of this  Nation.   We can take action that will protect the safety and well-being of  millions and tell everyone, particularly the LGBTQ youth, that they can  reach their full potential.   We can take action and pass the Equality Act.   The Equality Act will end these injustices and establish equality  under the law by enshrining sexual orientation and gender identity  language into the Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal  Credit Opportunity Act, and the Jury Selection and Services Act.   We must address this at the Federal level. Equality and human dignity  are not concepts that can be left up to the States. Americans who live  in Nebraska deserve the same civil rights protections as those living  in my home State of New Hampshire. The same goes for those living in  Mississippi and in Massachusetts.   The end of discrimination can only begin when we protect our fellow  citizens in each and every community across this Nation.   Since Stonewall, millions of LGBTQ Americans have come out and have  told their stories. Many have done so at great personal risk, but with  a great societal benefit.   Coming out and living openly has done more to change hearts, minds,  and laws than anything else. As a result, we now stand on the cusp of  history and of full equality, with the American people and public  opinion squarely behind us.   Mr. Speaker, as the people's House considers this bill, I ask my  colleagues a simple question: Who deserves to be treated as a second- class citizen just for being who we are? Which Members of this body,  which people in your districts, which people in your own lives deserve  to be less than equal?   Mr. Speaker, I hope this House gets it right. Full equality under the  law--nothing less, nothing more. It is a simple concept; it is a  beautiful concept; and it is also an American concept.   Mr. Speaker, for the sake of the LGBTQ Americans today, for future  generations, let's pass H.R. 5, the Equality Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
