 Madam Speaker, coronavirus obviously is a cause of great  concern for our citizens' well-being and impact on our health system in  its ability to deliver service in this country.   What is disappointing in the last few days, it is once again being  turned into a political football by those who oppose everything that  this President does, even this morning before a briefing we had to  educate us Members.   Can we please just stop on the bashing and focus on what Americans  expect--solutions?   There is much we don't know. It is a moving target. China hasn't been  very forthcoming with information.   So, in order to provide an abundance of caution, we need to have a  deliberate process, and that is what our health officials are trying to  provide.   We don't want an over-panic, but we don't want an under-response  either. We need to assure our citizens that proper steps are being  taken--and I believe they are--in containing it in this country.   Working together for solutions and leaving the politics to the  Presidential debates and the talk shows and all that is what we need to  be doing. It will help us best serve the needs and provide assurances  as we learn and understand the breadth of this virus and its reach into  our lives in this country.   It is not Democrat. It is not Republican. It is just answers and  assurances our citizens expect us to do.                            ____________________
