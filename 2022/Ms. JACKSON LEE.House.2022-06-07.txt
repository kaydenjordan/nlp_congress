 Buffalo, Tulsa, Philadelphia. Mr. Speaker, I won't  be talking about guns. I will be talking about saving lives.   My deepest sympathy to my colleague in Texas that represents Uvalde,  and to the people of Texas. And I am going to be repetitive this week.  It is going to be about saving lives and explaining to the American  people that people take guns to kill. It may be suicide, but it is  certainly mass murders. We are up to 200 mass murders up to this date.   But the most stark of what we see is that grocery store shoppers in  Buffalo, killed by white supremacy and guns, automatic weapons; here in  Uvalde, these precious children, killed by guns, automatic weapons.   We have to pass protecting our children's act, and we must also pass  a 7-day waiting period, which I will be introducing to deal with  automatic weapons because guns kill.   And the question that all of my colleagues must ask: Do you believe  in humanity? Do you have courage? And can you act? That is the only  question to save lives.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as a steadfast ally of the men and  women serving in the federal government, I rise in support of H.R.  6087, the ``Improving Access to Workers' Compensation for Injured  Federal Workers Act.''   This bill allows for injured federal workers to consult with nurse  practitioners or physician assistants for the diagnosis and treatment  of injuries covered by workers' compensation.   H.R. 6087 will make a needed correction to the Federal Employees  Compensation Act, increasing the accessibility of healthcare for nearly  three million federal employees.   Nurse practitioners and physician assistants represent a growing  portion of American primary care providers, especially for medically  underserved communities.   We must prioritize the needs of our invaluable federal workers.  Lowering the bureaucratic obstacles blocking federal workers' access to  benefits is a necessary measure to protect them.   When Congress has an opportunity to remedy real-world issues with  bipartisan action, especially when it improves the lives of government  employees, it is our responsibility to act.   H.R. 6087 is especially critical in the face of the increasing  workplace risks associated with COVID-19, in which situation an  expanded list of approved medical providers can help fill the coverage  gap.   The pandemic has already stressed the health and wellbeing of federal  workers. Amending the Federal Employees Compensation Act is imperative  to lessen that burden.   According to the Office of Personnel Management, Texas has 143,087  federal workers. I will always fight for these workers by standing up  for their access to healthcare.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7352--the  ``PPP and Bank Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act of 2022'' extends  the statute of limitation and provides a timeframe in which criminal  charges can be filed against those accused of fraud in connection with  the ``Paycheck Protection Program'' and ``Paycheck Protection Program  Second Draw Loans'' program.   The Paycheck Protection Program commonly known as the ``PPP'' loan  was created as a part of the CARES Act--the Covid Aid, Relief, and  Economic Security Act--of March 2020.   The PPP loan was established to help small businesses survive through  the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, so that they may be able to pay their  employees and keep their businesses operating during the tumultuous  challenges imposed by COVID-19.   I urge everyone to remember the times before the recent reemergence  of a ``business as usual'' stance that many have now taken, and  remember the omnipresent news reports about the horrific and ever- increasing death toll.   Any person who was willing, for their own financial gain, to take  advantage of that situation and the emergency funding that was intended  for those who needed it most during the gruesome pandemic deserves to  be punished for their heinous actions.   H.R. 7352 would extend the statute of limitation for prosecution of  loans classified within the PPP and Economic Injury Disaster Loan  (EIDL) categories under the Small Business Act.   As it stands now, bank-originated PPP fraud is being prosecuted as  bank fraud which carries a 10-year statute of limitations.   In contrast, loans that originated through financial technology  avenues--known as Fintech--are currently subject to only a 5-year  statute of limitations because they are governed by wire fraud laws.   H.R. 7352 will ensure that we are doing our duty to uphold justice  and gather all necessary information and evidence, while extending the  reach of the law against these violators.   PPP fraud comes at the expense of all Americans, tax-paying Americans  who work hard for the money they earn.   H.R. 7352 will ensure that there's ample time allotted for special  attention to the complex nature of PPP loan fraud.   Ensuring that the timeframe is fair and commensurate with the  severity of the nature of loan fraud, H.R. 7352 will make sure that  justice is served in every regard.   I ask that each of my colleagues joins me in support of H.R. 7352.    Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R.  5879 ``Hubzone Price Evaluation Preference Clarification Act''.   The Small Business Act is instrumental in allowing small businesses  to remain competitive amid complex markets.   Small businesses are the engine of our economy and exist as the  backbone of local communities across the nation. They are essential  contributors to our society, as we must support their growth and  progress.   The Hubzone program supports small businesses that are part of  historically underutilized business zones. These zones are low-income  communities that have increased levels of poverty and high unemployment  rates.   The program works to target inequities that make it at times  difficult for small businesses within these economically distressed  communities to compete.   Within the Small Business Act, preferential price evaluations are  given to small businesses participating in the Hubzone program.   Price evaluation preferences ensure that a price offered by a  qualified Hubzone small business entity is deemed lower than the price  offered by another offeror if the qualified Hubzone business's price is  not more than 10 percent higher than the price offered by the otherwise  lowest offeror.   These price evaluation preferences are a key feature which allow  Hubzone contracts to act as an economic boost for small businesses  within high unemployment and low-income areas.   These price evaluation preferences help level the playing field for  small businesses that are often minority-owned. In Houston alone,  nearly 35 percent of small businesses are minority-owned.   The Hubzone program gives these businesses a chance to compete in  competitive markets. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, these small  businesses need institutional support more than ever.   H.R. 5879 is necessary to clarify how small businesses can be  eligible for price evaluation preferences outlined in the Small  Business Act.   The number of Hubzone locations, or areas with historically  underutilized business zones, has nearly doubled in the past 20 years  according to the Small Business Administration.   Small businesses and the communities they benefit depend on the  success of the Hubzone program. It is vital to detail how small  businesses can receive benefits from the program.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for passage of H.R. 5879.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7622, ``The  Small Business Workforce Pipeline Act of 2022.''   This bill's purpose is to amend the Small Business Act requirements  relating to apprenticeship program assistance for small business  development centers, and other purposes.   The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a labor shortage, that affected  businesses in unimaginable ways, especially small businesses.  Alarmingly, 23 percent of small businesses closed due to the pandemic  and 20 percent of small businesses that were in their first year of  operation also failed.   This is why now, more than ever, small businesses need our support by  updating the laws that support them and to encourage apprenticeships.   I support this bill's effort to establish a clear and concise plan of  action for programing and other resources from which small businesses  and their employees can benefit.   I am in favor of this legislation because apprenticeships are  tangible opportunities for successful workplace development. They  enable young workers to gain on-the job training with educational  resources that deliver practical experience and skills, equipping them  for future career opportunities.   This ``learn as you work'' style gives access to people who may not  be able to purse traditional educational routes.   Historically, apprenticeships focused on skills for a narrow range of  industries that could also benefit from the academic credit and  mentorship opportunities. For employers finding a hard time hiring  qualified employees, apprenticeships are a direct investment that small  businesses realize will successfully impact them.   Madam Speaker, this bill will provide much needed assistance to  businesses and enable them to continue their good work of providing  training skills that will allow opportunities for employees to succeed  in the workplace. This legislation will prepare workers for the 21st  century workforce, while helping businesses find the skilled employees  they need to compete.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of H.R.  7622.   SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7622.   The question was taken.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7664, the  ``Supporting Small Business and Career and Technical Education Act of  2022.''   This bill would amend the Small Business Act to include requirements  relating to graduates of career and technical education programs, and  programs of study for small business development centers and women's  business centers.   H.R. 7664 would assist small businesses in hiring graduates from  career and technical education programs, and would assist graduates of  these programs in starting up a small business.   Small businesses are the engine of our economy, creating two-thirds  of the new jobs over the last 15 years, accounting for 44 percent of  U.S. economic activity.   According to the U.S. Small Business Association (SBA), small  businesses of 500 employees or fewer make up 99.9 percent of all U.S.  businesses and 99.7 percent of firms with paid employees.   Not only do small businesses provide millions of jobs, they also  advance careers and opportunities.   Successful small businesses put money back into their local community  through paychecks and taxes, which can support the creation of new  small businesses and improve local public services.   Small business is the portal through which many people enter the  economic mainstream.   Business ownership allows individuals, including women and  minorities, to achieve financial success, as well as bolster pride in  their accomplishments.   While most small businesses are still owned by white males, the past  two decades have seen a substantial increase in the number of  businesses owned by women and minorities.   The more we create opportunities for career growth and development  from a wide array of diverse backgrounds, the more opportunities we  create for ourselves and our economy.   A critical workforce challenge currently in the United States is the  skills gap, particularly among jobs that require either a high school  diploma, postsecondary certificate, or associate's degree.   Jobs requiring these ``middle skills'' outnumber the adults in the  workforce who possess them, and this gap presents a barrier to American  economic competitiveness.   Due to global shifts in technology, automation and other sectors that  had been occurring long before the pandemic, employers were raising  alarms over a growing number of vital skills they noticed to be in  short supply from incoming applicants.   Graduates from career and technical education (CTE) programs are  perfectly suited to fill this gap.   CTE programs help students see the relevance of their studies for  their future and motivates them to attend classes and study hard.   In 2019-20 there were 11.1 million CTE participants; 7.6 million at  the secondary level and 3.5 million at the postsecondary level.   According to the Texas Education Agency's 2016-2017 Academic  Excellence Indicator System State Profile Report, 1,523,779 secondary  students in Texas (46.3 percent) were enrolled in Career and Technical  Education programs.   We must make sure our legislation reflects the importance and value  of small business, CTE program graduates, and the role they will play  in growing our economy.   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 7664, the Supporting Small  Business and Career and Technical Education Act of 2022.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  7670, the ``Women-Owned Small Business Program Transparency Act.''   H.R. 7670 is a bipartisan effort to amend the Small Business Act to  require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to  submit to Congress a report on small businesses owned and controlled by  women including:   Information as to the amount of contracting dollars awarded through  the program,   The number of certifications being issued,   The amount of program examinations being conducted,   The number of companies being decertified, and   The number of contracts incorrectly awarded to industries within the  North American Industry Classification System or NAICS codes ineligible  for the program, as well as any actions taken by SBA to properly train  agency personnel.   The SBA's report to the Committee on Small Business of the House of  Representatives and the Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship of the Senate will equip Congress with transparency  into the effectiveness of the program that will enable future  improvements to the program.   Established in 2000, the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) program  leveled the playing field by providing an opportunity for women-owned  small businesses to attain federal contracts in industries where the  SBA had determined that women entrepreneurs were underrepresented.   Unfortunately, due to administrative neglect in the application  review and the application backlog from eligible businesses, many women  were shut out from attaining contracts.   Following the U.S. Government Accountability Office's investigation  into this matter, they concluded that ``By not improving its oversight  of the WOSB program, SBA is limiting its ability to ensure third-party  certifiers are following program requirements'', meaning that several  contracts that WOSBs had applied for were inaccessible to women.   When enacted, H.R. 7670 will reform the oversight of the WOSB program  to ensure that transparency and accountability are high priorities  during the contract distribution process.   I applaud the efforts of my colleagues Rep. Chrissy Houlahan and Rep.  Claudia Tenney for elevating the voices of all female entreprenuers  across America, including over 125,000 female small business owners  from Houston.   There has been a long history of women-owned small businesses being  excluded from consideration for federal contracts and participation in  subcontracting. The progress that women-owned small businesses had made  was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that lost ground must be  reversed so that women-owned businesses are able to remain competitive.   Now more than ever, it is critical for Congress to stand with  America's small business owners to whom we owe a great deal for our  economic prosperity.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  7670.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  7694, the ``Strengthening Subcontracting for Small Businesses Act of  2022.''   This legislation would amend the Small Business Act to ensure that  companies awarded government contracts utilize small businesses in  their subcontracting plans.   H.R. 7694 would ensure that small businesses are not excluded from  the government contracting process, which is an important concern in  Congress.   With more than 65 percent of small businesses having experienced at  least a moderately negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic according  to Statista Research, it is more vital than ever that we continue to  strengthen small business.   This legislation will provide that urgently needed support.   As small businesses account for 44 percent of U.S. economic activity,  they are the powerhouse behind the American workforce, creating two- thirds of the new jobs over the last 15 years.   Small business is vital in times of crisis, giving our economy the  ability to be more flexible, innovative, and productive.   In my home district in Houston, there are over 600,000 small  businesses engaged in industries across the spectrum.   Many of these small businesses received subcontracts following the  devastation of Hurricanes Ike and Harvey, and their work helped rebuild  Houston as well as restore local economic growth.   Just this week, there was a briefing on the COVID-19 pandemic  response that underscored how important small business subcontracts  were, and continue to be, to our capacity for COVID testing,  quarantine, and much more.   Small businesses are always serving our communities, and this  legislation on subcontracting will allow them to do more of what  they're already doing: improving life for us all.   We need legislation that reinforces the value and capability that  small businesses provide to the American economy, especially through  contracts with the federal government.   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 7694, the Strengthening  Subcontracting for Small Businesses Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished member of our  committee, Mr. Neguse, for his leadership joining with the Senate, and  I thank him for yielding, Mr. Speaker.   This is a fresh start. This is a new opportunity in important  bipartisan, bicameral legislation that Mr. Neguse has nurtured and  introduced and will ensure, under his leadership, that our bankruptcy  system works for the entrepreneurs, small businesses, homeowners, and  American families, who are the backbone of this country and of the  communities where they live and work.   Having the privilege of having served on the Judiciary Committee for  some time, I am reminded of the work that we have done, almost like a  puzzle putting together a better matrix for the American people to be  able to renew their lives even as they may have the necessity of filing  for bankruptcy.   If there is one fundamental principle of American bankruptcy law, it  is the promise of a fresh start, and the fresh start is  quintessentially an American idea. It is a promise that even when your  best efforts have failed, you are not a failure, and you will have a  chance to get back up and try again. It is a promise that your debts  will not destroy you.   Increasing the debt limit for small businesses electing to file for  bankruptcy under subchapter V of chapter 11 to $7.5 million is long  overdue.   Mr. Speaker, I particularly thank Mr. Neguse because really small  businesses across America have been raising this question, making the  point that it is impossible for them to survive with the previous cap  for individual chapter 11 filers of $2.75 million.   This legislation will provide much-needed certainty that the  bankruptcy system will be responsive to hardworking Americans and their  families trying to stay afloat in a world that can be turned upside  down by global economic shocks.   Just as I started, again, the filing of bankruptcy should not cause  one to never renew again. This legislation, with the leadership of Mr.  Neguse, gives our American businesspersons, homeowners, and others a  fresh start.   I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I give great accolades to the chairman  for his years of service.   This bill, H.R. 7776, deals with water resources infrastructure,  makes communities more resilient, and helps indigenous minority  communities, but urban areas as well.   The first longstanding impact that we have had in Texas over the  years, one of the big ones was Hurricane Ike; 195 dead, 143 miles per  hour and, of course, $38 billion. It was, in fact, the seventh most  expensive hurricane.   We have continued with the devastation through Hurricane Harvey. This  helps us with the Ike Dike and the coastal spine. We are saving lives  and helping people.   I support this bill because we can live on the Gulf Coast.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7776, the ``Water Resources  Development Act of 2022.''   This is the bill costal regions await because it outlines what  critical infrastructure projects will be funded by or in part by the  federal government.   I rise to speak on behalf of the city of Houston, which was  shortchanged by the General Land Office of Houston, which has not  received a single dollar out of $4.3 billion in Hurricane Harvey  funding appropriated by this body for flood mitigation.   Houston experienced 25 percent of the damage caused by Hurricane  Harvey which occurred in the city of Houston and twenty-five percent  occurred in Harris County.   Harris County did receive its Hurricane Harvey Flood mitigation  funding, while Houston did not receive funding for the billions in  damage caused by flood water.   As the Member of Congress representing the 18th Congressional  District of Texas, a senior member of the House Homeland Security  Committee, and the person who led the successful effort in the House of  Representatives to secure the federal disaster funding needed to  mitigate and recover from the epic damage caused by Hurricane Harvey, I  address this body to say if this has happened to the fourth largest  city in the Nation, it can happen to any community.   When Congress appropriates, there should be no light between our  decision and the expending of disaster mitigation funding.   The funds provided to insure that the same level of damage given the  same factors are not repeated in the future.   Because of the inexplicable decision by the Texas General Land Office  (GLO) refusing to award to the City of Houston or Harris County any of  the nearly $1 billion in funding for flood mitigation projects from the  $4.2 billion grant it received from the U.S. Department of Housing and  Urban Development are not ready for another storm of the size and  intensity of Hurricane Harvey.   I requested that the Department of Housing and Urban Development  review the propriety and legality of the action and Texas GLO and  suspend it from distribution any of $4.2 billion tranche, until after  HUD completes its review.   The review should include a determination of whether the decision of  the Texas GLO complies with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and  the Department's regulations.   HUD found that there was nothing it could do because of the agreement  that the Trump Administration entered into with the State of Texas.   It is impossible to justify the decision not to award a single dollar  out of the $1 billion funding tranche to the City of Houston and Harris  County, which are the economic hub of Texas and the southwest United  States, and which accounts for 16.3 percent of the state population and  more than 44 percent of the population directly affected by Hurricane  Harvey.   Hurricane Harvey did not impact all jurisdictions equally. Houston  has experienced 5 major flood events in 5 years, with Harris County as  the only county affected by disasters in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019.  The cost per-capita of damage in the City of Houston is much greater  than in rural areas because of the infrastructure and density of  residential and business structures.   The Texas GLO appears to have forgotten or disregarded the damage to  Houston and Harris County as a result of Hurricane Harvey, which  dropped 21 trillion gallons of rainfall on Texas and Louisiana, most of  it on the Houston Metroplex.   To put in perspective the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey,  the volume of water that fell on Houston and other affected areas of  Texas and Louisiana could fill more  [[Page H5295]]  than 24,000 Astrodomes or supply the water for the raging Niagara Falls  for 15 days.   Houston received more than 50 inches of rainfall and whole sections  of Houston, Beaumont, Bayou City, Port Arthur, and other cities were  underwater for days.   More than 13,000 people were rescued in the Houston area and more  than 30,000 persons were forced out of their homes due to the storm. In  just the first three days of the storm, more than 49,000 homes that had  suffered flood damage and more than 1,000 homes were completely  destroyed in the storm. The cost of removing debris dwarfed the $70  million spent by Houston removing debris after Hurricane Ike in 2008.   Given these facts, it is irrational and unconscionable that Texas GLO  awarded nearly $1 billion in U.S. Housing and Urban Development funds  to other local governments in 46 Southeast Texas counties but none to  the City of Houston.   I am in support of this bill because it renews America's commitment  to our environment by funding U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to carry out  critical infrastructure projects, especially in our Nation's coastal  areas and waterways. It also prioritizes climate change in the research  and implementation of the Corps' work.   H.R. 7776 will implement long-overdue modernization of the Corps'  procedures and ensure that the economic benefits associated with a  revitalized infrastructure are specifically advancing disadvantaged  groups. Section 224 of this legislation mandates a report on the  distribution of funds to Small Disadvantaged Businesses.   Those businesses include the thousands of small companies owned by  people of color and indigenous people. This legislation gives us the  opportunity to recenter our Nation's infrastructure development around  black and brown business owners who have been perpetually left behind.   I am pleased that this legislation requires a report to Congress by  the Secretary of the Army--who oversees the Army Corps of Engineers-- that specifies the amount of contract and subcontract dollars awarded  by the Corps to ``small and disadvantaged businesses''.   I hope to work with the Senate to further reinforce the Army Corps,  putting in place reliable strong programs and outreach for use of MWBE  in this work.   The programs for economic assistance and inclusion of MWBE by the  Army Corps in these infrastructure programs must be done. MWBE and  stopping flooding work together.   This transparency will help ensure that small businesses owned by  people of color are given a fair opportunity to compete for contract  and subcontract dollars in water projects. Furthermore, the report will  enable Congress to hold the Corps accountable if the share of dollars  to small disadvantaged businesses is inadequate.   Projects to research and mitigate flooding are critical to my  constituents in Houston, as flood waters present a perpetual risk to my  district and the surrounding community. Levees, bayous, reservoirs, and  watersheds must all be maintained and reinforced to protect Houston  from flood risks. Minority-owned businesses, who face these perpetual  risks, must be included in the contracts to protect our communities  from those risks.   In 2017, when Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on Houston and the  entire coast of Texas, it caused more than $125 billion dollars in  damage and killed 68 Texans.   As time passes, hurricanes become more intense as our planet warms.  Funding the Corps' projects will not only help protect communities in  Houston by reducing flooding, but also by lessening America's carbon  footprint. That will make these natural disasters less likely to occur.   H.R. 7776 funds projects in Houston like the removing of sediment  from the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, restoring our coastal regions,  and expanding the Houston Ship Channel. These are critical to the  economic viability and well-being of millions of people in South Texas.   It is time for Congress to act to save lives and protect our  communities. This funding will dually promote a greener America while  also working to lift marginalized groups. In doing both, we make our  Nation a more prosperous and equitable place.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con.  Res. 88, ``authorizing the use of Capitol grounds for the Greater  Washington Soap Box Derby.''   This bill calls for support to hold the traditional Soap Box Derby  association's free, public event on the Capitol grounds.   The Soap Box Derby international nonprofit organization, whose  mission is to ``build knowledge and character, and to create meaningful  experiences through collaboration and fair and honest competition,''  prides itself for allowing the race to take place on the most powerful  hill in the world, Capitol Hill.   For 88 years, this event has been an opportunity in which the  community comes out to support our youth. Annually, our youth get the  opportunity to participate in the international nonprofit's biggest  event.   Participants who compete range from ages 9-16 years old and come from  the Greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. They could potentially  have the honor of representing D.C. in the National Soap Box Derby  competition.  [[Page H5298]]    This completely sponsored soap box derby event will be free of charge  for the public and has a flexible date that will ensure it does not  interfere with the needs of Congress.   In Texas, anytime we can celebrate our youth and their  accomplishments, while also bringing the community together, it is an  opportunity fellowship and relationships through friendly competition.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Con.  Res. 88, to host the traditional, Greater Washington Soap Box Derby on  our nation's Capitol grounds, an event that will bring the community  together for a wonderful celebration.
