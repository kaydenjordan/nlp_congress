 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Con. Res.  119, which is a shameful denial of the clear evidence of climate change  and its impact on our planet.   Let me be clear. There is no greater threat to the future of this  planet than climate change. But instead of offering solutions,  Republicans are burying their heads in the sand once again.   Here are the facts. Climate change is real, it is manmade, and every  day that Congress fails to act, we are making the problem worse. The  cost of inaction is astronomical. If we do nothing it is our  grandchildren who will be left with the price tag.   The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that we can pass policies that  dramatically reduce greenhouse gases and build our economy. California,  my home State, is 4 years ahead of schedule on our greenhouse gas  emission reduction goals and green jobs have grown exponentially. We  have over 300,000 people working in the green job industry, by far the  most in the country.   So, no, Mr. Speaker, this carbon tax fear-mongering won't work  because Americans understand that the true threat to our economy is  from climate change, which is already wreaking havoc on our planet.   I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution and, instead, get to  the real work of addressing climate change.  [[Page H6563]]                                ____________________
