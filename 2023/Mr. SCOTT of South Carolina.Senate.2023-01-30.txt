 Mr. President, yesterday on ABC's ``This  Week,'' Senator Durbin asked Senator Booker and me to come back to the  table and start talking about policing in America.   I never left the table, but it was Senator Durbin who filibustered my  JUSTICE Act. It was Senator Durbin who called the effort to make  deescalation training more available a ``token'' piece of legislation.  It was indeed the Senator from Illinois who said that aspects of my  JUSTICE Act which talked about the importance of the duty to intervene  was a ``token'' piece of legislation.   In that legislation we had more resources for more training because  we want only the best wearing the badge in every location, in every  municipality, in every county, and in every State in this great Nation.  But politics too often gets in the way in doing what every American  knows is common sense, and here we find ourselves, again, having this  same conversation with no action having happened so far.   I don't speak on this floor very often, but this is my 10th speech on  policing  [[Page S152]]  in America in 8 years--the 10th time I have asked for something that  will make our officers better and safer and make our communities better  and safer. It is another time I have asked for more resources for  recruitment so that we can have only the best wearing the badge, but  this legislative body--the greatest deliberative body in the world-- didn't act.   It was in 2015, shortly after the shooting of Walter Scott, who was  shot in the back in my hometown of Charleston, SC, that I came to this  floor to ask for more resources for body-worn cameras so that we  capture what happens during those vital times, and not a single  Democrat cosponsored that legislation.   I came back a year later, in 2016, and gave three speeches on the  importance of policing in America.   In 2020, on June 17, I introduced the JUSTICE Act with more requests  for what I believe is common sense. It was 70 percent of what the House  Democrats were asking for. We, on our side of the aisle, said: This  makes sense. Why don't we find common ground in that 70 percent, make  it into a piece of legislation and show the American people that, yes,  their elected officials can, at times, act with common sense--because  my assumption was that common ground leads to common sense.   Imagine my disappointment when the duty to intervene, deescalation  training, more resources, more reporting so that we have eyes around  the country was filibustered in this Chamber with not enough votes to  even extend the conversation on the important issue of policing in  America.   I came back just a week later, on June 24, standing on this floor  asking our body to take seriously our responsibility on the important  topic of policing in America. What I said that day on June 24, 2020,  was that ``there is trouble coming.'' I referred to the Good Book, the  Bible, and reflected on Ezekiel 33:6 that says that when you see  trouble coming and you say nothing, you do nothing, the blood that  comes is on your hands. But if you shout from the mountaintops, if you  warn the people that trouble is coming, it is not on your hands.   Mr. President, our Nation is reeling. People--Republicans, Democrats,  Independents, nonaffiliates, Black folks, White folks, rich folks, poor  folks, Southerners, Northerners, the west coast and the east coast--are  sick and tired of politics as usual.   We, as a nation, deserve better. We should be able to build a  coalition around the common ground of, yes, we need more training on  deescalation; yes, we need more resources and training on the duty to  intervene; yes, we need more grants; and yes, we need the best wearing  the badge.   We should have simple legislation that we can agree upon that has  been agreed upon in the past, but too often too many are too concerned  with who gets the credit.   I know that when a conservative Republican starts talking about  policing in America, some people seem to just turn the channel. That is  wrong.   When I came to the floor and talked about my many unnecessary  incidents with the police; when I came to the floor and talked about  the man, Walter Scott, shot in my city; when I came to this floor on  June 17 and talked about the massacre at Mother Emanuel Church in my  hometown--I take the issue of policing in America seriously. I want our  body to see it not as an issue of Republicans versus Democrats but as  good people standing in the gap, elected to do a job that we all ran to  do. Let's do our jobs.   We can make a difference in this Nation. Had the duty to intervene  been law of the land on the Federal level, it could have made a  difference in Memphis, TN. In Wisconsin, more deescalation training  could make a difference.   I hope that when the dust settles and the issue is no longer on the  front pages of our newspapers, no longer streaming across our TVs and  our iPads and our computers, that we do something that says to the  American people: We see your pain. We are willing to put our partisan  labels and shirts and uniforms on the side so that we can do what needs  to be done. That is what the people deserve.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
