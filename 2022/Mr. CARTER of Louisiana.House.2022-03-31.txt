 Mr. Speaker, March is Women's History Month,  and I can't let this month pass without highlighting two barrier- breaking public servants.   So many women have contributed greatly to Louisiana, but today, I  want to take a few moments to celebrate two: Councilwoman Dorothy Mae  Taylor and Congresswoman Lindy Claiborne Boggs.   A New Orleans teacher and activist, Dorothy led a fight for equality  within the segregated school systems while serving as a PTA president.  Under her leadership, the city's Black and White schools finally  achieved equal funding.   While I didn't know it at the time, my educational experience as a  boy growing up in New Orleans in the sixties and seventies would  improve thanks to the work of Mrs. Taylor. During the civil rights  movement, she successfully fought to desegregate New Orleans  recreational facilities and register African-American voters.   She was a woman of many firsts: the first woman of color to be  elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives; the first African- American woman to hold the head of a State department; and the first  Black woman and one of the first two women to serve on the New Orleans  City Council, in 1986.   Councilwoman Taylor worked issues like criminal justice reform before  they were popular. After a century of segregation, she was the first  councilmember to move on a proposal to ban discrimination in Mardi Gras  krewe membership, a move that paved the way for their eventual  desegregation.   I was elected to the New Orleans City Council in 1994, the year that  Councilwoman Taylor retired, but I am so grateful to have known her and  to have had an opportunity to learn from her many pearls of wisdom.   Though she passed in the year 2000, she left a lasting mark on New  Orleans, Louisiana, and our country.   Congresswoman Lindy Boggs lived a life of service and warmth,  unafraid to break the glass ceiling while overcoming great personal  loss.   Her husband, the Honorable Hale Boggs, served in Congress for decades  until his tragic death in a plane crash. Following his passing, Lindy  Boggs replaced him as Congresswoman Boggs and became the first woman  ever elected to Congress from the State of Louisiana.   It takes a lot of inner strength to do that, strength we also see  today from our current colleague serving as a Member of Congress from  Louisiana, Congresswoman Julia Letlow.   In this very Chamber, Congresswoman Boggs fought tirelessly for equal  rights for women and minorities. She also fought to make the House of  Representatives more welcoming to women, successfully advocating for a  women's-only space in a governing body that was more than 96 percent  male. That room still exists today and is appropriately named the Lindy  Claiborne Boggs Congressional Women's Reading Room.   Throughout her life, Congresswoman Boggs famously opened her home,  her kitchen, and her heart to the people of Louisiana and the community  she loved so much.   She passed in 2013, but we all uplift the memory of Congresswoman  Boggs and Councilwoman Dorothy Mae Taylor for advancing issues that  they had committed their entire lives to protecting and advancing  voting rights, fighting against discrimination, providing healthcare to  underserved members of our community, and fighting for humanity for  people everywhere.   In the spirit of the Honorable Lindy Boggs and the Honorable Dorothy  Mae Taylor, we say thank you for your incredible service, and we will  continue the drumbeat of these issues here in Congress.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Louisiana has the second highest diabetes mortality rate but only the  11th highest number of cases. The rate of diabetes among Blacks,  Hispanics, and Native American adults in the State is  disproportionately high as compared to other populations.   Insulin is a lifesaving medicine, allowing people to live healthy  lives, raise families, and do their jobs. However, many can't afford  this life-regulating medicine.   Many Louisianans have to pay over $100 a vial in out-of-pocket costs  every single month. And some are forced to ration prescriptions,  risking complications or death. The people must always come before Big  Pharma.   Today, we are finally taking action to cut the price of insulin. The  Affordable Insulin Now Act would cap out-of-  [[Page H4045]]  pocket insulin costs for insulin for a month-long supply at $35 and  require plans to cover different types of insulin.   The bill is a strong move in the right direction to ease the burden,  and we must do this now.
