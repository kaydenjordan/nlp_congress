 Mr. President, let me thank my colleagues for coming to  the floor and speaking on behalf of Native Americans and the Indian  Health Service, its shortcomings and challenges that it creates for us.   I don't have an Indian reservation in my State, but I certainly have  visited these Indian reservations in other States and believe we have  an ongoing responsibility--social and moral responsibility--to those  who were in this country long before many of our ancestors and who have  not been treated fairly many, many times when it comes to the poverty  they face in this country and the challenges they face.   It is as bad as or worse than any other group in America. We can do  better, and we need to start with the Indian Health Service and health  services. I thank my colleagues for raising that issue.   Mr. President, it is interesting, this is a historic week in the  Senate because we have been engaged in a debate for weeks about what to  do about healthcare in America. The Senate, of course, is under the  majority control of the Republicans, as the House of Representatives  is, and, of course, with a Republican President. They all came to  Washington at the beginning of this year and said: The first thing we  want to do is to repeal ObamaCare. We have said it for 6 years. We are  finally going to do it. We are going to get rid of ObamaCare, the  Affordable Care Act, once and for all.   They set out to do it in a variety of ways. President Trump's first  Executive order to the agencies of the Federal Government said: Do  everything you can to discourage ObamaCare. He turned around and did  just that. His agency stopped advertising for people to sign up for  ObamaCare. They were determined to put an end to it.   In the House of Representatives, they took a step beyond that. They  introduced legislation to repeal it and replace it. What they replaced  it with was a disaster. The Congressional Budget Office took a look at  the Republican repeal plan in the House and said 24 million people will  lose their health insurance.   Beyond that, they talked about the changes that would take place in  health insurance policies with the Republican repeal plan. It passed  the House by four votes, which meant that if two Republican Members-- and only Republicans voted for it--had voted the other way, it wouldn't  have passed. It was that close.   Then it was sent to the Senate, and it was up to the Senate  Republicans to decide what they would do with this bill and what they  would do with the repeal of ObamaCare. They spent many weeks in  conversation and discussion about what they might do. Thirteen Members,  Republican Senators, sat in private rooms and talked about what they  would do to replace ObamaCare.   Finally, they reported a bill. It turns out their bill was an  improvement over the House bill. The House bill eliminated health  insurance for 24 million Americans. The Senate bill eliminated health  insurance for 23 million Americans. Still, when you look at it, it is a  horrible thing.  [[Page S4048]]    In my State of Illinois, a million people in my State would have lost  health insurance with either the House or Senate Republican bills. It  is the reason there has been resistance in my State to this Republican  effort from the start.   You would expect it on a political basis. Sure, the Democrats will  oppose the Republicans on issues, but this went beyond it. There wasn't  a single medical advocacy group in the United States that supported  what the Republicans were doing, not one. The hospital associations  across America, the medical society of doctors, the nurses, the  pediatricians, they all opposed what the Republicans set out to do.   When it looked like there were problems in passing one version of the  Senate Republican repeal bill, they sat down to rewrite it. As they sat  down to rewrite it, they got into deeper water and bigger problems.   Senator Cruz, the junior Senator from Texas, said: Well, one way to  bring down the cost of health insurance is to take out some of the  protections of a health insurance policy. We can get premiums down  pretty low if we take away the protections of a health insurance policy  that are in the Affordable Care Act.   That was his proposal.   Just this weekend, Blue Cross Blue Shield and the major health  insurance industry said that this will be a disaster. If you have some  people buying real insurance and real protection and others paying  rock-bottom premiums for little or no coverage, you are going to create  two classes of Americans, and you are going to see premiums going  through the roof for those who are buying full-coverage policies. They  came out against the Cruz proposal.   This week, we returned to face the votes. We were supposed to be  voting today, a vote on whether to repeal ObamaCare. As of last night,  things started changing. Two Republican Senators joined two others and  said they were opposing the effort, and so the Republican majority did  not have the votes it needed to go forward.   They said: Well, at least we will vote on repealing ObamaCare.   Three Republican Senators have announced, as of today, that voting  for simple repeal is something they will not do. Many of them make the  argument that just repealing ObamaCare without replacing it is  irresponsible. They are right.   If you don't like the current system, I believe you are duty-bound,  as a Senator or Congressman, to come up with a better idea, something  that serves America better. They have been unable to reach that point.   Where are we? At this moment, we are at a standstill. The Republican  efforts to repeal and replace have stopped as of this moment. There may  be a vote, an official vote this week. I don't know. That is up to  Senator McConnell as the Republican leader, but it appears there is no  plan coming out of the Republican side to replace the Affordable Care  Act.   I am proud to have voted for it. I voted for it for very simple  reasons. When it comes to health insurance, I believe that is one of  the basics in life. I am one of those politicians who believes  healthcare is a right, just like police and fire protection. It should  be part of who we are in America. I don't believe it is a question of  how rich you are or how lucky you are as to whether you have health  insurance in this country.   We can do better as a nation. The Affordable Care Act set out to do  that. We reduced the number of uninsured Americans with ObamaCare when  we passed it 6 years ago by 50 percent. We reduced by half the  uninsured people living in my State of Illinois. Many of them went to  the insurance exchanges, bought private health insurance. If they had  lower incomes, they got subsidies to help pay the premiums. Others  picked up Medicaid coverage as their health insurance. It was  significant.   I ran into people all across my State, from Chicago to downstate, who  had never had health insurance 1 day in their lives. These are not lazy  people. These are hard-working people who happen to have the kind of  jobs that didn't offer health insurance.   Ray Romanowski, big Polish fellow, guitarist and musician in Chicago  said: Senator, I have never had health insurance. I am a musician.  Nobody was ever going to provide me with health insurance.   He said: Lucky I have it now because I have been diagnosed with  diabetes. I am in my sixties, and I have, through the Affordable Care  Act, health insurance through Medicaid.   Similar story, almost identical story in deep Southern Illinois.  Judy, who works as a hospitality hostess in a local motel--she is the  one who greets you with a smile when you come in for that free  breakfast. Judy is 62 years of age. She never had health insurance 1  day in her life. She holds down two and three jobs at a time. The only  health insurance she ever had is what she has now under Medicaid.   What is going to happen to those people if we eliminate Medicaid  coverage--which the proposals before us suggested--if Medicaid coverage  is cut back dramatically?   Those two people, Ray and Judy, are still going to face health  challenges. They are still going to get sick and go to the hospital,  but if they don't have health insurance, will the hospital treat them?  Yes. What will happen to their bills? Their costs will be passed on to  everyone else. That is the way it used to be done.   What we have learned this week in Washington, in this national  healthcare debate, is there are of course concerns about whether the  current healthcare system is what it should be, and I think it can be  improved, but we have learned one basic thing. We are not going back.  We are not going back to the days when health insurance companies could  deny coverage to you or your family because of a preexisting condition.  We are not going back to the days where they put a limit on how much  they would pay on your health insurance plan.   Remember when you first realized that a $100,000 limit was not worth  that much if you had a serious diagnosis or a serious accident? We are  not going back to the days when that health insurance plan literally  expired in coverage, forcing you and your family into bankruptcy over  medical bills.   We are not going back to the day when families couldn't cover their  kids coming out of college. The Affordable Care Act said you can keep  your child on your health insurance plan as a family until they reach  the age of 26.   Those of us who have had kids who have graduated college realize they  don't always get a great job right off the bat. Some of them start as  interns or part-time workers, and they don't have health insurance.  They now know they have the peace of mind of the family health  insurance plan.   We want to make sure we protect that. We are not going back to the  day when those young people had no coverage at a critical moment in  their lives. We are not going back to the day when we allow these  insurance companies to charge whatever premiums they wish.   We put provisions in the law that limit the premiums that can be  charged on Americans, that limit the profits that are taken out of  health insurance companies. Those were moves that had to be made to  protect innocent American families who, unfortunately, were struggling  with medical bills before this law passed and now at least have some  chance of paying for them.   What we learned in the course of this national debate is significant.  We learned that if you put up a proposal, as the Republicans did in the  House and the Senate, that takes health insurance away from over 20  million Americans, you have a problem. People are going to push back  and say that it isn't fair to take away health insurance and the  protection and peace of mind that come with it. If you come up with a  plan that ends up dramatically cutting back on Medicaid, you are going  to get a lot of people who are concerned about it.    Across America, the Medicaid Program as we know it does many  significant things. One-half of the babies born in my State of Illinois  are covered by Medicaid. Mom and her prenatal care, the delivery of the  baby, and the caring for mom and the child afterward are covered by  Medicaid. If you make a cut in the reimbursement for Medicaid, you will  endanger the basic treatment needed to have a healthy baby.   The second thing we know is that Medicaid is critical for people with  disabilities. I met a mother in Champagne, IL, and she came up and told  me  [[Page S4049]]  she has a 23-year-old autistic son. It has been a struggle for her and  her family, but now he has a somewhat independent life. She said:  Senator, if you take away Medicaid insurance from him, I will have to  put him in some institutional program that I cannot afford. There is  nowhere to turn.   I also want to remind people that Medicaid pays school districts to  take care of kids with special education needs, transportation,  counselors, even feeding tubes for the severely disabled. That is an  important part of Medicaid.   I haven't touched on the most expensive part of the Medicaid Program  in America. The most expensive part is for those who are in nursing  homes, those who are older Americans and need Medicaid to get by. They  have Social Security and they have Medicare, but they need Medicaid. If  you cut back on Medicaid as proposed by the Republicans in both the  House and the Senate, who will take care of these elderly folks who are  in a situation where they have exhausted their savings? Do they move  back in with the family? Sometimes that is not even possible, but that  is one of the prospects faced.   What we need to do is to accept the obvious. We have reached an  important political milestone here where the Republicans don't have the  votes to move forward, but we still have the challenge of the current  system. I was proud to vote for it, but it is far from perfect. The  current healthcare system in America, the Affordable Care Act, needs  help, needs changes. We need to do it. We ought to just surprise the  heck out of America by working together, both political parties, to  solve the problems.   Let's identify a few of the most obvious problems.   No. 1, the Affordable Care Act in America today does not address the  cost of prescription drugs. You ask a health insurance company: What is  driving the cost of premiums? Prescription drugs.   Did you ever notice that when you turn on the television at certain  times of the day, it is all about drugs? It is all about new drugs,  things you can hardly pronounce. These new drugs are being advertised  on television time and again. And then there is a 2- or 3-minute  disclaimer: Be careful. If you take this drug, you might die. Be sure  and tell your doctor if you have ever had a liver transplant.   I listen to all these warnings, and I am thinking, this is being sold  in advertising for the general population? Did you know that there are  only three countries in the world that allow television advertising of  prescription drugs--the United States, New Zealand, and Brazil?   Why do the pharmaceutical companies advertise drugs on television?  Certainly if you want to inform a doctor about a new drug, you wouldn't  buy a television ad, would you? The reason they are on television is so  that we, as individual consumers and patients, will walk into the  doctor's office and say: Doctor, it took me five times, but I finally  figured out how to spell ``Xarelto,'' and I want Xarelto as my blood  thinner.   The doctor has a choice: He or she can explain to you that you may  not need Xarelto, that there is a cheaper version of blood thinner or  that this isn't the one that really fits your needs in this  circumstance. Doctors don't do that. Many of them just write out the  prescription. That is why the television advertising is taking place-- to convince the consumer, who asks the doctor and who ends up with the  high-priced drug being scripted for them. That is the reality of why  the costs of healthcare keep going up.   What does the Affordable Care Act do about that? Nothing. It does  nothing when it comes to the cost of prescription drugs. I want these  drug companies to make a profit, don't get me wrong. If they are  profitable while looking for new cures, that is the way it should be.  But when they charge through the roof and double and triple the cost of  these pharmaceutical drugs, that is not fair. It is not fair to  consumers, and it is not fair to taxpayers.   Think about the fact that many of exactly the same drugs made in the  United States are sold in other countries for a fraction of what they  cost in the United States. Even in Canada, they charge about one-half  or one-third for many of the most popular drugs because the Canadian  Government said to the drug companies in America: We are drawing the  line. We are not going to let you charge anything you want to charge.   Why don't we do something in America to protect consumers? Why don't  we at least inform people when pharmaceutical companies are  overcharging so that we can put some pressure on them to stop? That is  part of the change to the Affordable Care Act that I think will save us  money and at the same time deal with an issue most Americans really are  concerned about.   We also should be concerned about the fact that when it comes to the  individual health insurance market, that is where most of the problems  are. Six percent of the American population buying health insurance  through the exchanges--half of them have to pay the full premiums, and  some of those premiums go through the roof. Why? Because the people who  are buying this insurance are usually people with a medical history or  they are older folks and they want to have the peace of mind of  coverage. The healthy, younger folks aren't buying it. As a result, the  insurance risk pool gets pretty expensive when it comes to premiums. We  need to fix that, and we can fix that. That is another thing on which  we should come together as Democrats and Republicans to try to achieve.   For those who say: Well, I promised my entire political career that I  couldn't wait for the day to come forward and vote to repeal ObamaCare,  I just want to tell them that they should be aware that when the  Congressional Budget Office looked at the impact of just repealing the  Affordable Care Act and not replacing it, they said the following: This  would force more insurance companies to leave the market immediately.  It would increase premiums by 20 percent a year and double the price of  premiums over 10 years, and it would take health insurance away from 32  million people.   So taking that vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act may earn you a  cheer at some political rally, but it is not responsible. It is not  good. It will raise the cost of health insurance for families across  our country if we just repeal and don't replace, and it will take  health insurance away from over 30 million people, according to the  Congressional Budget Office. It is better that we replace it with  something responsible, better that we take the current system and make  it stronger.   This has been an interesting debate. I have learned a lot in the  course of this debate because I went and visited the hospitals in  Illinois. The Illinois Hospital Association opposed the Republican plan  in the House and opposed the proposal in the Senate. They said it would  cost us 60 to 80,000 jobs in Illinois and it would close down some  hospitals we need in rural parts of our State, smalltown hospitals that  are critically important. I don't want to see that happen, the people  who live there don't want to see that happen, and you won't be able to  keep and attract good employers and good jobs if that does happen. So I  have worked with these hospital administrators and want to move forward  with them on an alternative.   I will close by saying this: It is interesting how many people say  ``I can't wait until I reach age 65 because I will qualify for  Medicare.'' Medicare doesn't discriminate based on preexisting  conditions and provides good health insurance for millions of  Americans. It is an illustration and a lesson for us that if you have  something that isn't driven by the profit motive, that people trust,  that has provided basic, good care for Americans, good hospitals and  good doctors, that is what people are looking for. Why shouldn't they?  That should be part of the American dream. It should be part of our  right as Americans.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, for the second time this year, Illinois  communities are assessing damage and cleaning up after flooding. My  thoughts and prayers are with the families and first responders in  northern Illinois who are working to recover after heavy rain caused  severe flooding in Lake, McHenry, Kane, and Cook Counties last week.   The water has started to recede in some communities, but in some  areas, water levels will likely continue rising this week. Thousands of  buildings--including homes, businesses, and schools--have been damaged  by floodwaters.   Lake County has been one of the areas most impacted by this flooding.  Last weekend, I visited two towns in this area--Libertyville and  Gurnee--and I saw street after street of flood damage to homes and  businesses. What I saw was heartbreaking. I spoke with residents who  were concerned about being able to recover from the flood and resulting  damages and who voiced the need to find long-term solutions that will  mitigate the impact of future flood events. I am extremely grateful for  the hard work of local first responders and county officials.  Thankfully, there have been no reports of injuries or fatalities as a  result of this historic flooding.   I want to acknowledge the dedication of both the State and local  employees and volunteers who have come out to help at every level, from  the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the American Red Cross, to  county emergency management agencies. Many volunteers have helped with  sandbagging. County board chairman Aaron Lawlor has also been helpful  in securing resources and making sure residents have information about  where to find shelter and access cleanup supplies.   People from all around the area are pitching in to help their  neighbors and even strangers protect property and get back on their  feet.   I would also like to thank James Joseph, director of the Illinois  Emergency Management Agency, for his hard work. He has been there  during a time when Illinois constituents and communities need him the  most.   The State has provided 850,000 sandbags and deployed an emergency  management assistance team for flood mitigation and response efforts.  Representatives from the Illinois Emergency Management Agency are  working closely with local officials to make sure communities have the  resources needed to protect critical infrastructure and clean up when  water begins to recede.   The Governor has declared four counties State disaster areas. In the  coming days, the State will work with FEMA and local officials to begin  conducting preliminary damage assessments.   Once we have an idea of the scope of the damage, the Governor has the  ability to request a Presidential disaster declaration. In the past, it  has been challenging for Illinois to receive Federal aid after a  disaster occurs, but the Illinois delegation and I stand ready to do  whatever we can to help get any Federal assistance needed so that these  communities can clean up and recover.   There is more work to be done, and cleanup may be difficult and  dangerous, but I have no doubt the people who live and work in the  impacted communities will make incredible progress rebuilding with the  help and support of volunteers, local officials, and State agencies.   I want to thank everyone who has been engaged in the response and  mitigation efforts and all those who will be engaged in recovery  efforts in the weeks to come. We will rebuild, as Illinoisans always  do, and we will be stronger for it.                            ____________________
