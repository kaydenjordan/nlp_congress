 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his kind  words and the words of my good friend, Ranking Member Engel. This is  truly an unexpected, humbling honor. I thank both of their teams for  their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor, and I thank all  Members and supporters of Israel. There are so many of us in this  Chamber. We have been through a lot together and the U.S.-Israel  relationship is stronger because every single one of us works hard at  it.   Mr. Speaker, a special thank you to my dear friend and Florida  colleague, Ted Deutch, the great ranking member of our subcommittee,  with whom I have had the honor of working so closely on these issues  over the past 6 years. He is the author of this newly named bill and  the one with that idea.   As so many know, Mr. Speaker, it has been an absolute joy for me to  have been a part of this distinguished body for almost 30 years, as the  chairman points out, to advocate for my constituents and to serve on  our esteemed House Committee on Foreign Affairs to promote American  ideals like freedom, democracy, and human rights, and to help  strengthen the bonds we have with allies around the world.   No relationship, Mr. Speaker, is more important than the one that we  have with the democratic Jewish State of Israel. Israel is an  indispensable, strategic partner, not just for its protection of U.S.  interests, but because of our shared beliefs and our shared values.   I have had the incredible honor and privilege to travel to Israel,  both with the chairman, the ranking member, and Mr. Deutch. We have  seen firsthand that these shared values and these shared beliefs are  seen every day in Israel, after centuries of suffering, and it has  allowed the Jewish people to beat all the odds and to develop a country  that has become a thriving global leader.    It only gets more impressive when you consider the neighborhood where  Israel is--one that has never been more dangerous and more threatening  to them than it is today. The threats just keep getting tougher for  Israel.   For all of these reasons, I am so proud to have authored, along with  the ranking member, Mr. Deutch, this bill, because we have worked  together on this and we advocated for the bill before us today.   The bill authorizes, as has been explained, additional security  assistance for Israel at a minimum of $3.3 billion, the level agreed to  in the memorandum of understanding, for the next 10 years.   With this bill, Mr. Speaker, we both have the comfort of knowing that  our support for Israel will be ironclad, but it also provides us with  the flexibility to modify that support should the threats to Israel  increase. If additional support is needed, it would be given.   From drones and emerging threats to cybersecurity to space to  development cooperation in other countries, this bill also includes a  host of other provisions to expand our collaboration in other areas.  Collaboration is an important word because, as the chair and ranking  member have pointed out, this bill has been a positive, collaborative  effort by many Members in a bipartisan manner.   The U.S.-Israel partnership has never been stronger than it is today.  It is my sincere honor to have played a very small part in that. I  encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill, in spite of its  name.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking  member. I am proud to be a cosponsor of Mr. Smith's very important  bill, H.R. 1911, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism  Act.   As a founding member and co-chair of the Task Force for Combating  Anti-Semitism, I have been urging the administration to make the  Special Envoy position at the State Department a priority and to fill  that position as soon as possible.   In recent years, the spike in anti-Jewish violence and harassment has  been alarming, and not just in Europe, sadly, but across the globe, and  even here in our own wonderful Nation.                                time  1800    It is also worrisome that we are seeing anti-Semitism couched and  disguised in anti-Israel political rhetoric.   This bill ensures that we have someone at the Ambassador level giving  these issues full attention, and with access to the highest-level  officials in other nations.   I am also proud to have my amendment included in the bill, which adds  a deadline for the appointment, 90 days from enactment of this act, and  120 days from when this position becomes vacant.   Even though current law states that there shall be an appointment,  there is no clarity on whether an administration has a finite time to  make one. So this is why it is important that we add a deadline to fill  this Special Envoy position as quickly as possible.   I encourage all my colleagues to support Mr. Smith's important bill,  H.R. 1911; and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for the  time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to thank Honor Flight  South Florida for its work to recognize outstanding veterans of our  Armed Forces. This Saturday, September 15, Honor Flight South Florida,  in conjunction with the Miami International Airport, will again lead a  group of these brave veterans on their visit to our Nation's capital.   Since its inception in 2005, the mission of Honor Flight has been to  welcome our heroes to Washington so that these patriots may visit their  memorials.   Today, the Honor Flight network has 140 regional hubs across the  United States, each working tirelessly to pay tribute to these amazing  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, as the wife of a combat-wounded Vietnam veteran and  stepmother and mother-in-law to Marine Corps aviators, I am familiar  with the courage and the resolve that is required to dedicate one's  life to the service of others. I am so thankful for all the veterans'  devotion to our Nation, as well as the great work of organizations like  Honor Flight.   We must never forget the contributions these brave men and women have  made to our country, and I wish Honor Flight and the vets they serve  the utmost success in the years to come.                            ____________________
