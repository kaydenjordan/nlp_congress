 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the gentleman for his leadership as well as the author, Mrs.  Brooks, for her leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protecting Young Victims  from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act. In the wake of the  horrendous revelations of sexual abuse brought to the forefront by the  recent USA Gymnastics case, it is clear that measures do need to be put  in place to protect young athletes and keep them safe.   No child should ever be put in the position of having their innocence  robbed from them, which is why we need to have the highest protections  of the law from those looking to exploit them and take advantage of  their vulnerability.   I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan bill which will require amateur athletic-governing bodies to  immediately report sex abuse allegations to local or Federal law  enforcement and also to make it safe and easy for victims to report  that abuse.   As the Olympics approach, there is no doubt, we will all be reminded,  unfortunately, of the recent sexual abuse case that took place with the  gymnastics team. But this is our opportunity to take action, to do  everything in our power to make sure that this does not happen again,  and to protect all of our young and future athletes, giving them the  confidence that they will never be put in a situation where an adult or  someone who may have inappropriate intentions does not have the ability  to do so.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H638]]    Mr. Speaker, when I read the quote from the accuser who said this  could have been stopped in 1997, the article's headline was that eight  times Larry Nassar could have been stopped. Eight times. So it is  important to take note of this legislation as a clarion call, and these  words are most important.   This provision makes it unlawful for an adult who is authorized by a  national governing body, a member of a national governing body, or an  amateur sports organization that participates in interstate or  international amateur athletic competition to interact with a minor or  amateur athlete at specific events to fail to report as soon as  possible child and sexual abuse to local law enforcement or another  agency.   Many times members of the Judiciary Committee don't like wide nets.  We have a responsibility to adhere to the Constitution. But we are the  committee that has the responsibility of upholding the rule of law. And  to all of those who are now in this wide net, that is the rule of law:  to be able to protect our children against massive sexual abuse as they  pursue their dreams.   Just a comment, the requirement would arise on a person that learns  of the facts that give reason to suspect that a child has suffered an  incident of child abuse, including sexual abuse; and, therefore, those  who can say or attempt to say, ``I couldn't understand what the child  was saying; it wasn't clear,'' but if they got a sense that there was a  problem, they come under that net. I believe that that is appropriate.   Let me also indicate that there is a long list of sheroes who have  been impacted by Dr. Nassar. My constituent stated, on January 16, a  former Olympic gymnast who wowed the world, Simone Biles, said that she  was abused by Dr. Nassar.   The long list of Dr. Nassar's victims include U.S. Olympic gymnasts  McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman, and Gabby Douglas. They represented the  country and made us proud. And can you imagine? They were abused. Let  me thank the many organizations that have worked hard to advance this  legislation, including Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, RAINN,  the Nation's largest antisexual violence organization. They have been  magnificent.   I include in the Record a number of letters, Mr. Speaker, because  each day approximately 600 individuals are affected by sexual violence,  most of whom are children or parents seeking support, and they are  served by this organization.   The first letter I include in the Record supporting this legislation  is from RAINN, which urges the House of Representatives and others to  pass this legislation so that it can move quickly into the position to  be signed by the President.                                                          RAINN,                                  Washington, DC, November 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives.      Hon. John Thune,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Lois Frankel,      House of Representatives.        Dear House and Senate Leaders: RAINN, the nation's largest       anti-sexual violence organization, urges the House of       Representatives to pass the Protecting Young Victims from       Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act.        Every two minutes in America, someone is sexually       assaulted. Every eight minutes, that individual is a child.       The Senate-passed bill, which has RAINN's support and       reflects months of bipartisan work and deliberation, is an       important step forward in ensuring that young athletes can       train and compete in the safe environments they deserve. The       legislation strengthens and streamlines the process for       reporting abuse of amateur athletes, and requires officials       and coaches who work with prospective Olympians to undergo       training on sexual abuse.        Survivors are reaching out to RAINN, which operates the       National Sexual Assault Hotline, in record numbers. There has       been a 21 percent increase in those contacting our hotline.       Each day, RAINN's victim service programs provide support to       approximately 600 individuals affected by sexual violence,       assisting a record 19,432 people in October alone. Many who       contact the Hotline are children or parents seeking support.        We urge the House of Representatives to advance this       legislation, as passed by the Senate, without delay. Doing so       will demonstrate a commitment to ensuring young athletes who       dream of representing our nation at the highest levels can       achieve their goals safely and in a respectful environment.        Thank you and please do not hesitate to contact RAINN with       questions or concerns.            Sincerely,                                         Rebecca W. O'Connor, Esq.,                                   Vice President of Public Policy.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, every 2 minutes in America, someone is  sexually assaulted; every 8 minutes, that individual is a child.   Let me include in the Record a letter from the U.S. Olympians and  Paralympians Association, and I would like to call out their names.  These are all athletes: Dick Fosbury, track and field; Willie Banks,  track and field; Allison Baver, speedskating; Carol Brown, rowing;  Candace Cable, Paralympic track and field; Caryn Davies, rowing; Gary  Hall, Sr., swimming; Micki King, diving; Carol Lewis, track and field;  John Naber, swimming; Bill Toomey, track and field; Iris Zimmerman,  fencing.                                       U.S. Olympians & Paralympians                                                     Association.         An open letter from the U.S. Olympians and Paralympians       Association to athletes everywhere:        We hear you.        We have heard your many stories detailing the sexual and       emotional abuse you endured while training and competing in       pursuit of your goals and your dreams. We applaud your       individual and collective courage and conviction in coming       forward and telling all . . . and calling out those who       abused your trust.        We are both appalled by the actions of those who hurt you       and deeply saddened by your suffering. For those whose       stories we haven't heard (and may never hear), we respect       your decision and your privacy . . . but also acknowledge the       pain you feel in silence.        We are united in saying that there is no place for abuse in       sport--at any age, at any level, in any venue. As Olympic and       Paralympic alumni, we want you to know we are a family that       stands strong for the ideals of the Olympic and Paralympic       movements.        When we, as athletes, returned from past Games, we shared       an understanding that ``The goal of Olympism is to place       sport at the service of the harmonious development of       humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society       concerned with the preservation of human dignity.'' Now we       must ask how can athlete dignity be preserved when the       responsible institutions fail so in their oversight?        So what shall we do? We shall continue to advocate for       education and safe sport, to teach young boys and girls to       recognize the signs of abuse and provide a safe place to       speak without repercussion. Parents, coaches and trainers       need to be educated to recognize the signs and learn how to       behave properly in coaching situations. We shall support       Title IX, the U.S. Center for SafeSport and pending federal       legislation to protect our athletes.        For any of you who are currently in need (or know someone       who is), the newly created and independent U.S. Center for       SafeSport is available for confidential 24/7 reporting and       crisis support:        SafeSport.org        24/7 SafeSport Crisis Helpline 866-200-0796        We know the power of commitment to a belief and to goals;       our goal is that your experiences are never repeated.       Together, we shall seek to create a way of life based on the       joy of effort.        Together in sport,        United States Olympians and Paralympians Association       Executive Committee        President Dick Fosbury--Track and Field, 1968        Willie Banks--Track and Field, 1980/1984/1988        Allison Baver--Speedskating, 2002/2006/2010        Carol Brown--Rowing 1976/1980/1984        Candace Cable--Paralympic Track and Field, 1980/1988/1992/      1996, Alpine Skiing, 1992; Nordic Skiing,1994/1998/2002/2006        Caryn Davies--Rowing, 2004/2008/2012        Gary Hall Sr.--Swimming, 1968/1972/1976        Micki King--Diving, 1968/1972        Carol Lewis--Track and Field, 1980/1984/1988        John Naber--Swimming, 1976        Bill Toomey--Track and Field, 1968        Iris Zimmerman--Fencing, 2000    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, likewise, I include in the Record a  letter, dated November 16, 2017, from the CWLA, Child Welfare League of  America, an organization that worked on this issue.   [[Page H639]]                                                              CWLA,                                  Washington, DC, November 16, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives.      Hon. John Thune,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Congressman McCarthy,       Congressman Hoyer, Senator Thune, and Senator Feinstein:        The Child Welfare League of America, after months of       bipartisan work and deliberation, urges the House of       Representatives to pass the Protecting Young Victims from       Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act.        This bipartisan legislation has now passed the Senate and       we firmly believe it will help to address some of the recent       reports of child sexual abuse that occurred against some of       this nation's finest young athletes while training for the       United States Olympic team. Based on past history and       reports, CWLA believes that stronger legislative action is       required so that this history does not continue to repeat       itself.        Over these past several months we have been able to work       with key congressional offices to enhance the responsibility       and the accountability of U.S. Olympic organizations. Several       parts of this bill, including the authorization and funding       for the U.S. Center for Safe Sport, are critical to this       accountability.        We hope the House of Representatives will act without delay       so parents and young athletes can live out their dreams of       competing on behalf of this country and do so with the       assurance they will be safe and respected.        Thank you for your attention on behalf of children.            Sincerely,      Christine James-Brown,        President/CEO, Child Welfare League of America.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  the DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence. They have worked along with  RAINN and have emphasized that the Nation's youngest have been impacted  by this dastardly series of actions.

Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Ms. Brooks, Ms. Frankel,       Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Thune, and Ms. Feinstein:        The DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence urges the House       of Representatives to pass the Protecting Young Victims from       Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act.        This bipartisan legislation is imperative to respond to the       numerous disclosures of child sexual abuse by our nation's       youngest and most accomplished athletes while they were       training for the U.S. Olympics. Intervention and prevention       measures through this legislation are desperately needed to       keep our children safe and hold offenders and entities       accountable for their actions and their silence.       Authorization and funding for the U.S. Center for Safe Sport       will be the first significant step toward this goal.        We ask the House of Representatives to swiftly and       expeditiously pass this legislation to protect our young       athletes and show them they are valued and deserve to excel       in their chosen sport without fear of and violence from those       they trust.        Thank you for your commitment to ending sexual abuse,       please do not hesitate to contact our office if we can be of       further assistance in this charge.            Sincerely,                                                     Karma Cottman,                                                Executive Director.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  Professor Emeritus Howard M. Rubin from DePaul University who speaks  about sexual abuse. ``My wife, Barbara Blaine, knew the lasting damage  that is caused when a child is abused having been a child victim.''                                                   DePaul University                                                  College of Law,                               Chicago, Illinois, November 16, 2017.      Re: SB.534/ HR 1973--Protecting Young Victims from Sexual           Abuse Act of 2017       Senator Dianne Feinstein,      Senator John Thune,      Representative Susan Brooks,      Representative Lois Frankel.        Dear Lawmakers: I am writing to enthusiastically support       S.534/HR 1973 and to express my appreciation for your work in       drafting and advancing this legislation. In the wake of the       deluge of sexual harassment scandals breaking on a daily       basis, the American public is crying out for recognition of       women's rights, and the rights of victims of sexual abuse and       harassment.        While there is no way to quantify the struggles of one       victim against another a young victim's childhood is       indelibly harmed by sexual abuse. My wife, Barbara Blaine,       knew the lasting damage that is caused when a child is abused       having been a child victim. For her entire adult life she       fought selflessly and tirelessly to ensure the safety and       well-being of survivors, to prevent children from suffering       abuse, and to hold accountable those responsible. Abusers and       their enablers utilizing their power and status as shields       against prosecution and retribution were dragged out into the       light of justice and accountability by Barbara's ceaseless       crusade as advocate.        One of Barbara's passions was confronting unfair statute of       limitations. They protected abusers and punished young       victims unable to confront their abuse till later in life.       The language in S.534 that extends statute of limitations for       victims of child sexual abuse pertaining to federal crimes is       a tribute to her efforts.        Barbara cast a bright light against the darkness, but       tragically, her flame was snuffed out far too soon. She left       this world suddenly and before she could finish her life's       work. It is upon us now to stoke the embers left in the wake       of that lifetime, that her legacy might live on forever       through S.534, and cast such a spark so as to permanently       light the way towards justice for those who have been abused.        I would consider it an honor to be included in the list of       supporters for S.534.            Sincerely,                                                    Howard M Rubin,                                                Professor Emeritus.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  the National Children's Alliance, which has been working with other  advocacy groups and, again, has done longstanding work against child  abuse, supporting this legislation.                                     National Children Alliance,                                  Washington, DC, November 20, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      U.S. House of Representatives.      Hon. John Thune,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Lois Frankel,      House of Representatives.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi:        Dear Congressman McCarthy and Congressman Hoyer:        Dear Senator Thune and Senator Feinstein:        Dear Congresswoman Brooks and Congresswoman Frankel: The       National Children's Alliance, in cooperation with numerous       other advocacy groups, encourages the House of       Representatives to pass the Protecting Young Victims from       Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act (S.534).        Having recently passed the Senate, this bipartisan       legislation seeks to address the numerous reports of       childhood sexual abuse that have occurred against our       nation's young athletes. The recent press surrounding the       United States' Olympic trainees only serves to heighten the       need for a strong legislative response.        The NCA's longstanding work on child abuse leads us to       believe that this legislation will increase the       accountability of U.S. Olympic organizations and help ensure       that incidences of this nature are not repeated. In       particular, authorization and funding for the U.S. Center for       Safe Sport is one of the critical provisions of this bill       that will actively enhance U.S. Olympic organizations'       responsibility in these matters. It establishes an office for       education and outreach to develop the appropnate training,       policies, and procedures to combat and prevent the emotional,       physical, and sexual abuse, of young athletes competing in       athletic activities sponsored by national governing bodies       and Paralympic sports organizations.        We hope that the House of Representatives will take swift       action and stand with us in ensuring that our young athletes       are protected as they stave to compete on behalf of our       nation.        Thank you for your consideration of our youth.            Sincerely,                                                  Teresa Huizar,                                                 Executive Director,                                      National Children's Alliance.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. CHILD USA: Let's End Child Abuse and Neglect said  [[Page H640]]  in a letter, which I include in the Record: ``This bill would shine  much needed sunlight on the problem of abuse in sports. It will protect  children in the future.''                                                      CHILD USA,                                                  November 20, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives.      Hon. John Thune,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Susan Brooks,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Lois Frankel,      House of Representatives.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Congressman McCarthy,       Congressman Hoyer, Senator Thune, Senator Feinstein,       Congresswoman Brooks, and Congresswoman Frankel:        CHILD USA urges the House of Representatives to pass the       Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport       Authorization Act. This bill would shine much needed sunlight       on the problem of abuse in sports. It will protect children       in the future.        The bill, as passed by the Senate, institutes important and       minimally necessary measures to ensure the protection of       children from abuse in sports: (1) mandatory reporting of       child abuse to SafeSport and the authorities. Many states do       not mandate such reporting and, therefore, the bill fills       that need; (2) a rule against retaliation for those who       report suspected abuse; (3) a limitation on coaches and other       adults from taking a child to a place that is not observable       by others; and (4) for the first time, makes amateur sports       organizations accountable for abuse of children. Taken       together, these are large steps forward.        The epidemic of child abuse in the United States needs       Congress to lead the way on child protection with this bill.       Children deserve the protections of the Protecting Young       Victims Act and they need it now. Thank you for your efforts       for the protection of America's children.            Sincerely,                                                 Marci A. Hamilton,                                                               CEO.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter  from the United States Olympic Committee, dated January 24, 2018.                                United States Olympic Committee,                             Colorado Springs, CO, January 24, 2018.        To Team USA: The athlete testimony that just concluded in       the Nassar hearings framed the tragedy through the eyes of       the victims and survivors, and was worse than our own worst       fears. It was powerful because of the strength of the       victims, survivors and parents, who so eloquently and       forcefully told their stories and so rightfully demanded       justice. The USOC should have been there to hear it in       person, and I am deeply sorry that did not happen.        The purpose of this message is to tell all of Nassar's       victims and survivors, directly, how incredibly sorry we are       We have said it in other contexts, but we have not been       direct enough with you. We are sorry for the pain caused by       this terrible man, and sorry that you weren't afforded a safe       opportunity to pursue your sports dreams. The Olympic family       is among those that have failed you.        I know this apology is not enough. We have been working on       taking steps at the USOC and mandating changes among National       Governing Bodies to ensure this does not happen again. Our       next steps will be these:        1. We Must Change the Culture of the Sport. This was the       primary recommendation of the independent Deborah Daniels       Report on USA Gymnastics and the athlete testimony underlined       its importance. We heard athletes describe being unsure or       unaware of how to report abuse and to whom, and sometimes       even what constitutes abuse. We heard athletes describe being       afraid or discouraged from reporting abuse. We heard athletes       describe feeling hurt, betrayed, discounted and alone. Since       October of last year, we have been engaged in direct talks       with USAG leadership on this fundamental point. New       leadership at the board level is critical and you recently       saw three USAG board resignations. Further changes are       necessary to help create a culture that fosters safe sport       practice, offers athletes strong resources in education and       reporting, and ensures the healing of the victims and       survivors. This includes a full turnover of leadership from       the past, which means that all current USAG directors must       resign.        2. We Must Change the Governance Structure of the NGB. We       need to help USA Gymnastics better support its mission, which       is to provide the best resources and safest environment for       athletes to train and compete. We have strongly considered       decertifying USAG as a National Governing Body. But USA       Gymnastics includes clubs and athletes who had no hand in       this and who need to be supported. We believe it would hurt       more than help the athletes and their sport. But we will       pursue decertification if USA Gymnastics does not fully       embrace the necessary changes in their governance structure       along with other mandated changes under review right now.        3. We Must Know Who Knew What and When. The USOC has       decided to launch an investigation by an independent third       party to examine how an abuse of this proportion could have       gone undetected for so long. We need to know when complaints       were brought forward and to who. This investigation will       include both USAG and the USOC, and we believe USAG will       cooperate fully. We will make the results public.        4. We Must Support Safe Sport Victims and Survivors. Team       USA safe sport assault victims and survivors need access to       testing, treatment and counseling. The USOC will devote       substantial funds to help provide these resources to victims       and survivors. We are working on the details of how this       funding will become available to athletes and will       communicate them soon.        I hope that all members of Team USA remember that the USOC       ombudsman office is always available to provide free,       independent and confidential help to athletes with concerns       or questions about safe sport or other matters. Contact       information, along with other helpful athlete resources, are       here.        In order to bring even more focus and urgency to these       important points, the USOC board of directors has mobilized a       board-level working group chaired by independent board member       Susanne Lyons.        Finally, I invite any member of Team USA to communicate       with me or Ms. Lyons directly if there is more that you think       the Olympic family can or should be doing for you and your       families.            Sincerely,                                                    Scott Blackmun,                                           Chief Executive Officer.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Poe for his  longstanding work on these issues, the two House cosponsors, and the  Senator, and I want to end with, with that volcanic action, there was  no reaction, a deafening silence. Let us, with the passage of this  bill, begin the journey of commitment, along with our acknowledgment of  the Me Too movement that we will never be silent again.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 534, the ``Protecting Young  Victims from Sexual Abuse Act''.   This bill will help prevent the sexual abuse of minors and amateur  athletes by requiring the prompt reporting of sexual abuse to law  enforcement authorities.   This is a reasonable and important measure that is intended to  protect young athletes from abuse and preserve the sanctity of sports  associated with the U.S. Olympic Committee--the organization  responsible for preparing and training young athletes who might one day  represent our Nation competitively all over the world.   Children deserve to fully enjoy the innocence of their youth--by  exploring the curiosities of the world, taking pleasure in the arts,  and participating in sports--free from abuse.   Sexual abuse of children and youth is an abhorrent practice that is  intolerable in any context, and we must take appropriate measures to  eliminate it from youth sports.   Young people look to adults to protect them and keep them safe. We  all have a responsibility to do so. With S. 534, we have an opportunity  to ensure that individuals abide by this duty.   Certain other professionals--such as doctors, dentists, social  workers, psychologists, teachers, and daycare workers, are already  bound by law to report suspected abuse to law enforcement. S. 534 will  require the same of adults who interact with young athletes in  connection with sports activities organized by the national governing  bodies of various sports.   The urgent need for this legislation is best illustrated by the  horrible abuse and exploitation of numerous young gymnasts at the hands  of Dr. Larry Nassar, who victimized young athletes participating in USA  Gymnastics over the course of 20 years. The stories of abuse and  suffering of these young women are heartbreaking.   Many complaints of sexual and emotional abuse by Nassar and others  went unreported for years--allowing coaches, instructors, and doctors  to repeatedly victimize gymnasts as young as six years old.   The shocking failure of anyone to report accusations to law  enforcement, or even keep track of complaints internally, made it  possible for some of these predators to commit multiple, horrific acts  over time.   We entrust the care of our children and young athletes in the hands  of those we hope to uphold that trust and not abuse it.   One of the more than 150 girls and women victimized by Dr. Nassar was  recently quoted as saying, ``He has everything he needs to be an  incredible leader. He has the personality . . . the skill . . . the  knowledge. And he's using that to prey on people . . . what a waste.''   Last week, a Michigan judge sentenced Nassar to a prison sentence of  up to 175 years. The judge described Nassar's assault of scores of  girls and women, under the pretense that he was treating them, as  ``precise,  [[Page H641]]  calculated, manipulative, devious and despicable.''   We must continue to do more to help protect our young athletes, and  this bill will greatly assist in that effort. However, I must note a  concern with a change the bill before us would make to the Senate- passed version of S. 534. The bill unanimously passed by the Senate  would authorize funding to be provided to the U.S. Center for Safe  Sport in the amount of $1 million for each of the next five years.   Unfortunately, the version of the bill before us strips this funding  authorization. I believe we should have taken up the Senate bill,  without amendment. Safe Sport is charged with important  responsibilities under this bill--with respect to receiving and  investigating allegations of abuse and setting policies to prevent  future abuse. It is critical that we ensure that the Center is provided  the resources for those things to be done immediately and effectively.   By doing so, I hope we will prevent the type of abuse and suffering  perpetrated by people like Larry Nassar.   In a recent open letter from the U.S. Olympians and Paralympians  Association to athletes everywhere, they wrote: ``The goal of Olympism  is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of  humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with  the preservation of human dignity. Now we must ask how can athlete  dignity be preserved when the responsible institutions fail so in their  oversight?''   In an apology letter to Team USA from the United States Olympic  Committee issued last week, the Committee admitted that it had failed  its young athletes.   While the USA Gymnastics scandal is unfortunate, let it be an example  and incentive to prevent such abuse from happening again.   Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation.   The ``Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act'' is a necessary  measure to ensure young athletes in this country are able to pursue  their athletic dreams in safe environments, free of the fear of being  victimized by predators.   I thank the many organizations that have worked hard to advance this  legislation, including Rape Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN),  the Nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization.   I'd like to enter into the record a letter from RAINN, which  indicates survivors are reaching out to its National Sexual Assault  Hotline in record numbers, at a 21 percent increase.   Each day approximately 600 individuals affected by sexual violence  are served, most of whom are children or parents seeking support.   For the foregoing reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask support of the legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Beau Allen, a  Minnetonka High School graduate and defensive tackle for the  Philadelphia Eagles, who is now on his way to play in the Super Bowl  after a strong performance in the NFC Championship Game just a week  ago.   Beau graduated from Minnetonka High School in 2010, and he is the  only Minnetonka student in history to start all 4 years. After  graduating, he went on to play for Wisconsin and didn't miss a game in  his 4 years on that team. And then, in 2014, Beau was a seventh-round  NFL pick and joined the Philadelphia Eagles.   He is a key member of the team's defensive line rotation. The Eagles'  defense is now ranked first against the run, the fourth in the points  allowed, and fourth overall.   As a Vikings fan, I was crushed that our season ended the way that it  did, but it is exciting to see someone from our community now being  able to play in the Super Bowl. I look forward to seeing Minnetonka  represented on the field this Sunday.   Good luck, Beau.                            ____________________
