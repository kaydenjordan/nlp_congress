 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a  hero.   Yesterday morning, the city of Gallup and all New Mexicans lost a  leader and patriot when Corporal Hiroshi ``Hershey'' Miyamura passed  away.   Corporal Miyamura volunteered to serve in the Korean war after his  defense of our country in World War II. The call of service is one that  a select few among us choose to answer. He chose to answer it twice.   In 1951, he fought a barrage of enemy attacks that threatened his  company, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. He singlehandedly held the  line, giving his squad time to reach safety. He would spend the next 27  months as a prisoner of war.   Corporal Miyamura was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for  his service, only learning of his achievement upon his release in 1953.  He was the second-to-last living Korean war Medal of Honor recipient.  Now, his passing reminds us of the sacrifices our veterans make to  defend our Nation.   Madam Speaker, we will remember him and miss him. Most of all, we  will always honor him.                            ____________________
