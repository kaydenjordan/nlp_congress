 Madam President, I rise to speak about the urgent need for  the United States to take action to confront climate change. I think it  is pretty clear from the evidence and from the science right now that  the following is true: climate change is real, and it is a threat to  human life; second, that climate change is caused by human activity;  and third, we must take action against it by reducing substantially  greenhouse gas emissions.   We have an obligation, all of us--in both Houses of Congress and in  both parties and in both branches of government, the legislative and  executive branches--we all have an obligation to care for and protect  God's creation. We don't have time. We don't have time for cynical  political games. We need to be serious about this challenge.   According to the World Food Program, over 120 million people face  ``crisis-level food insecurity'' worldwide. Too often we don't focus on  that challenge.   Developing countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America have been  hardest hit by frequent and intense floods, droughts, and storms. These  climate events can quickly spiral into full-blown food and nutrition  crises.   The U.S. intelligence community, the intelligence agencies of the  United States of America, have linked global food insecurity to  instability that can lead to a rise in violent extremism and  international crime that puts the United States at risk. The January  2014 ``Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community''  reported that the ``lack of adequate food will be a destabilizing  factor in countries important to United States national security.''   We know the following is true: Climate change leads to humanitarian  crises; humanitarian crises lead to hunger, death, and insecurity;  hunger, death, and insecurity lead to desperation, instability,  extremism, and terrorism. Inaction on this issue predicated on denial  or indifference will result in millions around the world suffering  extreme hunger resulting from climate-related disasters, which in turn  leads to a rise in extremism and terrorism. Ignoring climate change  undermines U.S. national security.   Similarly, failure to address climate change will have negative  consequences here at home. In one example--among many--a 2015 paper  titled ``Growing Stronger: Toward a Climate-Ready Philadelphia''  reports that since 2010, Philadelphia has experienced the following:  the snowiest winter on record, the two warmest summers on record, the  wettest day on record, the 2 wettest years on record, and two  hurricanes. That is just in 5 years, in one city, in one State.   The same paper projects:         Philadelphia may experience four to 10 times as many days       per year above 95 degrees, and as many as 16 days a year       above 100 degrees by the end of the century. Up from the 1950       [to] 1999 average of fewer than one.    Fewer than one.   All of these changes have negative consequences for local economies  and for the well-being of all of our constituents. Increased heavy  rainfall can lead to more flooding in communities along, just for  example, the Delaware River and the Schuylkill River in my home State,  which places additional stress on our already outdated wastewater  infrastructure.   Older Americans and lower income American families are particularly  hard hit by heat waves. We know nearly one-quarter of the children in  Philadelphia suffer from asthma, a condition that is exacerbated by  ground-level ozone, which is made worse by hot weather.   So as Americans we have a duty to develop a strategy and to take  action to confront climate change. We must also provide robust  assistance, training, and support for workers who may be adversely  impacted by the steps we take, but we don't have time to waste. We need  a serious bipartisan effort to develop a strategy to take action to  prevent the horror that results from inaction on climate  change. Everyone knows that today's vote will do nothing to help us  deal with this grave crisis.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
