 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained due to pressing  business in my Congressional District. Had I been present on Tuesday,  May 15, 2018, I would have voted ``yes,'' on H.R. 613, Lieutenant  Osvaldo Albarati Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act of 2017,  ``yes,'' on H.R. 4854, the Justice Served Act, and ``yes,'' on H. Res.  285.                            ____________________
