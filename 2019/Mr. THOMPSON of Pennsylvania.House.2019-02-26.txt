 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss  the issue that is facing Americans across the Nation: the opioids  crisis.   The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment, a comprehensive guide  published by the Drug Enforcement Administration, indicates that  illegal drug use continues to rise. It cites Mexican transnational  criminal organizations as America's greatest enemy in the war against  drugs. While these criminal organizations are bringing a wide variety  of illegal drugs across our southern border, I am particularly worried  about their role in spreading the opioid crisis.   Thousands of pounds of opioids are smuggled across our southern  border every year. Just last year, the DEA seized more than 17,000  pounds of heroin in the United States. About 39 percent of this was  seized at the southern border.   Another opioid that has devastated communities across America is  fentanyl. As we started to understand the scope of the opioid crisis  facing our Nation, the CDC says doctors started prescribing less and  less pharmaceutical fentanyl. But fentanyl overdoses remained steady as  prescription rates dropped, meaning that illicitly manufactured  fentanyl is one of the main drivers of the opioid crisis.   Illicit fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is produced in China and  Mexico. It is either smuggled into the United States through the mail  from China or across our southern border from Mexico. In 2017, Customs  and Border Patrol agents seized nearly 1,500 pounds of fentanyl at the  border. Considering fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than  morphine, last year's seizures accounted for millions of potential  overdoses and deaths.   But it is easy to discuss the amount of illegal drugs that have been  seized at the border. It is easy to discuss the need for change. The  hardest part is discussing the human toll that this crisis has taken.   Madam Speaker, last year more Americans died of a drug overdose than  in any other recorded year. In 2017, overdoses killed more than 70,000  Americans, and more than 28,000 of these deaths were related to  synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.   Our country is facing a crisis, and action is necessary. That is why  I was proud to stand with President Trump and support H.J. Res. 31.  This appropriations bill included provisions that are vital to my  congressional district and that will bring the fight against opioids to  the front lines: the southern border.   Although I was disappointed that my Democratic colleagues didn't  include more to combat this crisis, I was pleased that it included  funding for 55 miles of wall on the southern border. Walls work, and we  need to continue the construction of this wall. This is why President  Trump's national emergency declaration is necessary.   But, Madam Speaker, tomorrow House Democrats will bring up a measure  to block President Trump's emergency declaration, H.J. Res. 46. They  say the wall is immoral. They say it is cruel. I say we need decisive  action to fight the opioid crisis, and this is the first step in the  right direction.   Since President Carter, there have been 31 national emergencies  declared. President Clinton declared 6, and President Obama declared 10  that are still in place. All 31 national emergencies recognized a dire  threat to the American people and took action. By declaring this  national emergency, President Trump is taking action against a threat  that killed 70,000 Americans in 2017 alone.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.J. Res. 46.  Support our President and save American lives.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this month I met with  representatives from two Federal correctional institutions located in  the 15th District of Pennsylvania: FCI McKean and FCI Loretto.   I thank the representatives for visiting my Washington, D.C., office  and taking the time to discuss their priorities for the year ahead.  They shared the need to increase staffing levels at Federal prisons  because low personnel numbers can result in a more dangerous working  environment.   Today I commend corrections officers at FCI McKean and Loretto and  all across our country who help protect our communities and uphold the  values of our justice system. Officers face dangerous situations in the  workplace every day, but that does not deter them.   Just like our first responders, corrections officers are regularly  risking their lives to keep their community members safe. They enforce  the rule of law, and they carry out their duties without complaint.  Their dedication and sacrifice often goes unnoticed by the public, but  we owe them our gratitude.   Madam Speaker, let us always thank them for the important work that  they do to keep us safe.                            ____________________
