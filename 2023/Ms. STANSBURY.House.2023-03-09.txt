 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  which is, as the gentleman has described, a simple training requirement  to ensure that this act is implemented correctly. Seems like a  perfectly reasonable thing in and of itself; that is, it would be if  the actual underlying bill that it seeks to modify was reasonable and  not some sort of bizarre, Orwellian doublespeak designed to mislead the  American people about what this bill is actually about.   Nothing about this bill is reasonable. Nothing about this bill, the  process of how it has been brought to the floor, and how it has misled  the people of our country about what is happening is normal. It does  not secure the freedom of speech or any other freedoms of the American  people. It actually endangers them.   In fact, it imperils our democracy by handcuffing the ability of law  enforcement, national security, and intelligence officials to provide  factual, critical information to social media companies and the public  in order to prevent crimes or to ensure that election fraud tampering  does not occur and that there is no foreign interference with our  elections.   This is not some unintended consequence of the bill; rather, it is  the entire point of this bill, as my Republican colleagues have  conceded.   When we marked up this bill in the Oversight Committee, Chairman  Comer produced two emails from a single FBI agent to Twitter that he  said were ``the purpose of the bill.'' You might be asking, what  terrible censorship was the FBI trying to achieve in those emails? When  Democrats were finally provided with the email content, it was an email  to Twitter from the FBI identifying fraudulent election tweets. In  fact, the content identified that there were multiple tweets that were  misleading about the time, place, or manner of voting in the upcoming  election.   This is the smoking gun that they are claiming is taking away our  freedoms--that is right--election misinformation that was meant to  deceive American voters, which the FBI flagged as part of their course  of business. They would like to hamper the ability of our FBI and our  law enforcement to be able to do their jobs.   This is, of course, the same party that has engaged in voter  suppression for countless decades, so we probably shouldn't be  surprised.   We know that the American people not only want us to protect their  voting rights and their basic rights to express themselves, their  freedoms as protected by the Bill of Rights and our Constitution, but  we also want our public servants to be able to do their jobs and to do  their jobs with integrity and ensure the integrity of our election  system.   Democrats sought to try to address some of the grave flaws in this  bill and address the supposed intent of the bill by submitting 43  separate amendments for floor consideration. In fact, only one was made  in order.  [[Page H1220]]    Republicans, on the other hand, submitted 20 amendments, many like  this one, ignoring the dangers of the underlying bill and not wanting  to improve it to protect American freedoms but simply tinker around the  edges to make it more enforceable.   My question is, why are we voting on this amendment and not  Congressman Torres' amendment to ensure the bill does not prohibit  Federal officials from preventing and addressing cyberattacks?   Why are we voting on this amendment and not Congressman Lynch's  amendment to ensure the bill does not prohibit Federal officials from  protecting our national security?    Why are we voting on this amendment and not Congressman Goldman's  amendment to ensure that the bill does not prohibit Federal officials  from fighting foreign election interference, as occurred in the 2016  election?   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and oppose  this bill. It does nothing to improve a deeply dangerous bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will take a moment to reiterate that this  bill is not as it appears or the majority is proposing it appears to  the American public.   This bill is not about defending the basic right to free speech and  our constitutional rights. This bill is about hamstringing the ability  of Federal law enforcement, our national security staff, and others in  the Federal Government from protecting our country from election  interference.   This amendment would make the enforcement of that bill stronger by  requiring training to further censor and allow for interference in our  elections.   I am opposed to this amendment, and I rise in opposition to the bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, our inspectors general conduct vital work  on behalf of the American people. They help to safeguard taxpayer  dollars and government operations from waste, fraud, abuse, and  mismanagement, and they investigate what occurs inside our Federal  agencies. To ask them to waste their finite resources and staffing on  an annual reporting requirement for a bill that actually threatens the  freedom of the American people and the American public and electoral  system is gravely antithetical to their missions and their purpose and  is, itself, an act of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. Nobody  could act in good conscience to support this amendment.   One of the most concerning aspects of this bill is that it creates a  waiting period of at least 72 hours before law enforcement officials  can take action to prevent or respond to most crimes or threats they  identify, either on or involving social media platforms.   Let's imagine that you are a Federal official, an FBI investigator,  and you see information being shared online that indicates that a  sexual assault is imminent, some sort of violence is about to occur,  there is some sort of election fraud about to occur. Under this bill,  you would have a decision to make. Do you write and file a lengthy  report to Congress and then wait 72 hours until it is too late, or do  you act immediately, knowing that you might be subject to a $50,000  fine or might be barred from Federal service for 10 years because you  reported something that has been tagged as censored speech under this  bill and amendment?   Thanks to the excellent bipartisan work of Congresswoman Houlahan and  Congresswoman Mace, we could have been considering a very different  kind of amendment here on the floor today, one that would have made  sure that this bill still allowed enforcement officials to act  immediately in this exact case.                                time  1230    My Republican colleagues would not allow this amendment to come to  the floor today, choosing, instead, to waste our time and the time and  resources of our Federal agencies on this amendment. They choose a do- nothing, wasteful reporting requirement over a bipartisan amendment  that would protect the safety, in many instances, even the lives, of  women and Americans across the country. It is outrageous.   I believe that this bill and this amendment are dangerous, and I urge  my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, in closing, I will note one final time that  this bill and its proposition are deeply dangerous. It proposes to  actually address  [[Page H1221]]  free speech and censorship when, in fact, it would hamstring our  Federal officials.   This amendment adds dangerous changes to the bill that would make it  even more difficult for our Federal officials to do their job.   I am opposed to the amendment, and I am strongly opposed to the bill  itself.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think we have well established that not  only the premise of this bill, but many of the requirements in it, are  dangerous for our Federal law enforcement, dangerous to our  constitutional rights, dangerous to the American people, and dangerous  to our national security and our electoral system.   Yet, the way it is being proposed to the American people is that it  will defend their rights and their rights to speak freely under the  First Amendment.   During our markup of this bill, we talked about gaslighting.  Gaslighting is the act of when somebody in authority actually makes you  believe you are crazy because the truth of what is occurring is  actually the opposite.   This bill is a dangerous gaslighting of the American people. We will  not stand for it. It is dangerous to our democracy. It is dangerous to  our elections, and it is dangerous for the people of this country.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud daughter of New  Mexico, as a water resources professional, and as a defender of the  most basic element that we need to survive, which is water.   In New Mexico, water is life, water is sacred, water is culture, and  water is fundamental to everything that we do and everything that we  are.   For years, our State and our country and our communities have ridden  the roller coaster of regulatory rollbacks on the Clean Water Act, but  I never could have imagined that in the year 2023, we would be voting  on a bill to gut the rule that protects our streams and rivers and our  right to have clean water.   In 2023, just weeks ago, a train derailment in East Palestine sent  toxic smoke into the atmosphere, and people were afraid to turn on  their taps and drink the water. The American people want clean water.  Yet, here we are, weeks later, being forced to take a vote on a bill  that would gut a fundamental rule in how the Clean Water Act actually  saves our lives.   Water is the most basic element for how we survive as a species. The  Clean Water Act was passed because rivers were on fire. In fact, in  some of the districts of our Members--who are actually sponsoring this  bill--toxic waste and sewage was filling the waterways of these very  districts, where children were being poisoned by toxins that were being  put in the rivers. Yet, here we are voting for a measure that would  leave massive swaths of our waterways exposed, particularly in New  Mexico. We are talking about raw sewage, farm waste, and chemicals  being dumped in our arroyos and our wetlands.   Let me ask the American people: Is this what you want this body to be  working on, gutting the most basic foundation of the protection of our  public health and our environment? No, the American people want clean  water. They want us to protect our streams and rivers. They want us to  protect our farmers and ranchers. They want us to protect their  families and their children.   We cannot go back decades, as this measure would take us back, and we  cannot gut this fundamental, underlying environmental law that protects  the health and safety of our communities.   So wherever you live, whoever you represent, whatever you fight for,  know what this bill is actually about.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote with clean water and vote  against this measure.
