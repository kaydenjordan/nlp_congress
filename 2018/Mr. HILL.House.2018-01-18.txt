 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of Fire  Chief Gregory Summers as he retires after 35 years of service to the  city of Little Rock.   Chief Summers served as the 12th fire chief for the city of Little  Rock and became the department's first African-American fire chief. He  was appointed chief in 2009, and his leadership has had an indelible  impact on central Arkansas communities.   Under Chief Summer's leadership, the department earned Class 1 status  by the Insurance Services Office and received international  accreditation through the Center for Public Safety Excellence. This  saves our community insurance dollars and improves safety. The Little  Rock Fire Department is one of only 57 fire departments across the  country to receive this recognition.   My congratulations and best wishes for Chief Summers' future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished chairman for  yielding, and I appreciate my friend, Mr. Emmer, for introducing this  bill to make this very modest change which does help community banks  allocate capital and  [[Page H518]]  make more mortgage loans out there in our country.   I would say to my friend from Minnesota, who knows I have great  respect for him and his eloquence, that no one on this side of the  aisle is any less interested in justice than he is.   I must say, Mr. Speaker, that, as the chairman noted, this bill does  nothing about eliminating protections under the Fair Housing Act or  protections under the fair lending act for discrimination in housing or  lending for minorities in this Nation.   This is really, instead, about continuing the theme of the Home  Mortgage Disclosure Act, which is to relieve some burden for the  smallest financial institutions across the country. The act, for  example, exempts institutions with less than $50 million in assets that  are in an MSA from requiring any reporting. The act, for example,  exempts small banks under $50 million that are not in an MSA from any  reporting.    So Mr. Emmer's bill simply continues on that theme while protecting  justice and while protecting the ability to have data to make sure that  we, in fact, in this country, have fair lending.   If this requirement were enacted, community lenders would be required  to collect more than double the amount of data points they do now. It  is some 300,000 fields of data on a loan activity report, a LAR, which  is how banks measure their compliance with HMDA--300,000 lines of  activity. If you have a 10 percent error rate, Mr. Speaker, you are a  bad actor and can submit many more challenges to maintain your  independence as a bank.   I would also argue that, on the backs of other regulatory burdens on  small banks like TILA-RESPA, which was supposed to be a big improvement  for consumers, it has actually hurt lending, raised costs, and limited  credit. This comes on the back of that.   So, Mr. Speaker, I believe H.R. 2954 provides needed relief for our  smallest financial institutions and preserves more lending options for  the markets that these banks serve.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Emmer, for his thoughtful work.
