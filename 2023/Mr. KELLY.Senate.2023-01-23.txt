 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand that there are two bills at  the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own  request, all en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its  business today, it stand in recess until 10 a.m. on Tuesday, January  24, 2023; further, that following the prayer and the pledge, the  Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two  leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each; finally, that the Senate recess from  12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand in recess  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:27 p.m., recessed until  Tuesday, January 24, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
