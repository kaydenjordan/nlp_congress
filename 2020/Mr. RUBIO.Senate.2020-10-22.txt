 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a small business  with award-winning innovation that provides high-quality service and is  active in its community. This week, it is my pleasure to honor Scotlynn  USA Division, Inc., of Fort Myers, FL, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   Ryan Carter founded Scotlynn USA Division, Inc., in 2010, the year  after the Great Recession ended. Ryan worked for a Cincinnati freight  brokerage firm and identified a market demand for reliable, customer- focused delivery of time-sensitive perishable goods. Together, Ryan and  his younger brother, Brad, established Scotlynn USA in Fort Myers as a  transportation and logistics provider in southwest Florida. The  business grew quickly, moving in 2012 from their original 900-square- foot office into their current 12,000-square-foot building.   Today, Scotlynn USA has grown into an award-winning logistics firm  operating a truck fleet and freight brokerage that distributes  perishable foods nationwide. Ryan serves as the executive vice  president, and Brad is in a managerial role. They foster a sense of  community among their employees, resulting in high employee retention  rates, and they prioritize hiring veterans. Ryan serves on a number of  nonprofit boards and volunteers with several organizations, including  Big Brothers Big Sisters, Habitat for Humanity, and St. Matthews House.  Uniquely, Scotlynn USA provides its employees 16 hours of annual leave  to volunteer with local organizations.   Scotlynn USA has received industry recognition for its  entrepreneurship and innovation. Notably, it received early help from  the Florida Small Business Development Center--SBDC--located at Florida  Gulf Coast University, FGCU. They provided Scotlynn resources,  including mentorship, business planning, and access to capital advice  to help them establish their business. In 2019, the Florida SBDC at  FGCU awarded Ryan the Distinguished Entrepreneur of the Year title.  This year, Ryan was named as the 2020 U.S. Small Business  Administration--SBA--Florida Small Business Person of the Year and was  named first runner-up for  [[Page S6401]]  the SBA 2020 Small Business Person of the Year.   Like many Floridian small businesses, Scotlynn USA rose to the  occasion and supported their community during the coronavirus pandemic.  Working with Feeding America, they raised funds for charity and  distributed more than 3,500 free meals. Partnering with Community  Cooperative and Midwest Food Bank, Scotlynn USA donated logistical  support and truck space, enabling these two food banks to distribute  approximately 2 million pounds of food to Floridians in need.   As an essential business, Scotlynn USA managed to stay open, keep  their employees safe, and play a key role in keeping our Nation's  supply chains running smoothly. In April 2020, the SBA launched the  Paycheck Protection Program--PPP--a small business relief program I was  proud to author. The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small  businesses and nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the  coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to their PPP loan, Scotlynn USA was able  to retain 214 jobs and continued serving their customers and community.   Scotlynn USA exemplifies the critical role that small businesses play  in investing in community development. Their leadership and commitment  to their customers and employees is commendable, especially during  these unprecedented times.   Congratulations to Ryan, Brad and the entire team at Scotlynn USA  Division, Inc. I look forward to your continued success in Florida and  throughout the United States.                            ____________________
