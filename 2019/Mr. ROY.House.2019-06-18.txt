 Mr. Speaker, I rise today troubled that one of my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle compared the activities of the United  States Government and Border Patrol on the southern border of the  United States to concentration camps.   For the life me, I cannot understand why we have allowed discourse to  get to this place where the efforts by Border Patrol to secure our  border, to house children, to house women, to house families, to deal  with the fact that the cartels are attacking our border and profiting  while doing it, and trying to care for these people while we are trying  to enforce our laws, comparing that to the horrors of World War II, and  saying that my friend Hector Garza is somehow the Gestapo today, and  comparing what is happening at the border to concentration camps.   I am really troubled and offended, and I think that the people of  south Texas and Border Patrol are offended after what they are doing to  try to defend the United States of America against cartels attacking  the United States and profiting by moving people across the border.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Michigan, and I want  to rise to offer my support for his tireless efforts on this topic, in  particular.   It should not be a hard question that the American citizens, the  people who live here afforded protections under our Constitution,  should not be targeted unnecessarily, even when we are doing our  appropriate job to target those who wish to do us harm abroad.   I believe that the amendment in question attempts to do just that, to  ensure we have those tools to target those abroad while protecting  American citizens, and I thank the gentleman for his efforts.

Mr. HIMES, Mses. GARCIA of Texas, WATSON COLEMAN, Mr. COLE, Ms.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, Messrs. LONG, BLUMENAUER, and BUTTERFIELD changed  their vote from ``no'' to ``aye.''   So the motion to rise was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Lowenthal) having assumed the chair, Mr. Horsford, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2740)  making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, the truth is the President of the United States  shouldn't be forced to have to make the tough decisions of figuring out  how to secure our border without support from this institution, but  that is precisely what is happening. The President of the United States  is having to look at a crisis on our border that our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle just simply straight up refuse to acknowledge  exists.   When I was down at the border in McAllen in January, I was told of  about 200,000 people that would be apprehended; maybe 200,000 that  would not be apprehended. And I was told 90 percent of that was going  to come through McAllen, as opposed to Brownsville. Why? Because there  is fencing in Brownsville.   I would ask my colleagues whether they have ever been to the border,  in the cane, along the river, talking to Border Patrol when they are  there at 11:00 at night, and they have radios that don't work; cell  signals that don't work. They can't see the river because the cane is  too thick. They have no roads that are lateral that run along the  river, so they can move up and down the river to protect our border.  They are down there by themselves, and the cartels have operational  control of the river.   The Reynoso faction of the Gulf Cartel, they own it. They are making  hundreds of millions of dollars moving people through McAllen right  now. And right now, little girls are going to be abused on the journey  because we bury our heads in the sand.   The President is trying to secure the border, and the Democrats, in  another cynical attempt to stop security, are putting provisions and  poison pills in this legislation to prevent the kind of security that  is needed for our border. I, for the life of me, don't understand it.   I appreciate my colleague from Texas standing up and making this  point that we should be preserving the ability of the President to be  able to do his job in the absence of a Congress willing to do its job.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H4750]]     Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to consider a measure  that I would like to speak about for 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, to be clear, my request was to call up H.R.  3056, a measure to make sure we have the funding necessary to end the  border security crisis that the President and his Office of Management  and Budget sent to the Congress. It is Mr. Rogers from Alabama's bill.
