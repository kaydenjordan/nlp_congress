 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  life and legacy of Cookie Bible, an extraordinary Nevadan who touched  the lives of countless women and families in her adopted State. She  passed peacefully in Reno, NV, on Saturday, June 3, 2023, at the age of  77.   LaVerne Jo ``Cookie'' McManus was born in San Francisco; on July 30,  1945, and grew up under her grandmother's care to become widely known  as a strong advocate for women's health. Cookie was a fourth-generation  San Franciscan; however, she was proud to be a ``true blue'' Nevadan.  She fell in love with the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe where she met and  married into the family of U.S. Senator Alan Bible and was a resident  of Zephyr Cove ever since. Her neighbors affectionately called her  ``Mayor of the Cove.''   Following graduation from Orvis School of Nursing at the University  of Nevada, Reno, with a bachelor of science in nursing in 1971, Cookie  became a certified Nurses Association of The American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists Nurse Practitioner in OB/GYN in 1980.  She rose to State and national prominence, serving on the Nevada Board  of Nursing, as well as the National Council of State Boards of Nursing  in leadership positions.   In 2003, she received the Exceptional Leadership Award from the  National Council of State Boards of Nursing, where she chaired the  nurse practice, education, and regulatory and nominating committees.   Cookie was the lead nurse practitioner with Planned Parenthood Mar  Monte region for nearly 20 years. She served as an adjunct faculty  member for Orvis School of Nursing and held contracts with both the  State of Nevada and Washoe County Health Department. She was in private  women's healthcare practice from 2004-2017. She was also a founding  member of Douglas County Council for Abused Women and the Nevada  Women's Fund.   In addition, Cookie dedicated much of her life to Girl Scouts--12  years as a girl and 56 years as a Girl Scout adult. She was a past  president of the Sierra Nevada region of Girl Scouts of America. She  continued to buy cartons of Girl Scout cookies to share with charities  and dinner guests.   Seeing patients from ages 14 to 80-plus years old was her  professional passion, in addition to teaching and training at the  University of Nevada, Reno, and Truckee Meadows Community College and  lecturing before various groups. With a second home in Boulder City,  Cookie was a dedicated women's care provider for Volunteers in Medicine  in southern Nevada.   Cookie was a member of St. John in the Wilderness Episcopal Church  for more than 30 years, serving in leadership positions, as well as  greeting guests and parishioners in the historic lakeside church on the  grounds of Camp Galilee at Glenbrook, Lake Tahoe.   A world traveler, Cookie enjoyed great adventures from China to Italy  to the Galapagos Islands. But she loved Nevada best. She was happiest  hiking on trails in the Sierra Nevada Mountains with her dog Zephyr,  spending time on the beach, and gathering her family and friends for  barbecues in her backyard.   At every opportunity, Cookie demonstrated her strong commitment to  the women of Nevada. I know that her work, advocacy, and dedication to  women's health will not be forgotten. I ask my colleagues to join me in  remembering Cookie for her significant impact in Nevada. I celebrate  Cookie's legacy, and I extend my deepest condolences to her family and  friends.                            ____________________
