 Mr. President, I would like to just say a few words  about what we are going through and what we are experiencing. I can  only give you my experiences back home in West Virginia.   I have been on conference calls because we are social distancing, as  we all are. I have talked to the nurses' association, the medical  association, and the hospital association. The main concern we have  right now is of our medical providerships' being stable enough and  protected enough so, if need be, they can continue to take care of us.  Right now, they are scared to death because they are not getting the  protective equipment they need. They don't have the personal protection  equipment, such as the masks or the shields or the gowns--all of the  equipment that a first responder or a medical provider should have.  That is what we are fighting for right now. Also, we have rural  hospitals and rural clinics throughout all of America--West Virginia is  mostly all rural--and they are all scared to death that they are not  going to have the finances with which to stay afloat.   The proposal that we have right now, that they are working on--that  both sides are working on--is inadequate and insufficient. Mitch  McConnell's proposal falls short of delivering the protection the  medical providerships need. They talk about the economy and the  recovery of this economy, but we need to find a treatment for the virus  as we know it. For the people who do contract it, they will know they  have a treatment that can cure them, and then we must find a working  vaccine as quickly as possible. We have been told that this could take  12 months or longer.   The treatment is the most important thing, and protecting our  healthcare workers is the most important thing. Keeping our hospitals  and clinics and all medical providers vibrant right now and able to  survive this economic downturn is the first and foremost thing, and it  is the thing that didn't get the attention that we needed.   I am hoping that between now and before we vote, at 6 o'clock, the  two sides can come together. I implore of my colleagues on the  Republican side to basically express their concerns to their leader,  Mitch McConnell, that we need to have a balanced approach.   I am concerned about the economy. I am concerned about the workers.  Through no fault of their own, we have had workers throughout West  Virginia who have been laid off. They have done nothing wrong except to  have been in professions, basically, because of the health concerns of  our country, that had to lay them off. The businesses they worked for  had to stop--cease and desist. They had to stop. It was through no  fault of their own. Basically, for the health of this country, it was  best if they closed. These people have no control whatsoever over their  destinies except to ask: When can we get this thing cured? When do we  get ahead of this cycle, or ahead of the curve, so we may get back to  normal?   Wall Street will not return, I can assure you, no matter how much  money we throw at Wall Street. It is not going to have confidence built  into it is as long as the virus is out there without any type of a  treatment or a vaccine coming down the pike that is going to cure and  protect us. That is what this is all about.   Don't you think we should be putting the resources on the front end  to help these providers, to give some assurances to the American  public, to the people in West Virginia that we have found and we have a  treatment now that will work?   God forbid if you contract the disease, and the virus attacks you,  but we can help you. You are not going to perish from this. But with  that being said, it doesn't make any sense to me that--the proposal  that Leader McConnell from the Republican side has put forth is  absolutely, totally worried about Wall Street at this time.   I am worried about the people in rural West Virginia and all over  Main Street. Those are the people we are worried about, and Wall Street  is going to do just fine. It has always rebounded real well. They  always come back strong. But the market has to have stability to it and  it has to have confidence in it and the people have to have confidence.   So that is where we stand. Let's take care of the people whom we are  asking to take care of us if we need them. Let's take care of our  healthcare workers, our nurses, our first responders, all of our  doctors. Let's take care of the facilities that they are keeping open  for us, which is the hospitals and the clinics--everything that we  possibly can to protect them. Let's make sure that our workers and  these healthcare providers don't go down because if that system goes  down, I can assure you, you can't print enough money for Wall Street to  rebound. If the healthcare system in this country is not able to take  care of the people of America, that will not happen.   And if West Virginians can't count on our hospitals and clinics to  take care of them, and if the workers who work there--the nurses and  all of the different people who work within that system--aren't able to  go to work because they might have contracted the virus, we have done  nothing special to help them with their childcare and everything  because they will be working extraordinary hours. This is where our  emphasis should be right today. This is what we should be talking  about.   Yet we are miles apart now because Wall Street is not maybe taken  care of to the likes of what they would like. I can't understand it at  all. I really don't. I want them to succeed, and they will succeed. I  want them to have a generous loan program--not a gift but a loan  program--and I want to make sure that people who have lost their jobs  and the business has closed down due to no fault of their own have the  backing of this great country of ours and the government right here.  That is whom I am worried about.   The proposal that is on the table today does not do that. If we had  to  [[Page S1897]]  vote today at this time, I would vote no, not to proceed. We will stay  here all night long. They are worried about what happens when the  markets open in the morning. We will work around the clock. I am fine.  I can stay here until 7, 8 o'clock. We can all work around the clock,  but there has to be a balanced approach and putting healthcare first.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 5 p.m. today.
