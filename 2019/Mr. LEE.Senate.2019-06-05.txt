 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, President Trump was famous for many things  even before he was elected. One of those things was the catch-phrase  ``You're fired,'' which he popularized on his reality TV show ``The  Apprentice.''   This is a relatively commonplace phrase. It is something that most  persons are familiar with, but it is not surprising that the phrase  would have so much appeal for a television audience. I think the reason  has something to do with the fact that it carries a certain power and  resonance with it because the person who has the authority to use it  within any organization is, generally speaking, a person who gets to  call the shots. It is emblematic of executive control and, therefore,  the ability to get things done within an organization.   That is not to say that good leaders get their way solely or even  primarily by threatening to fire people who work for them. Effective  leadership, more often than not, requires what are sometimes called  soft leadership skills.   But the fact, nonetheless, remains that the head of an organization  must always have hanging in reserve, sort of like an employer Damoclean  sword--the absolute right to terminate a subordinate.   It is the ultimate and essential backstop that enforces and reifies  an executive's power to make decisions. This is true for pretty much  any leader, whether that leader happens to be the CEO of a corporation,  the coach of a sports team, or a general out on the field of battle.   Yet, remarkably, under our laws, the President of the United States  lacks authority over many high-ranking officers within the executive  branch. Despite its elemental association with Executive power,  Congress and the courts have time and again deprived the President of  the ability to remove his subordinates at will.   These restrictions often take the form of statutory for-cause removal  [[Page S3260]]  protections, such as the provision of the Federal Trade Commission Act  that provides that Commissioners may be removed only ``for  inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.''   In enacting laws like this, Congress has cast aside the original  meaning of the Constitution and thereby eroded a critical safeguard of  American freedom. As anyone who has studied the Constitution or  constitutional law, for that matter, can guess, my reference to the  FTC's for-cause protection is not accidental.   That statute formed the basis of the lawsuit that culminated in the  1935 decision by the Supreme Court in a case called Humphrey's  Executor, in which the Supreme Court held for the first time that  Congress may impose restrictions on the President's removal power.   In so holding, the Supreme Court overruled its earlier precedent in  Myers v. United States, which had held that Congress may not limit the  President's ability to remove principal officers within the Federal  Government, but Humphrey's Executor didn't simply overrule Myers.  Rather, as Justice Scalia later wrote, ``it gutt[ed], in six quick  pages devoid of textual or historical precedent. . . . a carefully  researched and reasoned 70-page opinion.'' That juxtaposition alone  tells you what you need to know about these decisions. One had  constitutional text and original understanding and historical precedent  behind it. The other was constitutional law by judicial fiat.   Article II of the Constitution unquestionably establishes a unitary  executive. The vesting clause provides that ``the executive power shall  be vested in a President of the United States of America.''   As Alexander Hamilton explained it in Federalist No. 70, placing the  totality of the Executive power in a single individual was no  happenstance. It was no mistake. It wasn't just sort of some fluke. The  delegates to the Constitutional Convention recognized that a unified  executive was essential to ensure energy and accountability in the  execution of the laws, and the Constitution was drafted accordingly,  consistent with this understanding.   Without the authority to supervise and direct, and, yes, ultimately  fire his subordinates, it is impossible for the President to fulfill  his duty imposed by article II to ``take care that the laws be  faithfully executed.''   The Founders also understood that the President's removal power was  the bedrock of his authority to oversee the executive branch. In a  famous debate during the First Congress, James Madison argued that ``if  any power whatsoever is in its nature Executive, it is the power of  appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws.''   He went on to note that ``if the President should possess alone the  power of removal from office, those who are employed in the execution  of the law will be in their proper situation, and the chain of  dependence be preserved; [they] will depend, as they ought, on the  President, and the President on the community.''   Madison's argument prevailed, and the First Congress declined, on  constitutional grounds, for the reasons articulated by James Madison  himself, to create for-cause removal protections for the heads of the  newly established executive branch departments. They considered it;  Madison raised, very persuasively, this constitutional argument against  it; and then they voted it down. That was the original understanding of  the removal power, and it predominated for nearly 150 years after the  Founding.   Since Humphrey's Executor and its radical departure from the original  understanding in 1935, for-cause removal protections, both statutory  and otherwise, have, sadly, proliferated, giving rise to a vast,  headless, out-of-control branch of government, a fourth branch of  government, if you will, that exists beyond the control of the  President and is therefore unaccountable to the people.   In fact, by some estimations, there are over 80 so-called independent  agencies within the executive branch. These executive branch agencies  that we refer to somehow as independent are entrusted with regulating  immense swaths of American life--from competition policy and workplace  safety regulations to labor relations and even securities laws. They  make rules; they adjudicate rights; and they enforce laws. The  potential for abuse is tremendous; the inconsistency with the  republican principles this country was founded on, obvious.   Now, there are a lot of people here who like the sound of the term  ``independent agency,'' and they might suppose, incorrectly, that an  agency that is independent, that is beyond the control of the President  of the United States to oversee, that that is somehow a good thing.   On closer inspection, we discover that quite the opposite is true.  When we insulate someone from Presidential oversight, what we are doing  is taking the American people out of the picture. There is a reason why  we have elections every 4 years, and those elections focus on the  election of a President. It is so there is some chain of accountability  between the people and the executive branch of government.   That has become more important, not less, over the last few decades  as we have created more and more executive branch agencies and we have  entrusted those agencies with more and more power. It has never been  more important than it is today to make sure the people are connected.  If you disconnect the American people by insulating them from the  political process, then you have a whole group of people who these days  are charged not just with administrating the laws but, in some cases,  with effectively making it and interpreting it, and you are taking them  beyond the supervision that would otherwise be appropriate by the  President of the United States within the executive branch of  government.   In their fight against British tyranny, the Patriots of the American  Revolution rallied behind the principle of ``no taxation without  representation.'' Today we are faced with a somewhat different threat  to freedom, as Chief Justice Roberts wrote in a case just a few years  ago. ``The growth of the Executive Branch, which now wields vast power  and touches almost every aspect of daily life, heightens the concern  that it may slip from the Executive's control, and thus from that of  the people.''   In other words, as Chief Justice Roberts explained, when you take  this power away from the President, you are taking it away from the  people. The people lose their input on and their control over these  very important functions of what is appropriately described as the  people's government.   The concern is further compounded by the existence of independent  agencies that are, by law, divorced from any Presidential control. As a  result, in this new fight against tyranny, our watchword perhaps must  be ``no regulation without representation.'' That is why I have  spearheaded the Article I Project and why I supported legislation such  as the REINS Act and the Separation of Powers Restoration Act that  would bring the Federal regulatory apparatus, as we know it, to heel.   Of course, more is needed. We need to not only reform Congress's  relationship with the administrative state but the President's as well.  To that end, I am introducing new legislation called the Take Care Act.  The bill would restore the unitary executive envisioned by the Founders  and, in fact, required by the Constitution by stripping away all  existing for-cause removal protections from the so-called independent  agencies. It would also limit Congress's ability to create for-cause  protections by implication in the future and take other critical steps  to fortify the President's directive authority.   Simply put, the Take Care Act would eliminate the headless fourth  branch of government, empower the President to ensure faithful  execution of the law, and make the bureaucracy accountable to the  people again. Importantly, the Take Care Act would not cause the work  of administrative agencies to become subject to the unmitigated whims  and caprices of a President. There is still very real, very meaningful  political constraints, including the Senate's advise and consent role,  that would ensure, as they do now, in areas outside of these so-called  independent agencies, that the executive officers can fulfill their  congressionally assigned duties without undue interference.   In other words, although there are some so-called independent  agencies as to which the President has no removal  [[Page S3261]]  power, there are a whole lot that are not. The President's Cabinet and  many other positions within the Federal Government involve people who  are appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and who serve  at the pleasure of the President who can be fired at any moment for any  reason the President might deem appropriate.   Nevertheless, that does not mean that Presidents go around just  firing people arbitrarily because Presidents understand that there is a  political cost to doing that. We have seen in recent years, and we have  seen earlier in American history, how Presidents, even when they have  disagreements with members of their Cabinet or other people who serve  at the pleasure of the President--Presidents are still reluctant to  fire people because there are political costs attached to that, and  especially where Congress perceives there might be a partisan political  motive in mind, Congress may well take action.   In the case of the Senate, it almost inevitably will at least  threaten, if not carry out the threat, to hold up future confirmations  of Presidential appointees if Presidents abuse this power.   So it simply isn't true to say that this would open the floodgates  and cause all Presidents to just fire people arbitrarily without  hesitation in the future. What it would mean is that our elected  President would have the power to represent the people and to oversee  the executive branch of the Federal Government just as article II  already requires.   So all this bill would do would be to rescind and limit  unconstitutional restrictions on the President's removal power, and  while it may be more convenient to limit this power by statute,  convenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives or the  hallmarks of a democratic government, as the Supreme Court has  repeatedly reminded us.   Another famous catchphrase popularized by an American President is  ``the buck stops here,'' which President Truman, of course, displayed  on a placard on his desk in the Oval Office at the White House during  his Presidency. What it means is, the President is the final decision  maker within the executive branch, and, therefore, bears the sole and  ultimate responsibility for executing the laws.   In order to fulfill that very special, sacred, important  responsibility, the President must have plenary power to direct the  President's subordinates in how they carry out their assigned tasks  and, if necessary, fire them. That is what the Constitution and,  indeed, common sense require. By restoring the original understanding  and restoring the removal power to the Presidency, the Take Care Act  would give the President this authority.   By taking this step, we would reempower the American people with that  which is rightfully theirs to begin with.                            ____________________     Mr. President, President Trump was famous for many things  even before he was elected.
