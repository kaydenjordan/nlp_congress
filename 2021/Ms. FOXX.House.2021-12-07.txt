 Mr. Speaker, the attempt to stifle free speech at colleges  and universities continues to be a major problem. Too many universities  are more committed to liberal indoctrination than to providing an  education.   One of the primary reasons students attend college is to foster  intellectual curiosity, yet this is no longer allowed at many  universities. Too many students and faculty alike are being intimidated  into silence, or even worse, punished for speaking out about their  religious or political beliefs.   Universities should encourage a diverse set of viewpoints and open  dialogue; not stifle the expression of ideas they may oppose. Students  should not feel like they must be on the frontlines of a culture war  just to obtain a degree.   All Americans should have their First Amendment freedoms protected,  regardless of their point of view. Students on college campuses should  be no different.                            ____________________
