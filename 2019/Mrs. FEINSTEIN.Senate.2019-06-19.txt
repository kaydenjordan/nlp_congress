 Mr. President, today I wish to speak in support of  legislation to address the ever increasing instances of gun violence  and to urge our Republican colleagues to finally join us in our effort  to save lives.   I became mayor of San Francisco as a result of gun violence, and from  my first day in the Senate, trying to reduce the number of lives  needlessly lost to gun violence has been my mission. I authored the  Federal assault weapons ban that was in place from 1994 to 2004. Since  that ban expired 15 years ago, the number of mass shootings has risen  dramatically.   According to data from Mother Jones, which defines a mass shooting as  four or more people killed, we have suffered through 77 such massacres,  leaving 643 dead and 1,055 injured. That is why I have introduced an  updated assault weapons ban, which will keep weapons of war off of our  streets. Compared with the 10-year period before the 1994 Federal  assault weapons ban, the number of gun massacres between 1994 and 2004  fell by 37 percent. The number of people dying from gun massacres fell  by 43 percent. The fact is that the assault weapons ban worked.   Firearms like the AR-15 have become the mass shooter's weapon of  choice, and they become even more dangerous with the use of  modifications like bump stocks. We will never forget that, in 2017 in  Las Vegas, 58 people were killed and 422 wounded in our Nation's worst  mass shooting.   Simply put, there is no reason why civilians need weapons like these.  They are not for protection, and they are not for hunting. They are  weapons of war designed to take lives, and that is why we need to  reinstate the assault weapons ban.   Since 1966, there have been 163 mass shootings with at least four  people killed; 1,165 people have lost their lives, 189 of whom were  children or teenagers.   The statistics on school shootings are even more sobering. Since the  shooting at Columbine in 1999, there have been 239 school shootings  nationwide; 302 people have been injured, 144 people killed, and  228,000 children exposed to gun violence.   I have said before that I thought things were going to change after  what happened in Newtown. I still have a framed copy of the Daily News  cover with the pictures of the beautiful children whose lives were  taken that day and the headline ``Shame on U.S.,'' for failing to pass  the assault weapons ban. But things didn't change because my Republican  colleagues lacked the courage to stand up to the National Rifle  Association. I hope that can change now and that Senator McConnell will  finally call up legislation to prevent more lives from being needlessly  lost, including the lives of our children.   In addition to reinstating the assault weapons ban, we should be  doing more. In particular, the Senate should immediately consider the  Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and  universal background checks. Each of these bills should be part of a  comprehensive strategy to prevent further shootings, and we must act  quickly.   To that end, I have introduced the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act  of 2019. This bill would give grants to States to enact extreme-risk  laws. These are laws that allow family members and law enforcement  officers to get court orders to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous  people.   Fifteen States and the District of Columbia already have extreme-risk  laws on the books, and they work. San Diego has had particular success  with California's law. In a little more than a year, that office has  obtained 126 orders and confiscated 318 guns, including 33 assault  weapons.   Earlier this year, I received a letter from the San Diego city  attorney. Here is an excerpt from that letter: ``Our office has found  California's red flag law to be a powerful tool for protecting  residents and police officers from senseless gun violence. Gun-rights  advocates closely monitor our work; they have yet to bring to our  attention a case where they believe the GVRO was improperly granted.''  Simply put, extreme-risk laws protect due process, and they save lives.   Similarly, the Violence Against Women Act, which has already passed  the House, addresses gun violence by keeping guns out of the hands of  domestic abusers. It does this in three ways. First, the bill makes it  a Federal crime for someone under an ex parte domestic violence order  to possess a firearm. An ex parte hearing means that the abuser is not  there, but there are still due process protections. The judge must  still consider evidence, and the order itself is only temporary. These  sorts of orders are only issued in the most dangerous situations, which  is why it is so important that we ensure these sorts of abusers cannot  purchase or possess firearms while the order is in place.   Second, it closes the so-called boyfriend loophole. This is an  important update to the law so that, if someone is convicted of  committing domestic violence against the person he or she is dating,  they cannot possess firearms. These are situations where someone has  already been convicted of committing an act of domestic violence. The  presence of firearms in domestic violence situations raises the chance  that someone will die by 500 percent. Preventing this is common sense.   Third and finally, the House bill prohibits people convicted of  stalking from possessing a firearm. Once again, this means someone has  already been convicted in a court of repeatedly following and harassing  someone else.   For me, there is no question that domestic abusers should be barred  from purchasing or possessing firearms.   There was a recent article in the Washington Post titled, ``The  latest shooting attacks show how the U.S. stands apart from the world.  It ends with the line: ``It may not be possible to completely replicate  Australia's success, but why there has been no effort even to try is a  question that puts national lawmakers to shame.''   I agree. It is far past time for my Republican colleagues to join me  in passing commonsense gun reform. It is far past time to act, and we  are needlessly losing more lives every day to gun violence.   Thank you.                            ____________________
