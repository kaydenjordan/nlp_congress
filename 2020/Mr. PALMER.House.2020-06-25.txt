 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this bill  because it would result in more crime and fewer people willing to serve  in law enforcement.   This bill lowers the standard for mens rea and basically eliminates  qualified immunity for law enforcement officers, so, in the course of  doing their job, an officer could go to prison for unintentionally  breaking the law.   Who wants to serve in a job where they are attacked, underpaid,  overworked, and, under this bill, possibly charged as a criminal?                                time  1715    Without qualification, what happened to George Floyd was horrific,  and those involved deserve the full punishment under the law. Mr.  Floyd's death was a brutal and callous assault that has undermined the  public trust of law enforcement officers that we depend on to keep our  communities safe. Notwithstanding, we cannot undermine the entire law  enforcement community because of it. Every group has bad actors.  Congress is not without examples of such. But we can't continue to  paint all law enforcement officers as villains.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the brave men and women who keep our  communities, families, and this very Capitol safe. They take an oath to  run towards danger when everyone runs away. In fact, two officers,  David Bailey and Crystal Griner did just that when they kept my  colleagues and me from being killed on the baseball field 3 years ago.  I am convinced that several of my colleagues and I would have been  killed or grievously wounded, as was   Steve Scalise, were it not for  the courage and dedication to duty of Officers Bailey and Griner. They  are heroes, and I stand with them, not with these lawless vandals who  have occupied some of our cities, who are pressuring my colleagues  across the aisle to, if not eliminate our police departments, make them  ineffective.   Every day, somewhere in our Nation, police officers put their lives  on the line and far too many of them lose their lives or suffer serious  injuries as they faithfully and honorably do their jobs in service to  their communities. I will not support any effort to make their jobs  more dangerous while also leaving our communities vulnerable to the  lawless acts and senseless violence that we are witnessing across our  Nation today.   Mr. Speaker, in regard to the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, I  appreciate the fact that he respectfully referenced Senator Tim Scott's  bill in the Senate. I wish that the Speaker of this House of  Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, had made a similar respectful response  to that bill, as I wish Senator Dick Durbin had made a respectful  response to that bill. The majority leader called on us to work with  our colleagues across the aisle on this legislation. Had he been  serious about that, there would have been a discussion before this bill  ever came to the floor. But there wasn't one.   Mr. Speaker, as my colleague from North Dakota has pointed out, there  will be no amendments from the Republicans that substantially improve  this bill, except that there aren't any on the Senate side either. So  it is disingenuous to say that the Republicans are not interested in  pursuing justice through sensible law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
