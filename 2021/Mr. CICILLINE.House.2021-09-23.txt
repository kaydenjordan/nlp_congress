 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Iron Dome Supplemental Appropriations Act.   Israel has the right to defend itself against any assault on its  sovereignty and its people. This funding will help replenish Israel's  Iron Dome to safeguard the Israeli people from Hamas rocket fire and  other terrorist threats.    It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have decided to politicize such an important and serious  issue even after the recent deadly hostilities between Israel and  Hamas. They tried to play political games with something as deadly  serious as Iron Dome by claiming we should have included this in a  different vehicle, which every single Republican voted against.   Too much of a risk.   Today's vote is a reminder that the United States will always stand  with our ally Israel, and we have always supported funding for Iron  Dome, we will continue to do so.   Enough with the politics. Israel wants bipartisan support. This  political gamesmanship must end. Today's vote will help do that.
