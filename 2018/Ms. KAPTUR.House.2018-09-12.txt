 Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn the efforts by the Trump  administration and this Republican Congress to strip health insurance  coverage from millions of Americans.   Before the Affordable Care Act, greedy insurance companies locked out  people with preexisting conditions like it was nothing.   A Federal court is hearing a case, Texas v. United States, which  could dismantle several key health protections, one of which is  protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.   Trump's Justice Department refuses to defend existing law, which is  unprecedented, and shirks its responsibility to defend the laws  Congress has passed. This could hurt millions of people.   In the United States, there are 130 million people with preexisting  conditions. In Ohio alone, 42 percent of the population has preexisting  conditions. In a recent poll, 75 percent of the public, regardless of  party affiliation, said protections for people with preexisting  conditions are very important.   This is what the American people want and need. As a Congress, we are  charged to represent the interests of the people; to be for the people,  not the big insurance companies, not the big pharmaceutical companies  that would profit even more from a lopsided healthcare system.   Every American life matters. Every single one of them.                            ____________________
