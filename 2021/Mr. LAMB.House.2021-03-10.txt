 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment, to make  perfectly clear that transfers of firearms between family members do  not require a background check, are not subject to the strictures of  this bill. We should make that clear in order to confirm what we have  all said here today, that this is a bill that targets those who break  the law, not those who abide by it.    My amendment shows respect for the important tradition within many  families in western Pennsylvania and elsewhere of passing down a  shotgun or a hunting rifle from a father to a son. That is allowed  under our bill.   And a further and more important sign of respect will come when we  vote for final passage tomorrow to strengthen the right of those who  obey the law by keeping those who break it away from your right to own  a firearm.
