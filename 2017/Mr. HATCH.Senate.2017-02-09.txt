 I will be happy to yield.    Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished majority  leader and the minority leader. I didn't expect this today; I was just  happy to be in the Chair. But it was certainly nice of them to say such  nice things. That means a lot to me, and I am sure it will mean a lot  to my wife Elaine and our family.   I have a great deal of respect for both leaders. Senator McConnell is  a very close friend and a wonderful leader. I don't think we have had a  better leader than he in my time in the Senate.   I will not go on and on, but Senator Schumer and I have been friends  for a long time, and I believe he is one of the great Senators here. I  hope we will be able to work together on a lot of things in the future.  I hope we can get out of this rut we are in right now so we can work  together, so we can feel good about being here, and so we can help this  country.   I thank both the majority leader and the minority leader for their  kind remarks. I didn't expect those, and I was a little shocked that  they would say these things this morning, but I am very grateful to  both of them. I want to thank both of them for being my friends.   I yield back to the minority leader.    Mr. President, this has been a nice morning for me. To  have both the majority leader and the minority leader say such nice  things means a lot to me.   Having said that, let me just say I am concerned about this body and  how it is going. I am also concerned about the President. I personally  wish he would choose his words a little more carefully because  everybody in the world pays attention to the President of the United  States.   On the other hand, I kind of find it refreshing that he doesn't take  any guff from anybody. I like that. He is a person who speaks his mind,  but I have also seen him change his mind after saying he was for  something and change it when he got more facts.   He is a brand new President coming right out of the private sector.  He is picking excellent people for his Cabinet. I don't know that I  have ever seen any President pick better Cabinet members than he has,  not the least of whom will be the two who should go through before the  end of this week. Congressman Price is a tremendous choice. As both  leaders had indicated, he probably has as much knowledge about our  health care system as anyone on Earth.   Steve Mnuchin--I didn't even know Steve Mnuchin, but I spent hours  with him. I have to say he is brilliant. I said to him: You know,  Steven, you are going to lose a lot of money by taking this job. He  said: I don't care. I want to serve my country.   I was refreshed by this attitude to the point that I am going to help  him every way I can to become the greatest Treasury Secretary we have  ever had. I will tell you one thing, he does understand a lot about  money. He understands a lot about Wall Street. He understands a lot  about business acquisitions and business matters. He is a practical  person, as is our President.   I don't know that we should be so sensitive sometimes because he  oftentimes repeals what he said afterward, and I find that refreshing  too. I happen to like this President. I think he is a refreshing new  leader for this country. He is not going to play these same old games  that almost everybody who has been President has played.   He reminds me a lot of President Reagan in that regard. Of course,  Reagan had been a Governor before he came here and a good Governor, but  he didn't take himself too seriously, and he would say some things that  got him in trouble from time to time too. They all have, haven't they?  I guess, being President, every word you say is being carefully  weighed.   This President is going to have to realize that as well. I think he  will. He is a very bright man. I think we are lucky that we would have  somebody come out of the private sector into the White House, with all  the flaws, and flaws that people are finding with Donald Trump, and be  willing to take the criticisms and fight back sometimes. Is he perfect?  No. Is he ever going to be perfect? No, he is not, but neither will any  of us ever be perfect.    I will say this. A lot of us have more experience than he has. On the  other hand, in my eyes, isn't it wonderful to have someone who has been  immensely successful in the private sector--who has had some very tough  realities in the private sector, who has had his ups and downs in the  private sector, who understands pain, who understands exhilaration-- isn't it wonderful to have someone like that who just may be able to  pull this country out of the stinking mess it is in, a mess caused by a  superabundance of bureaucracy, by arrogant Members of Congress, and by  very liberal States that are dependent upon the Federal Government  rather than upon themselves? I could go on and on and on.   Let us give this President a little bit of a chance. Above all, let  us give him his Cabinet and let us quit playing these games. I know  some on the Democratic side must feel they are making headway by  playing these silly games, knowing that these Cabinet officials are  going to go through while they stopped them from being able to do the  job that needs to be done. They have made it more difficult than any  President I recall in my time in the U.S. Senate. They are treating  this President in a very belligerent, awful way. So I think we ought to  give a little bit of leeway for him to make some verbal mistakes from  time to time--even though we all wish he wouldn't.   I will say I think it is time for this body to start working and,  more importantly, start working together. There is nothing we cannot do  if we work together. We can save this country if we work together. We  could have a better attitude in this country if we will work together.  We can be an exemplar for the rest of the world if we work together.   Look, there is no excuse for these two big fights that are going on.  I like big fights on the floor. I like big fights in committees.  Sometimes out of those fights comes very good legislation or very good  approaches to government. It is good for us to go at each other from  time to time. But to make it impossible for a President to have his  Cabinet early on? There is something wrong with this approach.   Some people are using this particular situation to enhance their  ability to run for President.   I will say it would be wonderful if, once again, we could get  Democrats and Republicans to work together. I remember in the early  days, when I became one of the youngest committee chairmen of a major  committee in history, when I became chairman of the Labor and Human  Resources Committee--which is now the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee--there were nine Republicans.   Senator Kennedy came over from the Judiciary Committee, which he had  chaired, to become my ranking member. There were seven Democrats,  including Senator Kennedy, but two of our Republicans from the  Northeast were from States that were quite liberal then. I couldn't  blame them, but I knew that Kennedy had the 9-to-7 ideological edge. I  was going to be chairman, and I could determine some things, but I  wasn't going to be able to get much done unless I had some help from  Senator Kennedy.   Senator Kennedy was not known for being cooperative up to that time.  He was not known as a person who really aligned with Republicans to try  to get things done. He was known as a bomb  [[Page S979]]  thrower and as somebody who really was one of the most articulate,  liberal Democrats in this body.   In his own way, he was a very interesting and good Senator, but he  was not known for bipartisan work at that time. When he came over and  said: I will work with you, there are some things I can't do--meaning  the unions, the feminists, et cetera--but I will help you, that is how  the Hatch-Kennedy relationship began and began to bear fruit.   It could not have happened, except for two tough people with  differing principles who were willing to get together and set aside  their differences and do some things that were not only important to  the country but beneficial to the country. We were known as the odd  couple. He would laugh about that in public and say: We are known as  the odd couple. I would always point to him and say: We all know who  the odd one is, don't we.   He would laugh. He was a fun guy to be with. When he was serious  about something, he could be a formidable challenger, but he earned the  right to be that. He didn't just pop off because he wanted to be  President. He earned the right, he earned our respect, and he earned my  respect. From that time forth--he was considered a very great Senator  at that time, but he was not considered a great legislator. He went on  from there and became a great legislator. I know because we worked  together on things that are law today and good laws today. He had to  learn to be able to compromise to be able to get this type of work  done--and so did I.   We have to earn respect here. It isn't just by popping off on the  Senate floor, it is by working as hard as we can to do the best we can  for our constituents, for the people in this country of both parties-- of all parties--in the interest of everybody.   I wish we could get more of that back. I miss Senator Kennedy. I  could talk to him. I could pull him off his liberal perch. I could get  him to do things that nobody could get him to do up until that time,  and he could get me to do some things I wasn't inclined to do at the  beginning. But as we worked them out, we found out that some of the  things we both agreed on--by pulling each other together--became some  of the most important bills in history.   I would like to see more of that here. I wish to see us all start  working together. A good way to do that would be to give the President  the Cabinet he needs and wants. Maybe that is one reason why he is  saying some things that those on the other side are finding fault with  and maybe on my side are finding fault with. He doesn't have his  Cabinet. As President, he doesn't have the advisers he needs. We are  not helping him here--as President. We are not helping him get the  people around him whom he needs. We are delaying, obfuscating, and  fighting against people whom we shouldn't be fighting against.   In terms of Congressman Price and Steven Mnuchin, these are two  extremely important men for two extremely important positions who are  left floundering because we are unwilling to get the job done. If there  were real arguments against them, that is another matter, but some of  the phony arguments that have been brought up are just pathetic.   I remember when one of the Democrats wanted to be Treasurer of the  United States. He had some real flaws. He even hadn't paid taxes in  some ways, but he was a good person and wanted to serve his country. We  worked out the difficulties, and he was able to serve as Secretary of  the Treasury. I can name a number of others. If we want perfection  here, we are crazy. Nobody is perfect, and everybody has some things  that they wish they didn't have in their biography.    But I can say this: I was very disappointed in this body for holding  up Jeff Sessions, who is a really good person. I haven't always agreed  with Jeff Sessions, but I knew one thing: He was honest in his beliefs,  and he was courteous in making his arguments. He did a lot of things  that really were right. Frankly, the fact that we differed was kind of  irrelevant because he was worthy of his position. I could go through a  number of others.   Let me just say that I happen to be one of the people who really like  the minority leader in this body. I think he could become one of the  great leaders of this Senate. He is smart; we all know that. He is  aggressive; we all know that. He has had some degree of success around  here; we all know that. He represents a huge constituency; we all know  that. He is a good man; we all know that. And he has a good family; we  all know that. Let's get rid of some of the picayune fights around  here, and let's start working together.   The majority leader, Senator McConnell, in my opinion, is the best  majority leader we have had here in a long, long time. He is smart. He  understands the system. He loves the Senate. He is a very honest and  good man. He is tough as nails. I am sure he has flaws, just like all  the rest of us.   But these are two really potentially great leaders who could not only  bring us together but could help us to save this country at a time when  it needs saving, where we have $100 billion in unfunded liabilities--I  mean trillion dollars; not billion, trillion dollars--where we are  deeply in debt. We are now $20 trillion in debt.   These two gentlemen could bring us together and could help solve  these problems if we would put the politics aside, for the most part.  We have to have some politics here, or this would be an uninteresting  body, but we don't have to have it on everything. If these two  gentlemen could get together--they are both bright, they are both  smart, and they both have given a lot of time to the U.S. Senate. I  like both of them. I could say I love both of them. If they would  really start working together, we could turn this country around. But  to do that, the distinguished Senator from New York is going to have to  be concerned about the national debt and the annual deficit, and the  distinguished Senator from Kentucky is going to have to worry a lot  about what motivates the Democrats and what we can do to find common  ground with the Democrats.   I believe these two men can do that, and I am hoping with all my  heart they will, and I am praying for them every day, that they might  get together and that we might put aside party politics in favor of  bringing this country out of the mess it is in. I believe they can do  that, and I believe we can help them do that. I would like to see it  done because we can't keep going the way we are going.   I actually believe the President will grow into becoming a great  President, too, if we will help him a little bit rather than just fight  everything he does or everything he says or try to criticize him every  time he opens his mouth. I would like to see us show some respect for  the President too.   I have a lot of respect for these two leaders. They are great men.  But I would like to see them be greater so that they will work  together. You will notice I am just saying ``work together.'' I would  like it to be this way, all the way together, but I will take this, if  we could just get people to work together around here.   I have said enough. I just want these two leaders to know that I am  pulling for both of them, and I am hoping we can still have our fights  and still have our arguments and still have the enjoyable aspects  around here of comradeship and working with each other. But I am hoping  we can set aside some of these animosities and give the President his  Cabinet and his leaders so that he has at least a shot at pulling this  country out of the mess it is in. It is going to take a President  Trump. It is not going to take another one of those--I believe  President Trump is the person who is right for this time. I believe he  will do a terrific job if we will help him. We will have differences,  but I believe he will pay more attention, and I believe we will get  better people to come into the government to help him to do this work  and his job.   I may be a little bit naive in thinking that we can do all of this,  but I think we can. And that is said by somebody who was told: You  don't want to work with Senator Kennedy because he is a rock-ribbed  liberal who doesn't really care about what Republicans like. Well, I  found that by working with him and he found that by working with me we  were able to do things that helped our country. It was partly because  he was a prestigious Senator, no question, and partly because I am an  active, hard-working, fighting Senator who kind of appealed to him  because he knew he had somebody who would help fight these things  through, and I was smart enough to be able to help him to get things  done in better ways than they would have been done.  [[Page S980]]    Well, I have said enough. I just love this body. I personally have  been very moved by the kindness of the two leaders, and I just hope we  can get together and do these things the right way. We are not going to  go anywhere with constant bickering and fighting and the constant  running for President that we have around here. I don't mind that. I  mean, I think there is something to that, but it can't be every time a  person opens his or her mouth.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about two of President  Trump's nominees. I will first address Nominee Gorsuch to the Supreme  Court. Then I will discuss the nomination of Tom Price to be Secretary  of Health and Human Services, which is currently pending before the  Senate.   Last week, President Trump nominated U.S. Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch  to fill the vacancy left by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin  Scalia. I want to address both the process and the substance of what  lies ahead for the Senate.   The Constitution gives to the President the power to nominate and,  subject to the Senate's advice and consent, the power to appoint  judges. The first step in the Senate exercising its power of advice and  consent is to decide the best way to handle a nomination made by the  President.   The Constitution does not mandate a one-size-fits-all process. In  fact, the Senate has handled the Supreme Court nominations in at least  a dozen different ways.   Nearly 1 year ago, shortly after Justice Scalia's death, I explained  on the Senate floor the two reasons the next President should choose  his replacement. First, the circumstances and timing of the Scalia  vacancy supported separating the confirmation process from the  Presidential election season, which was a hard-fought Presidential  election.   When he chaired the Judiciary Committee in 1992, then-Senator Joe  Biden urged the Senate not to consider a Supreme Court nomination in  that Presidential election year. Each of his four reasons applied, with  even greater force, to the circumstances we faced last year.   Second, I said that elections have consequences. The American people  were increasingly concerned about the illegal and unconstitutional  actions of the Obama administration, actions that the courts struck  down dozens of times.   The two Presidential candidates last year represented very different  ideas about the power and proper role of judges in our system of  government. The American people, therefore, had a unique opportunity to  address the future course of the judiciary in general and the Supreme  Court in particular.   Not surprisingly, the percentage of American voters who said that the  Supreme Court was a very important issue tripled between 2008 and 2016.  The issue was always when, not whether, the Senate would consider a  nominee to fill the Scalia vacancy.   Plunging into a divisive, ideological confirmation battle in the  middle of a confrontational and ugly Presidential campaign would have  done more harm than good to the judiciary, the Senate, and the country.  We were right to avoid such damage and, as a result, today we can focus  properly on the appointment of Justice Scalia's successor.   Democrats and their left-leaning allies, however, sound as though  they exist in some kind of parallel universe. In editorials since the  election, for example, the New York Times claims that Republicans stole  this Supreme Court seat from President Obama.   I am sure they are in denial about the election results, and some  observers have called this bizarre fiction sour grapes. I think that  gives sour grapes a bad name, between you and me.   No judicial position, including the Supreme Court seat occupied by  Justice Scalia, belongs to any President. President Obama exercised the  power that the Constitution gives him by nominating someone to that  vacancy. The Senate exercised the power that the Constitution  separately gives us by not granting consent to that nomination.   I have news for my Democratic colleagues: Not getting your way does  not mean that anyone stole anything; it just means that you did not get  your way.   When Chairman Biden refused to give a hearing to more than 50  judicial nominees during the 103rd Congress--a record, by the way, that  still stands--the New York Times never said that those seats were being  stolen from President Bush.   When Democrats blocked a confirmation vote 20 times during the 108th  Congress, the Times never accused Democrats of theft but was right  there egging them on.   Republicans last year decided to defer the confirmation process  without knowing who would win the election. Democrats this year are  objecting because of who won the election, even though at the time, it  looked as though Hillary Clinton was a sure winner.   I think we should stop the nonsense and act like grownups because we  have work to do.   Turning to that work, the task before us is to determine whether  Judge Neil Gorsuch is qualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court. Qualifications for judicial service include both legal  experience and judicial philosophy, and I believe we should look at a  nominee's entire record for evidence of these qualifications.   Judge Gorsuch's legal experience is well documented and widely  acknowledged. Judge Gorsuch clerked for two Supreme Court Justices,  spent a decade in private practice, and then served as Acting Associate  Attorney General. His qualifications for the U.S. Court of Appeals were  so obvious that the Senate confirmed him in 2006 without even a roll  call vote.   Let me put that into perspective. During the 4 years that Republicans  were back in the majority, 2003 to 2006, the Senate took roll call  votes on 86 percent of judicial nominations. Democrats were demanding  roll call votes even when, as happened 82 percent of the time, the  nominations were unopposed. In other words, it was a very rare  exception for a judicial nomination to be confirmed without a roll call  vote at all. That is how self-evidently qualified this nominee was for  the appeals court.   In 11 years on the appellate bench, he has authored hundreds of  majority or separate opinions, many of which have been widely praised.  There is no question that Judge Gorsuch has the legal experience to  serve on the Supreme Court.   As I have said many times, the conflict over judicial appointments is  really a conflict over judicial power. The more important qualification  for judicial service, therefore, is a nominee's judicial philosophy, or  his or her understanding of the power and proper role of judges in our  system of government--in other words, the kind of Justice he will be.   Federal judges have two basic tasks. They can perform those tasks in  two basic ways. Their tasks are to interpret and apply the law to  decide cases. They can perform those tasks impartially or politically.   An impartial judge interprets statutes and the Constitution to mean  what they already mean, while the political judge interprets them to  mean what he wants them to mean. When an impartial judge applies the  law, he deliberately excludes his own views and does not put his thumb  on the scale to make sure the results of the case benefit a particular  party or group.   The political judge accepts, and even embraces, that his background  and biases shape his decisions and considers how individual decisions  will affect other parties, groups, or issues.   Our system of government, and the liberty it makes possible, requires  impartial judges in all cases.   In his farewell address in 1796, President George Washington said  that the heart of our system of government is the right of the people  to control the Constitution. One of his original Supreme Court  Justices, James Wilson, described our system of government by saying  that here, the people are masters of the government. Our liberty can be  secure only if the people control the Constitution, only if the people  remain masters of the government. That cannot happen if judges control  the Constitution because then, government will be the master of the  people. That is why the kind of judge Presidents appoint is so  important. Impartial judges  [[Page S988]]  let the people govern; they let the people govern themselves. Political  judges do it for them.   The best way to tell which kind of Justice the nominee before us will  be is to assess the kind of judge he already is. One of the most  obvious places to look is in the opinions he has been writing for more  than a decade. Last year, for example, the Tenth Circuit had to decide  whether to use the Constitution to create new categories of lawsuits  against law enforcement officers. Judge Gorsuch agreed that the courts  should resist doing so and wrote:         Ours is the job of interpreting the Constitution. And that       document isn't some inkblot on which litigants may project       their hopes and dreams . . . but a carefully drafted text       judges are charged with applying according to its original       public meaning.    In other words, the Constitution is not a blank check a judge may  write to whomever, and for whatever amount, they like. It is not a  shape-shifting blob that judges can manipulate into whatever they want  it to be.   In this view, Judge Gorsuch was merely echoing America's Founders.  Thomas Jefferson, for example, argued that if the Constitution means  whatever judges say it means, the Constitution will become ``a mere  thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and  shape into any form they please.''   He was right. The Constitution, after all, is the primary way the  people set rules for government, including for the judiciary. If the  people are to remain masters of the government, they must remain  masters of the Constitution, and that includes not only what it says  but also what the Constitution means.   Impartial judges take statutes and the Constitution as they are, not  for what they say but also for what they mean.   Political judges act as if the people and their elected  representatives established a Constitution or enacted statutes that are  merely collections of words with no meaning until judges fill in those  blanks. Judge Gorsuch is an impartial judge. Anybody looking at the  record has to know that. He knows that he is to interpret but cannot  make the law. He knows that the Constitution must control judges, not  the other way around.    Last year, Judge Gorsuch delivered a lecture about Justice Scalia's  legacy at Case Western University School of Law. In that lecture, Judge  Gorsuch embraced a defined judicial philosophy and made clear the kind  of judge that he is.   I referred to this lecture in my remarks last week, and this week I  sent it to each of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I truly  hope each and every Member of this body will read it carefully because  it helps answer the most important question before us in exercising our  power of advice and consent: What kind of Justice will this nominee be?   In his lecture, Judge Gorsuch said--and I will refer to the chart  again--``Judges should be in the business of declaring what the law is  using the traditional methods of interpretation, rather than  pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own  political views, always with an eye on the outcome.''   Some Senators and liberal groups have already stated that they oppose  this nomination. Perhaps they think judges should be in the business of  pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own  political views.   Judge Gorsuch said in his lecture that the task of a judge is to  interpret and apply the law rather than, as he put it, ``to amend or  revise the law in some novel way.'' Perhaps his critics believe the  opposite, that judges actually do have the power to amend and revise  the law in novel ways.   Last year, Judge Gorsuch echoed America's Founders in saying that the  power of the legislative branch to make law and the power of the  judicial branch to interpret law should be kept separate and distinct.  Confusing them, he said, would be a grave threat to our values of  personal liberty and equal protection. Perhaps his critics believe it  does not matter whether judges make or interpret the law.   Last year, Judge Gorsuch said that judges must ``assiduously seek to  avoid the temptation to secure results they prefer.'' What the law  demands, he said, is more important than the judge's policy  preferences. Perhaps his critics think judges should give in to that  temptation, putting their preferred results ahead of what the law  demands?   The more we find out about Judge Gorsuch and his judicial philosophy,  the more we should ask what his opponents and critics really find so  objectionable. If Democrats and their leftwing allies believe that  judges, rather than the people, should control the Constitution, they  should come right out and say so. If they believe that the political  ends justify the judicial means, that judges may manipulate the law to  produce politically correct results, then they should be honest about  it and defend that radical idea to the American people.   As I close, I want to offer some wisdom from Daniel Webster, who  served in the House and Senate and twice as Secretary of State under  three different Presidents. In a speech on March 15, 1837, he said:         Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption       of authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the       Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers       of good intentions. There are men in all ages who mean to       govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good       masters, but they mean to be masters.    Well, there are also judges who mean to be good masters, but they do  indeed mean to be masters. They mean to govern well, but they do mean  to govern. That kind of judge compromises the heart of our political  system and undermines the liberty that it makes possible.   Judge Neil Gorsuch has no intention of governing, of being any kind  of master of the Constitution or of the people. He is, instead, an  impartial judge, the kind who follows rather than controls the law. He  will be the kind of Justice that America needs on the Supreme Court.    I thank you, Madam President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Nebraska.    I thank you, Madam President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Nebraska.    I thank you, Madam President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Nebraska.    I thank you, Madam President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Nebraska.    I still have one more speech to give.    I still have one more speech to give.    I will try to make this very brief.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore.    Madam President, I would like to turn to the business  currently before the Senate and express my support for the nomination  of Representative Tom Price to be the Secretary of Health and Human  Services at this critical juncture.   HHS encompasses an extremely large and diverse set of agencies,  including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health,  and the Food and Drug Administration, just to name a few. All told, its  annual budget is more than $1 trillion--that is trillion with a ``t.''   The various programs and agencies that fall under HHS's purview have  an enormous impact on our Nation's fiscal and economic outlook. I am  not exaggerating when I say that HHS affects the daily lives of more  American taxpayers than any other part of the Federal Government.   Management of all these agencies is not for the faint of heart. Once  confirmed, Dr. Price will have his work cut out for him, but I believe  he is more than up to the challenge. He has proven that over the years.   Dr. Price has extensive insight into our Nation's health care system,  having practiced medicine for two decades in a variety of settings.  That experience has informed his years of service in the House of  Representatives, which included a tenure as chairman of the House  Budget Committee and in the leadership in the Ways and Means Committee.   While many who come to Washington are content to sit back and talk  about our Nation's problems, Dr. Price has always sought to find  solutions. At a time when our health care system is in distress, I  believe Dr. Price will put his  [[Page S989]]  vast experience to good use and be decisive in not only working with  Congress to find solutions but implementing them as well.   My view on his qualifications is shared by a great number of people,  including many who see the problems in our health care system up close.  For example, former HHS Secretaries Mike Leavitt and Tommie Thompson  enthusiastically support his nomination. Major stakeholder  organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American  Hospital Association, most surgical specialty groups, and others, also  support him. In their letter of support, the Health Care Leadership  Council, which represents a wide range of health care providers, said  that ``it is difficult to imagine anyone more capable of serving his  nation as the Secretary of HHS than Congressman Tom Price.'' I couldn't  have said it better myself.   Of course, none of this seems to matter to some of my colleagues on  the other side. They aren't coming to the floor to criticize Dr.  Price's abilities or qualifications; instead, most of what we have  heard for weeks now is focused on a vague patchwork of allegations of  ethical impropriety on the part of the nominee.   I have participated in quite a few confirmation debates during my  time in the Senate, and even over this agency. One thing I have learned  is that if the opponents of a particular nomination keep moving their  focus from one set of allegations to another, more often than not, they  don't have a leg to stand on. That is very much the case with regard to  the attacks that have been hurled at Dr. Price.   First, we heard about supposed conflicts of interest in his finances,  until it was pretty clear that Dr. Price had followed all the required  ethical guidelines and disclosure requirements of the House.   After that, he was accused of lying to the Senate Finance Committee  during our vetting process because he had to file an amended disclosure  to include some mistaken omissions. Of course, this is not altogether  an uncommon occurrence, particularly given the fact that the Finance  Committee's vetting process is uniquely exhaustive. It happens in  almost every case where you have people who have had a complicated life  or work life. Furthermore, he was asked about this during his  confirmation hearing, and his answers were reasonable, and I haven't  heard anyone credibly argue that he was intentionally trying to mislead  the committee.   I will set aside the fact that the particulars of Dr. Price's  disclosures to the Finance Committee--information which is typically  kept private among members and staff--were apparently managed and  embellished in order to create and reinforce a partisan narrative with  the media. Instead, I will simply say that the Finance Committee's  bipartisan vetting process for nominees has historically operated on an  assumption of good faith, both on the part of the nominee and the  members of the committee. The fact that my colleagues on the committee,  in many respects, have decided to cast all that aside in recent weeks  is not evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Dr. Price.   When the overblown claims about his disclosures failed to gain  traction, my colleagues on the other side turned their focus to a  particular investment in an Australian biomed company in 2015. Their  claim: Dr. Price received a ``sweetheart deal'' from the company which  allowed him to purchase stock at a discounted price. They also argue  that he lied during his confirmation hearing when he said he paid the  same price for the stock as everyone else at that time.   Now, my colleagues would have everyone believe that private placement  investment arrangements are inherently shady and nefarious. Let's just  get that out of the way right now. Private placements are a commonplace  and appropriate means for companies to raise--   Madam President, let me yield the floor to Senator Scott.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.    I sure appreciate my colleague because I have run out of  time here and I still have things to say.    Well, let me just go back.   Let's just get that out of the way right now. Private placements are  a commonplace and appropriate means for companies to raise additional  capital from a small number of investors. I know because I used to  practice law and I did a number of private placements in my experience.   The facts in this matter are relatively simple: The Australian  company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, had a relatively small number of  U.S. investors at the time. It is my understanding that all of the  investors who had participated in a previous share offering were  offered an opportunity to purchase additional stock as part of a  private placement arrangement. Dr. Price purchased additional stock at  the price that was offered to all the investors in that group.   Once again, private placements are commonplace investments, not  nefarious conspiracies that some of our colleagues would have us  believe. And I can certainly testify to that. According to all the  available details, this particular investment was in compliance with  all of the laws and regulations that govern those types of deals. In  fact, as private placement investments go, this one appears to be  fairly unremarkable, unless, of course, you just assume without  evidence that there simply had to be something fishy going on--an  assumption that I don't think could be made.   Put simply, this investment arrangement was a perfectly normal,  commonplace affair. There is certainly no evidence to suggest that  there was any insider trading, as some of my colleagues have alleged.   On top of that, Dr. Price's statements before the Finance Committee,  despite many claims to the contrary, appear to be truthful unless you  simply want to assume without evidence that he has to be lying. What a  situation that our colleagues try to put this good man in. It is  disreputable, in my opinion.    By all accounts, Dr. Price purchased the Innate stock at the same  price offered to all other participants in the private placement which,  by the way, also included a few thousand investors from Australia and  New Zealand. That is what he told the committee and that, by all  appearances, is the truth. We certainly haven't seen any evidence to  the contrary. Sure, my colleagues on the other side have thrown a lot  of dots on the wall, apparently hoping they can create a cloudy  impression that something nefarious just had to be going on with this  investment, even though they haven't come close to connecting any of  the dots. They have parsed words, they have divined alternative  meanings behind the nominee's statements. But let me be clear, no one  has produced any credible evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Dr.  Price. Those of us who know him know that he never did any wrongdoing  and, frankly, never intended to do anything that was wrong.   That being the case, it is utterly shameful that my colleagues would  go to such elaborate lengths in order to malign not only a nominee for  a Cabinet position but a sitting Member of the U.S. Congress. There  ought to be some courtesy here, and I am kind of shocked that there  isn't. Of course, we went through a fairly ugly episode the other night  about the same issue, though that one hit a little closer to home as  the nominee under attack was a fellow Senator.   I don't want to rehash that argument here today. Instead, I will say  this. I know some people like to fight around here. For some, it seems  the fighting is half the reason they are here to begin with, and  neither party is blameless in that regard. Do you know what? If my  colleagues wanted to have a fierce and lively debate about this  nominee's qualifications or his views on policy, I welcome that debate.  He is a tremendous human being, a tremendous doctor, with all kinds of  experience, and has been a wonderful Member of the House of  Representatives for both parties--as a Republican. If they want to  fairly debate his record as a legislator  [[Page S990]]  and a public servant, I am game. I will be glad to do it with them, but  to throw accusations at a congressional colleague, and even go so far  to accuse him--without evidence--of criminal wrongdoing is, in my view,  beneath the dignity of the Senate.   That is precisely what has happened to Dr. Price. Ultimately, my  colleagues' specious arguments and their desperate attempt to block Dr.  Price's confirmation would all seem far more sincere if he were the one  nominee or even one in a small handful of nominees they deemed unfit to  serve, but that is not what is happening.   My colleagues on the other side have appeared to be apoplectic about  almost every single nominee we have had before us. The confirmation of  any of President Trump's Cabinet nominees, it seems, will bring about  untold destruction, the likes of which America has never seen.   With so many of these nominations, the entire process has been  wrought with fever-pitched arguments, accusations, and apocalyptic  visions of a future world gone mad. We hear it in committee. We are  hearing it on the floor. Then the Senate votes, the nominees are  confirmed, and my colleagues immediately switch gears to do the very  same thing with the next nomination. Some of them even switch gears and  come up to the nominee with smiles on their faces and congratulate him  or her.   One can only wonder how so many Senators can keep their outrage  settings turned to 11 without getting completely exhausted around here.  I expect they are able to do so because their outrage is more show than  anything else. Indeed, I suspect that the outrage that has been on  display has less to do with the particular nominees and more to do with  a longer term political agenda. In service of that partisan agenda, my  colleagues appear to be more than willing to cast aside the traditions,  respect, and assumptions of good faith that have long been the hallmark  of the Senate confirmation process and of the Senate itself.   I am very concerned with the way this has gone on here. I am  concerned with the way my colleagues are treating another respected  colleague from the House. We have seen it in committee. We are seeing  it on the floor. In my view, it is a tragic shame.   The bottom line is, Dr. Price is, by any reasonable objective  standard, qualified to serve as HHS Secretary. Some people would say he  is qualified just because he has made it all the way to Congress and he  ought to be treated with equal respect, but I will not even go that  far. I will just say, by any reasonable and objective standard, he is  qualified to serve as HHS Secretary. There is nothing in his past  record or statements that disqualifies him to serve in that capacity.  In a better world, he would be confirmed already. People would be  shouting hooray that this good man will take the time and spend the  effort to take this very thankless, very difficult job--and to leave  Congress in the process. I suspect he will be confirmed in short order.   Once again, I do urge my colleagues to vote with me to confirm  Representative Price. I really believe we ought to get past this is  picayune stuff that has been going on, on the floor. We ought to get  past that and truly, truly support a good man from the other body who  we all know is honest and decent and allow him to see what he can do to  straighten out this tremendously complex Department of Health and Human  Services.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.    Mr. President, I ask consent that floor privileges be  granted until June 30 to Christopher Walker, an academic fellow on my  staff.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
