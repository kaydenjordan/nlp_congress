 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7105, the Johnny Isakson  and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement  Act of 2020.   This legislation is a culmination of 2 years of bipartisan work by  the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees. It contains  provisions that will provide veterans and their families with improved  access to care, compensation, education, housing, and burial benefits  that they have earned and will result in a Department of Veterans  Affairs that is better able to meet their needs.   I am proud that one of my last votes in Congress will be in support  of this bill. I am also humbled that it bears my name and that of my  friend, former Senator Johnny Isakson from Georgia. It was a pleasure  to work with Senator Isakson as the chairman of the Senate Veterans'  Affairs Committee before his retirement last year.   Our shared passion for serving our fellow veterans led to the  creation and passage of landmark veterans' legislation, including the  MISSION Act, the Forever GI Bill, the Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection Act, and the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization  Act.   I am honored to share this recognition with him, and I thank our  colleagues for recognizing our work in this way. It would take more  time than I have to list every worthy proposal in this bill and thank  every lawmaker, Republican and Democrat alike, who sponsored them.   The many provisions included in this omnibus bill will support  veterans and families from the time they transition out of the military  to the time they are interred in a VA, State, Tribal, or private  cemetery and at multiple critical touchpoints in between.   For transitioning veterans, it will authorize a review of the  Transition Assistance Program, or TAP; allow TAP to be provided at off- base locations; and support community organizations that are supporting  servicemembers as they transition.   For student veterans, it will expand the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM  Scholarship program to student veterans working on their medical  degrees; require schools to provide all student veterans with in-state  tuition, regardless of when they left Active Duty; make improvements  and increase funding for the VET TEC pilot program to connect veterans  with careers in the technology industry; strengthen oversight of  schools that use the GI Bill; expand the restoration of benefits to  students whose schools close in the middle of a term; and ensure that  more servicemembers and veterans can take advantage of the improved  benefits available through the Post-9/11 GI Bill.   For veterans with service-connected disabilities, it will ensure that  claims  [[Page H7206]]  for disability compensation include pertinent information from  veterans' private providers by requiring the VA to reinstate public- facing Disability Benefits Questionnaires, or DBQs, and issue a report  detailing whether an alternative disability exam process would better  serve veterans and, if so, implement it.   For women veterans, it will ensure that the VA healthcare system is  more prepared for and responsive to their needs and help it instill a  culture that is more welcoming, inclusive, and safe.   For veterans who have experienced military sexual trauma, it will  streamline benefits and make it easier to get the care and compensation  they deserve.   For veterans struggling with homelessness or housing insecurity, it  will increase funding for transitional housing providers; improve case  management services in the HUD-VASH voucher program; provide additional  funding and flexibility to allow service providers to care for those  with children and meet rising demands associated with COVID-19;  authorize grant funding for legal services; and support those leaving  the criminal justice system.   For veterans worried about their finances, it will address a major  root cause of veteran debt by allowing veterans to remove dependents  from the eBenefits system.   For veterans concerned about the general management and operation of  the Department of Veterans Affairs, it will improve VA's work with  Congress and the Government Accountability Office to address high-risk  service lines and improve VA's overall efficiency and effectiveness;  and strengthen financial management across the Department, which is  more important now than ever before as VA's budget approaches $250  billion a year and total liabilities surpass $4 trillion.   For veterans who are providing critical care and support during the  COVID-19 pandemic, it will provide a time-limited presumption of  exposure to help streamline benefits for those who develop long-term  disabilities associated with exposure to COVID-19 as a result of their  service during this unforgettable moment in history.   For veterans at the end of their lives, it will create a single  burial benefit for non-service-connected veterans by raising the cost  of the non-service-connected burial allowance to match the allowance  for veterans who pass away in a VA facility; allow VA to pay for  certain burial transportation costs for families who choose to lay  their loved ones to rest in a State or Tribal veterans cemetery; and  permit VA to replace a veteran's VA-furnished headstone in a private  cemetery to add memorial inscriptions for eligible family members.   Finally, for veterans' survivors, it will extend GI Bill survivor  benefits to the families of servicemembers who died of a service- connected injury while in the Reserves, and it will address an inequity  in Federal benefits for surviving spouses by allowing them to retain  their eligibility for VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation if they  remarry after the age of 55.   I can go on and on; but, suffice to say, there is something in this  bill for just about every one of our Nation's veterans and their loved  ones.   I am very grateful to every Senator and Member of Congress who has  introduced one of the various pieces of legislation in this package,  including Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California; my good  friend and incoming Ranking Member Mike Bost from Illinois; Congressman  Gus Bilirakis from Florida; General Jack Bergman from Michigan;  Congressman Jim Banks from Indiana; Congressman Andy Barr from  Kentucky, Congressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois; Congressman Doug  LaMalfa from California; and Congressman Jodey Arrington from Texas.    This bill would not have been possible without the hard work,  dedication, and support of numerous individuals and organizations,  including VA; our partners in the veteran service organization  community; the Women Veterans Task Force; committee members from both  sides of the aisle, particularly the chairs and ranking members of our  Subcommittees on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, on  Economic Opportunity, on Health, and on Oversight and Investigations;  our colleagues on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee; and last, but  certainly not least, my good friends and fellow Veterans' Affairs  Committee leaders: Chairman Takano, Chairman Moran, and Ranking Member  Tester.   Serving in the United States Army, Second Infantry Division, as I  did, was a defining moment in my life. Helping to serve my fellow  veterans in Congress these past 12 years along such an esteemed group  of lawmakers who I am proud to call friends has been a honor of a  lifetime.   The 116th Congress has been one for the history books in more than  one way. I hope that it will end on a high note today by passing this  important bill and providing that, despite all of the challenges before  us at this particular moment in time, Congress can still come together  on a bipartisan basis to enact meaningful legislation on behalf of some  of our most deserving constituents, the men and women who have so  bravely defended our freedoms and the families and caregivers who  support them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), my good friend and new ranking  member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I have been in Mr. Bost's  district many times. I know his passion. He is a former marine. I guess  once a marine, always a marine, Mr. Speaker.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), my good friend who represents  the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I think General Bergman is the highest  ranking officer who has served in the U.S. Congress, a marine.                                time  1445     ROE of Tennessee.

Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, it is obvious today, with the minority leader, the  Speaker, and numerous, numerous distinguished Members coming to speak,  the importance of this.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for his work on this. I thank  all the Members who, in a bipartisan way, brought this extremely  important bill to fruition.   I certainly appreciate the honor of having this bill named after  Senator Isakson and myself, and I encourage my colleagues to support  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2216, the TEAM Veteran  Caregivers Act.   Just as our Nation's veterans are heroes, so are their caregivers.  When a servicemember or veteran is seriously injured in service to our  country, their family caregiver serves as an irreplaceable source of  support and care during recovery and beyond.   They are just as vital a part of the veteran's care team as the  veteran's doctors and nurses. They deserve respect, recognition, and  support for all the work they do for their veteran loved ones and the  personal sacrifices that work requires of them.   Since the Department of Veterans Affairs' family caregiver program  was created by Congress in 2012, caregiver support services--including  a monthly stipend, respite care, training, and healthcare, if needed-- have been offered to eligible caregivers of post-9/11 veterans.   We expanded the family caregiver program to include caregivers of  pre-9/11 veterans in the MISSION Act 2 years ago, and those caregivers  began receiving benefits through the program in October.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't say the Dole Foundation  and Senator Dole had a great influence on this.   Along with expanding the family caregiver program to caregivers of  veterans of all eras, VA also made several programmatic changes, which  I hope will ensure the program works better for every single veteran  and caregiver in need of it. However, it may also result in some  caregivers who were formerly eligible for the program to no longer be  eligible for it because their veteran loved one had sufficiently  recovered as to no longer require the same level of caregiving  services.   To help individuals under those circumstances, this bill would  require the VA to notify veterans and caregivers of medical decisions  and determinations that may affect their eligibility for the family  caregiver program and to extend the caregiver benefits on a temporary  basis to those who are deemed ineligible for the program, ensuring that  they have time to adjust to life without the support it provides them.   It would also require VA to list the names of caregivers in veterans'  electronic health records to ease communication between providers and  caregivers.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Senator Gary Peters from Michigan and  Senator Marsha Blackburn, my fellow Tennessean, for introducing this  bill, as well as Congressman   Andy Biggs from Arizona for sponsoring  the House companion to it. I thank each of them for their leadership on  this issue and their commitment to caring for caregivers.   Mr. Speaker, I will be proudly supporting this bill today, and I urge  all of my colleagues to join me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my good friend, who is the House  sponsor of this legislation.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take a couple of minutes of personal privilege  before I do close.   This will be the last couple of days I am here on the House floor,  and I would like to thank the constituents of the First Congressional  District of Tennessee who have supported me overwhelmingly for the past  12 years. I cannot thank you enough.   I have made so many great friends as I have traveled those 12  counties in rural east Tennessee, and I couldn't be prouder of them.  Certainly, my prayers are with them now during this COVID epidemic.   This was a year like no one ever expected, Mr. Speaker. I think we  will all look back years from now, and history will judge us on how we  did now.   I want to thank my family and friends that I have had. I would not be  here without them.   During this past 12 years, I have had, obviously, some personal  issues. My wife died of cancer during the 12 years I was here. I lost a  very dear personal friend not 6 weeks after that. My mother died a year  after that. And a year after that, I was diagnosed with cancer myself,  and I am a cancer survivor.  [[Page H7213]]    I want to thank the people in this body and in this House for the  personal support that they gave me and uplifted me, the Congressional  Prayer Breakfast, and just many friends, as Mr. Biggs talked about,  that would stop and speak to you and lift you up. I don't think people  see that.   I want to thank my staff. I have had an incredible staff since I have  been here. I am amazed at the insight and work that these young people  do on both sides of the aisle. It is just amazing. We would not get  this legislation completed. You see this big, thick binder right here.  It is these staff members that put this together, do the hard work, and  bring us together. And I can't thank them enough.   And my colleagues: I have met and made some amazing friends that will  last a lifetime here.   I remember, and I will pass this along, an old coach told me this  once. We were at a Boy Scout camp and I was a counselor there. One of  the scouts ran up and said: ``Coach, Coach, we have a problem down at  shower house number 2.''   And he said: ``What is it?''   The scout said: ``Well, the toilet is stopped up.''   And the coach, I will never forget this, he said: ``We don't have  problems here. We have opportunities.''   So, basically, we have had a lot of opportunities, I have, since I  have been here.   I have been able to serve on some committees, the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, which I have been a member since day one; the Education and  Labor Committee, which I had the privilege of serving as the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions. I  served a term on the Agriculture Committee. I served on the Joint  Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans. I have co- chaired the GOP Doctors Caucus for the past several terms.                                time  1530    Mr. Speaker, I mean this sincerely. No one person does any of these  things. It does take a team effort. And that team effort, you heard it  today, you heard both sides of the aisle contribute to this piece of  legislation that we just passed by voice vote.   We were able to pass in a bipartisan way the MISSION Act, which will  fundamentally change--it is a very complex act that will fundamentally  change how veterans get their care and improve the quality of care for  our veterans.   The Forever GI Bill--Mr. Speaker, when I got out of the Army in 1975,  I was able to use the GI Bill, and I know it paid me $300 a month for 2  years. It sunsetted at 10 years. This Congress fully paid for that.   These young people now, these men and women who have served this  country, can use that benefit the rest of their lives and that benefit  can be transferred. It is an incredible help to families now with the  high cost of education.   We had an SGR, the sustainable growth rate repeal, and Medicare  reform, the Medicare wage index reform.   We passed the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial  Act.   With Whip Hoyer, we passed an EpiPen bill so that they can be put it  schools around the country. And I can tell you, after that happened, in  my own district about 3 years ago, a student had an anaphylactic  reaction. She did not know she had a problem. And a life was saved  because of that.   I think if I did anything in Congress--and I want to thank Mr. Hoyer  for his help with that. We have another asthma bill that is getting hot  lined in the Senate, to show you can do bipartisan work across the  aisle.   That is just a few of the things that we were able to succeed and do.  These are, again, not done by any one person. They are done as a team.  And I want to thank everyone who helped make my time here in Congress  successful.   I can tell you, it is one of the great privileges of my life to serve  in the House of Representatives, in the greatest deliberative body in  the world, the United States Congress. It is an honor I will never  forget, Mr. Speaker.   I will finish by saying that I encourage my colleagues to support  this bill and, graciously, I yield back the balance of my time.
