 Madam President, 50 years ago this coming February,  President Nixon made history as the first American President to visit  the People's Republic of China. He thought that by inviting China to  join what he called ``the family of nations,'' he could incentivize the  Chinese Communist Party to liberalize at home and refrain from  exporting its brand of communism abroad.   That may sound naive because, as we look back on those 50 years, the  changes President Nixon hoped for never came. But he held out hope for  change because he had faith in the Chinese people. He was an incredible  admirer of their culture and their remarkable history.   And even though these past few decades have proven Nixon wrong about  the CCP, he was right to have faith in the people of China. That is why  we have to be specific when we talk about what the future holds for our  two countries.   The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party are not the same  thing. In fact, the opposite is true. We have seen countless examples  of the Chinese people's bravery, from pro-democracy demonstrations in  Hong Kong to 1989's protests in Tiananmen Square.   They were born deserving the same universal rights that we enjoy in  the United States: freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and so many  more.   They deserve to live in a country that recognizes those rights and  understands that true power comes from the consent of the governed, not  from the iron fist of the party oligarchy.   Unfortunately, that iron fist is how the CCP has kept its grip on  power for so many decades, and they have shown no signs of slowing down  under President Xi Jinping.   As we approach the 50th anniversary of President Nixon's  groundbreaking trip, we need to reflect on what those 50 years have  brought us.   China has not become a democracy. Instead, the Communist Party is  weaponizing new technologies to consolidate their rule. Through what  President Biden's chief adviser for Asia, Kurt Campbell, has called  digital authoritarianism, the CCP can now track the Chinese people's  every movement with facial recognition. They have developed a social  credit system that ranks the likability and trustworthiness of hundreds  of millions of Chinese citizens. Using these and other technologies,  the CCP is committing genocide against their own people.   Since April 2017, the CCP has detained over 1 million leaders and  other Muslims in specially built internment camps in Xinjiang province.  These are Chinese citizens, and their own government is subjecting them  to forced sterilization, sexual abuse, forced labor, physical and  psychological torment, and political indoctrination.   This is government-sponsored ethnic cleansing, and now China is  starting to carry out this kind of state-sponsored racism and genocide  outside Xingjiang.   In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the CCP is curtailing the  use of the Mongolian language by shutting down Mongolian-language  social media websites and prohibiting schools from teaching certain  classes in Mongolian. The next steps could be similar to what we have  seen in Xinjiang.   Sadly, ethnic minorities are not the only people to find themselves  on the wrong side of the CCP's many abuses of power. Under President  Xi, China has broken its promises to the free people of Hong Kong.  Under the pretense of protecting national security, new laws have led  to the arrest of thousands of people for doing nothing more than  exercising their God-given rights.   Taken together, all these things paint a picture of a Chinese  Government that is doubling down on its communist roots and doing  whatever it takes to control its people.   None of this should surprise us. This is the same government that  forcibly sterilized its citizens as part of its one-child policy, and  gunned down thousands of students who were peacefully protesting in  Tiananmen Square.   And now they are turning their attention abroad. They are growing  more aggressive towards other countries by the day, in ways that comply  with international norms and in ways that defy those norms.   In 2013, President Xi formally launched his signature foreign policy  effort: the Belt and Road Initiative.   Through this program, China offers lucrative infrastructure  investments and economic development deals to smaller and poorer  nations. The ultimate goal is to create a global coalition that could  challenge the longstanding network of alliances and partnerships that  have been built by the United States. Since Belt and Road began, 139  countries have joined, and on every continent China is using it to  expand their power.   But here is the catch: If developing countries that welcomed these  investments want construction to continue on their new highway system  or skyscraper, or if they want access to funding for future projects,  they cannot speak out against China's actions. This is why leaders of  Muslim-majority countries who have spoken out against these crimes in  the past have suddenly fallen silent.   Just look at Turkish President Erdogan, who said China's crimes  against the Uighurs are ``a genocide, and there is no point in  interpreting this otherwise.''   He said that in 2009. Today, he won't even talk about it, and he has  ordered the police to break up protests about these atrocities in  Turkey.   Pakistan's Prime Minister, usually a champion for Muslims around the  world, has also fallen under Belt and Road's spell. In June, he refused  to answer questions about Xinjiang in an interview with Axios's  Jonathan Swan.   China's other strategies for reshaping the rules-based international  order are far less subtle. They are using the infrastructure they build  to spy on foreign leaders or even take over disputed regions in  neighboring countries.   In Ethiopia, the CCP offered to build the new headquarters of the  African Union. African Union workers soon discovered that the  building's Huawei servers had been shipping their data to Shanghai  every day for years and that the building was riddled with Chinese  surveillance devices.   This is a perfect example of China's strategy of military-civilian  fusion, or the way the CCP forces so-called ``private'' corporations  like Huawei to do their bidding.   Another example hit much closer to home. In 2016, the Chinese company  with CCP ties tried to buy a hotel in San Diego. Well, the hotel has a  view of Naval Base San Diego, the home port of the U.S. Navy's Pacific  Fleet. The deal was ultimately blocked, but the fact that such a  transparent attempt to keep an eye on our forces almost went through is  cause for serious concern.   China is also building artificial islands in the disputed South China  Sea. Many in this body will recall when, in 2015, President Xi stood  next to President Obama and he lied, saying that China does not intend  to militarize those islands. He broke his pledge within a year.   Along with this geographic expansion, President Xi is investing in  China's military. According to the Center for Strategic and  International Studies, China now spends nearly three times as much on  the People's Liberation Army as they did just 10 years ago. They now  have the world's largest navy in terms of total number of ships, a  title the U.S. held until 2 years ago.   China's navy currently numbers about 355 ships and submarines. They  have 2 aircraft carriers and at least 32 destroyers, 48 frigates, and  65 attack submarines. This is not a navy designed to protect a  coastline; this is a navy designed to project force on a global scale.   Former Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger called what  China is doing the ``largest peacetime military buildup in the modern  era, and maybe one of the largest in history.'' He said that in  response to my questions at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing  earlier in June.   And what is this new, more powerful military's highest priority?   The peaceful island of democracy, Taiwan. President Xi has been very  clear about his desire to bring Taiwan  [[Page S7780]]  under the CCP's control. The only thing stopping him is 100 miles of  ocean: the Taiwan Strait.   But the CCP's ambitions won't end with Taiwan. India, Japan, South  Korea, and many countries in the South China Sea are feeling the  effects of China's aggression in ways no one expected even a decade  ago. And to back up their global agenda, the CCP is hard at work  expanding China's nuclear arsenal.   As Admiral Richard, the commander of STRATCOM, wrote earlier this  year:         China's nuclear weapon stockpile is expected to double--if       not triple or quadruple--over the next decade.    A new report out yesterday from the Pentagon paints a worse picture.  It predicts that China could have at least 1,000 nuclear warheads by  2030, roughly five times what they have now. As part of this expansion,  China is building at least three new missile fields, each capable of  holding over 100 ICBMs. And maybe most concerning, China recently  tested an extremely sophisticated new weapons system that combines  space capabilities with advanced hypersonics. This nuclear capable  prototype could give China a unique edge over our own arsenal.   Madam President, this needs to be a wake-up call for us. We must  change our approach to China. We can't keep pretending that these  problems don't exist.   Thankfully, concern about China's rise is an area of bipartisan  consensus here in Congress. But recognizing that there is a problem is  not enough. We have to get our act together and we have to do something  about it. There are many ways for us to push back against the CCP, but,  by far, the most fundamental thing we can do to safeguard against  China's rise is to invest in our military.   The old adage ``peace through strength'' still applies today, but the  Biden administration has proposed raising defense spending by only 1.6  percent, and taking this year's inflation into account, that means we  have a proposed cut. That defies basic logic. The world is not getting  safer. Threats like China are not going away.   When we met earlier this year to review the President's budget  request and write our annual defense authorization bill, the Senate  Armed Services Committee debated defense cuts.   What was the result?   A huge bipartisan majority--25 of the 26 members--voted to authorize  an additional $25 billion in defense spending, which primarily  supported the unfunded priorities of our commanders.   This provides our military with the real budget growth necessary to  keep pace with an adversary like China. It makes critical investments  in readiness and in modernization, as well as in research and  development programs that help America keep our technological edge.   It also includes a number of specific investments that would  strengthen our force posture in the Indo-Pacific theater.   Most importantly, the bill authorizes an additional $230 million to  begin improving missile defense capabilities on Guam. Guam is a key  element of our regional presence, but it has been increasingly  threatened by China's growing arsenal. INDOPACOM commanders have warned  of this threat since 2019, and the situation has only grown direr since  then.   The resources authorized by this bill would begin to address this  threat, and by improving our defensive capabilities in the region, we  can keep conflict from beginning in the first place.   Like many of my colleagues, I am at a loss to explain why the  Democratic leader hasn't brought the NDAA to the floor. Even if we  voted on it today, this would still be one of the latest NDAA votes in  history.   So as we celebrate Veterans Day next week and consider the sacrifice  and service of America's bravest, we should all remember our  responsibility as Members of Congress, to give our military men and  women the resources they need to successfully complete the missions  that they are given. We cannot afford to delay any longer.   I yield the floor.
