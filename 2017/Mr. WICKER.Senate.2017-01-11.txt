 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join my  colleagues in expressing support for S. Con. Res. 3, the budget  resolution which, as most Americans now know, is the vehicle we will  use to begin the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare.   This is a matter of keeping our word to the American people. This is  a matter of keeping our promises that we have made, not only during the  last campaign cycle but repeatedly since I voted against this bill some  8 years ago. It was enacted in January of 2010.   Republicans on this side of the aisle and many Americans repeatedly  opposed the ObamaCare expansion of Federal power. We said it wouldn't  work. We said the President would not be able to keep his promises to  the American people and when we got a chance to go back into the  majority, we would repeal that act. On this side of the aisle, this is  a followup on years and years of determination on our part to right  this wrong, to keep our promises, and come up with a better plan to  help Americans have coverage they can afford and a doctor they can  keep.   I intend to support the chairman of the Budget Committee in the votes  we will have today and tonight. We have what some people call the vote- arama tonight. A number of votes will be taken in rapid succession, and  we don't know how many will actually be offered by our friends on the  other side of the aisle. I believe I will be able to vote against all  of these amendments because I think keeping a clean bill makes it more  likely we will be able to pass this legislation, send it to over to the  House of Representatives where it can be tweaked but passed and get  back to us for final approval, and actually get a bill to President- elect Trump after he takes office, repealing ObamaCare so we can  replace it with something that works.   This is our opportunity to keep our campaign promise. This is our  opportunity to help the President-elect and the Vice President-elect  keep their campaign promises and show to the American people that  elections have consequences and that at least this group of public  officials intends to keep our word with regard to this piece of  legislation. It was well intended, no doubt, but it could not possibly  have worked to do the things that President Obama said it could do.   In 2009 and 2010, the President told us: If you like your health  plan, you get to keep it. It turns out that is a promise that was not  kept because it could not be kept.   The President said: If you like your doctor, you can keep that  doctor. Again, this is a promise this administration and our Democratic  friends on the other side of the aisle were unable to keep. That is why  so many people around the country are opposed to keeping ObamaCare.  They want it to be repealed. They want a drastically different approach  involving market principles to be put in its place so it will work for  patients and work for the American people.   ObamaCare is not working. It is not working in my home State of  Mississippi. It is not working for millions of Americans who lost their  health insurance. It is it is not working for millions of Americans who  saw their premiums rise and their deductibles go to unimaginable  heights.   Of course, I know the Presiding Officer and I have heard from  constituents at home, and I am going to take this opportunity to share  with you some of the views I have heard from people in Mississippi who  are looking to us in the House and in the Senate to rectify this  situation with regard to this disastrous piece of legislation.   A 62-year-old individual from Madison, MS, wrote to me saying:         Please explain the term ``affordable'' in the Affordable       Care Act. . . . I recently went to Healthcare.gov to look at       possible health insurance plans. . . . The estimates range       from over $18,000 to over $26,000 per year. That is anywhere       from 13.5% to 18.6% of our gross salary. So forget about       saving for retirement. The system is flawed.    Another Mississippian wrote to me:         I have read in many publications about the increases in       premiums for ObamaCare, but that is actually a moot point       when the only insurance . . . that my doctor and my wife's       doctor will take is PULLING out (of the exchange) leaving my       wife with no choice but to possibly return to work just for       the insurance.    A third constituent from Saltillo, MS, wrote:         I just applied at the market place for health insurance. My       quote was $415 monthly with a deductible of $6850. I work       less than 30 hours a week in retail. There is no way that I       can afford that.    This constituent from Saltillo goes on to say:         What am I supposed to do? I have a car payment and I need       to eat.    Well, I think help is on the way. The action we are going to take  this week in sending this resolution over to the House of  Representatives is a form of keeping our promise and providing  assistance to this constituent of mine.   These stories go on and on. For a woman in Gulfport whose husband  lost his job, the cheapest plan in the ObamaCare exchange was $1,042  with a $13,000 deductible. This constituent calls ObamaCare ``legalized  extortion.''   A 60-year-old constituent was understandably upset when his insurance  went up by $113 a month. He then noticed that coverage he didn't  request had been added to his policy without wanting it or needing it.  Pediatric dentistry and birth control were required on this plan, two  things neither he nor his wife want to use or want to pay for.   So I want to remind my colleagues that ObamaCare is hurting  individuals--individuals who have written to me, and individuals who  have written to all of my colleagues, but it is also hurting small  businesses in Mississippi and small businesses in Pennsylvania and  around the country. I would remind my colleagues that most jobs in the  United States are created not by large corporations, not by the big- ticket manufacturing plants that come into our States and districts  that we like to have, but by small businesses--businesses of under 200  people.   A small business owner in South Mississippi wrote to me. Following  her husband's retirement, she had to find health care through the  exchange. Her county borders Louisiana, and many Mississippians travel  across State lines for work. The health care network that she has used  for 20 years is no longer an option for her because ObamaCare policies  do not allow beneficiaries to use networks in different States. That is  also something we need to address when we finally put in place the  replacement portion of this mechanism.   The plan for this nonsmoker, with no preexisting conditions, under  the exchange cost her $900 a month in premiums and she was not able to  keep her doctor.   It is not just constituents in my more or less Republican State,  among my more or less Republican constituents in the State of  Mississippi who are telling the truth about ObamaCare. I want to quote  Bill Clinton, speaking on behalf of his wife in Flint, MI, on October 4  of last year. Former President Bill Clinton said this:         You've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25       million more people have health care, and then the people who       are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up       with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.       It is the craziest thing in the world.    President Bill Clinton said that just last year in Flint, MI.   I think if we come to grips with this, we will admit that this is a  crazy system. It was well intended by some of my Democratic friends but  one that has failed; one that has failed the American people and one  that has failed to keep the promises that were solidly made when the  bill was rammed through on a strictly partisan basis. Every Democrat  was supporting it. No Republicans were supporting it at all.  [[Page S243]]  There was no Republican input, no bipartisan input on overhauling one  of the most significant systems in our country.   It is time for us to move forward, and tonight is a step forward. We  certainly aren't going to get it all done in one fell swoop, and even  when we get the bill signed into law by our new President Donald Trump,  it will take a while for it to be put into place. Tonight we show that  we meant what we said and we said what we meant, and we are going to  follow through. We are going to pass this resolution tonight and begin  the process of keeping our promises to the American people to repeal  ObamaCare and replace it with something that works for the millions and  hundreds of millions of Americans out there who depend on us for good  policy.   Seeing no other Members seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of  a quorum.
