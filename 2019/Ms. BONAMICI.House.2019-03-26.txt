 Madam Speaker, climate change is not a distant threat;  it is reality. In the Pacific Northwest, our families and communities  are facing acidic oceans; unhealthy, smoky air; decreased snowpack;  droughts; and extreme weather patterns.   Recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and  the U.S. Global Change Research Program make clear: human activity is  contributing to climate change. The science supporting these reports is  convincing and alarming, but there is hope. We have the opportunity  and, in fact, the imperative to take action that will protect our  planet and grow our economy.   I am honored to serve on the House Select Committee on the Climate  Crisis, and I will work with my colleagues to reduce emissions, to  transition to 100 percent clean energy, to create good-paying jobs,  rebuild our Nation's infrastructure in a sustainable and resilient  manner, invest in clean and efficient transportation systems, and  support frontline communities, particularly communities of color and  low-income communities, that have often faced a disproportionate share  of the burden of our past inaction.   The future of our planet and the health of our communities depend on  the actions we take today. For our children, our grandchildren, and  future generations to come, let's not wait.                            ____________________
