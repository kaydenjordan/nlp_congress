 Mr. Speaker, I listened to people on the other  side. This is a good rule. I want to compliment the Rules Committee.   It is crucially important to recognize that this is an issue that  means lives: 19 people have died out of that community of King Cove-- mothers, children, husbands, brothers, uncles, and aunts--because they  didn't have a road.   We passed legislation similar to this in 2009 that granted a land  exchange--and was a massive land exchange--of 43,000 acres for 260  acres from the State of Alaska to construct this road. I think that is  a fair exchange for an 11-mile road--single lane, gravel covered--just  so they have access to save lives.   Those who speak against it have never experienced the wind that howls  through that area when you try to land a plane or take off, you have a  sick person with you, and you crash. Or go across the bay when waves  are 30 feet high, and the evacuation of those ill people to an area  that is only 11 miles away on an unfinished road and they die. Human  beings, Alaskan constituents, that have medical aid only 600 miles away  and stopped by 11 miles that is not allowed because supposedly there is  a better way. And there is no  [[Page H5994]]  better way than a road in the weather condition I am speaking of.   When you think about it, I often listen to the other side of the  aisle in voting against something like this, yet they will defend the  right to save certain animals, but they don't want to save human life.  That is wrong.   This is a good project. It should be built. I am hoping this body  recognizes that lives are important and recognize the fact that this  road doesn't disturb any of the wildlife. It is ironic that they will  say it is going to disturb the geese that live off of eelgrass. The  closest road that comes to this one bay is 11 miles away--11 miles. And  the same area as this wildlife range has miles of road in it already,  miles of road already in place. One of those roads already in place  goes right by the lagoon where the tourists go watch the geese.   Now, why can't a tourist go by an area and watch the geese and it  doesn't disturb them, but if someone is sick, dying, in a bus,  ambulance, car, or truck, that is going to disturb the geese?   This is a nonsense argument by environmental communities around this  Nation that want to put a stop to anything that benefits mankind and  save the wildlife, say from New York or San Francisco, and don't know  what they are talking about.                                time  1300    My job is to protect my people. This is not going to cost the  taxpayers a nickel. This is going to be a project that is well done,  and it will not disturb the wildlife they are so-called trying to  protect.   So I ask my colleagues on this floor to think about humanity. Think  about that person, be it your mother, your daughter, your son, your  aunt, your uncle, your brother, and you would want to see them die  because they are trying to protect a goose?   Shame on you. Shame on those who vote against this bill, saying: This  is more important--I live in New York or California. This goose is more  important than human life.   I think it is time we use a little sense in this body, a little  understanding. Let's build this road. Let's pass this bill.
