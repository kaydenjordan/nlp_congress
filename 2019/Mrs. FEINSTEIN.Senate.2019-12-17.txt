 Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues, Senators  Grassley, Capito, and Durbin to introduce the Preventing Pill Mills  Through Data Sharing Act.   Millions of pills flooded small communities throughout the Nation to  fuel the opioid epidemic we are facing today.   Despite the fact that opioid manufacturers and distributors were  required to keep complete and accurate records relating to the sale,  delivery, or disposal of opioids through the Automated Reports and  Consolidated Ordering System, often referred to as ARCOS, and to detect  and disclose suspicious orders of opioids to the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA), these substances still reached our streets.   That is why my colleagues and I previously introduced the ``Using  Data to Prevent Opioid Diversion Act,'' which was enacted as part of  the ``SUPPORT Act'' in 2018. As a result of that law, DEA is now  required to provide to opioid manufacturers and distributors anonymized  information related to the number of distributors serving a single  pharmacy or practitioner, and the quantity and type of opioids being  delivered to each.   This information, coupied with the internal controls that these  companies already use in their efforts to determine the legitimacy of  opioid orders, is assisting manufacturers and distributors in their  efforts to better prevent these substances from being diverted to  someone other than the intended recipient who has a lawful  prescription.   That law also strengthened accountability by establishing civil and  criminal fines for drug manufacturers and distributors who fail to  consider ARCOS data when determining whether an order for opioids is  suspicious. Additionally, it increased existing civil fines for drug  manufacturers and distributors who fail to report suspicious orders and  keep accurate records ten-fold, and doubled existing criminal fines.   Finally, our legislation required the United States Attorney General  to share standardized reports with state officials, including  regulatory, licensing, attorneys general, and law enforcement agencies,  related to the distribution patterns collected by the ARCOS database on  a semi-annual basis.   This law has ensured that opioid manufacturers and distributors have  a clear picture of how many pills are going to each pharmacy, thereby  helping to eradicate pill mills.   To strengthen this law, my colleagues and I are introducing the  ``Preventing Pill Mills Through Data Sharing Act.'' This new  legislation is largely based on recommendations included in the October  2019 U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the Inspector General  (OIG) report related to the DEA's response to the opioid epidemic.   In that report, the DOJ OIG noted two shortcomings associated with  the ARCOS system. First, not all registrants input data into the ARCOS  system at the same intervals.   While both opioid manufacturers and distributors are required to  input data on a quarterly basis, manufacturers often input the data  monthly, while distributors do so quarterly. This means that when the  DEA provides the quarterly reports that drug manufacturers and  distributors must use to determine whether orders are suspicious, they  don't have the most up to date information. Our legislation addresses  this problem by requiring all registrants to input data on a monthly  basis.   Second, the database only captures information for Schedule I and II  drugs. As a result, addictive drugs in other schedules, which are also  diverted, are not captured. This includes nine combination opioid  products.   For this reason, our legislation expands the reporting requirements  to include controlled substances in all schedules. Our legislation also  closes an existing loophole.   The DEA has informed my staff that, under current law, one pharmacy  is able to transfer up to five percent of its inventory of controlled  substances to another pharmacy without having to immediately report to  the DEA.   Because these transfers are not automatically reported to the DEA  through the ARCOS system, it creates a blind spot for the DEA, as well  as for drug manufacturers and distributors who are required to consider  data from the anonymized reports generated from the ARCOS database when  determining whether an order for controlled substances is suspicious.   Moreover, because pharmacies are not currently required to check the  ARCOS reports provided by DEA before transferring a controlled  substance to another pharmacy, they could be inadvertently supplying a  pharmacy with excess amounts of pills that could easily end up on the  black market.   That is why our legislation applies the same reporting requirements  and penalties to pharmacies transferring controlled substances, except  in the limited circumstance of a transfer made for a specific patient  need, as those that are applied to drug manufacturers and distributors.   In 2018, we lost almost 70,000 individuals to drug overdose deaths in  our country. Nearly 48,000 of these were opioid-related.   Drug manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies all play a critical  role in preventing future overdose deaths.   The ``Using Data to Prevent Opioid Diversion Act'' has been  successful.   The ``Preventing Pill Mills Through Data Sharing Act'' builds on that  success and will close existing loopholes in order reduce the diversion  of controlled substances that are contributing to the massive number of  overdose deaths in the United States.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to  its passage.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Duckworth,  [[Page S7117]]          Mr. Leahy, Ms. Harris, and Mr. Brown):   S. 3071. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and  title 5, United States Code, to permit leave to care for a domestic  partner, parent-in-law, or adult child, or another related individual,  who has a serious health condition, and to allow employees to take, as  additional leave, parental involvement and family wellness leave to  participate in or attend their children's and grandchildren's  educational and extracurricular activities or meet family care needs;  to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
