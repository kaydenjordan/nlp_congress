 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are coming up on a year of Democratic  governance here in Washington, and what do Democrats have to show for  it? Nothing good.   On the international front, the President's most significant act was  his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, which lowered our standing  with our allies and continues to jeopardize our national security.   On the domestic front, Democrats have largely ignored a massive  crisis along our southern border that continues to rage because they  can't take on the open borders left in their own political party.   Look at what is happening with the supply chain. There are 90  containers sitting at the port at Long Beach waiting to get into the  country, and the President and his team can't really do anything about  it because they are unwilling to take on the Teamsters.   If you look at our cities, homicides are up in all of our major  cities across this country. It seems that perhaps a ``defund the  police'' approach to communities' safety isn't something that sends the  right signal to people who want to break our laws.   Then there is inflation. You might call it the Democrats' signature  domestic achievement.   So how did we get here? How did they get us here? Well, despite their  lack of a mandate and their extremely narrow majorities in Congress,  Democrats came into office last January determined to expand government  and implement a far-left, Big Government, socialist agenda. In their  minds, the coronavirus crisis provided the perfect opportunity to  advance their plans.   So despite the fact that Congress had just passed--just passed--a  nearly $1 trillion bipartisan coronavirus response bill in December-- the fifth, I might add, the fifth bipartisan bill Congress had passed  in just 10 months--Democrats declared that we immediately needed  another piece of ostensibly coronavirus relief legislation--and not  just another piece of legislation, a massive piece of legislation.   Despite the fact that the December bill had met essentially all of  the pressing coronavirus needs the country was facing, Democrats  decided that we needed to spend another $1.9 trillion. Democrats were  warned that the size of their so-called American Rescue Plan, which was  substantially in excess of anything the economy required, ran the risk  of spurring inflation.   Obama economic adviser Larry Summers warned in the Washington Post:         There is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale       closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels       will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not       seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the       dollar and financial stability.    That, again, was Obama economic adviser Larry Summers.   Well, Democrats passed their bill anyway. They flooded the economy  with a lot of unnecessary government money, and the results have been  predictable. Inflation. Significant inflation. Inflation, to borrow a  phrase from Larry Summers, ``of a kind we have not seen in a  generation.''   Last week, we found out that inflation rose 6.2 percent last year in  a year-over-year analysis, the largest increase in more than 30 years-- 30 years.   Families are facing higher prices at the grocery store. And when I  say ``higher,'' I mean a lot higher. The price of meat, poultry, fish,  and eggs was up 11.9 percent year over year in October--11.9 percent.  Families are also facing higher prices at the gas pump, for housing,  for electricity, for furniture and vehicles and pets and pet products,  and the list goes on.   While wages are rising, they are being outstripped by inflation,  which means that many families are dealing with a de facto pay cut.  Think about it--6.2 percent increase in inflation. That is essentially  a 6.2-percent pay cut for American families.   A big reason families are struggling with the higher cost of pretty  much everything is Democrats' decision to flood the economy with  unnecessary government money by passing the so-called American Rescue  Plan. You don't have to take my word for it; I quoted Larry Summers  earlier.   Here is what former Obama economic adviser Jason Furman had to say  recently when discussing our current inflation problem:         The original sin was an oversized American Rescue Plan. It       contributed to both higher output but also higher prices.    Now, you might think that the inflation that has resulted from the  American Rescue Plan would be giving Democrats pause right now. You  might think that they would be putting a hold, you know, tapping the  brakes a little bit on any more big spending until inflation calms down  somewhat from its 30-plus-year high. But you would be wrong. Democrats  are actually planning to double down on the strategy that helped cause  so much inflation in the first place and pass another giant spending  bill.   That is right.   Democrats are trying to finalize a new $1.75 trillion tax-and- spending spree, the so-called Build Back Better plan--on top of their  $1.9 trillion spending spree from earlier this year.   I say $1.75 trillion, but Democrats only arrived at that number  through a combination of shell games and budget gimmicks. An honest  accounting of the cost of this proposal over 10 years would reveal a  much higher pricetag--some analyses and assessments suggest as high as  $4 trillion or more.   And if Democrats succeed in passing this latest partisan spending  spree, Americans should brace themselves because this new flood of  government money will undoubtedly make an already serious inflation  situation much worse.   It is no exaggeration to say that Democrats' main focus this year has  been growing the size of the Federal Government and expanding its reach  into Americans' lives. No sooner had they passed their massive $1.9  trillion spending bill in March, then the Democrats moved on to their  next massive spending proposals which have been coalesced into the so- called Build Back Better bill the House is planning to take up later  this week.   Other government business has been forced to take a backseat.  Democrats have ignored, as I said earlier, the massive--massive--crisis  at our southern border. They have ignored our inflation crisis. And  they have pushed consideration of essential legislation in favor of  working on their tax-and-spending plan.   This week, the Senate will finally--and I say finally--consider the  fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, a month and a half  after the 2022 fiscal year has started. Shipbuilding projects, military  infrastructure projects, development of new combat systems, a pay  increase for our troops, they have all had to wait--all had to wait-- while Democrats negotiated over their Big Government socialist spending  spree.   And about that socialist spending spree, despite the fact that  Democrats have pushed aside most other matters in favor of focusing on  their spending plan, they still haven't managed to come up with a bill  that can pass the House and the Senate.   And the tax proposals they plan to use to--and I say partially-- partially pay for the bill seem to change on a daily basis. And I say  partially because, again, a great independent analysis from places like  Penn Wharton suggest that the revenue that they would raise to pay for  all the spending in the bill would fall somewhere between $2 and $2.5  trillion short of the  [[Page S8219]]  cost of the bill. That is $2 to $2.5 trillion that would be added to  the already $30 trillion national debt.   Let's just say, for example, that these ideas they have to partially  pay for this bill seem to change on a daily basis. A corporate tax  hike? No, let's change it to a corporate minimum tax. A new death tax?  No, let's change it to a new tax on wealth--something we have never  talked about before in this country, taxing unrealized gains. That is  taxing income before people have actually seen the income--the realized  income.   Funding for their bill seems to be a matter of throwing spaghetti at  the wall on a daily basis to try and see what sticks. There isn't a day  that went by in the last couple of weeks, when we were in session the  week before last, where there wasn't another horrible idea that came  from that side of how to raise revenue to finance this massive,  reckless, and radical spending bill. And of course all of Democrats'  current funding proposals put together will not be able to pay for  their legislation, especially when you remove, as I said earlier, the  budget gimmicks that are disguising the true cost of their plans.   As their narrow majorities made clear, the 2020 election did not give  Democrats a mandate for Big Government socialism. And if that wasn't  clear to Democrats in 2020, it should certainly be clear to them now  after the election for the Virginia Governor this month, which saw  Republicans win statewide for the first time since 2009. Voters in  Virginia sent a clear message to Democrats that they weren't looking  for far-left government or a far-left social agenda that would seek to  circumvent parents' role in their children's lives and education. But  just as inflation concerns have not stopped Democrats, it has become  clear that their rebuke in Virginia won't stop them either. In fact,  some Democrats seem to think that their response should be to run  faster and further to the left.   So the big agenda item for Democrats for the rest of the year  continues to be passing their partisan Build Back Better tax-and- spending spree, which means Americans will be able to look forward to  further inflation and a weaker economy, not to mention increased  government control of their decision making.   It is a poor legacy for Democrats' first year in office, but it seems  to be the legacy Democrats are determined to secure.   I yield the floor.
