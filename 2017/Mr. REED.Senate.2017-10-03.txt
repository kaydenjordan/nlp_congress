 Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Corporate  Management Accountability Act, which request each publicly traded  company to disclose its policies on whether senior executives or  shareholders bear the costs of paying the company's fines and  penalties.   In 2014, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,  William Dudley, gave a speech on Enhancing Financial Stability by  Improving Culture in the Financial Services Industry. In this speech,  President Dudley said, ``in recent years, there have been ongoing  occurrences of serious professional misbehavior, ethical lapses and  compliance failures at financial institutions. This has resulted in a  long list of large fines and penalties, and, to a lesser degree than I  would have desired employee dismissals and punishment. . . . The  pattern of bad behavior did not end with the financial crisis, but  continued despite the considerable public sector intervention that was  necessary to stabilize the financial system. As a consequence, the  financial industry has largely lost the public trust.''   Since 2008, ``banks globally have paid $321 billion in fines . . .  for an abundance of regulatory failings from money laundering to market  manipulation and terrorist financing, according to data from Boston  Consulting Group.'' Unfortunately, despite these fines, we continue to  see disappointing behavior at our financial institutions, whether it is  Wells Fargo betraying the trust of its customers by opening  unauthorized accounts or it is Equifax endangering millions of  consumers by compromising critical personal information. Indeed, in my  home State of Rhode Island, nearly half the State may have been  affected by the cybersecurity breach at Equifax. Given these and other  breaches and lapses, it is clear that many financial institutions have  a long way to go in rebuilding the trust of Rhode Islanders and the  American people.   At the same time, it is also clear that more must be done than simply  fining and penalizing financial institutions at the corporate level.  Senior executives, many of whom are all too eager to take credit for a  company's good news, must also take more responsibility for the bad  news, especially if it is true that the buck stops with them. For  example, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded ``the  financial crisis reached cataclysmic proportions with the collapse of  Lehman Brothers,'' and yet, according to the Congressional Research  Service, not a single senior executive officer at Lehman Brothers at  the Federal level was charged, went to jail, or personally paid a  Federal fine or penalty for the damage caused at Lehman Brothers that  rippled through our economy in 2008.   According to Professor Peter J. Henning, who also writes for the New  York Times in its White Collar Watch column, ``a problem in holding  individuals accountable for misconduct in an organization is the  disconnect between the actual decisions and those charged with  overseeing the company, so that executives and corporate boards usually  plead ignorance about an issue until it is too late.''   The Corporate Management Accountability Act I am introducing today is  one attempt at helping to solve this problem. The bill asks publicly  traded companies to disclose whether they expect senior executives or  shareholders to pay the cost of corporate fines or penalties. This  approach is supported by University of Minnesota Law School Professors  Claire Hill and Richard Painter, who also served as President George W.  Bush's chief ethics lawyer, as well as U.S. PIRG, Public Citizen, and  Americans for Financial Reform.   Companies must do a better job of aligning executive incentives so  that they are motivated to put their shareholders, and not themselves,  first. I urge all my colleagues to join this legislative effort to hold  senior executives accountable for their actions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Corporate  Management Accountability Act, which request each publicly traded  company to disclose its policies on whether senior executives or  shareholders bear the costs of paying the company's fines and  penalties.
