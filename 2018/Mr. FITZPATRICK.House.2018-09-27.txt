 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a small  business in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that was recently  recognized by the Lansdale Economic Development Committee as Business  of the Month.   Otherwise Gifts, located on Green Street, has been a fixture in  Lansdale since its opening in 1979. Owner John Otherwise describes his  shop as containing unique gifts for everyone. Indeed, Otherwise Gifts  sells everything from antiques, woodworking items, lamps, furniture,  and nearly everything else John believes would help beautify Lansdale  community homes.   A Philadelphia native, John previously worked in construction and in  the nuclear industry before deciding to follow his passion and open his  own store. At age 77, John continues to offer unique experiences and  gifts to citizens of Montgomery County and throughout the region.   I wish John and his wife, Cynthia, all of the best, and I send my  congratulations to Otherwise Gifts on being named Lansdale's Business  of the Month.               Recognizing Mary, Mother of the Redeemer School     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a school in  Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that plays a tremendous role in the  development of our youngest citizens.   Mary, Mother of the Redeemer School in North Wales has provided  educational growth and spiritual guidance since 2003. While the parish  community has existed since the church was established in 1987, it is a  testament to MMR's parishioners' devotion to their faith and community  that a school was ultimately established. It also comes as no surprise  that this school has some remarkable achievements.   MMR is a nationally ranked Blue Ribbon, School of Excellence, a  recognition of exceptional academic achievement bestowed by the U.S.  Department of Education. Earning this award despite its mere 15 years  in existence demonstrates the future is tremendously bright for this  amazing school.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mary, Mother of the Redeemer School Principal  Denise Judge and all faculty, staff, and parents for facilitating such  a wonderful community school. We are grateful for your presence in our  community, and we wish you all the best.                Recognizing Montgomeryville Elementary School     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a school in  Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that plays a pivotal role in the  development of our community's youth.   Montgomeryville Elementary, located in North Wales, is known for  instilling in its students the value of academic success and the  virtues of acceptance and appreciation. These ideas are ultimately  culminated into the school's motto: ``Dream big. Achieve greatness.''   Last year, Montgomery Elementary was ranked the 48th best elementary  school in the State of Pennsylvania. This is no small feat, especially  given that Pennsylvania contains over 4,000 elementary schools.   These noteworthy milestones would not be made possible without the  assistance of a dedicated staff and school community. I am especially  grateful for the leadership of principal TJ Seidenberger, who has given  Montgomery Elementary the tools they need to thrive and succeed since  he took the helm at the school.   We thank Montgomery Elementary for all they do for our community, and  we wish them continued success in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise  today with my colleagues to honor the life and the memory of Connor  Bednarzyk, who tragically passed away on September 7 in an armored  vehicle accident near Fort Benning, Georgia. Connor was 25 years old.   Captain Bednarzyk grew up in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, where, even at  a young age, he demonstrated superb leadership. A 2011 graduate of  Central Bucks East High School, where he lettered in football,  baseball, and wrestling, he went on to attend Penn State University on  an ROTC scholarship. He graduated with a degree in security risk  analysis, graduating in the top 10 percent of ROTC graduates in the  entire United States.   An Army Ranger, Captain Bednarzyk was assigned to the 3rd Battalion,  75th Ranger Regiment, at Fort Benning. In his time in the Army, he was  awarded the Ranger Tab, the Air Assault Badge, the Army Parachutist  Badge, and the Expert Infantryman's Badge.   He previously deployed to Kosovo, where he conducted training  exercises and led U.S. troops on a peacekeeping mission with NATO  forces and local military.   Captain Bednarzyk is an American hero. While his life was tragically  cut short, his service to our community and to our Nation will forever  live on. His courage and his determination to succeed are truly  inspirational.   We send our deepest condolences to Captain Bednarzyk's parents, Casey  and Ruth, along with his brother Kevin and grandfather Francis.   Thank you for sharing his life with us.   Rangers lead the way. Connor Bednarzyk led the way.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence for an  American hero, Connor Bednarzyk.                            ____________________
