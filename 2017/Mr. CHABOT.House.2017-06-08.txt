 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a beloved Warren  County, Ohio, icon, Leslie Spaeth, who passed away recently at the age  of 92.   Mr. Spaeth was a dedicated husband and father and grandfather and  great-grandfather. What made him so special was his dedication, not  only to his family, but also to his community and to his country.   Leslie Spaeth first served his Nation as a corporal during World War  II.   Throughout his life, he continued to serve our community as a  volunteer firefighter, as president of the Mason Council, as Warren  County Auditor, as a member of the Warren County Board of Elections,  and, finally, as the Warren County chairman of the Republican Party.   In his personal time, he bettered the lives of those around him,  volunteering  [[Page H4716]]  with the American Legion's Buckeye Boys State program and as an elder  at his church.   Mr. Speaker, Leslie Spaeth was a patriot and a family man, and it has  been my honor to represent him in Congress since Warren County came  into my congressional district. I wish his family my sincere  condolences as we say good-bye to one of our finest.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 10, the Financial  CHOICE Act, and I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership  on this important issue.   For the last 7 years, Dodd-Frank has blocked small businesses from  getting the capital they need to grow and create more jobs. As chairman  of the Small Business Committee, it is no surprise that small  businesses from all across the country tell me over and over again that  this blocking of capital to them by Dodd-Frank is preventing them from  creating more jobs which are needed in this country.   Whether to pay employees or to buy new equipment, we need to make it  easier for small-business owners to gain access to capital. H.R. 10 is  chock-full of real reforms, including the Helping Angels Lead Our  Startups, or HALOS, Act to encourage and inspire entrepreneurs across  the country.   The Nation's 29 million small businesses are working hard to achieve  the American Dream. Let's not let our own government continue to stand  in their way. Support this legislation. It is very important.
