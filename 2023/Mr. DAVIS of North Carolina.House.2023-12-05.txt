 Mr. Speaker, to help bring families  closure, Honor and Remember, Incorporated, strives to provide  personalized flags to surviving loved ones.   North Carolina's chapter of Honor and Remember recently paid special  tribute to the families of Captain Jeb Franklin Seagle, Corporal Loren  Melton, Specialist Jose Melendez, Jr., and Specialist Austin Monk.  These names are of brave souls who loved our country.   The presentation of the Honor and Remember flag represents the  profound sacrifices made by those killed while serving our country and  the enduring pain their families bear.   That is why I introduced the bipartisan H.R. 4109, the Honor and  Remember Flag Recognition Act of 2023, legislation already adopted in  27 States, demonstrating deep appreciation for our servicemembers who  have died in the line of duty.   Mr. Speaker, a call for the passage of H.R. 4109. Let us honor and  remember.                            ____________________
