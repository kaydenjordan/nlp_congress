 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National  Dairy Month this June and recognize the incredible work that is done by  small dairy farms in Pennsylvania, I am reminded of the words written  by Rick Harvey: ``And on the eighth day, God looked down on his planned  paradise and said, `I need a caretaker.' So God made a farmer. God  said, `I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, milk cows, work  all day in the fields, milk cows again . . . then go to town and stay  up past midnight at a meeting of the school board.' So God made a  farmer.''   In Congress, I am proud to represent the incredible dairy farmers of  Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District who operate our farms and  work to provide the milk, the butter, the yogurt, and the ice cream  that Americans eat each and every day.   As a doctor, I have seen firsthand the advantages that providing  whole milk has for our Nation's young people. The nutrients, the  vitamins, that milk provides are essential to the development of  healthy brain tissue, healthy bones, and healthy muscles. That is why  it is so important that we once again have whole milk back in schools  in the cafeterias so our students can have this each and every day.   This June, as we celebrate National Dairy Month, let's remember and  let's thank our farmers who do so much to support our health, our  nutrition, our Nation, and each and every one of us.                            Stop Runaway Spending     Mr. Speaker, right now, American families  are facing higher prices and supply chain shortages in our Nation's  grocery stores.   Right now, the cost of beef is up 10 percent from last year. The cost  of bacon is up 15 percent. The cost of oranges is up 16 percent.  Chicken is up 19 percent. The cost of eggs is up more than 30 percent.   Last week, I spoke to a mother in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, who told  me that she was still unable to find baby food on store shelves. When  she could, that price had shot up nearly 15 percent.   These price hikes are unsustainable, and as prices are rising faster  than wages, families doing their grocery shopping are forced to make  hard decisions about what they can buy and what they can provide for  their families.   Inflation is a tax on all Americans, and the skyrocketing costs that  we are seeing right now are a direct result of President Biden's failed  policies, policies that pumped trillions of dollars into our economy  without a second thought about what that money would do to Pennsylvania  families in my district.   It is time to stop this runaway spending, and it is time to get our  economy moving once again.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, last week, I heard from a  woman in my district who told me about the direct impact that rising  energy prices are having on her family. This year, her energy bill will  climb from $135 to $398 a month.   This constituent is not alone, and because of this record-setting  inflation, two-thirds of Americans have been forced to use their  savings just to pay for everyday expenses.   With gas now costing more than $5 a gallon, with diesel costs up  nearly 70 percent higher than they were a year ago, it is Pennsylvania  families who are now paying the price for President Biden's failed  energy policies.   Instead of using American energy, President Biden is preparing to  travel to Saudi Arabia in an attempt to bring more foreign oil into our  markets here in America.   Americans cannot afford these record-setting prices, and we cannot  afford to allow the Biden administration to continue its war on  American energy.                            ____________________
