 Mr. Speaker, President Trump promised to drain the swamp,  but the Financial Times reports his pay-to-play scheme catering to  Chinese investors sure looks like he is in the swamp.   Vox reports this week President Trump has a direct financial interest  in a major real estate development project essentially underwritten by  a state-owned Chinese bank in Indonesia called Lido City and secured a  $500 million loan from the Metallurgical Corporation of China, billing  it as Asia's first Trump community, featuring a resort golf course,  condominiums, and private villas.   According to the Financial Times, the President and the Republican  Party are soon to host a $150,000-a-plate dinner in Dallas, where a  Chinese-owned bank is now encouraging its top investors to attend so  they can get face time with the President and key members of his team  at $150,000 a plate.   Meanwhile, the American workers still don't know what is in President  Trump's trade deal to increase Chinese purchases of American goods, but  we do know we need a guard dog to protect American economic and  security interests from the President's apparent conflict of interest  on his personal dealings, not in the national interest.                            ____________________
