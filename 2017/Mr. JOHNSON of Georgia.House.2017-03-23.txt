 Mr. Speaker, today the Republicans are doing  something that goes against what was promised in the campaign, and that  was that everyone would have insurance, the insurance would be better,  and it would cost less. But, instead, we are going in the opposite  direction. Less people are going to have insurance; 24 million are  being kicked off. It is going to cost more for the insurance, and you  are going to get less insurance coverage than what you are paying for.  It is a total disaster what they are trying to do here.   Today, they are going to meet with the Freedom Caucus at 11:30, I  understand, over at the White House. So the bill is going to get worse.  Can you imagine that?   If you have got fooled the first time, don't get fooled again. If  someone tells you something that you know is not true or that you  thought was true and you find out it is not true, don't fall for it  again, Members. It is time for change in America.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article from today's New  York Times titled, ``Late GOP Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover  Aromatherapy But Not Chemotherapy.''                  [From the New York Times, Mar. 23, 2017]   Late G.O.P. Proposal Could Mean Plans That Cover Aromatherapy But Not                                Chemotherapy                          (By Margot Sanger-Katz)         Most Republicans in Congress prefer the type of health       insurance market in which everyone could ``choose the plan       that's right for them.''        Why should a 60-year-old man have to buy a plan that       includes maternity benefits he'll never use? (This is an       example that comes up a lot.) In contrast, the Affordable       Care Act includes a list of benefits that have to be in every       plan, a reality that makes insurance comprehensive, but often       costly.        Now, a group of conservative House members is trying to cut       a deal to get those benefit requirements eliminated as part       of the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act       moving through Congress. (The vote in the House is expected       later today.)        At first glance, this may sound like a wonderful policy.       Why should that 60-year-old man have to pay for maternity       benefits he will never use? If 60-year-old men don't need to       pay for benefits they won't use, the price of insurance will       come down, and more people will be able to afford that       coverage, the thinking goes. And people who want fancy       coverage with extra benefits can just pay a little more for       the plan that's right for them.        But there are two main problems with stripping away minimum       benefit rules. One is that the meaning of ``health       insurance'' can start to become a little murky. The second is       that, in a world in which no one has to offer maternity       coverage, no insurance company wants to be the only one that       offers it.        Here is the list of Essential Health Benefits that are       required under the Affordable Care Act:        Ambulatory patient services (doctor's visits)        Emergency services        Hospitalization        Maternity and newborn care        Mental health and substance abuse disorder services,       including behavioral health treatment        Prescription drugs        Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices        Laboratory services        Preventive and wellness services, and chronic disease       management        Pediatric services, including oral and vision care        The list reflects some lobbying of the members of Congress       who wrote it. You may notice that dental services are       required for children, but not adults, for example. But over       all, the list was developed to make insurance for people who       buy their own coverage look, roughly, like the kind of       coverage people get through their employer. A plan without       prescription drug coverage would probably be cheaper than one       that covers it, but most people wouldn't think of that plan       as very good insurance for people who have health care needs.        Under the Republican plan, the government would give people       who buy their own insurance money to help them pay for it. A       20-year-old who doesn't get coverage from work or the       government, for example, would get $2,000. If the essential       health benefits go away, insurance companies would be allowed       to sell health plans that don't cover, say, hospital care.       Federal money would help buy these plans.        But history illustrates a potential problem.        In the 1990s, Congress created a tax credit that helped       low-income people buy insurance for their children. Quickly,       it became clear that unscrupulous entrepreneurs were creating       cheap products that weren't very useful, and marketing them       to people eligible for the credit. Congress quickly repealed       the provision after investigations from the Government       Accountability Office and the Ways and Means Committee       uncovered fraud.        Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management at the       Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who tends       to favor market solutions in health care, said that while the       Obamacare rules are ``paternalistic,'' it would be       problematic to offer subsidies without standards. ``If       they're going to offer a tax credit for people who are buying       insurance, well, what is insurance?'' he said, noting that       you might end up with the government paying for plans that       covered aromatherapy but not hospital care. ``You have to       specify what's included.''        A proliferation of $1,995 plans that covered mostly       aromatherapy could end up costing the federal government a       lot more money than the current G.O.P. plan, since far more       people would take advantage of tax credits to buy cheap       products, even if they weren't very valuable.        There's another reason, besides avoiding fraud, that health       economists say benefit rules are important. Obamacare       requires insurers to offer health insurance to people who       have preexisting illnesses at the same price as they sell       them to healthy people, and the Republican bill would keep       this rule. But if an insurance company designs a plan that       attracts a lot of sick people, it will be very expensive to       cover them, and the insurance company will either lose money       or end up charging extremely high prices that would drive       away any healthy customers.        Sherry Glied, the dean of the Robert F. Wagner Graduate       School of Public Service at New York University, who helped       work on the essential health benefits in the Obama       administration, raised the example of mental health benefits.       Parents of adolescents with schizophrenia will be sure to buy       insurance that covers only mental health services. Other       parents won't care about that benefit.        The result: Any company offering such benefits will end up       with a lot of customers requiring expensive hospitalizations,       while its competitors that drop them will get healthier       customers who are cheaper to insure. If mental health       services are optional, no insurance company will want to       offer them, lest all the families with sick children buy       their product and put them out of business.        And then healthy people who develop mental illness, or drug       addiction, will also learn that their illness isn't covered.       The result could be a sort of market failure: ``If you don't       require that these benefits are required, they often just get       knocked out of the market altogether,'' she said.        Before Obamacare passed, there were few federal standards       for health insurance bought by individuals, and it was not       uncommon to find plans that didn't include prescription drug       coverage, mental health services or maternity care. But plans       tended to cover most of the other benefits. That was in a       world where health insurers could discriminate against sick       people. In that era, insurers in most states could simply       tell the mother of a mentally ill child that she couldn't buy       insurance. That made it less risky for insurers to offer       mental health benefits to everyone else.        David Cutler, a professor at Harvard who helped advise the       Obama administration on the Affordable Care Act, said he       thinks the kind of insurance products that would be offered       under the proposed mix of policies could become much more       bare-bones than plans before Obamacare. He envisioned an       environment in which a typical plan might cover only       emergency care and basic preventive services, with everything       else as an add-on product, costing almost exactly as much as       it would cost to pay for a service out-of-pocket.        ``Think of this as the if-you-have-rheumatoid-arthritis-      you-should-pay-$30,000 provision,'' he said. Such a system       would mean that Americans with costly problems--cancer,       opioid addiction, H.I.V.--would end up paying a substantially       higher share of their medical bills, while healthy people       would pay lower prices for insurance that wouldn't cover as       many treatments.        There is most likely a middle way. Republican lawmakers       might be comfortable with a system that shifts more of the       costs of care onto people who are sick, if it makes the       average insurance plan less costly for the healthy. But       making those choices would mean engaging in very real trade-      offs, less simple than their talking point.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted if we had actual text  to look at right now, but, instead,  [[Page H2360]]  we are forced to rely on news reports, and what I am reading in the  news is not good.   The article that I just included in the Record also quotes a Harvard  professor who says: ``Think of this as the if-you-have-rheumatoid- arthritis-you-should-pay-$30,000 provision.''   The article says that we could go back to a world where insurers  could simply tell the mother of a mentally ill child that she couldn't  buy insurance. It is ironic that the Republicans want to take away a  woman's choice about a pregnancy, and then it looks like they are going  to take away any insurance she needs for prenatal care or maternity  care.   What are we doing here, Mr. Speaker? What will we be asked to vote on  later today? If these sorts of dangerous ideas are being considered,  we, the American people, deserve to know. Twenty-four million people  are going to lose their insurance under the proposal the Republicans  are considering. People will pay more and get less. There will be huge  tax cuts for the rich. Again, we don't even have the final text. This  is awful. This is unacceptable.   I will remind my colleagues that this is about the American people.  Put the people of this country ahead of your party, ahead of your  ideology, and ahead of this President who just discovered that health  care is complicated.   This is a life-or-death issue for many in this country. Health care  is very personal. Don't take it away from people. Let's work in a  bipartisan way to make the improvements in the Affordable Care Act that  we all know need to be made, but don't just tear apart a healthcare  system that is providing an additional 20 million Americans health  insurance.   Please don't do this. Slow down. Provide us the text of the bill.  Let's have hearings. Let's bring the American people into the Congress  and listen to what they have to say. Listen to what your own  constituents have been saying to you in townhalls. They don't want what  you are selling here today. They don't want your rescue plan. They want  health care for themselves and their families, and that is what they  deserve.   So, please, vote down this martial law rule and go back to the  drawing board.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
