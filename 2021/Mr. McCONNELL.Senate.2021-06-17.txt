 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, next week, as the Democratic leader  has indicated, the Senate will finally get the opportunity to vote on  the bill that House and Senate Democrats have both made their No. 1  priority for the entire Congress. S. 1 is a bad bill filled with bad  ideas, and I have been crystal clear about opposing it from the very  beginning.   But for Democrats themselves, coming up with a compelling rationale  for this unprecedented political power grab has been a long and winding  road. It started back in 2019. Then, our friends on the left were still  trying to wrap their heads around a stunning defeat in the 2016  Presidential election, so the Speaker of the House billed H.R. 1 as a  major overhaul for what her party concluded was a profoundly broken  democracy.   Then, 2020 changed everything. A Democrat actually won the White  House. I guess our democracy wasn't broken after all. This time,  apparently, Federal authorities just needed urgent protection from  State legislatures running their own elections.   So we are talking about fundamentally the very same bill. And one  thing is for certain: Major overhaul doesn't even begin--begin--to  describe it. The awful guts are all in there.   There is the plan to forcibly rewrite large portions of the 50  States' respective election laws and the plan to create new, publicly  funded accounts not for building roads or bridges, expanding rural  broadband, or fighting the opioid epidemic, but just piles of Federal  dollars going to yard signs, balloons, and TV ads for candidates at  least half of Americans disagree with.   There is the plan to trash a decades-old, bipartisan consensus on the  right way to call balls and strikes on elections and turn the even  split of the Federal Election Commission into a partisan majority and  the one to give that majority new and broader tools for chilling the  rights of citizens to engage in political speech it doesn't like.   It is such a radical proposal that even prominent voices on the left  have urged caution. Lawyers from ACLU, no less, have sounded the alarm  on its proposed encroachment on free speech. One liberal expert went  further, saying that if Democrats think their bill is ``essential to  secure democracy, they are self-deceived or deceitful.'' And voters  themselves are hardly convinced. When asked about election policies  like voter ID, large--large--majorities consistently come down on the  opposite side of Washington Democrats. The bill is so transparently  opportunistic, the Democrats' spin has failed to even unite their own  party here in the Senate. It is a massive takeover of our election  system with a fill-in-the-blank rationale. Nobody is fooled, and next  week, the Senate will reject it                            ____________________     Madam President, now on another matter entirely, the  House of Representatives will vote today on a bill from Representative  Barbara Lee to repeal one of the key authorities behind nearly two  decades of U.S. efforts to fight terrorism: the 2002 authorization for  the use of military force. House Democrats claim this vote is an urgent  act of congressional oversight, and the Democratic leader has indicated  the Senate will take it up with similar zeal.   The right way to address ongoing terrorist threats is a debate  certainly worth having. I would have welcomed that debate before the  Biden administration began its hasty retreat from Afghanistan without a  plan to sustain counterterror missions or support our friends. It is  one we should have before we vote to repeal these authorities. Reality  is more complicated, more dangerous, and less politically convenient  than its supporters actually believe.   The fact is, the legal and practical application of the 2002 AUMF  extends far beyond the defeat of Saddam Hussein's regime, and tossing  it aside without answering real questions about our ongoing efforts in  the region is reckless.   So let's clear up some facts. The 2002 AUMF has been understood for  years--years--to apply to a variety of threats emanating from Iraq.  Administrations of both parties have cited it as an important legal  foundation of our fight against ISIS. It has been used precisely  because the ISIS caliphate that stretched into Syria emanated from Iraq  after President Obama's withdrawal in 2011.   The 2002 AUMF is important in Iraq today because it provides  authority for U.S. forces there to defend themselves from a variety of  real, exigent threats. It is arguably even more important in Syria,  where our personnel are present against the wishes of the brutal Assad  regime, supporting local Kurdish and Arab forces and conducting strikes  against ISIS. And because ISIS and al-Qaida have sometimes diverged,  legal analysts have suggested that the 2001 AUMF alone may be  insufficient to authorize operations against ISIS.   Do supporters of this repeal fully understand the ways it might limit  counterterrorism missions? How about cyber ops? How about support for  Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria? How do they propose we respond to  growing attacks against our forces and interests in Iraq?   What about the prospects for robust congressional oversight if the  President is left to rely on unilateral article II authorities or even  less transparent ones? We are learning a lesson in real time about  withdrawing from Afghanistan without a plan. We shouldn't make the same  mistake here. So I suspect this isn't really about reasserting  congressional oversight. After all, when the last administration  announced plans to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan in 2019, two  dozen Democrats joined my amendment opposing the decision and  reasserting our role in foreign policy. But now, many of our colleagues  no longer want to talk about what we should be doing to confront these  ongoing threats.   A lot can happen in 2 years, I guess. The political winds have  certainly changed. But one thing hasn't changed: The grave threats  posed by ISIS, al-Qaida, and other terrorist groups are as real as they  have ever been, and repealing AUMFs without agreeing on a set of new  authorities up front will only lead to more uncertainty about what we  are going to do about them.   For years, U.S. forces have been carefully handing more of the  primary responsibilities for counterterrorism to brave local partners.  Under the last administration, this allowed our military footprint in  Iraq and Syria to shrink dramatically. But the only reason that worked  is because our partners have been able to trust that the U.S. military  is still authorized to back them up. Today, House Democrats intend to  rip out one of the key authorities underpinning that trust.   As I understand it, Democrats don't even intend to stop there. They  are also planning to take aim at the 2001 authorities that allow us to  keep some of the most dangerous terrorists alive from taking more  innocent American lives. The administration says it is looking into how  best to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that  houses the absolute--absolute--worst of the worst, including Khalid  Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11 attack. But thus  far, the administration is rather short on details. How does the  President plan to do this? Does he intend to break the law and bring  terrorists to the United States? Give them expanded legal rights?  Further radicalize our prison population? Talk about domestic violent  extremism. Or does the President intend to send KSM and his  [[Page S4602]]  terrorist cronies to Pakistan or Saudi Arabia before they have faced  justice?   Closing Guantanamo Bay will not make Americans safer. It will not  bring solace to the victims of terrorism. It will not make America more  respected in the world. It won't solve the terrorist threat any more  than repealing AUMFs will end their war against us.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
