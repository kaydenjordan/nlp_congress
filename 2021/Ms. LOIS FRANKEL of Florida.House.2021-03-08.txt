 Mr. Speaker, I join Madam Speaker in  celebrating International Women's Day.   Today, I rise in support of the VA VACCINES Act. This is a bipartisan  bill that will expand the VA's ability to provide COVID-19 vaccines to  all veterans and their caregivers, regardless of whether or not they  are enrolled in the VA healthcare system.   Mr. Speaker, the VA should not turn away any veteran who wants this  lifesaving vaccine. You know, where I live in Florida--and I am sure it  is like this in most places--it is still like playing the lottery to  get a vaccine.   This vaccine is free to all Americans and is paid for by our tax  dollars. So, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, for our veterans who have  selflessly served our  [[Page H1086]]  country, we should honor their service with easy access to lifesaving  COVID-19 vaccines. In my view, there are no people more deserving.                            ____________________
