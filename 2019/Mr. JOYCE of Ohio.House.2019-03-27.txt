 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  passing of a dear friend and a model public servant from my district,  Ms. Barbara Ricca of Newbury Township in Geauga County. Ms. Ricca  passed away peacefully on Saturday morning, March 23, at the age of 95.   Barb proudly served as the legal secretary for Geauga County for over  30 years. She worked under five different prosecutors from both  parties. In fact, when I became prosecutor, Barbara was my very first  secretary.   She worked tirelessly until her retirement, but Barb did not retire  from life. She worked just as hard as a volunteer at University  Hospitals Geauga Medical Center and could be found baling hay on their  family farm.   For relaxation, she played in the Great Geauga County Fair Band, of  which she had been an original charter member since 1938. Most  recently, I had the honor of pinning Barb at the Geauga County Fair to  commemorate her 80th year of playing in the fair band.   Barb will not only be missed by her loving family and friends but by  the entire Geauga County community.   May Barbara Ricca rest in peace.                            ____________________
