 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  support H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act,  which I am very pleased to co-sponsor.   This bill comprises a significant set of provisions that resulted  from constructive negotiations with our Majority and with the Senate as  part of the energy conference last year. I am also proud to note that  many of these provisions were actually first proposed in the version of  the American Competes Reauthorization Act that was sponsored by every  Democratic Member of the Committee in the last Congress.   The bill includes what would be the first comprehensive authorization  of the DOE Office of Science, which is the largest supporter of  physical sciences research in the country. This is a nearly $6 billion  office that manages 10 of our national laboratories, often called the  crown jewels of our national research infrastructure. Yet thus far,  unlike NSF, NASA, and nearly every other major scientific research  agency stewarded by the federal government, the Office of Science has  not received the statutory guidance and support that its capabilities  and mission warrant. So passing this portion of the bill into law alone  would be a big step in the right direction.   The bill also includes a number of important technology transfer  provisions that previously passed the House as part of a bipartisan  bill that I and many of my colleagues on the Committee co-sponsored. In  addition, it would provide the first authorization of the promising  Innovation Hub model for energy research, and it would enable greater  private sector engagement with ARPA-E. Finally, this bill includes an  updated and improved version of the Nuclear Energy Innovation  Capabilities Act, which I was happy to co-sponsor with my friend Mr.  Weber in the last Congress.   I would like to thank Chairman Smith and his staff for working  closely with us and our Senate counterparts to move beyond what began  as, frankly, a rather contentious process to find common ground on a  wide range of areas that will be critical to ensuring our nation's  competitiveness and our clean energy future.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, I was unable to  vote during the following rollcall votes. Had I been present, I would  have voted: ``No'' on rollcall 62, Motion on Ordering the Previous  Question on the Rule providing for consideration of H.R. 7. ``No'' on  rollcall 63, Rule providing for consideration of H.R. 7--No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of  2017. ``Yea'' on rollcall 64, on Democratic Motion to Recommit H.R. 7.  ``No'' on rollcall 65, Passage of H.R. 7--No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017.                            ____________________
