 Madam Speaker, Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 356.

Their certificates of election have not arrived, but there is no  contest, and no question has been raised with regard to their election.    Madam Speaker, today we welcome Representative Shontel  Brown of Ohio's 11th Congressional District to the Halls of Congress,  America's temple of democracy.   Representative Brown's Great Lakes, northern Ohio, Cleveland region  has weathered enormous challenges over the years. Now more than ever  her intelligent, innovative, personable, and collaborative leadership  are needed.   Representative Brown has a remarkable record of such accomplishments.  She follows in the footsteps of former Congresswoman and now HUD  Secretary Marcia Fudge, Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones, and  Representative Louis Stokes. Representative Brown will now become the  58th member of the Black Caucus, an historic high for our Nation.   First, as a Warrensville Heights City Council member, and then as a  Cuyahoga County Council member, Representative Brown has driven  progress through investments in infrastructure, health and human  services, and education at every juncture to help incentivize good- paying jobs.   Shontel knows well how important it is for Federal and local  governments working with the private sector to partner together to  improve quality of life and increase opportunity, equity, and justice  for all.   Her relationships across northeast Ohio are very deep. Her commitment  to serving greater Cleveland and Akron is dynamic and purposeful.   Ohio's Buckeye State congressional delegation is honored to welcome  sparkling Representative Shontel Brown. We stand ready to work with her  to deliver results for Ohio and for the American people.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, today, we have the additional distinct  pleasure of welcoming Representative Mike Carey of Sabina, Ohio, to the  117th Congress and to Ohio's Buckeye State congressional delegation.   Ohio is truly the industrial heartland of America, and the 15th  Congressional District embodies our region's aspirations and struggles.   The hardworking men and women of south central Ohio hold high hopes.  They have sent Representative Mike Carey to advance progress for Ohio  and America. We know he will champion the cause of workers and families  so all can succeed.   We all can imagine how very proud his family and friends are at this  unforgettable moment.   From assuring America's energy independence and deploying broadband  internet, to rebuilding our roads, bridges, and power grid,  Representative Mike Carey will bring his experience to bear with the  energy industry to move Ohio and America forward and secure good-paying  jobs for the middle class.   All of us here today are excited to welcome determined, dogged  Representative Mike Carey and to get to work delivering new prosperity  across our great State and Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.
