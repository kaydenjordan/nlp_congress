 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the need to  ensure quality healthcare for our veterans and military members who may  be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.   According to the Military Health System, 14 percent of servicemembers  who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD. The condition can  lead to substance abuse and cause serious physical and mental health  problems.   In Montana, 1 in 10 residents are veterans. That is one reason I have  acted to expand mental health services in Montana. With increased  resources for the VA system, improved access to community healthcare,  and the expansion of telemedicine, we can help to ensure that those who  have served get  [[Page H4928]]  the treatment they need, regardless of where they live.   June is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month. I encourage  my colleagues to support our veterans and military members who suffer  from PTSD. We must keep our commitments to them and provide the highest  quality of care.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to immediately  schedule this important bill so the American people know where we  stand.
