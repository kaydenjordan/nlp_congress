 Mr. Speaker, the Water Resources Development Act contains  important language to help prevent a public health crisis at the Salton  Sea, California's largest lake, which is in my district.   The Salton Sea's shoreline is rapidly receding, exposing thousands of  acres of lake bed and sending dust loaded with selenium and pesticides  into the air and into the lungs of residents in my district.   My provision will authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to take the  next steps and study the construction of a northern perimeter lake  project at the sea, which is the next major project under the State of  California's Salton Sea Management Program, and it will strengthen the  Federal-State partnership.   Later this week, we will pass the Energy and Water Development  appropriations bill, which contains another one of my provisions which  will prioritize the Army Corps' efforts at the Salton Sea.   I would like to thank Chairman DeFazio, Congressman Vargas, and  Congresswoman Napolitano for their partnership on this pressing and  important issue, and I urge support for this legislation.            H.R. 7849.         Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant       to the following:        Article I, section 8, Clauses 1 and 18 of the United States       Constitution, to provide for the general welfare and make all       laws necessary and proper to carry out the powers of       Congress.
