 Madam President, Hurricane Michael made landfall along  the Florida Panhandle. This storm has already claimed multiple lives  and left the gulf coast communities wounded by surging waters and high  winds. As Michael continues inland, those left in its wake can count on  the Senate's support for responsive recovery efforts and trust in our  continued prayers. We remain grateful for the vigilance of first  responders and emergency preparedness organizations as they work to  keep residents of affected communities safe and for all of those who  will help to rebuild after the storm has passed.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on an entirely different matter,  with the bipartisan progress the Senate has made this week, it is hard  to believe what was happening just a few days ago right inside this  Capitol and right outside the building. It is hard to believe it was  less than a week ago that far-left protesters were literally storming  the steps of the Capitol and the Supreme Court, running my colleagues  out of public places and attempting to shout over their voices right  here in the Senate Chamber. Of course, it didn't work. The Senate stood  tall and did the right thing.   The far left isn't done yet. If we take them at their word, this may  have only been the warmup act. Here is the advice former Secretary of  State Hillary Clinton gave to her fellow Democrats just a few days ago.  She said: ``If we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the  Senate, that's when civility can start again.''   ``That's when civility can start again,'' she said, when they win  back the House and/or the Senate.   Just yesterday, we saw President Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder  offer his own version of a slogan made famous by our former First Lady,  Michelle Obama. This is Mr. Holder's new vision for civil discourse.  Here is how the former Attorney General of the United States urged  Democrats to treat the other side. He said:         Michelle always says, ``When they go low, we go high.'' No.       No. When they go low, we kick 'em.    He said:         When they go low, we kick 'em. That's what this new       Democratic Party is about.    The ``new Democratic Party,'' he said.   Remember, these comments come less than a year and a half after  Republican Members of the House and Senate were literally shot at by a  politically crazed gunman. Our colleagues were nearly killed just a few  minutes from the Capitol. In just these past days, there have been  graphic death threats, Senators and staff have needed extraordinary  police protection, and the Democrats are calling for more incivility  and more rage? They are calling for more incivility and more rage?   There isn't a firmer defender of the First Amendment than I. It is  vital that citizens be heard. Americans with strong opinions on both  sides of last week's debate spoke up in a civil and respectful way, and  our Nation was better for it. But only one side--only  [[Page S6778]]  one side--was happy to play host to this toxic fringe behavior. Only  one side's leaders are now openly calling for more of it. They haven't  seen enough. They want more.   I am afraid this is only phase 1 of the meltdown. We are already  seeing desperate voices on the far left explain that, well, because  they lost this fight, even more drastic steps are in order.   There is crazy talk--crazy talk--about impeaching Justice Kavanaugh.  There are left-wing writers demanding that Democrats pack the Court--a  zombie idea from the 1930s they have dug up just in time for Halloween.   How about this: One columnist for a national newspaper called the  result a coup--a coup--and implied that the Founders got it wrong and  designed the Senate incorrectly. They want to rewrite the Constitution?  The Founding Fathers got it wrong? Handling defeat badly is one thing,  but regretting the Constitution itself because you don't like how a  vote turned out--really? This is something else. But I guess it is not  entirely surprising given the outright embrace by many on the left,  including elected officials, of radical concepts like open borders and  socialism.   Anyone who thinks that intimidation and scare tactics might rule the  day must have missed the Senate's vote last Saturday. Maybe they  weren't tuned in. This body will not let unhinged tactics replace  reasoned judgment. We will not let mob behavior drown out all the  Americans who want to legitimately participate in the policymaking  process on all sides. The Senate, I assure you, will not be  intimidated.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter,  yesterday the Senate passed broad, bipartisan legislation to maintain  our Nation's waterways and drinking water systems. Now we are turning  back to the personnel business and confirming more of the President's  qualified nominees to important executive branch positions.   We voted yesterday to advance the nomination of Jeffrey Clark to  serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural  Resources Division.   Mr. Clark's qualifications include several years of prior service as  Deputy Assistant Attorney General in that same position. He has also  built a strong reputation in the private sector as a leading litigator  with subject-matter expertise in administrative law. Mr. Clark's legal  colleagues describe him as ``one of the most capable lawyers with whom  [they] have ever worked.'' No fewer than seven former Assistant  Attorneys General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division  tell the Senate that his well-rounded background and prior experience  in the division make him an excellent choice for this position.   After we confirm Mr. Clark, we will consider another Assistant  Attorney General nominee, Eric Dreiband, for the Civil Rights Division.  Mr. Dreiband is also well prepared to serve. His resume includes  several stints of public service, including as general counsel of the  EEOC, in addition to private sector experience. Others have praised his  service at the EEOC as ``widely respected,'' ``in the highest rung of  the Agency's general counsels,'' and a ``record of superlative  performance.'' Those who have worked with Mr. Dreiband emphasize his  strong commitment to protecting all Americans' civil rights.    In the words of one leader who is known and worked hard with the  nominee for 15 years, ``his commitment to fairly enforcing the law is  without question.''   After Dreiband will come James Stewart, the President's choice to  serve as Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. Mr.  Stewart's experience managing military manpower runs deep through his  distinguished career at the U.S. Air Force, from which he retired as a  major general.   He has most recently served on the North Carolina Military Affairs  Commission and on the Secretary of Defense's Reserve Forces Policy  Board.   Each of these nominees deserves confirmation, and I would urge our  colleagues to approve all of them.                            ____________________     Madam President, it has been more than 9 months since  Republicans passed the most sweeping tax reform in a generation. Here  are just a few of the economic headlines we have seen since it took  effect: consumer confidence at an 18-year high, faster year-on-year  wage growth than at any point since 2009, and the lowest national  unemployment since 1969--almost 50 years ago.   Behind all of these numbers are middle-class families whose lives are  changing for the better, and the effects are reaching all kinds of  communities--even the places most neglected for nearly a decade by the  Obama administration's so-called recovery.   After years of investment and job creation being disproportionately  concentrated in the biggest metropolitan areas, 2018 has been a  different story. So far this year, it has been smaller and rural  communities--smaller and rural communities--that have led the Nation in  relative job growth. Out across the heartland, empty storefronts and  stagnant local economies are giving way to vibrant transformation and  new opportunities.   So when we hear that States like Missouri are thriving again on the  watch of the Republicans' pro-growth, pro-opportunity agenda, it really  shouldn't come as a surprise. It shouldn't surprise us that Missouri's  statewide unemployment rate has reached its lowest level since 2000-- the lowest unemployment in 18 years.   News like this will not surprise anyone who has been listening to the  accounts of Missourians, like Mary Beth Hartman, who runs a small  construction company in Springfield. She says the new tax law has given  her the flexibility to expand vacations and bonuses for her employees  and invest half a million dollars in new equipment.   Or Brandon Pister--he used his tax reform bonus to help his family  cover medical expenses and put money into savings.   The junior Senator from Missouri can be proud that he voted for the  historic policies that helped unleash all of this good news. It is a  shame that his colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, chose to  vote in lockstep with Senate Democrats and try to block tax reform from  taking effect.   Republicans will keep sharing success stories like these from  Missouri and keep helping the American people write more.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:45  p.m. today, the Senate proceed to executive session for the  consideration of the following nominations: Executive Calendar Nos.  1007, David James Porter; 1081, Ryan Nelson; 1082, Richard Sullivan;  627, William Ray; 628, Liles Clifton Burke; 629, Michael Juneau; 634,  Mark Norris; 638, Eli Richardson; 894, Thomas Kleeh; 907, Jeremy  Kernodle; 895, Peter Phipps; 905, Susan Brnovich; 906, Chad Kenney;  945, James Hanlon; 947, Lance Walker; further, I ask consent that the  Senate vote on the nominations in the order listed, with 2 minutes of  debate equally divided prior to each vote; that for each nomination  that is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action, that no further motions be in order, and that any statements  relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.

Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  with a further amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize the 50th anniversary of one of the great economic development  organizations in my home State, the Kentucky Highlands Investment  Corporation, KHIC. Throughout 22 counties in southeastern Kentucky,  this community development institution provides the necessary  assistance to groups by bringing new opportunities to the region.   Since its creation in 1968, the KHIC claims a remarkable record of  financial investment and job creation. In fulfillment of its founding  mission, the organization has invested more than $350 million and  helped create or maintain approximately 22,000 jobs. A significant  amount of the KHIC's success has occurred in Promise Zones, federally  designated regions of high poverty. I applaud organizations that are  able to encourage economic growth in the areas of greatest need, and I  am especially proud of the KHIC for doing just that.   To accomplish its goals, the KHIC focuses its efforts on four main  areas: providing loans and giving equity investments, building housing  solutions and driving innovation. The KHIC collaborates with  experienced entrepreneurs and community leaders who offer guidance and  support to a wide variety of small businesses in this region, and it is  easy to see the half-century of success that has resulted.   I have proudly supported the KHIC's work in its applications for  competitive Federal grants. Much to my delight, their programming has  been awarded Federal grant resources to bolster its successful work in  Kentucky. I will continue to work with the KHIC and other groups to  make a difference in our Commonwealth.  [[Page S6806]]    It is my privilege to congratulate the men and women of the KHIC for  their golden anniversary. Under the leadership of the chairman of the  board of directors William Singleton and president and CEO Jerry  Rickett, the people of southeastern Kentucky have strong advocates  working tirelessly on their behalf. In particular, I want to thank  Jerry Rickett for his many years of outstanding work for the people of  southeastern Kentucky. I would like to extend my sincere  congratulations to the KHIC and its staff and supporters, as the  organization celebrates 50 years of accomplishment. Along with my  Senate colleagues, I wish them the best and look forward to the KHIC's  many future successes.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 523, H.R. 1037.
