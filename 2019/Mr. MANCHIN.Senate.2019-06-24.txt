 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to call for immediate  action on the American Miners Act. We have an obligation to the coal  miners across America who served our Nation by providing us with energy  through our greatest advancements. They deserve to know that the  pensions they rightfully worked for will be funded fully. They deserve  to have acceptable healthcare, which was guaranteed to them, and they  paid for it.   As the Senate fails to act, we continue to put our retired miners'  healthcare and pension benefits in jeopardy yet again. I have been  working with everyone from every angle in order to prevent our miners  from losing their healthcare and retirement benefits, but, once again,  they are facing a deadline that puts their whole livelihood at risk.   This has been a long fight, and it is far from over. Everyone--and I  mean  [[Page S4200]]  everyone--who has joined me in this journey understands that they are  fighting for the working people, and that is what we were sent here to  do. These retired miners are walking the halls and fighting for what is  rightfully theirs. I am doing this for them. I promised them that this  body will not abandon them. I refuse to let them down.   The 1974 pension plan will be insolvent by 2022 if we do not act now.  Miners who receive their healthcare through companies that went  bankrupt in 2018 are at risk of losing their coverage in the coming  months if we fail to act soon. Unlike many other public-private pension  plans, the 1974 pension plan was well managed and 94 percent funded  prior to the crash of 2008. However, the 2008 crash hit at a time when  the plan had its highest payment obligations to the retirees. If the  plan becomes insolvent, these beneficiaries will face benefit cuts and  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will assume billions of  dollars in liabilities.   To address these issues, the American Miners Act would shore up the  1974 pension plan, which is headed for insolvency due to coal company  bankruptcies and the 2008 financial crisis. It would ensure that the  miners who are at risk due to the 2018 coal company bankruptcies will  not lose their healthcare. It would extend the Black Lung Disability  Trust Fund tax at $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and 55 cents  per ton of surface-mined coal for 10 years.   West Virginia has more retired miners than any other State. More than  27,000 retirees live in West Virginia alone. Most of those who are  receiving these pensions are widows. The pensions for these widows-- basically, it is a family affair when someone in the family mines--on  average is less than $600 per month--less than $600. They have worked  for it. Their husbands worked for it. They have been counting on it.  Basically, it is a lifeline for them. Because of the bankruptcies that  have allowed companies to walk away from the legacy costs and leave  them with nothing after they negotiated to not take home the pay to  take care of this themselves, they are left in a very vulnerable  position, which we should never have let happen.   I have a letter from a retired coal miner to read to you today. I  think it puts everything in perspective. This is Delbert from West  Virginia, who was a miner for 35 years. He said:         To the members of the Senate and House: Months ago, I       walked the corridors of Washington, D.C., asking many members       of Congress for help. I spoke with Mitch McConnell and bled       my heart out to him, how this was not only the right thing to       do but it was also a matter of life and death to many       thousands of coal miners.        If this letter is read on the Senate and House floors, I       plead with each and every one of you to search your hearts       and souls today. Close your eyes and imagine giving your       youth and your entire working life to the coal industry, and       the only promise you were given was a small retirement check       and medical insurance. I know a favorable ruling for these       miners will cost the taxpayers nothing. It will not lead to       an increase in the deficit. I realize all we are asking       for is the interest earned off the unused reclamation       fund. Most coal companies are even on board with this.        These miners have black lung. Many have to use oxygen 24       hours a day. Many have to use wheelchairs, walkers, and       canes. Their bodies are broken. Please don't break their       hearts, spirits, and souls also. Please save their lives and       pass this bill today.    He is a proud veteran of the Vietnam War, a proud coal miner, and a  proud American. Please don't say no to these deserving miners and  spouses.   Let me give to you in a nutshell what they are asking for. In 1946,  when Harry Truman was President, the Krug-Lewis Agreement was signed.  That was John L. Lewis. The miners had to work for our industry and our  economy to keep moving forward. Until that time they had no pension and  no retirement. From that day forward it was promised to every miner  that for every ton of coal that would be mined, there would be a  certain set-aside on the price of coal that would go into their pension  and retirement because it was an important industry and important  commodity for the economy of our great country.   After World War II, when the economy fell, miners were on strike, and  they couldn't take care of themselves. This is how we got this bill, a  guarantee from the Federal Government that they would be taken care of.  It was not that the Federal taxpayer and government were going to pay  for it. It was basically funded through the product they were mining  and the products being sold, which gave them the resources to take care  of their retirement and pensions.   Somebody got this money when there was a bankruptcy, and it wasn't  the people who worked for it. The bankruptcy laws in this country are  so messed up that they don't give money to the human beings--they don't  give it to the workers who basically worked for this and didn't take  money home to their families because it was based in their retirement  and pension plan, and then, all of a sudden, it is gone. All of the  financial institutions line up first. It is not the working person at  the front of the line. They are in the back of the line getting  nothing. That is what we are trying to change here.   We are trying to make sure that the people who have given everything  they have for this great country--they are patriotic, they fought in  the war, and they mined the coal that basically built America. Now we  are about ready to let it go down.   We had this bill fixed 3 years ago. I talked with Majority Leader  McConnell about both the pension and the healthcare, but they separated  it. We got the healthcare benefits for a certain portion of those  people but not the pension plan. If there is one bankruptcy between now  and 2022, this whole thing collapses immediately.   On the other hand, the guaranteed funding that the Federal Government  does pay for will be hit hard, and it could break down. So we have a  crisis looming. We can avoid it or we can allow this to happen, as we  do so many things around here.   Why has this become a political fight? It shouldn't be. We have  bipartisan support. We had almost every member on the Finance Committee  from both parties--Democrats and Republicans--support it, but it never  made it past the person who is responsible for putting it on the floor.   I hope that all my colleagues will consider the widows and their $600  pensions, which means the difference between having a life and  basically worrying from day to day whether they are going to have food  or medical care for whatever they need. These pensions are not  extravagant. These pensions are a necessity and something that is  needed. So I implore all of my colleagues to look at this very hard and  try to get this on the NDAA. This is something we all should be  fighting for and helping the people who fought for us, who gave us the  quality of life we have and the great country we have.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
