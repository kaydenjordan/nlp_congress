 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Sires) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rooney).   Nicolas Maduro is an illegitimate president. As a result of his  brutal dictatorship, the Venezuelan people are suffering in one of the  worst humanitarian crises in the Western Hemisphere.   Without basic food and medicine, people are starving and dying. As  many as 3.4 million Venezuelans have left the country and migrated to  neighboring countries, which are having immense difficulty absorbing  such high volumes of migrants.   My bill would help alleviate the pain of the Venezuelan people by  providing humanitarian assistance in accordance with established  international humanitarian principles to those within the country and  in the region. It gives Congress the authority to provide as much  funding as is necessary to address the crisis in both 2020 and 2021,  with no less than $150 million for each year.   It also requires the State Department and USAID to show the American  people the most effective way to coordinate with nongovernmental and  international organizations operating throughout the region, and the  bill also requires the administration to submit a report to Congress  assessing the impact of U.S. humanitarian assistance.   Maduro has proven that he is willing to let his own people suffer and  die rather than accept international aid. It is not enough to provide  USAID with the funds for this aid. The administration must show that  they are strategically trying everything they can to get the aid to the  Venezuelan people inside the country, not just leaving it at the  border. That is what this bill will achieve.   Finally, the bill expresses Congress' strong condemnation of all  violent actions by the Maduro regime and Venezuela's security forces to  block and divert humanitarian assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
