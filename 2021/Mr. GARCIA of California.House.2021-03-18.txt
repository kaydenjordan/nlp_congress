 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition  to H.R. 6.   As a first-generation American, I know firsthand the opportunities  that America provides. I understand why every person on this planet  should want to come to this beautiful country. We are a land of  immigrants, built on hard work, and blessed by freedoms that are  protected by law and order and secured by our Constitution.   I sympathize with the Dreamers, I really do, but this bill should not  be considered before addressing our broken immigration system that led  to this very problem. Providing amnesty to Dreamers while ignoring the  crisis at the border is like cleaning up spilled water before fixing  the broken pipe.   If Congress fails to reform our immigration system and fails to  secure our borders, future migrants will be subjected to the same  situation in which Dreamers today find themselves.   We need to fix our broken immigration system and secure our borders.   If my colleagues are sincere about their care and passion for the  Dreamers, they should work with us to secure the border today so that  the Dreamers have a chance tomorrow.
