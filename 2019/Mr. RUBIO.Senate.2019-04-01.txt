 Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the unique American entrepreneurial spirit.  It is my privilege to honor a Florida small business that has worked so  diligently to expand opportunity within their community, proving that  small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the heartbeat of  Main Street. This week it is my privilege to honor Sunshine Peanut  Company of Jacksonville, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Founded in 2005, Sunshine Peanut Company is Florida's only peanut  butter producer and processes more than 10 million pounds of peanut  butter each year. Sunshine Peanut Company, owned by CEO Jeff Turbeville  and his brother David, completes every phase of production, from  roasting to packaging, entirely in house.   Focusing on competitive cost, high quality, and timely delivery and  with the help of the Jacksonville Small Business Development Center,  Sunshine Peanut Company has become a leader in the peanut processing  industry. Through the utilization of their Small Business  Administration HUBZone certification, Sunshine Peanut Company has been  awarded contracts to sell their high-quality peanut butter to  hospitals, schools, universities, and correctional facilities.   Sunshine Peanut Company's work with the Florida Department of  Corrections goes far beyond just supplying peanut butter. Jeff employs  a number of rehabilitated offenders, and David, a former police  officer, understands firsthand the criminal justice system and the  support that parolees need. Jeff takes his role as an employer and  community sponsor seriously, and his dedication to provide dignified  work to the members of his community that need it the most is an  outstanding example of community support. Sunshine Peanut Company's  efforts have resulted in reduced recidivism and increased opportunity  within his community.   Jeff's efforts and Sunshine Peanut Company's success has not gone  unnoticed. He was recently honored as the 2019 Florida Small business  Person of the Year by the Small Business Administration. This  distinction is awarded to an entrepreneur who represents diversity,  hard work, and perseverance. Jeff's commitment to both his company and  his community have made him a clear choice for this award. He will be  honored this year in Washington, DC, at the beginning of National Small  Business Week.   Sunshine Peanut Company is a great example of how dignified work can  lead to community engagement and business expansion, while changing  lives for the better. I commend Jeff and the Sunshine Peanut Company on  their dedication to their community and am honored to name them as the  Senate Small Business of the Week. I wish them good luck and look  forward to watching their continued growth and success.                            ____________________
