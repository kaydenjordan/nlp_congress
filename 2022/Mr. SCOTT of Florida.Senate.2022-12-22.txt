 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, immediately after Hurricane Ian  passed, I made clear that I would fight for and support a standalone  disaster aid package to get Floridians the assistance they need to  recover.   On September 30, just 2 days after Ian made its catastrophic landfall  near Fort Myers, FL, I wrote to my colleagues urging them to work with  me on getting much needed aid to Florida families as quickly as  possible.   Immediately after, the aid Floridians desperately needed was delayed  so that it could be stuffed into this massive and reckless $1.7  trillion omnibus bill. While that is disappointing enough, I have now  heard from Floridians, especially our growers in agriculture, that  without changes, this disaster aid will not be delivered in the most  efficient and effective way possible to ensure their recovery.   We should take this opportunity to act on their concerns today and  make needed changes that ensure this Federal disaster aid does as much  good as possible. There is no reason to delay this further. I urge my  colleagues to stand with those recovering from these terrible storms  and the folks who put the food on our tables. Please support this bill.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
