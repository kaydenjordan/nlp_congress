 Mr. Speaker, my district is the proud home to  Adirondack Park, an environmental treasure. We understand in the north  country that protecting our environment plays an important role in  promoting economic growth and opportunity.   Along with 16 of my colleagues, I am proud to introduce a resolution  calling on the House of Representatives to commit to working on  economically viable solutions that address the threat of climate  change.   Clean energy innovation is critical, and this resolution brings  together the priority of addressing the risks of climate change with  the importance of protecting and creating American jobs. This  resolution calls on American ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism,  also citing that it is a conservative principle to protect, conserve,  and be good stewards of our environment.   No matter what side of the aisle you are on, we all have a  significant responsibility to protect our environment from avoidable  damage. I ask my colleagues to join in this commitment and support this  important resolution.                            ____________________
