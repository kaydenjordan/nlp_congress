 Madam President, first, I thank the Energy Committee  chair for her kind words and for her advocacy. I may be speaking for a  bit, and then when the majority leader comes, I will interrupt and  allow him to close, and then I ask unanimous consent to finish my  speaking, if that is OK.     Madam President, I am on the Senate floor today to talk  about the protection and restoration of the Gulf Coast, an issue  extremely important to those I serve in Louisiana in the Gulf Coast,  but important to the rest of the Nation, whether the rest of the Nation  knows it or not. I will explain why that is.   In the coming days, the Senate will vote on whether or not to pass  the Great American Outdoors Act. This bill dedicates funding over 5  years towards deferred maintenance. We have spoken about it at length.  It adds an additional $900 million to the Land and Water Conservation  Fund, an amount which is already authorized but never funded. This  would make it mandatory that it is funded.   Many will say that this is a good thing or even a great thing. I will  tell you, for Louisiana, for the Gulf Coast, and for a lot of other  States, this is not a great thing in its current form. In fact, I will  show how this bill currently benefits only certain States at the  expense of others.   First, it is almost entirely funded with money from the Gulf of  Mexico oil and gas production. So 50 to 60 percent of the dollars go to  five States. So we are going to put up about $9.5 billion, and 50 to 60  percent of it goes to five States. Needless to say, that lacks equity.  I would argue that we can make this bill better in terms of benefiting  many more Americans than it currently does.   First, let's speak about where the revenue comes from. Again, about  $1.9 billion a year comes from energy production, redistributing that  across the country, as we mentioned, to deferred maintenance programs.  About 90 percent of that revenue from which this money will be  extracted comes from oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. This  will be about $4.3 billion coming from the Gulf of Mexico. Now, this  makes the Gulf of Mexico the primary revenue source for this whole  project. It adds $900 million to what is already designated the Land  and Water Conservation Fund. There is $1.9 billion a year for 5 years  to go for deferred maintenance, and this is in addition to $125 million  a year, which is currently being spent on the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   Now, some of the advocates, by the way, just for a point of clarity,  will say or imply that these dollars are not otherwise allocated. Let's  just be clear. The dollars are allocated. Right now, the dollars that  will be used for this fund come to the U.S. Treasury and are used for  the priorities of the American people, and they are allocated for, you  name it, higher education, debt service, paying troops, defense, et  cetera. This would make it mandatory that a certain amount of this  money would go towards both deferred maintenance and the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   Now, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is supposed to be a fund  that functions to benefit, kind of, all Americans, but I would argue  that it really benefits select regions of America. If you look at this  map, where the dollars are spent are not where the people live. These  are the coastal States, and here are the inland States. As it turns  out, the areas that are most benefited by this funding are not on the  coast. And, yet, as you will see in a second, that is where the people  live.   If you live in a coastal State, on a per capita basis, your State  receives about $7.53 per person. If you live in one of these inland  States, from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, you get $17.66, more  than two times plus. In fact, from about 2011 to 2015, if you are in  one of these inland States, you got a ratio of almost 8-to-1 in terms  of the dollars spent in the coastal States. If you take out Washington,  DC, and Virginia and maybe New York, then this $7.53 is going to go far  lower. If you are not one of those three States and you are on the  coast, you are not doing very well on a per capita basis.   To make that point, in 2015, about 40 percent of the Nation's  population lived in a county or parish that was directly on a  coastline, and 82 percent of people live in a State which has a  coastline. So 82 percent of the people live in one of these yellow  States, and yet, on a per capita basis, two plus times is spent on  those living in States which are inland.   Now, my point is that the dollars are not spent relative to where  people live. This disparity disproportionately impacts States such as  South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Maine, and other coastal  States. Now, I am a person who would rather have a solution, and the  solution I am going to propose does not take money away from the Great  American Outdoors Act. They will still continue to receive, in  relatively sparsely populated States, a significant sum of the money.   I worked with Senator Whitehouse on a bipartisan solution that would  at least add some equity for those States which are coastline, as  opposed to being inland. Now, that said, we acknowledge national parks  have deferred maintenance. At the end of fiscal year 2018, this was  estimated at roughly $12 billion, but those parks are not uniformly  distributed.   I mentioned earlier how a disproportionate amount of the money is  going to go to five different States. According to the Park Service  data, if you just looked at deferred maintenance, which will presumably  guide where this money is spent, California; Washington, DC; Virginia;  New York; North Carolina; Wyoming; Arizona; and the State of Washington  make up nearly 60 percent of the deferred maintenance needs at national  parks. If you live in one of those States, you are doing well, but if  you are living in a State other than those, not so well.   Now, some will say that even though almost 60 percent of the money is  going to seven States, everyone in the country benefits because you  might visit the park, or we are all in it together, so why shouldn't I  support a national park in a State which is far away from my hometown   I suppose there is something to be said to that. On the other hand,  if the person saying that lived in one of the States, which is getting  just a tiny fraction of the total sum of dollars, and, yes, the people  in their State will leave their State and go spend their money in  Montana, for example, that will be great. People in Montana, on a per  capita basis, get far more than anybody else.   We are in it together, I suppose, but you probably wouldn't reverse  it. You probably wouldn't say: Wait a second, we think it is unfair  that seven States get almost 60 percent of the dollars. We actually  think it is better to be more  [[Page S2800]]  equitably spread, or maybe you would. I hope that you would.   States like Kansas, Iowa, and Nebraska see almost no benefit.  Collectively, the deferred maintenance in these three States--Kansas,  Iowa, and Nebraska--is .2 percent of total deferred maintenance  backlog. It is the same for Connecticut, Delaware, Minnesota, and New  Hampshire. Again, while there is deferred maintenance in Gulf Coast  States, the real benefit to our States is investing in the coastline,  which has a direct impact on sustainability.   To be fair, by the way, the Gulf of Mexico States do currently  benefit. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act shares revenue with the  four Gulf Coast States. We use this revenue, by State constitution, for  coastal restoration. There is a little bit of irony, as the Senator  from Alaska pointed out, that those who strongly support this bill  oftentimes strongly disapprove of drilling for oil and gas,  particularly in coastal areas, but they are now reliant upon that  drilling in order to fund the Great American Outdoors Act.   I do believe that we can address this inequity, which has been  highlighted. I put together a bill, as I mentioned earlier, with  Sheldon Whitehouse, called the COASTAL Act. We are working with other  colleagues. We passed it out of the Energy Committee.   Actually, by that, Senator Whitehouse was not on that bill, but we  passed the COASTAL Act out of the Energy Committee with a bipartisan  vote. The junior Senator from Alabama is my cosponsor. He should  cosponsor, and he did. Alabama benefits exponentially more from the  GOMESA Act than anything that the Great American Outdoors Act has to  offer.   So all of this is to say that the Gulf Coast just wants equity. We  want a more general benefit, not almost 60 percent of the benefit,  going to seven States, and we also want the money to be distributed  nationwide where people live, as opposed to where they might go on a 1- week vacation every 5 years.   I will speak just very briefly about the COASTAL Act. It is a  bipartisan bill, again, passed by the Senate Energy Committee,  committing more dollars towards environmental protection, reducing  flood risks to businesses and industries along the Gulf Coast,  protecting regions of the Gulf Coast for public recreation--we talked  about recreation elsewhere. But committing dollars for all coastal  States for environmental protection, once more, does not take money  away from the Great American Outdoors Act.   Colleagues have heard me talk about the importance of revenue sharing  for environmental protection. Again, the COASTAL Act passed out with  bipartisan support, and its goals are consistent with the Great  American Outdoors Act. By the way, the recent flood event in  Louisiana--crystal ball--flooded homes in Mandeville and property in  Grand Isle. If we have flooding now, this bill would help prevent that  flooding.   The COASTAL Act also places millions of dollars in a coastal fund,  which benefits all coastal States, including those along the Great  Lakes, putting money to protect where people live.   Once more, let me just show this. This is where people live, and 82  percent of the people live in a State with a coastline. Yet, where the  money is going is, yes, to the coast, if you consider Washington, DC,  and Virginia the coastline, but typically, it is going to five or six  places, not to the places which have had the most flood events.   I walked around barrier islands in Georgia. Those barrier islands are  evaporating. I hear that barrier islands in South Carolina are  similarly under great duress. In Louisiana, as I already mentioned, we  just had a flood event this past week. The COASTAL Act would put money  for resiliency in States where 82 percent of the population lives. I  just don't understand what is the objection to spending money to  protect where people live. Why must we only do something nice for  places where people vacation. If you put it to a referendum, people  would first take care of their homes, and then they would take care of  the place where they vacation.   I am not saying, by the way, don't take care of where they vacation,  but I am saying we should at least give some dollars to where people  live. Now, I will quote a statistic once more: 42 percent of Americans  live in a parish or county that is directly on a shoreline. Why don't  we do something to protect that shoreline where 42 percent of Americans  live, not taking any dollars away from those sparsely populated places  where people vacation?   By the way, when the COASTAL Act passed the Energy Committee,  environmental groups such as the Energy Defense Fund, the National  Wildlife Federation, Audubon Society, and Louisiana-based organizations  such as the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation and the Coalition to  Restore Coastal Louisiana signed a letter saying:         As we move to address the significant land, water, and       wildlife conservation funding needs in our Nation, it is       important that our coastlines are also equipped to confront       the unique challenges that climate change presents. GOMESA       has been a critically important funding stream for Louisiana       and other Gulf Coast States, and expanding upon this success       will protect national economic assets, providing better       protection from storms, and enhance coastal habitat.    Now, bill sponsors will, rightly, say that the Great American  Outdoors Act does not impact revenues flowing to GOMESA States, but-- let's face it--it does cannibalize these dollars in Louisiana, so  sooner or later you run out of money.   So if we are going to take all these dollars that could be spent  elsewhere and put in these sparsely populated States where people  vacation but not spend it in States where people actually live, not  spend it in counties where 42 percent of the people live, which are  directly upon a coastline, sooner or later you run out of money. And we  are going to--just like a vacuum cleaner--suck those dollars down to  these sparsely populated areas where people love to vacation.   So my point is that, in Louisiana, for example, we have a $50  billion, 50-year master plan to protect our coastline, reducing flood  risk to communities and assets so important to the rest of the Nation.  The Great American Outdoors Act will make it more difficult to secure  future dollars for this gulf coast restoration.   Now, as I mentioned before, a lot of people live in coastline  communities, in counties and parishes, and from 2000 to 2016, the Gulf  of Mexico region grew by almost 25 percent, more than any other  coastline region.   Harris County, TX, and areas in Florida and New York also accounted  for substantial growth along our Nation's coast. The proposal I filed  commits dollars to these coastal States so that they can have a  sustainable revenue stream now and in the future for needed  investments.   If you asked the people in New York, after Hurricane Sandy, if they  would like to have dollars in New York to protect against a future  flood event, they would say yes.   Houston and Galveston have really borne the brunt of major flood  events, of hurricanes striking their coastline. Do we think that they  could use more money for coastal resiliency? Yes--as well as Lake  Charles, LA, after Hurricane Rita, Calcasieu Parish and Cameron Parish.  We talked about Louisiana with Hurricane Katrina, the gulf coast of  Mississippi and Alabama, devastated after Hurricane Katrina. Would it  be wise, as a nation, to put dollars there in order to have coastal  resiliency to prevent, if you will, more flooding in the future so as  to actually save more relief dollars that might be needed?   There are people, there are regions, battling rising sea levels, and  I am mindful about their concerns and how we can address those.   I am told recently, by the way, that the Army Corps of Engineers has  proposed a $3.5 billion flood wall for Miami. Think about that--$3.5  billion. This is in response to rising sea levels. But we are passing  legislation now in which folks refuse to consider spending money for  coastal resiliency. Instead, we are going to spend money on a $3.5  billion seawall because we don't want to spend the money on other forms  of coastal resiliency.   I recently spoke to one of my House colleagues, Donna Shalala, who  represents the Miami-Dade region, and she speaks about the rising sea  levels and the investments they need to make around South Beach. It is  something touching where people live, not where people vacation. I am  not sure why we emphasize where people vacation over where people live.  [[Page S2801]]    To pay for this bill, again, we are taking dollars from an area of  the country greatly impacted by coastal erosion, so these gulf funds  actually play a role in restoring or maintaining--   You will see a poster later on which shows the oil and gas  development taking place off the coast of Louisiana, the oil and gas  development that funds the Great American Outdoors Act.   Louisiana's coast is a working coast in which people from this  working coast go out to maintain that source of revenue, but look what  is happening to Louisiana's predicted land loss. Over the next 50  years, in a reasonable scenario, all of this red spot will be lost to  erosion.   By the way, look what happens to New Orleans. It is now directly  along the Gulf of Mexico. The next hurricane comes, and there goes the  port structure. There goes the ability for people in the Midwest to get  their grains to the international market and the ability of this  working coast to support the oil and gas drilling and, therefore, to  support the source of revenue required and relied upon by the Great  American Outdoors Act. It will be lost.   It is not just me saying it. Of course, I am the Senator. I love my  State. I am going to do whatever I can. You may not believe me, but on  the other hand, the State's land loss has been highlighted in countless  feature stories, including in the New York Times and National  Geographic, to name two.   By the way, Google Maps can't keep up. When looking at the Louisiana  coastline, Google Maps will show an area with land that has now been  replaced with open water. Louisiana loses about, oh, a football field  of land, I think it is, an hour. Whenever I say it, I can't believe it,  it is so fast. It is so rapid. So not only does this pose a risk to the  energy assets, a risk to communities, and a risk to port assets; it  poses a risk to our national livelihood.   Now, folks in Louisiana are going to look at this and say: How is the  Great American Outdoors Act going to help us? We are going to work to  produce all this oil and gas, and we are not going to get any of the  benefits.   Senator Kennedy and I recently had a call with more than 20 Louisiana  parish presidents. They are, very understandably, concerned about the  lack of equity. ``Concerned'' is diplomatic. ``Ticked off'' is how  better to describe it.   I had another call with close to 100 businesses. They, too, are  pleading for equitable treatment along the gulf.   So when I speak about the Great American Outdoors Act cannibalizing  dollars from the Gulf of Mexico to spend money in places where people  don't live as opposed to protecting my coastline, which, in turn,  ensures tha we can continue to have the source of revenue--but also  coastlines around the Nation in counties and parishes where people  actually live as opposed to going to places where people only visit--I  am trying to make a case for those people.    Will you show the energy assets.   I have been speaking about these energy assets that are required. It  is one thing to say it; it is another thing to look at it. All of these  are part of the gulf coast energy infrastructure that the rest of our  Nation relies upon.   I am a doctor. I think like this. If you saw a map of the Nation, you  would see pipelines coming out of this region across the rest of the  Nation, and in my mind, as a doctor, I think of this as being a heart.  If we need energy to fuel our lives, the heart is right here, and it  beats here. The aorta, if you will, the pipelines that flow out, taking  gasoline to Philadelphia, taking natural gas to another part of our  country, taking the refined fuel products to Atlanta, GA, in the case  of jet fuel--you name it, they come out of this area.   If this area cannot be sustained, we cannot sustain that part of our  energy economy. We will not have jet flights to Hawaii or jet flights  from Atlanta around the world, as the hub, or for New Orleans, people  coming in for Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, or to Breaux Bridge for a crawfish  festival. It will not happen because this pipeline structure cannot be  sustained with a coastline which is eroding.   Some of these--let me just speak--are oil import sites, natural gas  market centers, processing facilities, liquefied natural gas export  facilities, strategic petroleum reserve, major working ports, such as  Port Fourchon. I could go on. These assets and companies then employ  hundreds of thousands of men and women contributing billions of dollars  in government revenues with an even greater impact on our annual GDP.   This is what powers our country. This is where the revenue is coming  from for the Great American Outdoors Act. This revenue stream will not  be sustainable if we don't at least have some consideration of how to  restore this.   The Senator from Ohio had spoken about a leaky roof and the leaky  roof increased its leak and now all those assets are being damaged  within a park. That is great. People like to visit parks, and we should  take care of leaky roofs. I am more concerned about a coastline that is  dissolving, and, as it dissolves, you lose the energy infrastructure,  which is required to pay for that park building to be fixed.   I will also point out the flooding risk for the folks in my State.  Again, I spoke about the communities at risk. This is predicted future  flooding from a 100-year flood event, without action. Let's just say,  if it is colored, it is bad, where you are going to get 0.5 to 5 feet  of water north of New Orleans.   If you want to speak about something that should be done now to  prevent future problems, I have bigger issues than a leaky roof in a  park building. I have entire communities washed away into the ocean, at  risk for great flooding. I am speaking of New Orleans. I could be  speaking of Miami, of Houston, of New York.   Why don't we spend money where people live as opposed to spending it  only where people vacation?   Now, you might be sitting in Iowa or Kansas or Nebraska thinking:  Well, I am only getting 0.2 percent of this money. I am not getting any  benefit whatsoever, but why does it matter to me to have a coastline?  Why does it matter to me at all?   Well, let's look at how investing in the coast impacts our Nation  economically. Let's look at what happened after Hurricane Katrina.  After Hurricane Katrina, the flooding took out the port structure in  South Louisiana; therefore, the in place for all the goods coming from  the Ohio, Missouri, Mississippi, and other rivers for export to the  rest of the world--the rest of the United States--was terribly  impacted. If you look at this--if we have a lack of coastal  investment--corn exports were down 23 percent post-Hurricane Katrina;  barley, down 100 percent; wheat, down 54 percent; soy, down 25 percent;  total grain exports, down 24 percent after Hurricane Katrina.   If that port system in South Louisiana and in the lower Calcasieu  River in Houston is damaged by flooding--that is going to happen under  current scenarios--then our midwestern farmers are not able to ship to  international markets. Their livelihood is damaged.   In moving goods across our country for export, one coalition  committed to ensuring future navigation on the Mississippi said that  the lower Mississippi has an estimated annual impact of $735 billion to  the Nation's economy and is responsible for 2.4 million jobs. That  starts with being able to navigate goods through the various locks and  port complexes near the mouth of the river.   The USDA recognizes this. It says in a report on the importance of  inland waterways that farm products are 14 percent of total commodities  moved along inland waterways. Further, processed flour, animal  feed, milled grain products, and fertilizers add another 5 percent to  agricultural related products.    It is important to remember, the Mississippi River Valley encompasses  almost 60 percent of our country, so many major rivers connect with the  Mississippi to deliver those products around the world. If we are going  to have a port system that is going to take those goods and allow them  to be transported around the world, it has to be a sustained,  reinforced coastline.   In my State, we have some of the largest barge and container ports in  the country. The Port of South Louisiana is the largest grain exporter  in the country. The Port of Baton Rouge is home to the largest grain  operator in the State. Ports farther to the south in  [[Page S2802]]  Mobile and Texas are, likewise, important.   If we are going to have rising sea levels and spend all of our money  on the inland areas--not where people live but where people visit on  vacation--as opposed to the coastlines, which have the ports that  sustain where people live and sustain the vitality of those in the  heartland, we are being foolish with our public policy.   The same USDA report highlighted the consequences of an inadequate  infrastructure along the waterways, saying that inadequate  infrastructure leads to reduced transportation capacity, raising  shipping rates, meaning less income to the farmers who are shipping-- which reduces U.S. economic activity--and a loss of global  competitiveness.   I could go on. I will just say that associated industries impacted by  the Iowa grain exports support business from agriculture, forestry,  real estate, restaurants, and pesticides, to name a few. This is just  in Iowa.   The ports in the gulf coast support those folks in Iowa, and we  should support the ports. We should support the ports, which support  Iowa.   To summarize, my colleagues and I are fighting for fairness and  equity. That is what this is about. I have highlighted obvious  inequities both in how the gulf region is treated and how other States  are treated--spending money not where people live but where people  visit.   I am pointing out the consequences to midwestern farmers. They don't  benefit very much at all--if you live in Iowa, Kansas, or Nebraska-- from the Great American Outdoors Act, but they would benefit from a  sustainable port system, which means that those ports they rely upon to  ship goods around the world will be there even as sea levels rise.   Now, I am all for, by the way, taking care of deferred maintenance in  parks, but I think, in the relative hierarchy of what we should do, we  should take care of where people live. And I will repeat once more: 42  percent of the people live in a parish or county that is directly on a  coastline; 82 percent of Americans live in a coastal State. That is not  where the bulk of these dollars are spent.   We have a bipartisan group of Senators supporting; we have  environmentally focused groups supporting as well, and what they are  supporting is an amendment which would actually help create this equity  that would allow dollars to be put into a fund to help coastal States-- where people live--but would be part of a bill to take care of where  people visit.   I wish it were the other way around, but those are not the priorities  of the people who are promoting the Great American Outdoors Act.   I thank you for this time.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
