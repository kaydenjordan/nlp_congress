 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Affordable Housing Redevelopment Act,'' which I introduced today.   I want to thank Senator Padilla for joining me on this important  bill, and Representatives Jared Huffman and Mike Thompson for leading a  companion measure in the House of Representatives.   Established in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the  Neighborhood Stabilization Program was created by Congress to help  provide assistance to communities hit hard by the recession by funding  the acquisition and rehabilitation of troubled residential properties.  [[Page S1030]]    The program helped States, local governments, and nonprofit  organizations acquire properties and rehabilitate or repurpose them as  long-term affordable housing.   Between 2008 and 2019, Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds have  facilitated the construction or rehabilitation of more than 50,000  homes, and the program has generated $1.8 billion in return income,  allowing communities to stretch Federal investments even further.   Today, more than 7.4 million units of affordable housing are needed  across the U.S. to meet the needs of low-income renters. In my home  State of California, more than 1.4 million units are needed to address  the State's affordable housing shortage.   Due to financial burdens and loss of income resulting from the COVID- 19 pandemic, millions of people in the United States are at risk of  eviction or foreclosure, and the need for more affordable housing is  expected to increase dramatically.   In addition to making long-term investments in building new  affordable housing in the United States, it is also critically  important to focus resources on more immediate solutions, such as  acquiring and rehabilitating existing buildings.   Acquisition and rehabilitation provides two distinct advantages: it  lowers per-unit construction costs and makes affordable housing units  available to low-income households much faster.   The ``Affordable Housing Redevelopment Act'' would reauthorize and  expand the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to help State and local  governments purchase blighted, vacant, abandoned, foreclosed, or  surplus properties, and convert them into affordable housing. Eligible  projects would include mixed-use development and conversions of non- residential office and retail properties.   All new units would have to serve households whose income does not  exceed area median income, and at least 25 percent of units would serve  households whose income does not exceed 50 percent of area median  income. Long-term affordability requirements would apply in all cases.   The bill would authorize $1.5 billion in discretionary appropriations  to be allocated as a competitive grant program administered by the  Department of Housing and Urban Development.   This bill provides a targeted and cost effective way for the Federal  government to help communities build more affordable housing, while  also stimulating local economies and creating jobs.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Booker, Mr. Markey,          Mr. Murphy, Ms. Warren, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Kaine,          Ms. Smith, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown, Mr. Schatz, Ms.          Klobuchar, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Ossoff, and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 582.
