 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Representative  Gallagher's bill, to get us some simple facts: How many Americans are  stranded and are we going to get them home.   Yes, these issues are important. We should debate these issues.  Infrastructure, healthcare, all of these issues are critical to our  country.   But the number one job of the Federal Government is to keep Americans  safe. Today, America is less safe. Americans are stranded behind enemy  lines, and they are not all going to get out by August 31.   Colleagues, what happens in Afghanistan does not stay in Afghanistan.  It will follow us home. Terrorism is a cancer that once again will  threaten the United States.   I want everyone to see this picture and remember it: Osama bin  Laden--by the way, then-Vice President Biden opposed the raid to bring  this man to justice. His deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri--know that name--who  is now leading al-Qaida, now has a terrorism playground from which to  plot and plan attacks on the United States once again.   The intelligence has been clear. Al-Qaida 3.0 will come roaring back.  The Taliban equals al-Qaida. As we head into the 20th anniversary of 9/ 11, we once again are going to face the prospect of more Pulse  nightclubs, San Bernardinos, and, God forbid, another 9/11.   What has me so upset, so flaming mad, as a veteran, as a Green Beret  that has had to fight this fight, is future soldiers are now going to  have to go back and deal with this again, but now with no bases, no  local allies, and a Taliban that is armed to the teeth with our own  equipment. That is unconscionable. It is unacceptable. If the White  House won't lead, then Congress will.
