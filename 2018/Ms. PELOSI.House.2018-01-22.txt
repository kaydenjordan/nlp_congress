 Here we are, Mr. Speaker, another day to take a deep  breath. As you know, our responsibility is to pass a budget that meets  the needs of the American people. Since September 30, which was the end  of the fiscal year, we have not done that.   Today, we are gathered to do our fifth continuing resolution. You  know all the statements that have been made by Secretary Mattis and  others about how destructive that is to our national security. I want  to make a few points.   First of all, I want to say that a dark cloud is lying over the  Capitol, and that is the Trump GOP tax scam. Under that legislation,  nearly $2 trillion will be added to the national debt. That is bad  enough in itself, but it also has cast a shadow over the ability of  this House to honor its responsibilities to the American people.   We take an oath of office to protect and defend the American people  and our Constitution. We know that is our first responsibility, and we  stand ready to join in funding our military to do that. So for the  Republicans to say that we are shutting down the government because we  didn't want--we weren't shutting down the government. You shut down the  government.   But let's put that aside for now as we go forward.   One, let us stipulate to the fact that we will all agree that we need  to support our troops in the manner that the mission that is  established calls for.   Two, the other part of that debate is about the domestic agenda. The  domestic agenda includes opioids and veterans, issues like that, that  are part of our national security, homeland security, Veterans'  Affairs, State Department, and antiterrorism activities at the Justice  Department--the list goes on--of things that are part of the security  function that are on the domestic side.   Our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle have been  reluctant to support domestic agendas. That is just the way it is, and  I think that is one of the reasons the Speaker has increased the  defense spending so that he can get their votes even though they didn't  want to vote for the domestic spending.   But if we are going to honor the commitment, not the dollar figure  that is in the authorization of the Department of Defense bill, and  honor the budget agreement, we will be adding $300 billion to the  deficit maintaining parity.                                time  1245    I just want our Republican colleagues to know that when they are  voting for a CR that takes us to the next step, that next step, if it  honors the commitments that have been made, it will be $300 billion  over and above the $2 trillion.   I just say that because I have heard you say: Well, we have a big  deficit, so we have to look at Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and  all of those initiatives. If we are not going to honor that, and we are  not going to honor other commitments because of this tax scam and this  Trump shutdown, then we have a problem going forward.   So, yes, we are here about values. It is not about one set of  children versus another. It is about our values. The Republicans have  put forth what they did with CHIP--which the Senate has never shown  much of an interest in--and all of a sudden, CHIP was their chit. CHIP  was their chit. They put that on the table, and they said: America is a  country of ``Sophie's Choice.'' You either choose the DREAMers, or you  choose the CHIP kids.   We all support all of that. America can take care of all of its  children--their safety, their health, and their well-being.   The dark cloud of the tax bill is a real problem as we go forward in  the decisions we have to make to meet the needs of the American people.   As Mr. Hoyer said, this is a budget debate. The DREAMers part of it  is a part that has come into it, but if there never was a DREAMer on  the face of the Earth--thank God, there are DREAMers--but if there  never were, we still have this challenge: the lack of interest on the  part of Republicans in the House to vote for a domestic budget that  meets the needs of the American people, using the excuse of the budget  deficit, which didn't seem to bother them when they gave away the store  to the richest people in the country, the top 1 percent and corporate  America.   As we face this decision today, it is a no-drama event, as far as I  am concerned. The Senate Democrats' movement, in terms of getting a  commitment on how we go forward on the budget and how we go forward on  DREAMers, good for them. Our Members will make their decision about how  they wish to vote.   But understand this: this isn't just about the DREAMers. This is  about who we are as a nation, in terms of honoring what we care about  most in our country and how we put that into a budget in terms of  fighting the opioid epidemic; meeting the needs of our veterans,  especially in terms of infrastructure; issues that relate to the  National Institutes of Health and their investments there; CHIP,  really, with the community health centers; medical education for  primary care doctors; and the list goes on and on.   This will be a lively debate about a number of subjects, as we go  forward. But understand this: it is going to increase the national  debt. It didn't have to have such an impact if we didn't have the GOP  tax scam, which led to the Trump shutdown.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I  associate myself fully with his remarks. I thank the gentleman, Mr.  Hoyer, for his great leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican's latest stopgap  funding bill. I take great pride in House Democrats overwhelmingly  supporting the first continuing resolution in September to give the  majority a chance to get the job done.   But after months of Republicans' excuses and extensions, I refuse to  be an  [[Page H619]]  enabler to the Republicans' failures any longer.   This past week once again exposed the utter incompetence of the  Republican-controlled government. Here we are ending the Trump shutdown  with Republicans' fourth stopgap short-term bill. The Republicans have  failed to get their act together for the fourth time to fund the  government for a full year.   In August, Defense Secretary Mattis was asked: What would be the  effect of another stopgap short-term spending bill on the military?   You all know he replied: ``It just creates unpredictability. It makes  us rigid. We cannot deal with new and revealing threats. We know our  enemies are not standing still.''   ``So it's about as unwise as can be.''   Mr. Speaker, there are also other statements for the Record to that  effect from the Navy Secretary, et cetera.   Now, the Trump shutdown will end, but Republicans' wasteful  incompetence continues. There is a dark cloud over the Capitol, Mr.  Speaker: the deficit-exposing GOP tax scam, which has added nearly $2  trillion to the national debt.   The Republicans have made their choice: tax breaks for corporations  and the wealthiest are more important than certainty for our military.   Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. They  control what bills we vote on in Congress. We could have brought up a  long-term bill long before now.                                time  1745    We have placed our suggestions on the table as to what would be on  the domestic side of that: resources for the opioid epidemic that kills  94 people every day in our country, for funding for veteran  infrastructure and services, for saving millions of Americans' pensions  in crisis today, for funding community health centers and lifesaving  research at the NIH, for childcare for hardworking parents, for  protecting patriotic young DREAMers, and, as our distinguished whip  said earlier, for making sure we have the resources for those affected  by hurricanes, fires, and especially our folks in Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands.   Because of the Republican majority's weakness, we still do not have a  long-term spending bill that funds the military and the domestic  investments that keep America strong. We take an oath of office to  protect and defend. Now we have to fund that.   We have not delivered strong disaster recovery funding to Puerto  Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other victims of hurricanes.   Congressional Democrats continue to propose bipartisan solutions, but  Republicans refuse to take yes for an answer.   We have not protected our courageous young DREAMers. Not only should  we protect them, we should embrace them and value them. We should be  grateful for the inspiration they are to America.   This is about meeting the needs of the American people. It is also  about honoring the values that have made our Nation a beacon to the  world.   Today we end the Trump shutdown, but it does not diminish our  leverage or our determination on the Democratic side to meet the needs  of the American people. Democrats are united in our determination to  get the job done. We are unified for a better deal, better jobs, better  pay, and a better future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to Republicans' latest stop-gap  funding bill.   I take great pride in House Democrats overwhelming support for the  first continuing resolution in September.   But after months of Republican excuses and extensions, I refuse to  enable Republicans' failure any longer.   The past week has once again exposed the utter incompetence of  Republican-controlled government.   Here we are, ending the Trump shutdown with Republicans' 4th stop- gap, short-term bill; the 4th time Republicans have failed to get their  act together to fund the government for a full year.   In August, Defense Secretary Mattis was asked: what would be the  effect of another stop-gap, short term spending bill on the military?   ``It just creates unpredictability,'' he said. `` It makes us rigid.  We cannot deal with new and revealing threats. We know our enemies are  not standing still . . . So it's about as unwise as can be.''   Navy Secretary Richard Spencer has said: ``We have put $4 billion in  a trash can, poured lighter fluid on it, and burned it . . . Four  billion is enough to buy a squadron of F-35s, two Arleigh Burke-class  destroyers, 3,000 Harpoon missiles. It's enough money to buy us  additional capacity that we need. Instead, it's lost, because of  inefficacy in the ways of the continuing resolution.''   Now, the Trump shutdown will end, but Republicans' wasteful  incompetence continues.   There's a dark cloud over the Capitol: the deficit-exploding GOP tax  scam--which has added nearly 2 trillion to the debt.   Republicans made their choice: tax breaks for corporations and the  wealthiest were more important than certainty for our military.   Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House--they  control what bills we vote on in the Congress.   So, my colleagues, why haven't we voted:   For resources for the opioid epidemic that kills 94 people every day?   For funding our veterans' infrastructure and services?   For saving the millions of American pensions in crisis today?   For funding community health centers & lifesaving research at NIH?   For child care for hard-working parents?   For protecting patriotic young DREAMers?   Why were tax breaks for billionaires and corporations so urgent?   120 days after allowing CHIP to expire, Republicans suddenly claim to  care about children on CHIP--but only as part of a cruel Sophie's  choice to pit sick children against DREAMers fearful for their future.   Because of the Republican Majority's weakness, we still do not have a  long-term spending bill that funds the military and the domestic  investments that keep our nation strong.   We have not delivered strong disaster recovery funding for Puerto  Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other victims of hurricanes and  wildfires.   Congressional Democrats continue to propose bipartisan solutions. But  Republicans refuse to take yes for an answer!   We have not yet protected our courageous young DREAMers. Not only  should we protect them, we should embrace them--value them. We should  be grateful for the inspiration they are to America.   This is about meeting the needs of the American people. This is about  honor the values that make our nation a beacon to the world.   Today, we end the Trump shutdown, but it does not diminish our  leverage or our determination to meet the needs of the American people.   Democrats are unified in our determination to get the job done. We  are unified for our Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better  Future. And our fight continues.
