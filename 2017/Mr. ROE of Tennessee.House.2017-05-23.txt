 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1808, the Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act,  which improves the Missing Children's Assistance Act.   Mr. Speaker, this Thursday is National Missing Children's Day. I  can't imagine the pain and suffering that occurs when a child goes  missing. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, and I am proud of  the Committee on Education and the Workforce for its work on this  important issue.   This legislation strengthens existing efforts to help recover missing  children and prevents more children from being victims of abuse and  exploitation.   This bill also includes a provision to incorporate developing  technologies related to the reporting of child exploitation. This  provision was a result of an idea shared by a constituent of mine,  Michael Reed. His wife was a victim of abuse as a child, and he has  devoted his life to making sure other children have a voice and the  ability to report the abuse that they are experiencing. I am committed  to ensuring that Congress is working to protect these children.   Mr. Speaker, I thank both sides of the aisle on the Education and the  Workforce Committee, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support  this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2288) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  reform the rights and processes relating to appeals of decisions  regarding claims for benefits under the laws administered by the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2288         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

If       a claimant requests to hold a hearing pursuant to such       section 7107, such request shall be deemed to be an election       to revert to the standard appeals process pursuant to       paragraph (2)(D).        (4) Duration; applicability.--        (A) Duration.--Subject to subsection (c), the Secretary may       carry out the program during such period as the Secretary       considers appropriate.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within  [[Page H4464]]  which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous  material in the Record on H.R. 2288, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2288,  as amended.   First, I want to thank the Disabilities Assistance and Memorial  Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Bost and Ranking Member Esty for their  hard work in bringing H.R. 2288 to the floor. I also want to thank  every member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, both Republican and  Democrat, who all are original cosponsors of this bill.   The committee has been working on overhauling the VA's appeals  process, which was established back in 1933. The problem is that the  current system is slow, cumbersome, frustrating, and full of  bureaucratic red tape. As a result, there are currently 470,000  veterans, many of whom may have been injured in the line of duty, who  are waiting for a decision on their appeal. Many of these folks have  been waiting for more than 5 years, and veterans are filing more  appeals every day.   Last year, VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson testified that if  Congress doesn't pass reform soon, by 2027, veterans may have to wait  as long as 10 years to get a decision on their appeal. Think about  that. In 2027, men and women who served our Nation may have to wait a  decade to get a decision on their appeal.   These veterans have bills to pay and families to support. Even worse,  they may need medical treatments that they can't get from the VA  because their appeal hasn't been decided.   Mr. Speaker, one of the dearest friends I have had in my life died a  little over 2 years ago, waiting on a decision on an appeal.   H.R. 2288 would help streamline the VA's appeals process, while  giving veterans more options and protecting their due process rights.  This legislation includes a compromise agreement that was reached  between VA and the veterans service organizations which passed the  House last Congress as part of H.R. 5620.   We have added a few improvements since last year. For example, we  have expanded the bill to allow some veterans who are currently having  pending appeals to opt in to the new system. I really believe that the  changes in this bill will make a difference and help expedite the  process so that veterans can get a decision on their appeal and then  get on with their lives.   I am going to pull out all the stops to get this bill on the  President's desk as soon as possible. We are talking with our  colleagues in the Senate, including Chairman Isakson, Ranking Member  Tester, and Senator Blumenthal, to resolve a few minor differences  between the House version and the Senate version.   The sooner we get this bill passed, the sooner our Nation's veterans  will be able to get their decisions on appeal in a timely manner.  Veterans deserve no less.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2288, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Bost), chairman of the DAMA Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Dunn), an active member on the committee and a  veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), a new member of our  committee and the only representative from Puerto Rico.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I must first  thank Chairman Roe for all of his leadership and work on behalf of our  veterans. I also thank Representative Bost and all of our committee  members for allowing me to contribute to this effort.   Today I rise to support H.R. 2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement  and Modernization Act. This bill will provide timely justice to the  brave Americans who gave their best in the name of democracy, freedom,  and the continuing greatness of our Nation.   As the sole representative of more than 93,000 registered veterans in  Puerto Rico, I established a Veterans Affairs Task Force, and one of  the main complaints they have is about the Veterans Administration's  and Board of Veterans Appeals' slow processing of their claims.   I believe every veterans service organization hears similar  complaints. The most recent statistics reveal a 5,000-case backlog for  claims originally filed by Puerto Rican veterans. One such Puerto Rican  claim has gone on for over 12 years, other claims for over 5  [[Page H4466]]  years. As of this date, the veterans are still waiting for the Board of  Veterans Appeals' decisions. This is not the justice system our  veterans deserve.    I am a proud sponsor of this bill, and this bill will provide heroic  veterans a system that is adjusted to their needs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a former member of our committee.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I, too, want to echo what Mr. Walz has said. It has been a pleasure  to work on this and what has been done in the previous Congress. I  think this is one of the most important bills that we voted on in the  Veterans' Affairs Committee since I have been in Congress. It is the  thing we hear about back home, Mr. Speaker, which is disability claims.  I think this actually will speed up that process and adjudicate those  claims.   I, too, thank all the staff and both subcommittee chairs and ranking  members for their hard work.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge all Members to support H.R. 2288, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 467) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  ensure that each medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs  complies with requirements relating to scheduling veterans for health  care appointments, to improve the uniform application of directives of  the Department, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 467         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 467, a bill that would codify  the VA's own directives for outpatient scheduling into law.   In June of 2010, the Veterans Health Administration issued VHA  Directive 2010-27, VHA Outpatient Scheduling Processes and Procedures.  This directive requires VHA facility directors to annually certify that  their facility is in full compliance with the scheduling procedures  outlined within the directive.   It is important to note that this directive was issued 4 years before  the scheduling scandal at the Phoenix VA broke, with no less than 40  veterans dying while being kept on secret lists, waiting for an  appointment. I believe this directive was a responsible way for the VA  to ensure that veterans were receiving the care that they came to the  VA for and were not slipping through the cracks.   Unfortunately, in May of 2013, then-Deputy Under Secretary for Health  at the VA waived this requirement for the VA medical facility directors  to adhere to the directive. As we now know, this waiver helped cover a  practice of malfeasance within scheduling departments at VA medical  facilities across the Nation.   As I mentioned before, in 2014, the House Committee on Veterans'  Affairs, with my friend, former Chairman Jeff Miller at the helm,  discovered secret waiting lists at the Phoenix VA, as well as many  other medical centers across the country. Had this directive still been  in place, I honestly believe the scandal could have been prevented.   Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that these scheduling  processes do not and cannot be dismissed by VA bureaucrats ever again.   I thank my good friend and former committee member, Representative  Jackie Walorski from Indiana, for sponsoring this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 467, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the vice chair and one of the most active  members of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), the sponsor of the bill and a  former member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1005) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  improve the provision of adult day health care services for veterans.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1005         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PROVISION OF ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR                     VETERANS.         (a) In General.--Section 1745 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(d)(1) The Secretary shall enter into an agreement under       section 1720(c)(1) of this title or a contract with each       State home for payment by the Secretary for adult day health       care provided to a veteran who is eligible for, but does not       receive, nursing home care pursuant to subsection (a).        ``(2) Payment under each agreement or contract between the       Secretary and a State home under paragraph (1) for each       veteran who receives care under such paragraph shall be made       at a rate that is equal to 65 percent of the payment that the       Secretary would pay to the State home pursuant to subsection       (a)(2) if the veteran received nursing home care under       subsection (a) rather than under paragraph (1) of this       subsection.        ``(3) Payment by the Secretary under paragraph (1) to a       State home for adult day health care provided to a veteran       described in that paragraph constitutes payment in full to       the State home for such care furnished to that veteran.'';       and        (2) in the heading, by inserting ``, adult day health       care,'' after ``home care''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 17 of such title is amended by striking       the item relating to section 1745 and inserting the following       new item:  ``1745. Nursing home care, adult day health care, and medications for                veterans with service-connected disabilities.''.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1005, a bill to improve  the provision of adult day healthcare services for veterans.   Last year, the Department of Veterans Affairs testified that 9.8  million veterans, or 46 percent of the veteran population, will be 65  years of age or older in 2017. Given that, the need to ensure that  veterans have ready access to a variety of geriatric and long-term care  services and supports is an increasingly important component of the  VA's mission.  [[Page H4469]]    Current law requires the VA to cover the cost of nursing home care in  a State Veterans Home for any veteran in need of such care due to a  service-connected disability or with a service-connected disability  rating of 70 percent or more. That authority is incredibly important  and has helped thousands of our veterans get the nursing home care they  need.   However, there is an increasing demand for VA to offer geriatric and  long-term care programs in noninstitutional settings that would allow  aging veterans to receive needed services and supports while remaining  in their homes surrounded by their loved ones.   To that end, H.R. 1005 would require VA to enter into an agreement or  a contract with State Veterans Homes to pay for adult day healthcare  for a veteran who is eligible for but not receiving nursing home care.   Adult day healthcare programs are a popular alternative to nursing  home care that provide veterans in need of case management, assistance  with activities of daily living, or other supportive services with  companionship, peer support, recreation, and certain healthcare  services. They also provide needed respite for caregivers.   By requiring VA to cover the cost of adult day healthcare programs at  State Veterans Homes for veterans who would otherwise qualify for VA- paid nursing home care, H.R. 1005 would expand access to this type of  care, which has been shown to maximize a veteran's independence and  quality of life and to extend an aging veteran's ability to remain at  home, which I think we would all want to do.   This bill has the support of the National Association of State  Veterans Homes, The American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans,  the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of  the United States.   I am grateful to my friend and former committee member, Lee Zeldin  from New York, for sponsoring this legislation and for shepherding it  to the House floor. I look forward to working with him and our  colleagues in the Senate to secure a quick passage over there as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 1005, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin) who is a former member of our committee and  sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello) who is a former member of our  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1005.    Once again, I urge all Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1162) to direct the Secretary  [[Page H4470]]  of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to provide access to  magnetic EEG/EKG-guided resonance therapy to veterans.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1162         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``No Hero Left Untreated       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Magnetic EEG/EKG-guided resonance therapy has       successfully treated more than 400 veterans with post-      traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military       sexual trauma, chronic pain, and opiate addiction.        (2) Recent clinical trials and randomized, placebo-      controlled, double-blind studies have produced promising       measurable outcomes in the evolution of magnetic EEG/EKG-      guided resonance therapy.        (3) The outcomes described in paragraph (2) have resulted       in escalating demand from returning members of the Armed       Forces and veterans who are seeking access to magnetic EEG/      EKG-guided resonance therapy.        (4) Congress recognizes the importance of initiating       innovative pilot programs that demonstrate the use and       effectiveness of new treatment options for post-traumatic       stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual       trauma, chronic pain, and opiate addiction.       SEC. 3. MAGNETIC EEG/EKG-GUIDED RESONANCE THERAPY PILOT                     PROGRAM.         (a) Pilot Program.--Commencing not later than 90 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs shall carry out a pilot program to provide       access to magnetic EEG/EKG-guided resonance therapy to treat       veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,       traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, chronic pain,       or opiate addiction.        (b) Locations.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot       program under subsection (a) at not more than two facilities       of the Department of Veterans Affairs.        (c) Participants.--In carrying out the pilot program under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall provide access to       magnetic EEG/EKG-guided resonance therapy to not more than 50       veterans.        (d) Duration.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot       program under subsection (a) for a one-year period.        (e) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the termination       of the pilot program under subsection (d), the Secretary       shall submit to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report on the pilot program.        (f) No Authorization of Appropriations.--No additional       amounts are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the       requirements of this section. Such requirements shall be       carried out using amounts authorized under provisions of law       other than this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1162, a bill to expand  the use of EEG/EKG-guided magnetic resonance therapy to treat veterans  with PTSD, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, chronic  pain, and opiate addiction at VA medical centers.   A 2016 VA report found that mental health conditions and substance  abuse among veterans is alarmingly high and steadily on the rise, up  from 27 percent in 2001 to over 40 percent in 2014. Perhaps even more  alarming, the same report showed that VA has increased its use of  prescription opioids by 259 percent over the same period to treat these  invisible wounds.   Magnetic resonance therapy, or MRT, is an emerging technology that  has been used to treat over 400 veterans with symptoms of their mental  conditions. MRT uses quantitative electroencephalogram,  electrocardiogram technology to target the affected areas of the brain  and apply repetitive magnetic stimulation to return normal function to  those areas.   MRT has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat  depression, and a 2015 study found that veterans who underwent 2 weeks  of treatment for PTSD reported an average of 47.4 percent reduction in  symptom severity. After 4 weeks of treatment, veteran participants saw  a 64 percent reduction in symptom severity on average. The same study  showed zero reports of worsening symptoms or adverse effects from the  treatment.   H.R. 1162 would create a 1-year pilot at two VA facilities during  which 50 veterans would be provided MRT treatment for PTSD, traumatic  brain injury, military sexual trauma, chronic pain, and opioid  addiction.                                time  1530    Ninety days after the end of the pilot, the Secretary of the VA would  issue a report to Congress on the efficacy of the pilot.   Mr. Speaker, with such promising results from preliminary tests of  MRT technology, I believe that we must act quickly to make this  emerging technology available to more veterans suffering from the  invisible wounds of war.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight), my  good friend and fellow Army veteran, for sponsoring this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 1162, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Knight), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, encourage all Members to  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1545) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  clarify the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to disclose  certain patient information to State controlled substance monitoring  programs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1545         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Prescription Data       Accountability Act 2017''.       SEC. 2. SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS DISCLOSURE OF PATIENT                     INFORMATION TO STATE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE                     MONITORING PROGRAMS.         Section 5701(l) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``Under'';        (2) by striking ``a veteran or the dependent of a veteran''       and inserting ``a covered individual''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(2) In this subsection, a `covered individual' is an       individual who is dispensed medication prescribed by an       employee of the Department or by a non-Department provider       authorized to prescribe such medication by the Department.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1545, the VA  Prescription Data Accountability Act of 2017. H.R. 1545 would require  the Department of Veterans Affairs to disclose information about any  individual prescribed medication by a VA employee or a provider  authorized by the VA to a State Prescription Drug Monitoring Program to  the extent necessary to prevent misuse and diversion of prescription  medication.   Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs are Statewide electronic  databases that collect and distribute information on prescription  medication to certain authorized individuals or entities. They are used  to identify and address prescription drug abuse, addiction, and  diversion.   While 90 percent of the VA's patient population are veterans, the VA  treats certain nonveterans, including Active-Duty servicemembers who  receive VA care through sharing agreements with the Department of  Defense, dependents, caregivers of veterans, and VA staff, to name a  few.   Current law authorizes the VA to disclose information to Prescription  Drug Monitoring Programs for veterans and dependents of veterans only.  The VA is not authorized to disclose information for other patients.   Moreover, technological barriers prevent the VA from transmitting  dependent data to Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. That means  that prescription drug information for nonveterans--10 percent of the  VA's patient population, which translates to more than 700,000 veterans  this fiscal year--is not being shared with Prescription Drug Monitoring  Programs today.   In light of ongoing concerns about the potential for misuse or  diversion of prescription medication, particularly opioid medications,  it is imperative that the VA share information about all VA patients,  veteran and nonveteran, to State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs.  It is a matter of public safety.   H.R. 1545 is supported by the American Legion, the Paralyzed Veterans  of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and by  the VA, who testified before the Subcommittee on Health earlier this  year that this authority would ``ensure that VA is able to fulfill its  public health role in sharing vital clinical information to help guide  treatment decisions.''   Mr. Speaker, this bill is sponsored by the gentlewoman of New  Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations, who is joined by the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Wenstrup), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health; the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Oversight and Investigations; and the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Brownley), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Health. I am  grateful to all of them for sponsoring this legislation. It has my full  support, and I urge all of our colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   In over 31 years of the practice of medicine, I have seen great  changes, many of them to the good. One of the things that has disturbed  me greatly is the opioid epidemic that we have in this great country at  this time. I am an obstetrician. I have delivered a lot of babies in my  career, and it was a rare event when we saw a baby that was addicted to  opioids--as a matter of fact, almost never until, literally, about 20  years ago, and 10 years ago a full-fledged epidemic.   In our hospital at home, we have a neonatal intensive care unit that  cares for nothing but opioid-addicted babies. In our State of  Tennessee, Mr. Speaker, we have had more people who died of  prescription drug overdose deaths than died in car wrecks. It now  exceeds many cancer deaths in the country.   This bill has my 100 percent support, and I certainly want to thank  Ms. Kuster for her great work on this bill. We have shared a trip to  Afghanistan together, as we did with Mr. Takano, and had a chance to  talk about these things in great detail. I want to thank her and also  the ranking member for their support in this.   I once again encourage all Members to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1725) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  improve the treatment of medical evidence provided by non-Department of  Veterans Affairs medical professionals in support of claims for  disability compensation under the laws administered by the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1725         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPORT ON PROGRESS OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS ACCEPTABLE CLINICAL EVIDENCE                     INITIATIVE.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report on the progress of the Acceptable       Clinical Evidence initiative of the Department of Veterans       Affairs in reducing the necessity for in-person disability       examinations and other efforts to comply with the provisions       of section 5125 of title 38, United States Code.        (b) Contents of Report.--The report required by subsection       (a) shall include the following:        (1) The number of claims eligible for the Acceptable       Clinical Evidence initiative during the period beginning on       the date of the commencement of the initiative and ending on       the date of the submittal of the report, disaggregated by       fiscal year.        (2) The total number of claims eligible for the Acceptable       Clinical Evidence initiative that required a medical examiner       of the Department to supplement the evidence with information       obtained during a telephone interview with a claimant.        (3) Information on any other initiatives or efforts of the       Department to further encourage the use of private medical       evidence and reliance upon reports of a medical examination       administered by a private physician if the report is       sufficiently complete to be adequate for the purposes of       adjudicating a claim.        (4) The anticipated impact on the timeline and accuracy of       a decision on a claim for benefits under chapter 11 or 15 of       title 38, United States Code, if the Secretary were       prohibited from requesting a medical examination in the case       of a claim in support of which a claimant submits medical       evidence and a medical opinion provided by a private       physician that is competent, credible, probative, and       otherwise adequate for the purpose of making a decision on       that claim.        (5) Recommendations on how the Department can measure,       track, and prevent the ordering of unnecessary medical       examinations when the provision by a claimant of a medical       examination administered by a private physician in support of       a claim for benefits under chapter 11 or 15 of title 38,       United States Code, is adequate for the purpose of making a       decision on that claim.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORT ON SUBMITTAL OF PRIVATE MEDICAL                     EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF CLAIMS FOR DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS BENEFITS.         Not later than March 1 of fiscal years 2018 through 2024,       the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to Congress a       report that includes, for the calendar year preceding the       year in which the report is submitted, the following for each       regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs:        (1) The number of times a veteran who submitted private       medical evidence in support of a claim for compensation or       pension under the laws administered by the Secretary was       scheduled for an examination performed by Department       personnel because the private medical evidence submitted was       determined to be unacceptable.        (2) The most common reasons why private medical evidence       submitted in support of claims for benefits under the laws       administered by the Secretary was determined to be       unacceptable.        (3) The types of disabilities for which claims for benefits       under the laws administered by the Secretary were mostly       commonly denied when private medical evidence was submitted.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 1725,  as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 1725, as amended, was introduced by my good friend Mr. Walz, the  ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.   This bill addresses a very serious issue. When a veteran files a  claim for disability benefits, VA may need a medical opinion regarding  whether the injury or illness is service connected and, if it is, the  extent of the veteran's disability. The problem is that the VA often  schedules a medical disability examination when one might not be  needed.   Many times, a veteran will submit medical evidence from a private  doctor with enough information for VA to decide the claim, but we hear  about cases where VA still requires a VA examination. Ordering  unnecessary disability examinations is a waste of time and resources.  It takes doctors away from taking care of their patients and conducting  other disability examinations.   H.R. 1725, as amended, would require VA to provide reports to  Congress about its use of private medical evidence. This information  will be used to help us find ways to make the disability examination  more efficient for veterans.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1725, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly endorse this  bill.   Mr. Walz, Sergeant Major Walz, speaks with great passion about it. He  has the Mayo Clinic in his district. I can't imagine an evaluation at  the Mayo Clinic by physicians there wouldn't be adequate for the VA.   I wholeheartedly support this bill, H.R. 1725, as amended. I urge all  Members to also support it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1329) to increase, effective as of December 1,  2017, the rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected  disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for  the survivors of certain disabled veterans, to amend title 38, United  States Code, to improve the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans  Claims, to improve the processing of claims by the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1329         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-      of-Living Adjustment Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND                     DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.         (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2017, the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance       with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November       30, 2017, for the payment of disability compensation and       dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions       specified in subsection (b).        (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be       increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:        (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar       amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the       dollar amounts under section 1115(1) of such title.        (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section       1162 of such title.        (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving       spouse.--Each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a)       through (d) of section 1311 of such title.        (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children.--      Each of the dollar amounts under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of       such title.        (c) Determination of Increase.--Each dollar amount       described in subsection (b) shall be increased by the same       percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts payable       under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et       seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2017, as a result       of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42       U.S.C. 415(i)).        (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made       under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation       payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72       Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter       11 of title 38, United States Code.       SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the       Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as       increased under that section, not later than the date on       which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to       be published by reason of a determination made under section       215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2018.     Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members have 5  legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 1329, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 1329, as amended, is one of the most important bills the House  will take up this year. This bill will help ensure that the benefits  paid to veterans who are disabled as a result of their military service  do not lose value because of inflation. H.R. 1329, as amended,  authorizes a cost-of-living increase for veterans and their families  next year as long as Social Security recipients receive an increase.   We pass this bill every year, and it has always enjoyed wide,  bipartisan support. This year's bill was introduced by the Subcommittee  on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Chairman Bost and Ranking  Member Esty.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1329, as amended, and help  disabled veterans and their families keep up with the rate of  inflation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Bost), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Chairman Bost.    Mr. Speaker. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from  [[Page H4477]]  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the vice chairman of our committee.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), my good friend and a member of our  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to thank my good friend, Sergeant Major Walz for his kind  words.   Certainly, what we try to do on the Veterans' Affairs Committee is  leave Republican and Democrat at the door of the committee room and go  and do the work of the veterans for what is best for them. It is a true  pleasure and honor, if you have ever attended one of our meetings, to  see that and to see the effort of all Members. And you can see here  today, with seven important pieces of legislation passed, it will help  improve the lives of our veterans.   I know, for me, that this time of the year--and I feel sure that my  friends on the other side of the aisle feel the same way--is one of the  most difficult times of the year. It is Memorial Day. And I don't think  we need to forget, this coming Monday, what that means. It is for all  of those who didn't make it home who protected this great country.   I know, myself, I get some guilt this time of year. I was a drafted  soldier, as many of us were. I served my time in 1973 and 1974 in  Korea, just south of the DMZ. Many of my friends didn't make it home  from Vietnam. I still feel for them and their families.   I know every Memorial Day, when I attend a service for veterans, it  is difficult for me to get through that day because I got to come home,  as all of us here who are serving did. We got to raise our children and  see our grandchildren be born. These men and women who died in Vietnam  and other wars didn't get to do that, as young people are doing today.  So I can't thank, enough, the veterans of this great Nation who serve  us every day and keep us free.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 1329, as  amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
