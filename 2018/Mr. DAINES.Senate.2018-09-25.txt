 Mr. President, the Medicare Advantage Quality Payment  Relief Act will protect and enhance Medicare benefits by reversing a  damaging policy created by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.   Obamacare attempted to provide better benefits for seniors and people  with disabilities who are enrolled in the highest rated Medicare  Advantage plans. But Obamacare also inadvertently limited these bonus  payments from ever reaching beneficiaries by putting a cap on the  payments, or benchmarks, that these Medicare plans receive. Now, 17,000  Montanans, and millions of Americans across the country--are being  denied the full scope of the Medicare benefits that they should be  receiving.   I'm glad to join with Senator Angus King of Maine to introduce  legislation that reverses this ill-advised policy. Our bill protects  Medicare benefits by removing the damaging limitation on payments to  Medicare Advantage plans with a 4-star rating or higher. This  legislation is crucial to ensuring that these top-rated Medicare  Advantage plans are offered throughout Montana and our country. Nearly  20% of Medicare beneficiaries in Montana, and one-third of Medicare  enrollees nationwide, receive their Medicare coverage through Medicare  Advantage plans.   I'm pleased that our legislation enjoys strong support from diverse  stakeholders, and I will continue to champion this issue on behalf of  seniors and people with disabilities in Montana who rely on Medicare  Advantage for their Medicare coverage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Medicare Advantage Quality Payment  Relief Act will protect and enhance Medicare benefits by reversing a  damaging policy created by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.
