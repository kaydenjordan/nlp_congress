 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay special recognition to the  Campbellsville University Lady Tigers women's basketball team upon  making the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky proud with another  successful college basketball season. The Lady Tigers finished with a  28-7 record and appeared in their second NAIA Fab Four round in 3  years.   In their final four game in Billings, Montana, against Oklahoma City,  two girls from my home county of Monroe had career highlights. Madison  Clements hit six 3-pointers and Lauren Turner had nine assists. The  Campbellsville University Lady Tigers are also coached by a Monroe  County girl, Ginger High Colvin.   The Campbellsville University Lady Tigers have been one of the most  dominant college girls basketball programs in the NAIA over the past 20  years. Campbellsville University is one of Kentucky's finest  educational institutions, and I am very proud that Campbellsville is in  the First Congressional District of Kentucky.                            ____________________
