 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I  may hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 391, a bill  originally introduced by Representative Chaffetz of Utah, for the  purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to  clause 7 of rule XII.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ferguson). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Louisiana?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
