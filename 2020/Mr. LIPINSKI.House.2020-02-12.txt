 Mr. Speaker, we will soon be voting on H.J. Res. 79,  which attempts to remove the deadline for ratification contained in the  equal rights amendment, which passed Congress in 1972.   Over the decades, we have made great strides in our Nation in  promoting and protecting women's rights. This year, we are celebrating  the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed women the  right to vote across our country.   A few months ago, I visited the Susan B. Anthony Birthplace Museum in  Adams, Massachusetts. It is a small but powerful museum that tells the  story of Susan B. Anthony and her work, along with other suffragists,  for the right to vote and for other rights for women.   When talking about how far we have come in equal rights for women, I  can't help but think of my own mother, who is now in her eighties. When  I graduated from eighth grade, she fulfilled her goal of graduating  from college, which she had never had a chance to do. When I went off  to college, she fulfilled a lifelong dream and went to law school; and,  in 1988, she graduated from Georgetown University Law School with her  law degree. It took her a long time to finally have these  opportunities, but she persevered and succeeded.   So I am thinking about my mother as well as my wife, who is an  actuary, and my sister, who is an attorney. I think about them when I  work on protecting women from discrimination and harassment in the  workplace, when I work for legislation for equal pay for women and for  other bills to guarantee equal treatment for women.   The equal rights amendment, as we now consider it, was passed by  Congress in 1972. There was a 7-year deadline placed by Congress on  States for ratification, just as there had been on a number of other  constitutional amendments. At the deadline, three-fourths of States had  not ratified it.   This week, Congress will be considering H.J. Res. 79, which  retroactively removes the deadline for ratification. There is much  controversy over whether this is constitutional. In addition, H.J. Res.  79 also requires a simple majority to pass.   Article V of the Constitution gives Congress the power to propose  constitutional amendments but requires a two-thirds vote in both the  House and the Senate. The original resolution introduced in the House  this year to remove the ERA deadline, H.J. Res. 38, required a two- thirds vote in both the House and the Senate.   In addition, we know that the Senate is highly unlikely to take up  this resolution. So, if Congress is interested in the equal rights  amendment being added to the Constitution, we should be considering  H.J. Res. 35, which would restart the process.   Just a couple of days ago, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime  supporter of the ERA, said Congress should do just this. Justice  Ginsburg said:         I would like to see a new beginning. I'd like to start       over.    She added:         There is too much controversy about latecomers. Plus, a       number of States have withdrawn their ratification. So, if       you count a latecomer on the plus side, how can you disregard       States that have said ``we've changed our minds''?    H.J. Res. 35, which would restart the process, could go through  committee, where it could be debated, potentially amended, and then  brought to the floor for further debate and possible amendment. In  doing so, we can clear up any points of contention about the impact  of the ERA and raise a consensus.    If we truly want to support the addition of the equal rights  amendment to the Constitution, this is what we should do. I support  doing this. Otherwise, we are simply casting a message vote.   This week when we vote on H.J. Res. 79, my message is yes. I will be  voting ``yes'' to demonstrate my support for protecting equal rights  for my wife, my mother, my sister, and for all women.                            ____________________
