 Madam Speaker, over the past 50 years, income inequality  has exploded in our country.   For decades, trickle-down economics has guided our country's fiscal  policy, selling the American people a bill of goods about how cutting  taxes for big business and the wealthy would eventually benefit society  at large.   Most Americans have experienced this policy failure firsthand. They  have watched the rich and powerful accumulate wealth while the middle  class shrinks and families struggle to stay afloat. Study after study  has shown that instead of promoting jobs or growth, tax cuts for the  rich have increased inequality.   It is time to reject the failed theory of trickle-down economics and  finally give everyday Americans a fair shot.   The Build Back Better Act will provide one of the biggest middle- class tax cuts in history and invest in the American people to build a  stronger, more inclusive economy.   The best part? It is paid for by making those at the top finally pay  their fair share.   The system has been rigged against most Americans for far too long.  We have a chance to fix it now. Let's get it done.                            ____________________
