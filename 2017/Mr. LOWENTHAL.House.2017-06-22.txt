 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of the bill, add the following:       SEC. 7. CONDITION ON APPLICABILITY.         This Act shall not apply to any project that the Secretary       determines could cause harm to commercial fisheries.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 392, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Lowenthal) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I, like many of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle, am concerned about  [[Page H5090]]  the long-term prospects for water infrastructure and storage in the  West.   As the western climate continues to get hotter, we are going to have  more hot, dry, drought years. That is why many States and communities,  including the cities that I represent, are doing all that they can to  make their water infrastructure more resilient, to reduce unneeded  runoff, to recycle water, and to store as much ground water as  possible.   To support these critical activities, Congress needs to invest in our  country's water infrastructure. The bill before us today does not do  any of these things. It does not authorize new or additional funding  for water projects. It is not an infrastructure bill.   Instead, the bill before us today makes many Americans nervous  because it loosens key environmental safeguards and imposes arbitrary  deadlines for the approval of dams on our rivers and streams. This bill  threatens the health of our streams, our rivers, and coastlines, which  could harm fish populations important to commercial fisheries.   Therefore, I am offering a straightforward amendment. It simply  requires proposed new dams to go through the normal project review  process if they are likely to harm commercial fisheries.   The construction of poorly permitted dams has been a major cause of  mortality for California's fisheries. In California's Central Valley,  they currently block Chinook salmon and steelhead from more than 90  percent of the historical spawning habitat.   My amendment will help protect my State's economically important  fisheries from further harm. Commercial fisheries from my home State  sustain thousands of jobs across California and the West Coast, and,  currently, we have what can only be described as a fisheries crisis.   Many fisheries are at record-low population levels. According to some  estimates, 78 percent of California's native salmon will be extinct or  disappear within the next century if current trends continue.   Simply put, many West Coast fishermen and fisherwomen who depend on  California's fish runs are hanging on by a thread. The thousands of  fishermen and fisherwomen, and other employees of restaurants, hotels,  and other businesses that depend on healthy fish runs, have been  struggling mightily.   Even now, many fishermen and fisherwomen are still recovering from  the total closure of the ocean salmon fishery along the West Coast in  2008 and 2009, because of poor California salmon returns. The closure  devastated the Pacific Coast fishing industry and, ultimately, required  millions of dollars in disaster aid from Congress.   In recent years, fishery managers have also had to severely restrict  commercial fishing season because of low population levels. My  amendment will help prevent future harm to people who are already  struggling just to get by.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, first I would point out to my friend  from California, if the climate continues to warm, we are not going to  be able to store as much water in our mountains as snow, and we are  going to need much more surface water storage reservoirs than the laws  have allowed us to build because of the delays they have imposed in  planning and construction.   The gentleman's amendment gives the Secretary of the Interior the  ability to ignore this streamlining law if he determines it could  ``cause harm to commercial fisheries.''   Well, now, remember, this bill makes no changes to any of our  existing laws or regulations. It makes no changes to the licenses and  permits required for a project or the criteria for obtaining those  licenses and permits. It makes no changes to any law or regulation that  could affect commercial fisheries or, for that matter, anything else.   It simply says that the agencies and jurisdictions involved with  these projects have to cooperate and coordinate and communicate with  each other, and it requires the science guiding these decisions to be  available to the public to review and scrutinize.   So why the amendment? Well, for one reason and one reason only, I  think, because for the last 8 years, we have had an administration that  was actively hostile to constructing new reservoirs. That  administration has used the fragmented nature of the approval process  as a way to delay projects indefinitely. That is what this proposal  corrects.   Mr. Lowenthal's amendment would allow any administration so inclined  to make a specious finding as an excuse to ignore this law. Project  applicants would not know from one election to the next whether their  millions of dollars of studies and investments would suddenly come to  naught, and projects already well along in the planning and approval  process could find their efforts coming to a screeching halt.   For our laws to work, they must be predictable and fair. Mr.  Lowenthal's amendment is a poison pill to render this law unpredictable  and capricious.   The irony is this: the gentleman's constituents in southern  California have the most to lose from his amendment because southern  California depends on surplus water from northern California. And let  me make this very clear to the gentleman and his constituents: northern  California has first claim on northern California water.   If we can't store the extra water in the north, there is no surplus  for the south, and the gentleman's constituents can look forward to  dead lawns and gardens, brown parks, empty swimming pools, astronomical  water and electricity prices, spiraling grocery prices, and a future  where they will have to ration and stretch every drop of water and  every watt of electricity in their parched and sweltering homes. They  might want to ask him about that some day.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?   The CHAIR. The gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal) has 1\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?   The CHAIR. The gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal) has 1\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  northern California (Mr. Huffman).    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record three letters,  including one from the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's  Associations, which is the largest organization of commercial fishing  families on the West Coast, collectively representing thousands of  family-wage jobs and the West Coast commercial fishing industry that  contributes billions of dollars to the U.S. economy, strongly opposing  this bill, H.R. 1654, and supporting the amendment.                                            Pacific Coast Federation                                     of Fishermen's Associations,                                                      June 12, 2017.        Dear Representative: The Pacific Coast Federation of       Fishermen's Associations (PCFFA) is the largest organization       of commercial fishing families on the West Coast,       representing the interests of hundreds of family-owned       commercial fishing operations who harvest and deliver fresh       seafood to American consumers and for export. Collectively,       we represent many thousands of family wage jobs and a West       Coast commercial fishing industry that contributes billions       of dollars to the U.S. economy.        On behalf of the hundreds of hard working commercial       fishermen we represent, we are OPPOSED to H.R. 1654 for many       reasons, among them the following:        While the concept of streamlining permitting for federal       water projects is attractive on its face, our primary problem       in the arid west is not a lack of water storage projects, but       lack of funds for maintaining and repairing the many existing       projects that are already in place. Hundreds of existing       water projects are badly in need of repair, with many       dangerously close to failing. And as we recently witnessed       with the catastrophic failure of the Oroville Dam, an       ``expedited review process'' like what is envisioned in H.R.       1654 could lead to poor or rushed impacts analyses       potentially resulting in further catastrophe or economic       disruption. It is now apparent that the Oroville Dam's 2017       emergency spillway failure was predicted--but the warning       signs were ignored--in its expedited environmental impacts       review process.        H.R. 1654 is simply the wrong approach. It would undermine       existing laws protecting both the public and public resources       by making the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) the       lead agency for all environmental reviews, in effect leaving       Reclamation in control of the entire environmental review       process. However, Reclamation has neither the expertise nor       the capacity of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the       National Marine Fisheries Service to inform the development       of major infrastructure projects to reduce their impact on       valuable wildlife and fisheries. Under H.R. 1654, these       agencies would be stripped of their authority and duties to       oversee and authorize water storage projects, to the       detriment of the people of the West and the American       taxpayer.        H.R. 1654 also implements overly restricted and burdensome       project review timelines, including provisions that would       require expedited review under the National Environmental       Policy Act (NEPA)--timelines that may be inappropriate for       very complex projects like the damming of streams and rivers.       These fast-tracking provisions interfere with the ability of       agencies and the public to meaningfully analyze proposed       complex projects, and could also limit the public's ability       to weigh in on infrastructure developments that could affect       communities for decades. Further, the bill permits non-      federal public entities to contribute funds to expedite       project permitting, raising serious conflicts of interest       questions about the fairness and impartiality of the federal       review process.        H.R. 1654 also establishes perverse incentives for western       states to cede their independent authority. Under the new       regulatory scheme, state agencies could be compelled to       adhere to the bill's procedures, thereby requiring those       state agencies to cede control to Reclamation and comply with       its timelines. This weakens the essential and independent       role that states play in reviewing proposed water       infrastructure projects within their borders.        We sincerely request that you vote NO on H.R. 1654. This       bill will not solve the problems it purports to address, and       it would have widespread consequences far beyond water       deliveries and water storage, including adverse effects to       regional and local fishing industry economies and the jobs       and communities those economies support.            Sincerely,                                                    Noah Oppenheim,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  American Rivers,                                     Washington, DC, April 26, 2017.      U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of the U.S. House Committee on Natural       Resources: I am writing on behalf of American Rivers and our       200,000 members to oppose H.R. 1654, the Water Supply       Permitting Coordination Act, which is before the Committee on       April 26, 2017. We understand that new surface storage       projects are a consideration as part of a multi-faceted       portfolio aimed at addressing long term drought in the       Western United States. We also share Congress' view that       long-term, balanced solutions to drought and water supply       security that support and protect local economies, the       viability of agriculture, municipal water supplies,       recreation, and the riparian environment are critical to the       future of Western communities. H.R. 1654, however, fails to       provide a long-term, balanced solution, and goes far beyond       the scope of authorities vested in the Bureau of Reclamation       (the ``Bureau'') while undermining the critical role other       federal agencies, tribes, and states play in the permitting       of water supply projects in the West. We remain concerned       about the potential harmful impacts to management authorities       designed to protect streams and conserve watersheds. In light       of these concerns, we ask you to oppose H.R. 1654.        This legislation amends the Reclamation Act, 43 U.S.C. 371,       et seq., in a way that undermines the management authorities       of other federal agencies, tribes, and states. H.R. 1654       allows the Bureau to preempt state laws and procedural       requirements for agency decision-making by dictating       unreasonable deadlines. It also weakens authorities under       Endangered Species Act and Clean Water Act, as well as other       federal laws, by subordinating all other State and federal       agencies to the Bureau's sense of how much time those       administering agencies should have to do their jobs.        Specifically, H.R. 1654:        Designates the Bureau as the lead agency and allows the       Bureau to set the schedule for all federal authorizations,       including those issued pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA),       the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Federal Land Policy and       Management Act (FLPMA), the Coastal Zone Management Act       (CZMA), the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA), and other       federal authorizations, even where those authorizations have       been delegated or devolved to the states or Native American       tribes.        Forces all other federal, state, and tribal agencies to       comply with the Bureau's schedule and to defer to the       Bureau's proposed scope of environmental review.        Effectively waives the Endangered Species Act or the Clean       Water Act if a state, tribe, or federal agency cannot meet       the Bureau's schedule or misses a deadline. The Bureau and       the project applicant may simply proceed with the proposed       action and the authorization is waived. There are no similar       remedies or penalties if the Bureau or the project applicant       fails to meet a deadline, or if delay caused by Bureau or the       project applicant results in an agency missing a deadline.       The end result of this and the following provisions could be       that states and tribes may be forced to deny certification       for new projects in order to avoid potential legal liability.        It is important that federal natural resource agencies       retain the authority and responsibility to condition       operations of surface storage projects so as to protect       streams and other public resources. A key part of protecting       watersheds, especially in the arid West, is maintaining       healthy flows in streams. For years, American Rivers has       worked with the federal land management agencies, tribes,       states and other stakeholders to protect healthy river flows       on public lands. Federal land managers, states, tribes and       the public have an important role to play in protecting       streams--based on the Property Clause of the Constitution,       Section 505 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act,       and other authorities--and they also have a responsibility to       work with their stakeholders to do it right. Provisions of       H.R. 1654 would harm the ability of federal land managers,       states, and tribes to use these authorities to protect       streams, rivers, and vital fisheries.        We oppose H.R. 1654, and urge Congress to carefully       consider the impacts of the legislation on federal, tribal       and state authority before proceeding further and determine       if legislation is needed.            Sincerely,                                              Matthew Niemerski,                                           Director, Federal Policy,      American Rivers.                                   ____                                   Golden Gate Salmon Association,                                        Petaluma, CA, June 12, 2017.      Re H.R. 1654 (McClintock)--OPPOSE.         Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: The       Golden Gate Salmon Association is a coalition of salmon       fishermen and women, both sport and commercial, and related       businesses. As a business-oriented advocacy organization       focused on conservation and restoration of Central Valley       salmon stocks, with members throughout California, we write       to offer our strong opposition to H.R. 1654 (McClintock), the       ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act.'' This       legislation threatens tens of thousands of fishing related       jobs and could result in severe impacts to a salmon fishing       industry that is highly vulnerable today.  [[Page H5092]]                Surface Storage and California's Salmon Fishing Industry         Surface storage projects have been the leading cause of the       decline of California's historic salmon fishery. In the past       decade, surface storage projects contributed to the first       ever, historic closure of the California salmon fishery in       2008 and 2009. A fishery worth an estimated $1.4 billion in       annual economic activity to California in a normal season was       shattered. This had devastating impacts on the 23,000 men and       women whose livelihoods depend on the commercial and       recreational salmon fishery.        In significant part as a result of dam projects, the health       of our coastal fishing communities has decreased. We've seen       a decline in the number of commercial salmon boats registered       to fish from almost 5,000 in the late 1980's to just over       1,000 today. Once bustling salmon ports, like Fort Bragg and       Eureka are lined with crumbling docks and pier pilings. In       some places there aren't enough fish crossing the docks to       maintain basic infrastructure like boat repair yards, fuel       docks and ice making machines. Where once proud freshly       painted houses beamed pride of fisherman ownership, too many       are sadly in need of repair. Go to any California harbor with       commercial fishing activity and inspect the deck hardware and       rigging on boats and you'll see what deferred maintenance       looks like for people who struggle to keep a roof over their       family's heads and pay the bills.        Because of low populations of adult salmon in 2017, salmon       fishing for much of Northern California has been closed       entirely this year. For the remainder of the California       coast, the commercial fishing fleet has lost approximately       two thirds of their traditional fishing season. These low       population numbers are the result of the drought and the       impacts of existing surface storage projects.        Decision-makers should respond to this crisis by       strengthening efforts to restore salmon runs. However, H.R.       1654 could increase the impacts of dam projects on salmon,       with potentially devastating consequences.                              Specific Concerns         This legislation threatens to weaken analysis and       permitting for surface storage projects, with significant       potential impacts on salmon. GGSA offers the following       specific concerns.        Interfering With The Use of the Best Available Science: The       bill would allow the Bureau of Reclamation to control the       administrative record used by all federal agencies in       reviewing surface storage projects. At best, the Bureau lacks       the environmental expertise of the regulatory agencies on a       range of issues, including salmon. In addition, as a       potential applicant for surface storage projects, the Bureau       would have a clear conflict of interest, were they to be       given control of the record used by all federal agencies.       Further, the Bureau has a record of asserting dubious       environmental benefits from surface storage projects and       working to suppress analysis by federal agencies. As a       result, it is highly inappropriate for the Bureau to be given       control of a single administrative record to be used by all       federal agencies.        Interfering with Agency Review: The bill would give the       Bureau authority to establish a binding schedule for all       federal agency environmental review and permitting. For the       same reasons cited above, this is inappropriate. In addition,       this requirement would produce unnecessary, costly and time       consuming litigation, in the likely event that a schedule       adopted by the Bureau does not allow adequate time for review       by regulatory agencies.        Undermining State Review of Projects: In cases where states       chose to opt in, the bill would give the Bureau control over       the administrative record and schedule for state agencies. In       such a case, the bill would allow the Bureau undue control       over state analysis and permitting. This is highly       inappropriate, given more than a century of traditional       federal deference to state law.        Surface Storage Bias: Surface storage construction and       operation is among the water management activities with the       most severe impacts on salmon and salmon rivers. This       legislation inappropriately restricts analysis for the most       environmentally destructive method of storing water and       generating new water supplies, but not for less destructive       activities.        For the above reasons, we urge you to oppose this damaging       and unnecessary bill.        Thank you for considering our comments.            Sincerely,                                                      John McManus,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, by that token, I will include in the  Record the support of the United States Chamber of Commerce as well as  the Family Farm Alliance and others in support of this bill and the  jobs that will expand as a result of its adoption.                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                      Washington, DC, June 20, 2017.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce urges you to approve H.R. 1654, the       ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act,'' which would       streamline the permitting process for new surface water       storage projects. The Chamber may consider including votes       on, or in relation to, H.R. 1654 in our annual How They Voted       scorecard.        H.R. 1654 would establish the Bureau of Reclamation as the       lead agency for coordinating environmental reviews and       permitting new or expanded non-federal surface storage       facilities. The bill also would allow the Secretary of the       Interior to accept funds from non-federal public entities and       to use those funds to expedite the permitting process for       designated projects. This type of coordination and       streamlining is essential to the development and construction       of much-needed water storage projects.        The structure of H.R. 1654 tracks the permit streamlining       provisions contained in Title 41 of the Fixing America's       Surface Transportation Act, which was passed during the 114th       Congress. The Chamber urges you to approve H.R. 1654.            Sincerely,                                                   Neil L. Bradley,      Senior Vice President & Chief Policy Officer.                                   ____                                             Family Farm Alliance,                                   Klamath Falls, OR, March 8, 2017.      Hon. Tom McClintock,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman McClintock: On behalf of the Family Farm       Alliance (Alliance), we write to express our support for your       ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act''. This important       legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to       coordinate Federal and State permitting processes related to       the construction of new surface water storage projects on       lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior       and the Secretary of Agriculture and to designate the Bureau       of Reclamation as the lead agency for permit processing, and       for other purposes.        The Alliance is a grassroots organization of family       farmers, ranchers, irrigation districts and allied industries       in 16 Western states. Several of our members are mutual ditch       and irrigation districts. The Alliance is focused on one       mission: To ensure the availability of reliable, affordable       irrigation water supplies to Western farmers and ranchers.        The ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act'' provides a       critical first step towards addressing current regulatory and       bureaucratic challenges that many times will delay or even       halt the development of new water supply enhancement projects       in the Western United States. The recent drought has ramped       up much-needed Congressional interest to enact legislation       that will allow Western water providers to better manage and       prepare for future dry times. Now, the heaviest rain in a       decade has overwhelmed parts of the West Coast, underscoring       the critical importance of having modernized and enhanced       water storage infrastructure in place to optimize water       resources management for the future.        Family Farm Alliance members rely on the traditional water       and power infrastructure built over the last century to       deliver irrigation water supplies vital to their farming       operations. Our membership has been advocating for new water       storage facilities for over twenty years, and we have       provided specific recommendations to Congress and the White       House on how to streamline restrictive federal regulations to       help make these projects happen.        As you are aware, developing new water storage projects is       much easier said than done. For many reasons--political,       economic and social--the construction of traditional surface       water storage projects is undertaken on a much more limited       basis than in decades past. Even if federal authorization and       funding, or funding from non-federal sources, is secured for       a new storage project, the existing procedures for permitting       the development of additional water supplies can make project       approval incredibly burdensome.        By the time project applicants approach federal agencies       for permits to construct multimillion dollar projects they       have already invested extensive resources toward analyzing       project alternatives to determine which project is best       suited to their budgetary constraints. However, current       procedure dictates that federal agencies formulate another       list of project alternatives which the applicant must assess,       comparing potential impacts with the preferred alternative.       These alternatives often conflict with state law or are       simply not implementable in the first place yet valuable       resources are required to be expended to further study these       additional alternatives in the federal permitting process.        Thus, we strongly support your bill. We look forward to       working with you, the 115th Congress and other interested       parties to build a consensus for improving the federal       regulatory and permitting process. If we don't find a way to       restore water supply reliability for Western irrigated       agriculture through a combination of new water supply and       management infrastructure, other water supply enhancement       efforts and demand management--our country's ability to feed       and clothe itself and the world will be jeopardized.        This bill takes an important step towards addressing this       critical need. I encourage you or your staff to contact Dan       Keppen if you have any questions.            Sincerely,      Patrick O'Toole,        President.      Dan Keppen,        Executive Director.

Re Support for H.R. 1654.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The       Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) is pleased to       support H.R. 1654, the ``Water Supply Permitting Coordination       Act''. ACWA's 450 public water agency members supply over 90       percent of the water delivered in California for residential,       agricultural, and industrial uses.        As demonstrated by California's recent historic drought, it       is important that Congress take actions now that help ensure       California has sufficient water supplies for the future. Had       the streamlining provisions contained in H.R. 1654 been in       effect prior to the drought, California's water       infrastructure and water supplies could have been improved to       help mitigate much of the current personal and economic       suffering that occurred.        Moreover, H.R. 1654 is consistent with policy principles       ACWA has formally adopted embracing environmental and       economic sustainability as co-equal priorities for water       management in California.        Thank you for this opportunity to express ACWA's support       for H.R. 1654.            Sincerely,                                                    David Reynolds,      Director of Federal Relations.                                   ____                                                  Voith Hydro Inc.                                            York, PA, June 20, 2017.      Hon. Tom McClintock,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman McClintock: On behalf of Voith Hydro, I am       writing today to extend our strong support for H.R. 1654, the       Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act. Voith Hydro is a       manufacturer of hydroelectric equipment and technology based       in York, Pennsylvania. Additionally, we have Voith Hydro       Services facilities located in Chattanooga, Tennessee and       Springfield, Oregon. Voith Hydro currently employees       approximately 680 workers across the United States. Water       storage issues are critical to our ability to provide both       the energy and jobs that sustain a nation.        As you are well aware, water provides multiple benefits to       communities across the country. Without an abundant supply of       water storage in the United States, hydropower production       cannot reach its full potential. These same communities have       been able to thrive in large part due to abundant water       supplies and the production of renewable hydropower,       especially in your home district in Northern California.       Increasing water storage throughout the country will allow       for better management during drought conditions, and thus       prevent power outages to communities reliant on       hydroelectricity.        Streamlining the permitting process to expand and develop       new water storage throughout the United States is critical to       increasing and upgrading our Country's infrastructure. I am       pleased to see that Congress continues to consider bills       targeted to improve the permitting processes and hope that       other infrastructure permitting streamlining continues,       especially as it concerns hydropower development.        I encourage the passage of the Water Supply Permitting Act       this week in the House of Representatives and look forward to       working with you on similar issues in the future. Thank you       for your leadership on water storage and other critical       issues.            Sincerely,                                                   Robert J. Gallo,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                            Municipal Water District                                                of Orange County,                                  Fountain Valley, CA, May 30, 2017.      Hon. Tom McClintock,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman McClintock: The Municipal Water District       of Orange County (MWDOC) is pleased to support your measure,       H.R. 1654--``The Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act.''       We applaud your efforts to streamline the permitting process       that relates to the construction of new surface water storage       projects on lands. This coordination is long overdue and will       ultimately benefit the entire state.        The rains this past winter emphasized the critical need       California has for surface water storage. We cannot let this       resource slip out to the ocean due to lack of places to put       it. Allowing the Bureau of Reclamation to be the coordinating       agency for projects on Interior or Department of Agriculture       lands will make the process more efficient and speed up the       process for critical water infrastructure projects in our       state.        The Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC), a       water agency serving the needs of more than two million       residents and 28 retail water agencies, voted unanimously to       support your legislation and to assist with its passage.        On behalf of the MWDOC Board of Directors, we are pleased       to support H.R. 1654 and sincerely thank you for your efforts       to address the ongoing water infrastructure needs in       California.        Should you have any questions regarding this matter, lease       feel free to contact either Jim Barker, our advocate in       Washington, or MWDOC General Manager, Rob Hunter.            Sincerely,                                                  Wayne S. Osborne,                                                   Board President.    Mr. McCLINTOCK.
