 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Our work on the House floor today is the culmination of more than a  year's effort to craft legislation in the Energy and Commerce Committee  that will save lives and help stem the tide of the opioid crisis that  has struck at the health of our people wherever they live in America.    In my Oregon district, I have held multiple roundtable discussions  with parents, with those addicted, and with those who treat the  addicted. I have talked with law enforcement officials and emergency  room physicians. I have sought the counsel and the advice of those who  are closest to this national problem, and I have worked with my  colleagues to carefully craft legislation that responds to the need and  to their suggestions.   The headlines--we know they are everywhere--tell the tragic stories  of loved ones gone far too soon. We are confronting an addiction that  mercilessly seizes control and then destroys. This killer doesn't  discriminate--not by age, not by race, not by where you live, or what  you believe.   We are here because opioid addiction continues to take the lives of  more than 100 people in America each and every day. These are real  people in all of our districts--people like Amanda.   Just this past January, Amanda was seeking relief from the pain  surrounding her mental illness. She ended up dying from an overdose of  fentanyl. Her father bravely shared his family's story with our  committee, hoping that their loss would help spur Congress to modernize  Federal laws. It is for the young people like Amanda and her parents-- people like Amanda who tragically lost their bright futures--that we  come together today to advance so many bipartisan pieces of  legislation.   And it is for families like hers, the ones who are left behind with  the heartbreak of a loss so many of us could never comprehend, that we  will not rest until we have won the fight against opioid addiction.   From passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, known  as CARA, and the 21st Century Cures Act last Congress under the able  leadership of Chairman Fred Upton, to the $4 billion in new funding  passed earlier this year by this Congress, we have worked long and hard  to help families and communities in despair.   Last fall, the Health Subcommittee chairman, Mr. Burgess of Texas,  invited all Members of the U.S. House to come before his Health  Subcommittee and to share their best ideas on how to combat this  crisis. We heard from more than 50 Members--Republicans, and Democrats  alike.   This spring, the Energy and Commerce Committee held a series of  legislative hearings examining ways to protect our communities, to  boost our public health and prevention efforts, and to improve  treatment and care for patients of all ages and all backgrounds.   While the work was not always easy, Mr. Speaker, the Energy and  Commerce Committee has advanced 57 different pieces of legislation to  this House floor, most with unanimous support, that may well be a  record for legislating on a single issue.   So while the surge of addiction looms large before us, I believe that  we as a Congress and we as the American people are up to this task. The  bills before us are not our first efforts in this fight, and you have  my word they will not be the last.   But I urge my colleagues today, tomorrow, the rest of this week, and  next week to support the legislation before the House. We have an  opportunity to save lives. We have a responsibility to our families,  friends, communities, our neighbors, and our Nation to lift people out  of addiction and to get America on a better path.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), who has been a real leader on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on this bill, so I  would encourage support of H.R. 449, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5473) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to update or issue one or more guidances addressing alternative methods  for data collection on opioid sparing and inclusion of such data in  product labeling, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5473         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Better Pain Management       Through Better Data Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. GUIDANCE ADDRESSING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO DATA                     COLLECTION AND LABELING CLAIMS FOR OPIOID                     SPARING.         (a) In General.--For purposes of assisting sponsors in       collecting and incorporating opioid-sparing data in product       labeling, the Secretary of Health and Human Services       (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall       conduct a public meeting and update or issue one or more       guidances in accordance with subsection (b).        (b) Guidance.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human       Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs,       shall update or issue one or more guidances addressing--        (A) alternative methods for data collection on opioid       sparing;        (B) alternative methods for inclusion of such data in       product labeling; and        (C) investigations other than clinical trials, including       partially controlled studies and objective trials without       matched controls such as historically controlled analyses,       open-label studies, and meta-analyses, on opioid sparing for       inclusion in product labeling.        (2) Contents.--The guidances under paragraph (1) shall       address--        (A) innovative clinical trial designs for ethically and       efficiently collecting data on opioid sparing for inclusion       in product labeling;        (B) primary and secondary endpoints for the reduction of       opioid use while maintaining adequate pain control;        (C) use of real world evidence, including patient       registries, and patient reported outcomes to support       inclusion of opioid-sparing data in product labeling; and        (D) how sponsors may obtain feedback from the Secretary       relating to such issues prior to--        (i) commencement of such data collection; or        (ii) the submission of resulting data to the Secretary.        (3) Public meeting.--Prior to updating or issuing the       guidances required by paragraph  [[Page H5032]]       (1), the Secretary shall consult with stakeholders, including       representatives of regulated industry, academia, patients,       and provider organizations, through a public meeting to be       held not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of       this Act.        (4) Timing.--The Secretary shall--        (A) not later than 12 months after the date of the public       meeting required by paragraph (3), update or issue the one or       more draft guidances required by paragraph (1); and        (B) not later than 12 months after the date on which the       public comment period for such draft guidances closes,       finalize such guidances.        (c) Definition.--In this section:        (1) The terms ``opioid sparing'' and ``opioid-sparing''       refer to the use of drugs or devices (as defined in section       201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.       321)) that reduce pain while enabling the reduction,       replacement, or avoidance of oral opioids.        (2) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health       and Human Services.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of this legislation, and  I want to thank Representatives Comstock and Lujan for their leadership  on it.   This bill would take steps to facilitate the development of products  that reduce, replace, or prevent the use of opioids. Specifically, this  legislation will direct the FDA to hold a public meeting and update the  agency's guidance on opioid sparing data that can be used to support  updated product labeling and claims.   For many Americans, Mr. Speaker, dealing with chronic or acute pain,  there are limited alternatives to opioids, but for some patients, there  may be therapeutic alternatives which do not share the same risks  inherent in opioid use. This bill will facilitate the process of  getting information to providers and patients at a critical juncture in  their treatment.   By reducing the need to start an opioid, we can stop addiction before  it starts, and we can save countless lives in the process. So I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of this narrowly tailored, commonsense, and  noncontroversial measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this  legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it.   I commend the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan) and the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) for their tireless work on  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3331) to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to  promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health providers  for adoption and use of certified electronic health record technology,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3331         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H5033]]            SECTION 1. TESTING OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR BEHAVIORAL                     HEALTH PROVIDERS FOR ADOPTION AND USE OF                     CERTIFIED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD TECHNOLOGY.         Section 1115A(b)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act (42       U.S.C. 1315a(b)(2)(B)) is amended by adding at the end the       following new clause:        ``(xxv) Providing, for the adoption and use of certified       EHR technology (as defined in section 1848(o)(4)) to improve       the quality and coordination of care through the electronic       documentation and exchange of health information, incentive       payments to behavioral health providers (such as psychiatric       hospitals (as defined in section 1861(f)), community mental       health centers (as defined in section 1861(ff)(3)(B)),       hospitals that participate in a State plan under title XIX or       a waiver of such plan, treatment facilities that participate       in such a State plan or such a waiver, mental health or       substance use disorder providers that participate in such a       State plan or such a waiver, clinical psychologists (as       defined in section 1861(ii)), nurse practitioners (as defined       in section 1861(aa)(5)) with respect to the provision of       psychiatric services, and clinical social workers (as defined       in section 1861(hh)(1))).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Representative Jenkins, who is here  and going to speak in a moment; Representative Matsui, who is also here  and going to speak in a moment; Representative Mullin; and others who  are working together on this bill.   H.R. 3331 will open an opportunity to accelerate the use of  electronic health records for behavioral health providers. Behavioral  health providers were left out of the HITECH incentives, leading to a  lower rate of adoption and creating a gap in continuity of care at a  point when it is most needed.   If there is one place you don't want a data-drop in care provided it  is with those who have sought care, but their doctors don't know about  it because they don't have the technology they need. No patient should  face the risks of being rerouted to opioids because their provider did  not have the full picture of a patient's history.   During the thorough legislative process the Energy and Commerce  Committee has engaged in to get here today, we have heard from several  witnesses and stakeholders on the importance of better utilizing  technology. So it is a natural step to let CMMI test the impact of  connecting behavioral health providers with the rest of the healthcare  community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R.  3331.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: On May 9 and 17, 2018, the Committee       on Energy and Commerce ordered favorably reported over 50       bills to address the opioid epidemic facing communities       across our nation. Several of the bills were also referred to       the Committee on Ways and Means.        I ask that the Committee on Ways and Means not insist on       its referral of the following bills so that they may be       scheduled for consideration by the Majority Leader:        H.R. 1925, At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act of 2017;        H.R. 3331, To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to       promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health       providers for adoption and use of certified electronic health       record technology;        H.R. 3528, Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act;        H.R. 4841, Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for       Safe Prescribing Act of 2018;        H.R. 5582, Abuse Deterrent Access Act of 2018;        H.R. 5590, Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act;        H.R. 5603, Access to Telehealth Services for Opioid Use       Disorder;        H.R. 5605, Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use       Disorders in Medicare Act;        H.R. 5675, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act       to require prescription drug plan sponsors under the Medicare       program to establish drug management programs for at-risk       beneficiaries;        H.R. 5684, Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5685, Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act;        H.R. 5686, Medicare Clear Health Options in Care for       Enrollees (CHOICE) Act;        H.R. 5715, Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid       Abuse Act;        H.R. 5716, Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber       Accountability and Safety for Seniors (COMPASS) Act;        H.R. 5796, Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy       Outcomes for Users' Treatment (REACH OUT) Act of 2018;        H.R. 5798, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management       Alternatives for Seniors Act;        H.R. 5804, Post-Surgical Injections as an Opioid       Alternative Act; and        H.R. 5809, Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018.        This concession in no way affects your jurisdiction over       the subject matter of these bills, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bills be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Ways and Means on the       conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include       this letter and your response in the bill reports and the       Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for your letter concerning       several bills favorably reported out of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce to address the opioid epidemic and which       the Committee on Ways and Means was granted an additional       referral.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       within these bills that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction       of the Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of the following bills so that they may move       expeditiously to the floor:        H.R. 1925, At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act of 2017;        H.R. 3331, To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to       promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health       providers for adoption and use of certified electronic health       record technology;        H.R. 3528, Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act;        H.R. 4841, Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for       Safe Prescribing Act of 2018;        H.R. 5582, Abuse Deterrent Access Act of 2018;        H.R. 5590, Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act;        H.R. 5603, Access to Telehealth Services for Opioid Use       Disorder;        H.R. 5605, Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use       Disorders in Medicare Act;        H.R. 5675, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act       to require prescription drug plan sponsors under the Medicare       program to establish drug management programs for at-risk       beneficiaries;        H.R. 5684, Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5685, Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act;        H.R. 5686, Medicare Clear Health Options in Care for       Enrollees (CHOICE) Act;        H.R. 5715, Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid       Abuse Act;        H.R. 5716, Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber       Accountability and Safety for Seniors (COMPASS) Act;        H.R. 5796, Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy       Outcomes for Users' Treatment (REACH OUT) Act of 2018;        H.R. 5798, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management       Alternatives for Seniors Act;        H.R. 5804, Post-Surgical Injections as an Opioid       Alternative Act; and        H.R. 5809, Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation and requests your support for       such a request.        Finally, I would appreciate your commitment to include this       exchange of letters in the bill reports and the Congressional       Record.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.

I urge passage, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4284) to establish a Federal Coordinator within the  Department of Health and Human Services, and for other purposes, as  amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 4284,  the Indexing Narcotics, Fentanyl, and Opioid Act of 2018, more easily  known as the INFO Act.   This legislation will facilitate the linking of all nationwide health  efforts and strategies to combat the opioid crisis into one place, as  well as create an interagency substance abuse disorder coordinating  committee to review and coordinate research, services, and prevention  activities across all relevant Federal agencies. This is going to be a  tremendous resource for patients, families, and local communities and  their leaders. I want to thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Latta) for  leading this important initiative.   I think all of us in our districts, Mr. Speaker, have heard directly  from people saying: I don't know what resources are there at the  Federal level. I don't know where to go access it. Can't you do  something?   That is why Mr. Latta, who chairs our Subcommittee on Digital  Commerce and Consumer Protection, rose to the challenge and put  together this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta)  to discuss the importance of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, would encourage our colleagues to  support this fine piece of legislation and, again, commend its authors  for doing the good work that will help so many in our districts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4684) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services,  acting through the Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment  of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, to  publish and disseminate best practices for operating a recovery  housing, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4684         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Access to Quality       Sober Living Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL RECOVERY HOUSING BEST PRACTICES.         Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act is       amended by adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 399V-7. NATIONAL RECOVERY HOUSING BEST PRACTICES.         ``(a) Best Practices.--The Secretary of Health and Human       Services, in consultation with the Secretary for Housing and       Urban Development, patients with a history of opioid use       disorder, and other stakeholders, which may include State       accrediting entities and reputable providers, analysts, and       stakeholders of recovery housing services, such as the       National Alliance for Recovery Residences, shall identify or       facilitate the development of best practices, which may       include model laws for implementing suggested minimum       standards, for operating recovery housing.        ``(b) Dissemination.--The Secretary shall disseminate the       best practices identified or developed under subsection (a)       to--        ``(1) State agencies, which may include the provision of       technical assistance to State agencies seeking to adopt or       implement such best practices;        ``(2) recovery housing entities; and        ``(3) the public, as appropriate.        ``(c) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) The term `recovery housing' means a shared living       environment free from alcohol and illicit drug use and       centered on peer support and connection to services,       including medication-assisted treatment services, that       promote sustained recovery from substance use disorders.        ``(2) The term `State' includes any of the several States,       the District of Columbia, each Indian tribe or tribal       organization (as those terms are defined in section 4 of the       Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act), and       any territory or possession of the United States.        ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this       section, there is authorized to be appropriated $3,000,000       for the period of fiscal years 2019 through 2021.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 4684,  Ensuring Access to Quality Sober Living Act of 2018.   This legislation will require the Department of Health and Human  Services to develop and disseminate best practices for operating  recovery housing.   We heard a lot about these issues in the course of our investigation  and in our legislative work. Recently, an increasing number of reports  have revealed the nefarious practice of patient brokering. This is  where individuals known as ``patient brokers'' treat men and women with  a substance use disorder as a commodity. They push them to seek  treatment at certain outpatient facilities and to live at affiliated  recovery residences while undergoing treatment.   In exchange for steering patients towards specific facilities and  housing, patient brokers then receive generous financial kickbacks.  Oftentimes, the residence and the treatment center involved in the  kickback scheme lack any oversight, transparency, or accountability.  This legislation will help ensure that recovery residences maintain  safe and supportive environments for those who are in recovery.   I would like to thank my California colleagues, Judy Chu, Mimi  Walters, and Raul Ruiz, along with Florida Representative Gus  Bilirakis, for addressing this important issue and bringing this  legislation to the committee and to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5037]]         Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5800) to require the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access  Commission to conduct an exploratory study and report on requirements  applicable to and practices of institutions for mental diseases under  the Medicaid program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5800         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

This Act may be cited as the ``Medicaid Institutes for       Mental Disease Are Decisive in Delivering Inpatient Treatment       for Individuals but Opportunities for Needed Access are       Limited without Information Needed about Facility Obligations       Act'' or the ``Medicaid IMD ADDITIONAL INFO Act''.

(a) In General.--Not later than January 1, 2020, the       Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission established       under section 1900 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1396) shall conduct an exploratory study, using data from a       representative sample of States, and submit to Congress a       report on at least the following information, with respect to       services furnished to individuals enrolled under State plans       under the Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act (42       U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) (or waivers of such plans) who are       patients in institutions for mental diseases and for which       payment is made through fee-for-service or managed care       arrangements under such State plans (or waivers):        (1) A description of such institutions for mental diseases       in each such State, including at a minimum--        (A) the number of such institutions in the State;        (B) the facility type of such institutions in the State;       and        (C) any coverage limitations under each such State plan (or       waiver) on scope, duration, or frequency of such services.        (2) With respect to each such institution for mental       diseases in each such State, a description of--        (A) such services provided at such institution;        (B) the process, including any timeframe, used by such       institution to clinically assess and reassess such       individuals; and        (C) the discharge process used by such institution,       including any care continuum of relevant services or       facilities provided or used in such process.        (3) A description of--        (A) any Federal waiver that each such State has for such       institutions and the Federal statutory authority for such       waiver; and        (B) any other Medicaid funding sources used by each such       State for funding such institutions, such as supplemental       payments.  [[Page H5041]]         (4) A summary of State requirements (such as certification,       licensure, and accreditation) applied by each such State to       such institutions in order for such institutions to receive       payment under the State plan (or waiver) and how each such       State determines if such requirements have been met.        (5) A summary of State standards (such as quality       standards, clinical standards, and facility standards) that       such institutions must meet to receive payment under such       State plans (or waivers) and how each such State determines       if such standards have been met.        (6) Recommendations for actions by Congress and the Centers       for Medicare & Medicaid Services. such as how State Medicaid       programs may improve care and improve standards and including       a recommendation for how the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid       Services can improve data collection from such programs to       address any gaps in information.        (b) Stakeholder Input.--In carrying out subsection (a), the       Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission shall seek       input from State Medicaid directors and stakeholders,       including at a minimum the Substance Abuse and Mental Health       Services Administration, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid       Services, State Medicaid officials, State mental health       authorities, Medicaid beneficiary advocates, health care       providers, and Medicaid managed care organizations.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Representative sample of states.--The term       ``representative sample of States'' means a non-probability       sample in which at least two States are selected based on the       knowledge and professional judgment of the selector.        (2) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the 50 States,       the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth or territory       of the United States.        (3) Institution for mental diseases.--The term       ``institution for mental diseases'' has the meaning given       such term in section 435.1009 of title 42, Code of Federal       Regulations, or any successor regulation.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, sponsored by my colleagues, Representatives  Upton, Walters, Blackburn, and myself, requires the Medicaid and CHIP  Payment and Access Commission, known as MACPAC, to submit to Congress  by January 1, 2020, a report about the services furnished to Medicaid  enrollees who are patients in an IMD, that is, an institute of mental  disease.   As we know, an IMD is a facility of more than 16 beds that is  primarily engaged in providing diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons  with mental diseases, including treatment for individuals with  substance use disorder.   Now, since the 1960s, Medicaid's IMD exclusion has limited the  circumstances under which Federal Medicaid matching funds are available  for inpatient mental healthcare. This means that Medicaid beneficiaries  with mental health or substance use disorders are statutorily barred  from receiving care in an IMD.   While Medicaid has the IMD exclusion, there is great need for this  care. According to SAMHSA's 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and  Health, about 8 million people--8 million, Mr. Speaker--had a mental  disorder and a substance use disorder, also known as co-occurring  mental and substance use disorders.   So where do Medicaid beneficiaries get the inpatient care they need?  That is the question.   First, States can provide Medicaid coverage for services rendered in  facilities that do not meet the definition of an IMD, such as  facilities with 16 or fewer beds, and facilities that are not primarily  engaged in providing care to individuals with mental diseases.   Second, States can get a waiver to allow for IMD services to be  reimbursed. However, as we all know, waivers take a lot of time, and  not all States have them.   So because of these complications, there is a great variation, and,  frankly, little information on IMD services. That information is  limited to one GAO report about types of institutional care.   The goal of this legislation is to better help Congress and CMS  understand how current Medicaid dollars are being used to provide care  for patients with substance use disorder and mental health disease in  an IMD. This bill seeks to identify gaps in our knowledge about IMDs  and leverage MACPAC's research capabilities to help address these gaps.   Given the broad bipartisan interest in ensuring patients have access  to the full continuum of care, we want to ensure Congress and CMS  understand how Medicaid dollars for services are being used, whether  that is under a waiver, under managed care, or under fee-for-service  Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Upton), the former chairman of the full committee, the chairman of the  Energy Subcommittee, who was very instrumental in this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I don't believe I have any other speakers on  this legislation, so I would urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5042]]         Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5009) to include information concerning a patient's opioid  addiction in certain medical records, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5009         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as ``Jessie's Law''.       SEC. 2. INCLUSION OF OPIOID ADDICTION HISTORY IN PATIENT                     RECORDS.         (a) Best Practices.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services, in consultation with appropriate stakeholders,       including a patient with a history of opioid use disorder, an       expert in electronic health records, an expert in the       confidentiality of patient health information and records,       and a health care provider, shall identify or facilitate the       development of best practices regarding--        (A) the circumstances under which information that a       patient has provided to a health care provider regarding such       patient's history of opioid use disorder should, only at the       patient's request, be prominently displayed in the medical       records (including electronic health records) of such       patient;        (B) what constitutes the patient's request for the purpose       described in subparagraph (A); and        (C) the process and methods by which the information should       be so displayed.        (2) Dissemination.--The Secretary shall disseminate the       best practices developed under paragraph (1) to health care       providers and State agencies.        (b) Requirements.--In identifying or facilitating the       development of best practices under subsection (a), as       applicable, the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate       stakeholders, shall consider the following:        (1) The potential for addiction relapse or overdose,       including overdose death, when opioid medications are       prescribed to a patient recovering from opioid use disorder.        (2) The benefits of displaying information about a       patient's opioid use disorder history in a manner similar to       other potentially lethal medical concerns, including drug       allergies and contraindications.        (3) The importance of prominently displaying information       about a patient's opioid use disorder when a physician or       medical professional is prescribing medication, including       methods for avoiding alert fatigue in providers.        (4) The importance of a variety of appropriate medical       professionals, including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists,       to have access to information described in this section when       prescribing or dispensing opioid medication, consistent with       Federal and State laws and regulations.        (5) The importance of protecting patient privacy, including       the requirements related to consent for disclosure of       substance use disorder information under all applicable laws       and regulations.        (6) All applicable Federal and State laws and regulations.       SEC. 3. COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILIES DURING EMERGENCIES.         (a)  Promoting Awareness of Authorized Disclosures During       Emergencies.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services,       acting through the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare       & Medicaid Services and the Administrator of the Health       Resources and Services Administration, shall annually develop       and disseminate written materials (electronically or by other       means) to health care providers regarding permitted       disclosures under Federal health care privacy law during       emergencies, including overdoses, of certain health       information to families, caregivers, and health care       providers.        (b) Use of Material.--For the purposes of carrying out       subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services       may use material produced under section 11004 of the 21st       Century Cures Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d-2 note).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 5009.  This is known as Jessie's Law, and it is written in memory of Michigan  resident Jessie Grubb, who tragically died of an opioid overdose in  2016.   This legislation will help ensure medical professionals have access  to a consenting patient's complete health information when making  treatment decisions. This is critical to ensure that mistakes, such as  the one that tragically happened to Jessie Grubb, never ever, ever  happen again.   This bill also incorporates the language of H.R. 5695, known as  Emmett's Law, which would require the Department of Health and Human  Services to develop best practices for healthcare providers on  permitted disclosures of medical records during emergencies with  families, caregivers, and other healthcare providers.   I thank my colleagues from Michigan, Representatives Tim Walberg and  Debbie Dingell, for leading this important initiative, along with the  collaboration and support of Representatives Evan Jenkins, Carol Shea- Porter, Tom MacArthur, Vicky Hartzler, Bob Latta, and  David McKinley.  They have all put a lot of time and effort into this to solve a problem  many of us have encountered in our States and our districts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Walberg), an author of this incredibly important piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I encourage my  colleagues to support this legislation. I thank the Members from  Michigan who brought it to our attention, and worked with the full  Energy and Commerce Committee in bringing it to your disposal here on  the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5041) to amend the Controlled Substances Act to authorize  the employees of a hospice program to handle controlled substances in  the residence of a deceased hospice patient to assist in disposal, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5041         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Disposal of Unused       Medication Act''.       SEC. 2. DISPOSAL OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES OF A DECEASED                     HOSPICE PATIENT BY EMPLOYEES OF A QUALIFIED                     HOSPICE PROGRAM.         Subsection (g) of section 302 of the Controlled Substances       Act (21 U.S.C. 822) is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(5)(A) In the case of a person receiving hospice care, an       employee of a qualified hospice program, acting within the       scope of employment, may handle, without being registered       under this section, any controlled substance that was       lawfully dispensed to the person receiving hospice care, for       the purpose of disposal of the controlled substance after the       death of such person, so long as such disposal occurs onsite       in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, Tribal, and       local law.        ``(B) For the purposes of this paragraph:        ``(i) The terms `hospice care' and `hospice program' have       the meanings given to those terms in section 1861(dd) of the       Social Security Act.        ``(ii) The term `employee of a qualified hospice program'       means a physician, nurse, or other person who--        ``(I) is employed by, or pursuant to arrangements made by,       a qualified hospice program;        ``(II)(aa) is licensed to perform medical or nursing       services by the jurisdiction in which the person receiving       hospice care was located; and        ``(bb) is acting within the scope of such employment in       accordance with applicable State law; and        ``(III) has completed training through the qualified       hospice program regarding the disposal of controlled       substances in a secure and responsible manner so as to       discourage abuse, misuse, or diversion.        ``(iii) The term `qualified hospice program' means a       hospice program that--        ``(I) has written policies and procedures for assisting in       the disposal of the controlled substances of a person       receiving hospice care after the person's death;        ``(II) at the time when the controlled substances are first       ordered--        ``(aa) provides a copy of the written policies and       procedures to the patient or patient representative and       family;        ``(bb) discusses the policies and procedures with the       patient or representative and the family in a language and       manner that they understand to ensure that these parties are       educated regarding the safe disposal of controlled       substances; and        ``(cc) documents in the patient's clinical record that the       written policies and procedures were provided and discussed;       and        ``(III) at the time following the disposal of the       controlled substances--        ``(aa) documents in the patient's clinical record the type       of controlled substance, dosage, route of administration, and       quantity so disposed; and        ``(bb) the time, date, and manner in which that disposal       occurred.''.   [[Page H5044]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the best ways we can fight the opioid crisis is  by decreasing diversion of prescription drugs. This bill does just  that, giving hospice employees new tools to dispose of unused  medications on-site after a patient's death.   During the committee process, several thoughtful amendments were  offered to perfect this language. For example, one clarified that the  training will be conducted by the hospice program, not the Federal  Government.   Another added a recordkeeping standard for hospice programs to  maintain information within patients' clinical charts of the controlled  substance dosage, number of pills, and the way it is disposed of.   And finally, a technical amendment incorporated comments from the  DEA.   Of note, there is one final technical correction incorporated into  the suspension document, which clarifies that hospice employees may  handle these unused controlled substances. This specification,  obviously, improves the bill.   In closing, Michigan Representative Tim Walberg and Representative  Debbie Dingell should be commended for, once again, their bipartisan  and thoughtful work on this legislation. They worked tirelessly to  forge an inclusive process, incorporating input from people in  Michigan, hospice groups across the country, the agencies who will  oversee this program, and others. Even more, their staff showed real  initiative and reason as we put this together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Walberg), my colleague, to discuss this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on this matter, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on this matter. I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5102) to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize a  loan repayment program for substance use disorder treatment employees,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5102         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 5102.  This is the Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Act. It is  legislation that would create a loan repayment program for substance  use disorder treatment providers.   Serious workforce shortages exist for all health professions across  the United States. We know that. But a delay in addiction treatment for  a patient with substance use disorder can be a life-or-death situation.   By offering student loan repayment for those who agree to work as a  substance use disorder treatment professional in an underserved area,  this bill encourages more people to enter the substance use disorder  treatment field and get critical services to areas that are seriously  in dire need of treatment.   I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives Katherine Clark,  Hal Rogers, John Sarbanes, and Brett Guthrie, for leading this  important initiative. It is brought to you from your Energy and  Commerce Committee with a unanimous vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before I recognize my colleague from Kentucky, I just want to say,  Mr. Rogers has spent many, many years leading nationally not only here  in the Congress, but nationally and in Kentucky on this issue of  addiction and the scourge of opioids as they have flooded into our  area. His leadership has been very, very valuable in this endeavor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Speaker, I would do the same, urge passage of the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5176) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to provide coordinated care to patients who have experienced a non- fatal overdose after emergency room discharge, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 5176,  the Preventing Overdoses While in Emergency Rooms Act, or the POWER  Act. This legislation will provide needed resources to help hospitals,  health departments, and health systems to develop discharge protocols  for patients who have had an opioid overdose, such as the provision of  naloxone upon discharge, and referrals to treatment and other services  that best fit the patients' needs.   By putting rapid referral systems in place, we can better place those  presenting with an overdose in evidence-based treatment and get  patients on the road to recovery.   I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives  David McKinley of  West Virginia and Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania, for leading this  initiative. I am going to yield to my colleague from West Virginia, but  before I do, I just want to say what a leader  David McKinley has been  on this issue involving opioids.   We have met on countless occasions. He has brought many initiatives  to our committee. While he is the lead on this bill, he has been  instrumental on nearly all the bills that we have considered and has  been a tireless advocate for the people of West Virginia in this  matter.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).    Mr. Speaker, I just want to, again, thank our leaders on  this effort, Mr. Doyle and certainly Mr. McKinley. I would encourage  passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.

(a) In General.--Section 505(d) of the Federal Food, Drug,       and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(d)) is amended--        (1) in the first sentence--        (A) by striking ``or (7)'' and inserting ``(7)''; and        (B) by inserting ``or (8) if the drug is or contains a       controlled substance for which a listing in any schedule is       in effect under the Controlled Substances Act or that is       permanently scheduled pursuant to section 201 of such Act, on       the basis of information submitted to him as part of the       application, or upon the basis of any other information       before him with respect to such drug, the drug is unsafe for       use due to the risks of abuse or misuse or there is       insufficient information to show that the drug is safe for       use considering such risks;'' before ``he shall issue an       order refusing to approve the application''; and        (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``(6)'' and       inserting ``(8)''.         (b) Withdrawal Authority.--Section 505(e) of the Federal       Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(e)) is amended in       the first sentence--        (1) by striking ``or (5)'' and inserting ``(5)''; and        (2) by inserting the following: ``; or (6) that, in the       case of a drug that is or contains a controlled substance for       which a listing in any schedule is in effect under the       Controlled Substances Act or that is permanently scheduled       pursuant to section 201 of such Act, on the basis of new       information before him with respect to such drug, evaluated       together with the information available to him when the       application was approved, that the drug is unsafe for use due       to the risks of abuse or misuse'' after ``of a material       fact''.        (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in the amendments made       by this section shall be construed to limit or narrow, in any       manner, the meaning or application of the provisions of       paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (7) of section 505(d)       of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.       355(d)) or paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 505(e) of such       Act (21 U.S.C. 355(e)).      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this legislation, and I  want to commend my friend and ranking member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey. He has worked  tirelessly on this very important policy.   Hundreds of millions of parcels containing illicit or unapproved  drugs enter the United States supply chain each year, and they do it  through international mail facilities. Through the mail, Mr. Speaker.   That poses a major threat to public health. These parcels are often  difficult to identify as they contain little or no labeling, and the  Food and Drug Administration's current detention and destruction  authorities over these parcels, turns out, it is pretty limited.   H.R. 5228 seeks to strengthen FDA's authority to refuse and destroy  substances identified through these international mail facilities and  improve enforcement mechanisms available to the agency to combat the  influx of illegally manufactured opioids into the country.   I know, in my conversations with Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who heads the  FDA, he has added the resources he could find within his agency and has  brought many of these issues to our attention. He has been a real  leader on this issue for the Trump administration, and I thank him for  his work.   But it is clear this bipartisan legislation that Mr. Pallone brings  to us today is essential as we join together to interdict and stop the  flow of illegal drugs into the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage passage of this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  just want to again say, as my friend and colleague from New Jersey has  outlined, you understand the importance of why we need to make these  changes under the law. I again commend him for his work on this.   I encourage all my colleagues to support this very critical piece of  legislation. This could do more to stop the flow of this illegal  fentanyl and the death it brings to our country than any other thing we  can do.   I commend the gentleman for his work on this. I encourage support of  the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5261) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for  regional centers of excellence in substance use disorder education, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5261         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Treatment, Education, and       Community Help to Combat Addiction Act of 2018'' or the       ``TEACH to Combat Addiction Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE IN                     SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER EDUCATION.

An eligible entity       designated by the Secretary as a Regional Center of       Excellence in Substance Use Disorder Education shall carry       out the activities described in subsection (b).        ``(b) Selection of Centers of Excellence.--        ``(1) Eligible entities.--To be eligible to receive a       cooperative agreement under subsection (a), an entity shall--        ``(A) be an entity specified by the Secretary that offers       education to students in various health professions, which       may include--        ``(i) a health system;        ``(ii) a teaching hospital;        ``(iii) a medical school;        ``(iv) a certified behavioral health clinic; or        ``(v) any other health profession school, school of public       health, or Cooperative Extension Program at institutions of       higher education engaged in an aspect of the prevention,       treatment, or recovery of substance use disorders;        ``(B) be accredited by the appropriate educational       accreditation body;        ``(C) demonstrate an existing strategy, and have in place a       plan for continuing such strategy, or a proposed strategy to       implement a curriculum based on best practices for substance       use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery;        ``(D) demonstrate community engagement and participation       through community partners, including other health profession       schools, mental health counselors, social workers, peer       recovery specialists, substance use treatment programs,       community health centers, physicians' offices, certified       behavioral health clinics, law enforcement, and the business       community; and        ``(E) provide to the Secretary such information, at such       time, and in such manner, as the Secretary may require.        ``(2) Diversity.--In awarding cooperative agreements under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall take into account       regional differences among eligible entities and shall make       an effort to ensure geographic diversity.        ``(c) Dissemination of Information.--        ``(1) Public posting.--The Secretary shall make information       provided to the Secretary under subsection (b)(1)(E)       publically available on the Internet website of the       Department of Health and Human Services.        ``(2) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall evaluate each       project carried out by a Regional Center of Excellence in       Substance Use Disorder Education under this section and shall       disseminate the findings with respect to each such evaluation       to appropriate public and private entities.        ``(d) Funding.--There is authorized to be appropriated to       carry out this section, $4,000,000 for each of fiscal years       2019 through 2023.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 5261.  This is the Treatment, Education, and Community Help to Combat  Addiction Act, or more easily known as the TEACH to Combat Addiction  Act. This legislation will designate and support centers of excellence  or institutions of learning that have championed substance use disorder  treatment.   Improving how professionals are taught to effectively teach substance  use disorder will also increase access to evidence-based treatment, in  other  [[Page H5053]]  words, treatments that will work and that we can prove will work.   I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Bill Johnson and Paul  Tonko, for leading this bipartisan and really important initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson), the leader on our committee, to talk more about his  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I don't have any other speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to commend our colleagues for  bringing this matter to our attention and commend them on the  legislation we are moving forward today in a bipartisan way. I  encourage our colleagues to vote for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5272) to ensure that programs and activities that are funded  by a grant, cooperative agreement, loan, or loan guarantee from the  Department of Health and Human Services, and whose purpose is to  prevent or treat a mental health or substance use disorder, are  evidence-based, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5272         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. GUIDANCE FROM NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE                     USE POLICY LABORATORY.         Section 501A(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       290aa-0(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (5), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (6), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(7) issue and periodically update guidance for entities       applying for grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental       Health Services Administration in order to--        ``(A) encourage the funding of evidence-based practices;        ``(B) encourage the replication of promising or effective       practices; and        ``(C) inform applicants on how to best articulate the       rationale for the funding of a program or activity.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials into the Record on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 5272. This is a  bill that helps ensure that federally funded programs and activities  that prevent or  [[Page H5054]]  treat health or substance use disorder are evidence-based. What a  concept.   H.R. 5272 will enhance the work of the National Mental Health and  Substance Use Policy Laboratory by directing the Substance Abuse and  Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, to provide guidance for  entities applying for grants, including guidance on how best to explain  the rationale for a given program or activity.   By encouraging the funding of evidence-based interventions and the  replication of promising or effective practices, we believe we can help  ensure that local organizations, health departments, nonprofits, and  substance use disorder treatment providers have the tools and evidence  necessary to implement solutions that work.   I would like to thank Representatives  Steve Stivers and Eliot Engel  for leading this important and, again, bipartisan initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Stivers), who has been a real advocate on these and  other issues dealing with this opioid epidemic.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), who is the vice chair of our  Health Subcommittee and has been a leader on this opioid issue along  with other healthcare issues to improve the lives of American citizens  and especially those in his home State and district.    Mr. Speaker, this is more good, bipartisan work here  attacking this opioid epidemic. I would encourage my colleagues to  support this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5329) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize  and enhance the poison center national toll-free number, national media  campaign, and grant program, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5329         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 5329, the Poison Center Network  Enhancement Act.

They offer free, confidential, expert medical advice 24 hours a day, 7  days a week. By reauthorizing this essential system resource, we will  help reduce visits to the emergency rooms and save countless lives.   I want to thank the leadership of Representative Susan Brooks and  Eliot Engel, my colleagues, along with Representatives Joe Barton and  Diana DeGette, who worked hard on this legislation to get it right and  get it to the floor in a bipartisan manner and, I would dare say, out  of committee in a unanimous vote.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5353, Eliminating Opioid  Related Infectious Diseases Act, which will authorize the CDC, the  Centers for Disease Control, to work with States to improve education,  surveillance, and treatment of infections associated with injection  drug use.   Injection drug use is a well-known route for the transmission of  blood-borne infections, particularly human immunodeficiency virus, or  HIV, and hepatitis. By supporting a national elimination initiative,  H.R. 5353 will help reduce the serious, costly, and life-threatening  infections that can be associated with illicit drug use.   I want to thank my colleague, Leonard Lance from New Jersey. He has  been a real leader in this effort, bringing this to our attention. He  wasn't alone. Representative Joe Kennedy, Chris Collins, Anna Eshoo,  Joe Barton, and Doris Matsui also were very much involved in the  creation of this legislative initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Lance) to speak on his legislation.     Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers as well.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Special Registration for       Telemedicine Clarification Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. DEADLINE FOR INTERIM FINAL REGULATIONS FOR A SPECIAL                     REGISTRATION TO ENGAGE IN THE PRACTICE OF                     TELEMEDICINE.         Section 311(h)(2) of the Controlled Substances Act (21       U.S.C. 831(h)(2)) is amended by striking ``The Attorney       General shall, with the concurrence of the Secretary,       promulgate regulations'' and inserting ``Not later than 1       year after the date of enactment of the Special Registration       for Telemedicine Clarification Act of 2018, the Attorney       General shall, with the concurrence of the Secretary,       promulgate interim final regulations''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, many patients have limited access to mental health and  substance use disorder services, particularly Americans who live  outside of metropolitan areas. To increase access to specialized care,  this legislation requires the Attorney General to issue waivers to  healthcare providers to prescribe medication-assisted treatment, or  MAT, for emergency situations, like the lack of access to an in-person  specialist.   Under a previous version of the bill, the DEA would have had up to 90  days to complete this task. At their request, this committee favorably  reported an amendment extending this window to 1 year.   Finalizing the rules for the special waiver process is on the unified  agenda of the Justice Department at DEA. That is a signal that they  understand the need to implement this provision of law.   We have the opportunity to consider this bill today because of the  faithful dedication and thoughtful legislating of Representatives Buddy  Carter of Georgia and Cheri Bustos of Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter) to speak on this legislation, our resident  pharmacist, the only one, I believe, in the entire U.S. House of  Representatives, who has  [[Page H5061]]  been a terrific asset as we have dealt with these issues of drugs and  drug abuse and addiction, or addiction treatment, and trying to find  the best paths forward.    Mr. Speaker, Members should support this very important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5582) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to conduct a study and submit a report on barriers to accessing abuse- deterrent opioid formulations for individuals enrolled in a plan under  part C or D of the Medicare program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 5582         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited at the ``Abuse Deterrent Access Act       of 2018''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON ABUSE-DETERRENT OPIOID FORMULATIONS ACCESS                     BARRIERS UNDER MEDICARE.         (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services shall conduct a study and submit to Congress a       report on the adequacy of access to abuse-deterrent opioid       formulations for individuals with chronic pain enrolled in an       MA-PD plan under part C of title XVIII of the Social Security       Act or a prescription drug plan under part D of such title of       such Act, taking into account any barriers preventing such       individuals from accessing such formulations under such MA-PD       or part D plans, such as cost-sharing tiers, fail-first       requirements, the price of such formulations, and prior       authorization requirements.        (b) Definition of Abuse-deterrent Opioid Formulation.--In       this section, the term ``abuse-deterrent opioid formulation''       means an opioid that is a prodrug or that has certain abuse-      deterrent properties, such as physical or chemical barriers,       agonist or antagonist combinations, aversion properties,       delivery system mechanisms, or other features designed to       prevent abuse of such opioid.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Mr. Carter, Mr. Loebsack, and Mr.  Reed,  [[Page H5062]]  bipartisan Members working together on legislation to develop the  bipartisan bill.   This Medicare program provides healthcare coverage to more than 58  million of our citizens. Serving the over-age-65 population, Medicare  accounts for a large share of total opioid prescriptions, as you might  imagine. While many Medicare beneficiaries with serious and very real  pain-related conditions are being properly prescribed opioids, we have  to be mindful of the potential dangers of diversion and misuse of these  very prescriptions.   There is no silver bullet in stopping the opioid crisis in this  country, but this legislation before us now will study one potential  tool for slowing misuse and diversion of opioids prescribed to the  chronic care population. Abuse-deterrent formulations have proven to  the Food and Drug Administration that they are harder to abuse because  of certain properties they contain.   While no abuse-deterrent formulation is 100 percent resistant to  abuse, I think we need to know what policies may be in place that would  limit patient access to these drugs for when they are the right option.   I believe this bill is important to inform future discussions on  these technologies, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and pass  H.R. 5582.   I know Mr. Carter, again, our resident pharmacist, has been very  active in this effort.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: On May 9 and 17, 2018, the Committee       on Energy and Commerce ordered favorably reported over 50       bills to address the opioid epidemic facing communities       across our nation. Several of the bills were also referred to       the Committee on Ways and Means.        I ask that the Committee on Ways and Means not insist on       its referral of the following bills so that they may be       scheduled for consideration by the Majority Leader:        H.R. 1925, At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act of 2017;        H.R. 3331, To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to       promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health       providers for adoption and use of certified electronic health       record technology;        H.R. 3528, Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act;        H.R. 4841, Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for       Safe Prescribing Act of 2018;        H.R. 5582, Abuse Deterrent Access Act of 2018;        H.R. 5590, Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act;        H.R. 5603, Access to Telehealth Services for Opioid Use       Disorder;        H.R. 5605, Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use       Disorders in Medicare Act;        H.R. 5675, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act       to require prescription drug plan sponsors under the Medicare       program to establish drug management programs for at-risk       beneficiaries;        H.R. 5684, Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5685, Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act;        H.R. 5686, Medicare Clear Health Options in Care for       Enrollees (CHOICE) Act; o H.R. 5715, Strengthening       Partnerships to Prevent Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5715, Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid       Abuse Act;        H.R. 5716, Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber       Accountability and Safety for Seniors (COMPASS) Act;        H.R. 5796, Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy       Outcomes for Users' Treatment (REACH OUT) Act of 2018;        H.R. 5798, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management       Alternatives for Seniors Act;        H.R. 5804, Post-Surgical Injections as an Opioid       Alternative Act; and        H.R. 5809, Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018.        This concession in no way affects your jurisdiction over       the subject matter of these bills, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bills be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Ways and Means on the       conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include       this letter and your response in the bill reports and the       Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for your letter concerning       several bills favorably reported out of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce to address the opioid epidemic and which       the Committee on Ways and Means was granted an additional       referral.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       within these bills that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction       of the Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of the following bills so that they may move       expeditiously to the floor:        H.R. 1925, At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act of 2017;        H.R. 3331, To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to       promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health       providers for adoption and use of certified electronic health       record technology;        H.R. 3528, Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act;        H.R. 4841, Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for       Safe Prescribing Act of 2018;        H.R. 5582, Abuse Deterrent Access Act of 2018;        H.R. 5590, Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act;        H.R. 5603, Access to Telehealth Services for Opioid Use       Disorder;        H.R. 5605, Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use       Disorders in Medicare Act;        H.R. 5675, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act       to require prescription drug plan sponsors under the Medicare       program to establish drug management programs for at-risk       beneficiaries;        H.R. 5684, Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5685, Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act;        H.R. 5686, Medicare Clear Health Options in Care for       Enrollees (CHOICE) Act;        H.R. 5715, Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid       Abuse Act;        H.R. 5716, Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber       Accountability and Safety for Seniors (COMPASS) Act;        H.R. 5796, Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy       Outcomes for Users' Treatment (REACH OUT) Act of 2018;        H.R. 5798, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management       Alternatives for Seniors Act;        H.R. 5804, Post-Surgical Injections as an Opioid       Alternative Act; and        H.R. 5809, Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation and requests your support for       such a request.        Finally, I would appreciate your commitment to include this       exchange of letters in the bill reports and the Congressional       Record.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), an incredibly important member of  our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the same, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5583) to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to  require States to annually report on certain adult health quality  measures, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5583         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MANDATORY REPORTING WITH RESPECT TO ADULT                     BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MEASURES.         Section 1139B of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-      9b) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)--        (A) in paragraph (3)--        (i) by striking ``Not later than January 1, 2013'' and       inserting the following:        ``(A) Voluntary reporting.--Not later than January 1,       2013''; and        (ii) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) Mandatory reporting with respect to behavioral health       measures.--Beginning with the State report required under       subsection (d)(1) for 2024, the Secretary shall require       States to use all behavioral health measures included in the       core set of adult health quality measures and any updates or       changes to such measures to report information, using the       standardized format for reporting information and procedures       developed under subparagraph (A), regarding the quality of       behavioral health care for Medicaid eligible adults.''; and        (B) in paragraph (5), by adding at the end the following       new subparagraph:        ``(C) Behavioral health measures.--Beginning with respect       to State reports required under subsection (d)(1) for 2024,       the core set of adult health quality measures maintained       under this paragraph (and any updates or changes to such       measures) shall include behavioral health measures.''; and        (2) in subsection (d)(1)(A)--        (A) by striking ``the such plan'' and inserting ``such       plan''; and        (B) by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting       ``subsection (b)(5) and, beginning with the report for 2024,       all behavioral health measures included in the core set of       adult health quality measures maintained under such       subsection (b)(5) and any updates or changes to such measures       (as required under subsection (b)(3))''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would point out to my colleagues, this is the 20th  bill in a row we have brought to the floor so far, with a few more to  go today. This bill is sponsored by Representatives Clarke, Blackburn,  and myself, and it requires States to report on the behavioral health  quality measures in CMS' core set of adult health measures.   Now, these measures were created as part of the CHIPRA legislation  back in 2009. States have had almost a decade to understand the  measures and to report them. So now it is time to make sure that  information gets reported so Congress can have a complete view on  behavioral healthcare in Medicaid.   You see, these behavioral health measures focus on important issues,  such as initiation and adherence to medication and treatment, smoking  cessation, screening, and follow-up after hospitalizations.   This legislation is certainly in alignment with our recent efforts to  expand mandatory reporting of quality measures. As a reminder, in the  recent Children's Health Insurance Program 10-year--record 10-year-- extension, States are now required to report on the pediatric core  measures. Now, this legislation before us will provide some parity in  requiring the reporting of important behavioral health measures as  well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York, my  friend, for her leadership. She is a tireless worker on our committee-- on this issue, especially.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage passage of the legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5685) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  provide educational resources regarding opioid use and pain management  as part of the Medicare & You handbook.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5685         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Opioid Safety       Education Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. PROVISION OF INFORMATION REGARDING OPIOID USE AND                     PAIN MANAGEMENT AS PART OF MEDICARE & YOU                     HANDBOOK.         (a) In General.--Section 1804 of the Social Security Act       (42 U.S.C. 1395b-2) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(d) The notice provided under subsection (a) shall       include--        ``(1) educational resources, compiled by the Secretary,       regarding opioid use and pain management; and        ``(2) a description of alternative, non-opioid pain       management treatments covered under this title.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply to notices distributed prior to each Medicare       open enrollment period beginning after January 1, 2019.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representatives Faso, Welch, and Renacci. They  all worked hard to develop this bipartisan bill, and I thank them for  their work.   The Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act directs the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services to include information about the risk of  opioid use, potential nonopioid pain management treatments, and other  relevant information in the Medicare & You handbook that is published  annually.   The Medicare programs provide healthcare coverage to over 58 million  users. We want to empower every person on Medicare to be able to have a  thoughtful conversation with his or her provider about their  prescriptions and the possible alternatives. Education is a big part of  what we are doing here.   The Medicare & You handbook is provided to every beneficiary and  represents an education point for those on opioids and those who may,  in the future, need to have a discussion about pain treatment options  with their physician.   We are rightfully seizing upon this opportunity to inform as many  people as possible and educate them about the long-term opioid use and  misuse. It is always a good thing to do. It is another tool in the  toolbox when it comes to beneficiary outreach and education.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5685.

Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for your letter concerning       several bills favorably reported out of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce to address the opioid epidemic and which       the Committee on Ways and Means was granted an additional       referral.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       within these bills that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction       of the Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of the following bills so that they may move       expeditiously to the floor:        H.R. 1925, At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act of 2017;        H.R. 3331, To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to       promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health       providers for adoption and use of certified electronic health       record technology;        H.R. 3528, Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act;        H.R. 4841, Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for       Safe Prescribing Act of 2018;        H.R. 5582, Abuse Deterrent Access Act of 2018;        H.R. 5590, Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act;        H.R. 5603, Access to Telehealth Services for Opioid Use       Disorder;        H.R. 5605, Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use       Disorders in Medicare Act;        H.R. 5675, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act       to require prescription drug plan sponsors under the Medicare       program to establish drug management programs for at-risk       beneficiaries;        H.R. 5684, Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5685, Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act;        H.R. 5686, Medicare Clear Health Options in Care for       Enrollees (CHOICE) Act;        H.R. 5715, Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid       Abuse Act;        H.R. 5716, Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber       Accountability and Safety for Seniors (COMPASS) Act;        H.R. 5796, Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy       Outcomes for Users' Treatment (REACH OUT) Act of 2018;        H.R. 5798, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management       Alternatives for Seniors Act;        H.R. 5804, Post-Surgical Injections as an Opioid       Alternative Act; and        H.R. 5809, Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation and requests your support for       such a request.        Finally, I would appreciate your commitment to include this       exchange of letters in the bill reports and the Congressional       Record.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso), a very capable and able  legislator. This is his legislation, in part, and he has been a real  leader in this overall effort, and certainly on this piece of  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this very  important and bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4275) to provide for the development and dissemination of  programs and materials for training pharmacists, health care providers,  and patients on indicators that a prescription is fraudulent, forged,  or otherwise indicative of abuse or diversion, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 4275         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering Pharmacists in       the Fight Against Opioid Abuse Act''.       SEC. 2. PROGRAMS AND MATERIALS FOR TRAINING ON CERTAIN                     CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A PHARMACIST MAY                     DECLINE TO FILL A PRESCRIPTION.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services, in consultation with the Administrator of the Drug       Enforcement Administration, the Commissioner of Food and       Drugs, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, and the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and       Substance Use, shall develop and disseminate programs and       materials for training pharmacists, health care providers,       and patients on--        (1) circumstances under which a pharmacist may, consistent       with section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.       811) and regulations thereunder, including section 1306.04 of       title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, decline to fill a       prescription for a controlled substance because the       pharmacist suspects the prescription is fraudulent, forged,       or otherwise indicative of abuse or diversion; and        (2) any Federal requirements pertaining to declining to       fill a prescription under such circumstances.        (b) Materials Included.--In developing materials under       subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services       shall include information educating--        (1) pharmacists on how to decline to fill a prescription       and actions to take after declining to fill a prescription;       and        (2) other health care practitioners and the public on a       pharmacist's responsibility to decline to fill prescriptions       in certain circumstances.        (c) Stakeholder Input.--In developing the programs and       materials required under subsection (a), the Secretary of       Health and Human Services shall seek input from relevant       national, State, and local associations, boards of pharmacy,       medical societies, licensing boards, health care       practitioners, and patients.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is a product of the chairman's  hard work and that of our colleague from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).   As the only pharmacist serving in Congress, Mr. Carter understands  the need to get fraudulent prescriptions off of our streets and give  folks on the front line additional tools to combat the opioid crisis.  This is why I know he helped author this bipartisan bill, which will  require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and  disseminate education materials for pharmacists to better detect, and  reject, fraudulent prescriptions.   While law enforcement plays a key role in detecting and stopping  fraudulent prescriptions, responsibility ultimately lies with  pharmacists, who are licensed healthcare professionals. For this  reason, we amended the bill at the committee level to originate the  materials at the Department of Health and Human Services as opposed to  the Justice Department.   As Mr. Carter has repeatedly said, this bill will complement the  DEA's existing efforts, like the Diversion Control Division's Pharmacy  Diversion Awareness Conferences held throughout the country, as well as  their other meetings, presentations, and seminars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am honored to yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), a co-author of this  legislation, and, as you have heard, our only resident pharmacist. He  knows this firsthand, and has brought incredible knowledge and skill to  the legislative process.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5197) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to conduct a demonstration program to test alternative pain management  protocols to limit the use of opioids in emergency departments, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5197         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Alternatives to Opioids in       the Emergency Department Act'' or the ``ALTO Act''.       SEC. 2. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ALTERNATIVES TO OPIOIDS                     DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.         (a) Demonstration Program Grants.--The Secretary of Health       and Human Services (in this section referred to as the       ``Secretary'') shall carry out a demonstration program under       which the Secretary shall award grants to hospitals and       emergency departments, including freestanding emergency       departments, to develop, implement, enhance, or study       alternative pain management protocols and treatments that       limit the use and prescription of opioids in emergency       departments.        (b) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant under       subsection (a), a hospital or emergency department shall       submit an application to the Secretary at such time, in such       manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may       require.        (c) Geographic Diversity.--In awarding grants under this       section, the Secretary shall seek to ensure geographical       diversity among grant recipients.        (d) Use of Funds.--Grants under subsection (a) shall be       used to--        (1) target common painful conditions, such as renal colic,       sciatica, headaches, musculoskeletal pain, and extremity       fractures;        (2) train providers and other hospital personnel on       protocols and the use of treatments that limit the use and       prescription of opioids in the emergency department; and        (3) provide alternatives to opioids to patients with       painful conditions, not including patients who present with       pain related to cancer, end-of-life symptom palliation, or       complex multisystem trauma.        (e) Consultation.--The Secretary shall implement a process       for recipients of grants under subsection (a) to consult (in       a manner that allows for sharing of evidence-based best       practices) with each other and with persons having robust       knowledge, including emergency departments and physicians       that have successfully deployed alternative pain management       protocols, such as non-drug approaches studied through the       National Center for Complimentary and Integrative Health       including acupuncture that limit the use of opioids. The       Secretary shall offer to each recipient of a grant under       subsection (a) technical support as necessary.        (f) Report to the Secretary.--Each recipient of a grant       under this section shall submit to the Secretary (during the       period of such grant) annual reports on the progress of the       program funded through the grant. These reports shall       include, in accordance with State and Federal statutes and       regulations regarding disclosure of patient information--        (1) a description of and specific information about the       alternative pain management protocols employed;        (2) data on the alternative pain management protocols and       treatments employed, including--        (A) during a baseline period before the program began, as       defined by the Secretary;        (B) at various stages of the program, as determined by the       Secretary; and        (C) the conditions for which the alternative pain       management protocols and treatments were employed;        (3) the success of each specific alternative pain       management protocol;        (4) data on the opioid prescriptions written, including--        (A) during a baseline period before the program began, as       defined by the Secretary;        (B) at various stages of the program, as determined by the       Secretary; and        (C) the conditions for which the opioids were prescribed;  [[Page H5068]]         (5) the demographic characteristics of patients who were       treated with an alternative pain management protocol,       including age, sex, race, ethnicity, and insurance status and       type;        (6) data on patients who were eventually prescribed opioids       after alternative pain management protocols and treatments       were employed; and        (7) any other information the Secretary deems necessary.        (g) Report to Congress.--Not later than one year after       completion of the demonstration program under this section,       the Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress on the       results of the demonstration program and include in the       report--        (1) the number of applications received and the number       funded;        (2) a summary of the reports described in subsection (f),       including standardized data; and        (3) recommendations for broader implementation of pain       management protocols that limit the use and prescription of       opioids in emergency departments or other areas of the health       care delivery system.        (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this       section, there is authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000       for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2021.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support of H.R. 5197,  the Alternatives to Opioids in the Emergency Department Act.   Emergency rooms are uniquely positioned to prevent addiction before  it starts through the conservative and judicious prescribing of  opioids. By establishing a demonstration program to test alternative  pain management protocols to limit the use of opioids in hospital  emergency departments, H.R. 5197 places emergency rooms on the front  lines of defense against this opioid crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Pascrell and Representative  McKinley, along with Representative DeGette and Representative Tipton  for leading this important initiative.   Throughout my district in Oregon, I met with victims, families,  treatment advocates, medical providers, and law enforcement officers on  the front lines of this fight in our communities. That includes Mike  Pelfrey of Grants Pass.   The first time I met Mike was at a roundtable in Medford, I think, in  southern Oregon. Mike didn't really know anybody in the room. I had  invited these folks to come around the table. They were addiction  specialists, they were in the treatment programs, and they were law  enforcement. I noticed he was there. He had heard the news about our  meeting to discuss opioid abuse.   When we had finished going around the table, I said: So what brings  you here, sir? And then he told me his family's story.   His son was injured in a school sporting accident and became addicted  to the prescription painkillers provided by his medical provider to aid  in his recovery.   Eventually, Mike's son made the all-too-familiar transition to a  cheaper source. You would know it as heroin. And to this day, his son  struggles with his addiction that began with opioid abuse.   Then he went on to talk about his sister, who also suffered from  addiction. She was a nurse. His sister found herself with, frankly, a  way to get easier access to pills than most. When coworkers and others  caught on, she moved and continued her addiction and her ability to  procure pills. He said that she died as a result of her addiction.   Mike came to the meeting in hopes that sharing the stories of his son  and of his sister could help ensure such tragedies don't happen to  other families.   At a more recent meeting I held in southern Oregon, Mike was present  once more. During the meeting, Mike urged everyone to make combating  the opioid crisis a top priority, saying, ``The only way we are going  to do it is address it, do something about it, and make this an  everyday part of our thought.''   Well, Mike, this Congress, we have made addressing this scourge an  everyday part of our thoughts and efforts, and we will continue to do  so no matter how long it takes to rip this terrible menace out of our  communities.                                time  1745    We have an extraordinary opportunity to make important progress in  this fight with the legislation before us, all of which reflects the  feedback we have heard from people like you and from others at  roundtables and meetings in our home districts.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say to Mike: You have been heard. We are  acting. We are acting on your behalf and on the behalf of so many other  Americans and American families who are dealing with this tragedy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to commend the gentleman for bringing this to our attention  with his colleagues. That was part of what we did back on Member Day. I  think it was in October. We had 50 Members. I don't recall specifically  whether Mr. Pascrell brought it to us there or some other time, but we  are taking these real-life experiences from our districts, the things  that work, and saying: This works. We know it works. It works in our  hospital. It works in our town, and we are saying it can work  nationwide.   We are taking ideas, like my friend from New Jersey has brought, Mr.  Speaker, to our committee and now to this House floor. We are saying,  let's apply this nationwide.    Together, we can overcome this epidemic. We must overcome this  epidemic. It is in our ability to do this.   Mr. Speaker, I just say to the gentleman and my friend that we are  not done, just as we weren't done 2 years ago when we modernized  America's mental health laws. At that point, Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania  was here and gave us great counsel about how to do that. We put money  in to deal with opioids then, that and 21st Century Cures that Mr.  Upton and Ms. DeGette helped lead the effort on.   I know at NIH they are working day and night, as they are in other  institutions, to find a nonaddictive pain management medicine. We wish  them Godspeed in that effort, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank my friend from New Jersey for bringing  this to us. This is the kind of legislation that will save lives,  prevent tragedy. We are going to get it passed here in a bipartisan,  unanimous way, I do believe, in a matter of seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5587) to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize  certain recovery services grants to be used to establish regional  technical assistance centers, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 5587.  This is the Peer Support Communities of Recovery Act.   This legislation will support the peer support specialist workforce  by authorizing the Department of Health and Human Services to award  grants to peer support specialist organizations for the development and  expansion of recovery services. Peer support specialists, peer recovery  coaches, are health workers who provide treatment linkages to  individuals suffering from substance use disorder and support services  to those newly in recovery.   The gentleman from New Mexico (Ben Ray Lujan) and the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Johnson) have helped lead and put this in bipartisan terms  and bring it to us today. I appreciate their hard work on this  initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this matter  and would encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5812) to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize  the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to carry  out certain activities to prevent controlled substances overdoses, and  for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is our last bill of the day on opioids. This is the  25th piece of legislation that we have worked through, not only our  committee, but also now the House floor.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 5812, the CONNECTIONS Act. Now, this  legislation enhances and improves state-run prescription drug  monitoring programs. These are really, really important. Prescription  drug monitoring programs or, as they are known, PDMPs, are useful tools  in helping identify and deter drug misuse and diversion. They allow  health prescribers to identify patients exhibiting risky behaviors and  assist those individuals in getting help.   By strengthening the current efforts of the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, in coordination with the Substance Abuse and  Mental Health Services Administration, and the Office of the National  Coordinator for Health Information Technology, the CONNECTIONS Act will  help make state-run PDMPs more easily accessible, more user-friendly,  more accurate, and better integrated across the country.   So I want to thank my colleague from Virginia, Representative Morgan  Griffith, a terrific member of our committee, Vice Chair of the  Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, who has done a lot of work  investigating pill dumping and patient brokering and the kind of abuses  we have seen that have helped to inform our legislation they have done  over on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. He will speak in  just a minute.   I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey, Representative Frank  Pallone as well, and Representative Brian Fitzpatrick from  Pennsylvania. They have all worked together on this really, really  important improvement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), our resident pharmacist, to speak on the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), who is a co-author of  this very important piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In conclusion, I just want to thank my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle for their incredible tenacity, their hard work, bringing from  their districts and from the people they represent these ideas to  formulate solutions that we are now going to enact into law and move  over to the Senate. We will pass them here and move them over to the  Senate and eventually into law.    I would also point out that, starting in 2016, 2017, Republicans in  this Congress passed CARA, and the 21st Century Cures Act, putting over  $1.2 billion into the efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. And then  we doubled down, literally and figuratively, and even more than that, I  think we have got $4 billion in the latest spending bill directed  specifically at opioids, and another couple of billion at mental health  services. Both of these are big needs for our communities and for our  citizens, both led by Republicans and the Trump administration in terms  of this most latest investment in the fight on opioids.   And I know President Trump and the administration do a lot of work on  their own through using their executive powers, their administrative  powers to address the problems of the opioid epidemic through the  various agencies of the Federal Government. Not only are they leading  on that, but they are also partnering with our States and our local  communities.   We have got to make sure the money that we appropriate gets all the  way to the ground, gets into these community organizations that are on  the front lines of helping people get into treatment, helping them get  the services that they need.                                time  1815    It has record funding going in. It helps when we change these laws to  modernize them so that people can get access to the care they need and  they deserve, and together, we are going to solve this problem.   It is a big step forward, 25 bills today. We will have more later in  this week and another 25 or 30 next week. We know that this is an  ongoing challenge for our country. It will be an ongoing effort for our  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this particular piece of legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
