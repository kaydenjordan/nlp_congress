 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 1170, I call up the bill (H.R. 7606) to establish      The online version has been corrected to read:  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.      The online version has been corrected to read: The gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. David Scott) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson) each will controll 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott). Mr. DAVID SCOTT of  Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     I rise in strong support of H.R. 7606, the Lower Food and Fuel Costs  Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support this package that is  comprised of multiple bills that our House Agriculture Committee has  advanced in a strong, bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, as we all know, the last 2 years have led to drastic  fluctuations in prices. Whether you look at the ongoing impacts of the  COVID-19 pandemic or the global disruptions associated with Putin's war  in Ukraine, American farmers, American ranchers, and consumers are,  right now, facing terrible, increasing costs on the farm, at the  grocery store, and at the gas station.   Our Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act tackles these price increases head  on by increasing competition, options at the pump, and by providing  needed support for America's agriculture sector at every stop of our  food supply chain.   Mr. Speaker, our package includes four main pillars.   One: Ensuring robust competition in the meat and poultry sector.   Two: Lowering costs at the grocery store by lowering costs for our  farmers and ranchers.   Three: By empowering our farmers to help provide fuel choices and  lower prices at our gas stations.   Four: Strengthening the food supply chain.   Going further into each of these pillars, first, this package will  establish an Office of the Special Investigator for Competition Matters  in the Agriculture Secretary's office.   When we held a hearing, Mr. Speaker, it was a very powerful hearing.  It was the largest viewing audience for a hearing in the history of our  Agriculture Committee.   We heard overwhelming evidence that continuing the status quo when it  comes to enforcement will not provide more desperately needed  competition and fairness within our meat and poultry industries.   So we believe earnestly that the USDA and their expertise in  agriculture issues gives them a strong footing to investigate the  competitiveness in our meat and poultry sectors and to enforce existing  laws to ensure a fair playing field for our family farmers, ranchers,  and consumers.   Mr. Speaker, we were informed at that hearing that right now, we are  losing 17,000 ranching farms every year. This has to stop.   Our bill also includes a bipartisan provision that will support the  creation and expansion of processing capacity for small- and medium- sized producers to help alleviate this terrible, threatening  consolidation just to a handful of four meatpacking companies. This is  the core of this legislation.   Our second pillar addresses a key piece in the puzzle of rising  prices. At the grocery store, there have been record increases in input  costs for agricultural producers, with fertilizer prices for both  specialty and row crop producers skyrocketing. This bill will help  reduce their input costs so planning decisions are not impacted.   Mr. Speaker, speaking of fertilizer costs, it is very important for  the Nation to know that right now, Russia produces and controls 66  percent of the fertilizer in the world. This needs to have serious,  serious attention.   Our second pillar of this legislative package is the puzzle of rising  prices.   Our third pillar addresses fuel costs, which is something that  impacts everyone, whether you are paying more at the gas pump or seeing  increasing prices in the grocery store from higher trucking and  transportation costs.   This package addresses these concerns in a way that empowers our  farmers and provides more choice and lower prices for our consumers at  the gas pump and at the grocery store.   Mr. Speaker, our biofuels adoption and investment helps reduce our  reliance on foreign oil and the supply shocks facing our gasoline  supply, while also bolstering a revenue stream  [[Page H5619]]  for our farmers and producers across the country.   Bolstering our use of ethanol from E10 to E15 will not impact the  environment, our Environmental Protection Agency confirms this, nor  will it slow down the rollout of electric vehicles.   This vital package of bills makes much-needed improvements in our  supply chain. A series of shocks to our beef supply chain, combined  with a concentrated processing infrastructure, resulted in high prices  for meat at our grocery stores and lower prices for our producers,  farmers, and ranchers.   Specifically, one provision calls for the formation of an  Agricultural and Food System Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis  Response Task Force to examine our food supply chain and report back to  us here in Congress on the strengths and the weaknesses that exist.   I am extremely proud of the work of our House Agriculture Committee  members, both Democrats and Republicans, who have worked tirelessly to  put this strong bipartisan bill together.   We have garnered for this bill extremely important bipartisan  participation. This is what our Nation is hungry for; Democrats and  Republicans working together to bring down these high costs for our  food and our fuel. This bill is a bill that our American people want  and deserve.        Mr. Speaker, I note that several of the sections in this       bill codify or are complementary to ongoing and planned       programs that the Department of Agriculture is carrying out       or planning to carry out with existing authorities and       funding. The intent behind passage of this bill is to be       additive to those efforts and is in no way intended to limit       or pause those programs and efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
