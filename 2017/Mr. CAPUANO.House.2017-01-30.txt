 Mr. Speaker, this is my first 1-minute in 20 years-- first one--and I am here today to basically call out my colleagues who  remained silent this weekend as Lady Liberty shed tears.   It is not about extreme vetting. No one has concerns about punching  it up a little bit. This weekend we took people from around this world  who are legally, legally, legally coming to our country, many of whom  have been through every single vetting we can give them. We embarrassed  ourselves and them in what we did this weekend.   Where is the terror threat from a 5-year-old child?   Where is the terror threat from a professor coming to MIT or a  research scientist coming in?   There is none. Not one of the seven countries mentioned provided one  single terrorist.   And for those people who say, I am here just to protect our country,  I have been in Boston all of my life. The largest numbers of people  came out from New York City and Boston. It was our people who lost  their lives, yet we remain humanistic and openhearted.   Open your hearts to the rest of the world.                            ____________________
