 Mr. President, what we are seeing here today really  disappoints me. We have, today, a straightforward opportunity to  prevent a critical part of our higher education system--HBCUs, Tribal  colleges, and other minority-serving institutions--from having to deal  with a lapse in funding. We should take it. This is bipartisan  legislation. It has passed the House. There is no reason at all to  delay it a minute longer here in the Senate.   I thank the Senator from Alabama for his leadership on this. I  express my personal strong support for the FUTURE Act, which will give  us then time to work out a permanent fix for funding HBCUs, Tribal  colleges, and minority-serving institutions through a comprehensive HEA  reauthorization, which is what I have made clear is necessary.   I appreciate what the Senator from Tennessee said about moving  forward with higher education reauthorization. I am hopeful we can  continue to work on reaching a compromise, as we have done on several  other pieces of legislation. As I have said before, I believe any  reauthorization of the Higher Education Act needs to have real answers  to the challenges students are facing today on affordability and access  and accountability and campus safety. I truly believe we have an  opportunity to get a comprehensive bill done that helps solve these  challenges for our students.   I hope the Senator from Tennessee and our colleagues on the HELP  Committee continue to focus on our efforts there. Meanwhile, I believe  we should listen to the Senator from Alabama. We should pass the  bipartisan FUTURE Act instead of playing politics with valuable and  underresourced institutions.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
