Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, if it weren't for the last moment, a lot of things  wouldn't get done in life, but last evening, the ranking member and I  came to a meeting of the minds on a path forward for H.R. 477. So in  the interest of efficiency of time for the House, I want to thank the  ranking member for her willingness to work on a bipartisan basis to  move this bill forward.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, our small businesses labor under a  gazillion regulations, some of which are quite good and quite helpful;  but, in the aggregate, they can be a very heavy burden and cost upon  our small businesses. One is an unnecessary registration system for  small business brokers.   I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) for his  leadership to ensure that they have a simplified registration regime,  which can help our small businesses as they are ready to engage in  sales or mergers or other transactions. It is a good, bipartisan piece  of legislation. I thank him for his leadership.   Again, I thank the ranking member for working on a bipartisan basis,  and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5  minutes.   H.R. 477 seeks to provide a statutory exemption from registration  with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for certain  brokers who facilitate the merger or acquisition of small businesses,  known as M&A brokers.   When Congress first considered this exemption in a similar bill  during the 113th Congress, our goal was to prompt the SEC to provide  regulatory relief for these brokers from ill-fitting restrictions  designed for persons helping companies raise capital rather than  facilitating their transfer of ownership.   We succeeded. Two weeks after the House passed that bill, the SEC  issued a no-action letter, which contained staff's view that, if an M&A  broker complied with the terms and conditions of the letter, it would  recommend that the SEC not take enforcement action against that broker  for failing to register with the Commission.   Specifically, the no-action letter required the M&A broker to abide  by certain commonsense restrictions to prevent such an exemption from  being misused to raise capital or abused by bad actors.   According to the bill's proponents, H.R. 477 is still necessary to  provide legal certainty since the no-action letter is merely the  nonbinding opinion of SEC staff. I understand that concern; however,  the bill inexplicably omits several of the conditions contained in the  no-action letter that protect small businesses and their investors.   I am pleased that this Congress, Representative Sherman and  Representative Huizenga have worked on a bipartisan basis to add these  protections back in through an amendment. If so amended, I will support  H.R. 477, which would strike the right balance between regulatory  relief and the protection of small companies and their investors.   In particular, the amended bill would require an M&A broker that  represents both the seller and the buyer to provide them with clear,  written disclosures and obtain their consent to that conflict of  interest; prohibit M&A brokers from misusing the exemption to raise  capital rather than transfer ownership of small businesses; prohibit  shell companies from using the exemption as a backdoor way to take a  small business public; and prohibit fraudsters and other bad actors  from using the exemption.   In addition, the bill would not change the statutory definition of  broker, thereby preserving the SEC's ability to investigate and bring  enforcement actions for violations of the antifraud provisions in the  securities laws.   The bill also would limit the relief to mergers and acquisitions  involving companies with less than $250 million in annual gross  revenues, which is the total income of the company, or $25 million in  annual earnings, which is the amount of income minus expenses. The  amendment would then provide the SEC with the authority to modify these  thresholds as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for  the protection of investors.   As our Nation's baby boomers head into retirement and look to sell  their privately owned businesses to a new generation of entrepreneurs,  it is important that they are able to do so in an efficient and cost- effective manner. If amended, H.R. 477 would allow them to do just  that, and so I would support the bill.   I would like to thank my colleagues. I would like to thank Mr.  Hensarling. I would like to thank Mr. Sherman.   This is an important bill for all of us. We are all so supportive of  our small businesses. We want them to do well, and we do not want them  to be hindered by unnecessary regulations.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the distinguished chairman of the Small Business  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), who is the sponsor of the legislation and the  chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments.    How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Speaker?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 25 minutes  remaining.    How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Speaker?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 25 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I will conclude by saying that, again,  this is a commonsense reform. It is a balanced reform. It is good for  small business. It is bipartisan. I urge all of my colleagues to adopt  H.R. 477.   Again, I thank the ranking member and the gentleman from California  for their leadership to work on a bipartisan basis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.                    Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Sherman     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
