 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to the importance and  interrelationship of mobility, innovation and placemaking.   In honor of my predecessor, the late Honorable John Lewis, I am happy  to offer the John Lewis TOD Innovation Loop. The John Lewis TOD  Innovation Loop envisions spurring over $5 billion of economic  development in Georgia's Fifth District in honor of the legacy of  Congressman John Lewis' sacrifice and commitment to equity, justice,  and economic empowerment.   Specifically, this project provides an opportunity to achieve justice  in mobility and placemaking through strategic land use and transit- oriented development.   Campbellton Road, a major artery of this project, is the area where  both of Congressman Lewis' homes were located. This funding will  ultimately create a snowball effect for signature catalytic projects,  such as Fort McPherson TOD, Tyler Perry Studios, Greenbriar, and  Westgate redevelopments.   One of the first projects in the John Lewis TOD Innovation Loop is  high-capacity transit in the Campbellton Road corridor. The project  will introduce Light Rail Transit or Bus Rapid Transit to the area  served by one the city's busiest bus routes.   All told, this will create billions of dollars of economic  revitalization, which will result in greater transportation options,  better quality of life, and renewed civic engagement. I encourage my  colleagues to support this project.   I include in the Record an appropriations request in honor of John  Lewis.                                         Congressman Kwanza Hall,                           5th District, Georgia, December 14, 2020.    The John Lewis TOD Innovation Loop--Towards Justice in Mobility and                                Placemaking         I am happy to submit this extraordinary appropriations       request in honor of John Lewis. The John Lewis TOD Innovation       Loop envisions spurring over $5 Billion of economic       development in Georgia's Fifth District in honor of the       legacy of Congressman John Lewis' sacrifice and commitment to       equity, justice and economic empowerment. Specifically this       project provides an opportunity to achieve justice in       mobility (transportation) and placemaking through strategic       land use and transit oriented development (TOD). Campbellton       Road, a major artery of this project, is the area where both       of Congressman Lewis' homes were located.    Immediate 2020 Funding Request for the John Lewis TOD Innovation Loop         1. $5M for development of the conceptual plan.        2. $50M for Accelerated Campbellton Road Bus Rapid Transit       project.        This funding will ultimately create a snowball effect for       signature catalytic projects listed below. Their estimated       economic impacts are:        Fort McPherson TOD / Tyler Perry Studios, $800M.        Oakland City TOD, $200M.        Campbellton Road or Bus Rapid Transit and future Light       Rail, $50M/$250M.        Greenbriar--Westgate Area, $1B.        John Lewis Senior Transit Center @ Barge Rd, $500M.        Camp Creek @ Campbellton Road, $200M.        Campbellton @ Fulton Industrial, $200M.        Fulton Industrial @ MLK Drive, $200M.        Aerotropolis (Atlanta Airport Area), $1.7B.        Total impact: $5.05 Billion.        One of the first projects in the John Lewis TOD Innovation       Loop is high-capacity transit in the Campbellton Road       Corridor. This project will assist in transforming this       corridor of established neighborhoods and businesses into a       vibrant, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use community and could       incentivize major redevelopment efforts at Greenbriar Mall       and Fort McPherson. The project will introduce Light Rail       Transit or Bus Rapid Transit to the area served by one of the       city's busiest bus routes. The budget is $50 million and the       project would be administered by Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit       Authority.

I include in the Record the following hyperlink to an article from  Reuters: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-jails.   The article draws attention to the private prisons, the death  penalty, and COVID. These are longstanding challenges in our criminal  justice system. Also on the list of problems, but not  [[Page H7163]]  mentioned in that article, are life sentences, the Federal sentencing  guidelines, and solitary confinement.   I am supplementing to this statement and to the article an  appropriations proposal. Were it here during the appropriations  process, I would submit this proposal so that it may be integrated into  future appropriations vehicles.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of several pieces of legislation  that I am proud to co-sponsor on behalf of the people of Georgia's 5th  Congressional District.   First, I will highlight several pieces of legislation critical to  fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. As a survivor of COVID-19, I know  firsthand the pain and difficulty this terrible disease has caused too  many Americans.   Health care is a right, not a privilege. Ensuring that every American  has high-quality health care is never more important than during a  pandemic that has claimed nearly 300,000 American lives. That is why I  support H.R. 6317, the Ensuring Coverage in Public Health Emergencies  Act, introduced by the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Doggett, and hope to  be added as a co-sponsor this week. This bill would create a special  30-day enrollment period during public health emergencies to allow  employees to enroll in health plans. It also would require coverage of  services like vaccines, diagnostic testing, and treatment and care.   As we fight the pandemic, it is critical to address the racial and  ethnic disparities in how COVID-19 affects Americans. Systemic health,  economic, and social inequities mean that minority communities have  borne the worst of this terrible disease--in cases, deaths, jobs lost,  and pay cut. We are, sadly, not all in this together. H.R. 6585, the  Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act, and H.R.  6763, the COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act, were  both introduced by the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Kelly. These  bills will provide critical information and attention to this problem  and help to mitigate the effects that this disease has had on  communities like the ones I represent, and I look forward to being  added as a co-sponsor.   Black women experience some of the worst systemic disparities in  health, housing, employment, and education. I am proud to support two  other bills co-sponsored by Congresswoman Kelly of Illinois and hope to  be added as a co-sponsor. H.R. 8196, the Protect Black Women and Girls  Act would establish an Interagency Task Force to examine the complex  problems and make recommendations for policy changes to help increase  opportunity for our mothers, sisters, and daughters. H.R. 1897, the  Mothers and Offspring Mortality and Morbidity Awareness (MOMMA's) Act,  will direct federal resources to prevent maternal mortality and expand  Medicaid to cover one year of postpartum needs. Georgia faces a crisis:  My state has the worst maternal mortality rate in the country, and many  women, particularly women of color, lack access to critical pre- and  postpartum services and lack health insurance. We know that we all do  better when we all do better, and as we rebuild our country from the  ruin caused by the pandemic, we must leave no one behind.   During a time in which we need people to stay home as much as  possible, but people have lost jobs and income, it is more critical  than ever to provide critical housing assistance. The CARES Act  provided many homeowners with the right to have all mortgage payments  completely paused for a period of time. Renters, however, face a  patchwork of regulations across the country that leave them in more  uncertain positions. That is why I co-sponsored H.R. 6820, the  Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act,  introduced by Mr. Heck of Washington. This bill would provide $100  million in emergency assistance to help prevent people at risk of  homelessness from finding themselves on the street. Especially as  coronavirus cases rise and as the weather gets colder, we must ensure  that as many people as possible are able to safely find the protection  and dignity of their own home.   Our nation's experience with COVID-19 has highlighted this country's  need for paid family and medical leave. H.R. 1185, the FAMILY Act,  introduced by the gentlewoman from Connecticut, Ms. DeLauro, would  create a new paid family and medical leave system run by the Social  Security Administration. Under this system, workers and employers would  split the very modest cost of the program. Paid leave benefits  employers and employees alike--workers have time and flexibility to  help themselves or their families through personal crises, while  employers can afford to keep trained workers on the job. But the United  States is the only rich nation without it. Paid leave would have helped  save countless jobs and businesses during this difficult year.   Sadly, COVID-19 is not the only epidemic facing the American people.  This summer, the rest of the country was reminded of what my  constituents in Metro Atlanta know all too well: that people of color,  particularly African-Americans, face systemic racism every day.  Sometimes, this discrimination manifests itself as unnecessary and  brutal police violence, as we saw in the murders of George Floyd,  Breanna Taylor, and, in my district, Rayshard Brooks. Black Lives  Matter, and their Black Lives Mattered.   I have co-sponsored legislation to ensure police treat citizens with  dignity and respect and are accountable to the communities they serve.  First, I am proud to introduce a bill aimed at abolishing qualified  immunity, which helps shield police officers who break the law from  accountability. H.R. 4408, the Eric Garner Excessive Use of Force  Prevention Act, introduced by the chairman of our caucus, Mr. Jeffries  of New York, would forbid the use of police chokeholds. I also support  H.R. 7100, the George Floyd Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act,  introduced by the gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee. This  comprehensive legislation improves accountability by introducing new  accreditation standards related to use of force, civilian review, and  other provisions like training and data collection.   We also must do all we can to erase the bitter legacy left by  enslavement and forced bondage. H.R. 40, sponsored by the gentlewoman  from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, would create a commission to study and  develop reparations proposals for African-Americans. Black communities  today still suffer from the wages, property, and rights stolen by  slavery and Jim Crow. We must also work to end the forced labor that  still exists due to mass incarceration, and I am proud to introduce a  constitutional amendment to end that horrific practice that perpetuates  human suffering.   H.R. 7217, the Confederate Monument Removal Act, introduced by the  gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lee, would remove all Confederate  memorials from the United States Capitol, so that we do not risk  perpetuating the myths of white supremacy to a new, more diverse, more  inclusive generation of Americans. I strongly support efforts in the  Georgia General Assembly to replace the state's statue of Alexander  Stephens in Statuary Hall with one honoring my predecessor and friend,  the late Honorable John Lewis. Congressman Lewis challenged the  historical status quo in the South by championing civil and human  rights through peaceful, dramatic, nonviolent action, dating from his  tenure as president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  and including his 17 terms serving in this House.   I am also proud to join two other bills important to my constituents.   H.R. 2975, the Women's Health Protection Act, offered by the  gentlewoman from California, Ms. Chu, prohibits states like Georgia  from restricting access to abortion services. Georgia has some of the  most restrictive abortion laws in the country, but my constituents  deserve to make their own choices regarding their health.   Lastly, H.R. 5349, the Protect SNAP Act, was introduced by the  gentlewoman from Connecticut, Ms. DeLauro. This bill prohibits the  administration from limiting access to the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. Last year, the  administration announced a plan to make nearly 700,000 people  ineligible for food assistance. We know SNAP is critical to making sure  that children in the richest country in the world have food in their  stomachs, and it would be doubly irresponsible to deny them help during  a pandemic and recession. Congress must do all it can to ensure this  vital program is strengthened and expanded, not cut.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent the people of Georgia's 5th  Congressional District. I believe these bills to be some of the  critically important measures this body should be considering and  passing to help the American people through this difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise to alert the Chamber to three  legislative activities that I am pursuing on behalf of Georgia's Fifth  Congressional District and a transportation and infrastructure bill  that I will be introducing later this week.   The first will seek to eliminate qualified immunity in police  misconduct cases. The second piece of legislation is a constitutional  amendment that concerns forced labor. The third piece of legislation is  one that would expunge all records of nonviolent offenders impacted by  the war on drugs and other various crime bills for any State and local  government that is the recipient of Federal crime dollars.   Later this week, I will be introducing legislation to commission a  study on a vital transportation corridor in Georgia, which would  connect Campbellton Road to the businesses that are right to make  greater metro Atlanta their home.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support my pieces of  legislation and this project.                            ____________________
