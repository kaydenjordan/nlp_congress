 Madam Speaker, this week we mark the 78th  anniversary of the D-day landing in northern France.   Three years ago, I had the honor of visiting the Normandy coastline  to see the Utah and Omaha beaches, to see the memorial where the 2nd  Ranger Battalion made their heroic stand, and to see the graves of the  men who did not come home and who are now buried in the French  countryside.   Those who fought in Normandy and across France on the road to victory  in  [[Page H5414]]  Europe came from all walks of life. Those individuals were bound by a  common goal: to stand for freedom and to liberate the oppressed. They  were part of our Nation's Greatest Generation. And now as they grow  older and move on to their eternal salvation, we must continue to  remember their courage and to remember their sacrifice.   Their legacy of service and bravery is at the heart of what makes the  United States the greatest nation on Earth.                            ____________________
