 Mr. President, last week, I expressed my sincere hope  that the majority leader and I could come to some agreement on the  process of nominations. He has negotiated in good faith, and we have  made some progress. I sincerely appreciate his willingness to work with  us so far. I do want to clarify why Democrats are doing this.   Yesterday, my friend the majority leader went on television and  suggested that we were raising concerns about the nominations out of  pique or anger. He chalked up these ``little procedural complaints'' to  ``sour grapes,'' and he suggested that Democrats ``grow up.''   We are not doing this for sport. Democrats feel very strongly that  pushing for a thorough and thoughtful vetting process is the right  thing to do. Here is why. The Democratic minority was and is concerned  about the hearing schedule, which is so jammed right now that several  high-importance hearings will fall on the same day, depriving Senators  and the American people a chance to properly participate in the vetting  process of these nominees.   Our caucus was and is concerned about the timely completion of the  standard paperwork and ethics clearance for nominees before proceeding  full steam ahead with confirmation hearings and votes. Bear in mind,  President-Elect Trump's nominees pose particularly difficult ethics and  conflict-of-interest challenges. Many of them come from enormous  wealth. Many have vast holdings in stocks, and very few have experience  in government so they have not been appropriately vetted for something  like a Cabinet post before.   What had been standard practice for the vast majority of nominees-- the completion of a preliminary ethics review before their nomination-- was skipped over for the vast majority of President-Elect Trump's  nominees. In fact, the independent Office of Government Ethics went so  far as to send a letter warning that ``their [the Republicans] schedule  has created undue pressure on OGE's staff and agency ethics officials  to rush through these important reviews.''   The OGE office is nonpartisan. It has never been political so this  has nothing to do with politics. ``I am not aware,'' wrote the  Director, Walter Schaub, ``of any occasion in the four decades since  OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before  the nominee had completed the ethics review process.''   The very same majority leader, my friend Senator McConnell, who  suggested that Democrats were raising concerns out of pique or  resentment, in fact, raised the same concerns in 2009 when he was  minority leader. In fact, then-Minority Leader McConnell sent then- Majority Leader Reid a letter laying out his prerequisites for time  agreements on the floor for President Obama's nominees. They are almost  exactly what Democrats requested.   I don't bring this up to play gotcha. I am doing it to show that our  requests are eminently reasonable and, in fact,  [[Page S126]]  have been shared by leaders of both parties. I am going to read the  letter because it is amazing how it mirrors our requests. It was sent  to Harry Reid from Mitch McConnell in 2009, just as President Obama  became President.         Dear Harry:        The Senate has the Constitutional duty to provide its       Advice and Consent on Presidential nominations, a duty which       we take seriously. In consultation with our Ranking Members,       we reaffirm our commitment to conduct the appropriate review       of these nominations, consistent with the long standing and       best practices of committees, regardless of which political       party is in the majority. These best practices serve the       Senate well, and we will insist on their fair and consistent       application.        Therefore, prior to considering any time agreements on the       floor on any nominee, we expect the following standards will       be met:        1. The FBI background check is complete and submitted to       the committee in time for review and prior to a hearing being       noticed.        2. The Office of Government Ethics letter is complete and       submitted in time for review and prior to a committee       hearing.        3. Financial disclosure statements (and tax returns for       applicable committees) are complete and submitted to the       committee for review prior to a hearing being noticed.        4. All committee questionnaires are complete and have been       returned to the committee. A reasonable opportunity for       follow-up questions has been afforded committee members, and       nominees have answered, with sufficient time for review prior       to a committee vote.        5. The nominee is willing to have committee staff       interviews, where that has been the practice.        6. The nominee has had a hearing.        7. The nominee agrees to courtesy visits with members when       requested.        8. The nominee has committed to cooperate with the Ranking       Member on requests for information and transparency.        There will be additional requirements, honoring the       traditions of the Senate, for judicial nominees. These common       sense standards and long standing practices will ensure that       the Senate has had the opportunity to fairly review a       nominee's record and to make an informed decision prior to a       vote.        Sincerely,                                                   Mitch McConnell,                                                 Republican Leader.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the letter.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                       U.S. Senate,                                 Office of the Republican Leader,                                                  February 12, 2009.      Hon. Harry Reid,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Harry: The Senate has the Constitutional duty to       provide its Advice and Consent on Presidential nominations, a       duty which we take seriously. In consultation with our       Ranking Members, we reaffirm our commitment to conduct the       appropriate review of these nominations, consistent with the       long standing and best practices of committees, regardless of       which political party is in the majority.

Sincerely,                                                   Mitch McConnell,                                                 Republican Leader.     Mr. President, I plan to return the exact same letter to  my friend, the majority leader, with the same requests. In 2009, the  then-minority leader called these benchmarks ``common sense standards''  and ``long standing practices.''   I agree with him. These standards do not indicate a lack of maturity.  They show an abundance of common sense, just as his letter said. I  remind the majority that several, if not most, of the nominees have  actually failed to meet the qualifications laid out by this letter  given the hearing schedule.   The majority leader is fond of mentioning that many Obama nominees  passed quickly in 2009 and he asks that we do the same, but there is a  big difference between 2009 and today. President Obama's nominees met  all the standards laid out in then-Minority Leader McConnell's letter.  President-Elect Trump's nominees have not.   In 2009, every Obama Cabinet nominee had an ethics agreement in  before their hearing. Every Obama Cabinet nominee underwent a full FBI  background check before the Senate considered their nomination.  President-Elect Trump's nominees are way behind that mark.   I only ask, respectfully, that the Republican majority follow the  same set of standards they had in 2009 when the shoe was on the other  foot, especially because these nominees raise particular concerns. The  standards we have laid out as leaders of both parties address conflict  of interest and security concerns.    Of course, those are prime concerns, but there is another concern as  well. These nominees have, even collectively, very little experience or  record in government. Many of them have taken positions quite different  from the President-elect. They need to be thoroughly vetted, not just  before the U.S. Senate but before the American people. If, for  instance, Representative Price is for the privatization of Social  Security, but President-Elect Trump said he is not, what position is  nominee Price going to take? Jamming all these hearings into 1 or 2  days, making members run from committee to committee makes no sense.  After all, these nominees are going to hold incredibly powerful  positions for potentially the next 4 years. To spend an extra day or  two on each nominee, even if it takes a few weeks to get through them  all in order to carefully consider their nominations, is well worth it.  It is only fair that they are given a thorough and thoughtful vetting  and they abide by the ``long standing'' ethics practices that were  established--and laid out quite clearly by the majority leader  himself--to ensure Cabinet officials were in good standing to work on  behalf of the American people.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, first, let me thank my good friend from  Maine for his usual eloquent remarks.   I thank my colleague from Connecticut, who is one of our great  speakers and mainstays, who has let me sneak in ahead of him. So I will  be brief.   My Democratic colleagues are holding the floor tonight to demonstrate  our solidarity and our commitment to defending the Affordable Care Act.  It is not just defending some abstract law. It is not about protecting  President Obama's legacy or Democrats' legacy. It is about people. It  is about the American people and their access to affordable health  care. It is about defending a health care system that has been made  fairer, more generous, more accessible, and more affordable for the  American family. It is about men and women and children whose stories  we have heard tonight from Member after Member, one part of the country  to the other, and their lives have been changed. In many cases, their  lives have been saved by health care reform.    That is why Democrats have held the floor tonight. Though the hours  have waned on, we will fight this repeal with every fiber of our being.  We will not go gently into that good night.   The history of health care reform has been cast and recast by both  parties, but there is a truth to be told amidst a lot of fiction. Here  is a truth. Before the Affordable Care Act, our health care system was  a mess. Health care costs were growing at a rate much faster than they  are today, eating into workers' paychecks, dissuading them from taking  risks and changing jobs lest they lose good coverage. A debilitating  illness could wipe away a lifetime of hard-earned savings because  insurers could put limits on how much treatment they would cover. Women  were charged more for the same health care coverage. Many couldn't get  insurance if they had a preexisting condition. Some insurance companies  would simply delete you from the rolls if you got sick; in short,  premiums spiraling up, spotty coverage, discriminatory practices, a  marketplace out of balance. I remember the days before health care  reform, before ACA. Everyone was complaining about the system. This  idea that everything was hunky-dory and then ACA came in is fiction.   I was involved. We knew health care reform would be difficult. It is  a $3 trillion industry with complicated rules and procedures. The  politics were arduous. For that reason, health care reform had  bedeviled Congresses and Presidents for decades. We knew in 2009 that  we had a rare opportunity and that it was too important to let politics  or lobbyists or special interests or fear stand in the way.   In the past, Democrats were able to make progress on smaller slices  of the overall pie. The CHIP program, my dear friend who is no longer  here, Senator Jay Rockefeller, championed it. Getting generic  prescription drugs on the market, I was involved in that, along with  the Senator from Utah. Never, never was a Congress able to pass a  comprehensive package of reforms to the health care system until the  ACA--the greatest leap forward in American health care, certainly since  the passage of Medicare and Medicaid.   You can measure the results. The law has helped bend the health care  costs curve down, insured more Americans than any time in our Nation's  history since we started measuring the uninsured rate, all while  providing higher quality health care.   Is the act perfect? No, no one ever said it was. I have listened to  my friend the majority leader and our Republican colleagues on the  floor these past few weeks. They used quotes from President Obama  saying the law could use improvements as proof that it is failing.   That doesn't hold up. Go look at the full quotes. No one ever said  the law would be perfect. We all know it could use some fixes. I, for  one, am for a public option--we nearly had it in 2009--to increase  competition in marketplaces where there is still too little. But scrap  the whole thing and go back, back to a chaotic marketplace,  inconsistent coverage, skyrocketing premiums? No way. Back to 40  million uninsured Americans, back to discriminating against women and  Americans with preexisting conditions? No way.   Democrats don't want to make America sick again. We don't want to  repeal the largest expansion of Affordable Health Care since Medicare  and Medicaid and leave chaos in its wake--chaos instead of affordable  care. That is what the Republican plan would do, sure as I am here  tonight.   This evening, as colleague after colleague has come to the floor to  describe how the ACA is helping their constituents, helping nurses,  helping rural hospitals, helping students, helping seniors, I hope my  Republican friends may have listened to them. The American people  certainly are. They have been watching this debate. We have been  talking to them on the phones, and they will carefully consider the  consequences of repealing this law, and I hope our Republican  colleagues will--particularly without a viable comprehensive  replacement.   With the close of this long night, I make a simple plea to my  Republican colleagues: Turn back. It is not too late. You are already  hearing the grumblings from Members on the left side of your caucus and  the right side of your caucus.   Well, they are starting to say, now that you have some power here,  you are in the majority, maybe we shouldn't repeal without replace,  even though for 6 years you have been unable to come up with a  replacement.   The Republican Senators from Maine, Arkansas, Tennessee, and  Kentucky, former Senator Rick Santorum, even the President-elect says  that maybe we should replace and figure out how to replace before we  repeal, but with this vote, it would just repeal it.   My simple advice to my Republican colleagues is turn back. The health  care of Americans hang in the balance. Affordable care for every  American hangs in the balance. If Republicans repeal the ACA without a  detailed comprehensive plan to replace it, not a mere framework, not a  set of principles, not a bunch of small-ball policies cobbled together,  they will create utter chaos, not affordable care.   It is not too late. Work with us Democrats. If you tell us tomorrow  you are giving up on repeal, we will work with you to improve it. We  know there  [[Page S176]]  needs to be some improvements, but don't scrap the law, leaving all  those in the lurch and then come to us and say: Now let's fix it.   You better have a replacement. Something you haven't been able to do  for 6 years. It is not too late. Work with us Democrats on improving  the law. Work with us on making it better. Don't scrap it and make  America sick again. Turn back before it is too late. It will damage  your party. It will hurt millions of Americans, far more importantly,  and hurt our great country.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
