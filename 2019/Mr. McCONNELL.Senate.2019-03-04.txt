 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I know the entire Senate joins me today  in offering deep sympathies to the communities affected by yesterday's  spate of tornadoes in east Alabama and Georgia. As first responders  continue to search for survivors in the rubble, we know that at least  23 innocent lives were lost to this disaster all in Lee County, AL. Our  condolences are especially with their loved ones, and our gratitude is  with the emergency personnel and local officials who spearheaded  evacuation and rescue efforts.   The people of Alabama are all too familiar with the pain caused by  devastating storms like yesterday's. The entire region has been hit  hard in recent years, seemingly by one disaster after another. They  continue to brace against the threat of tornadoes and the flooding that  so often impacts communities in my State of Kentucky.   At every step of the way--from response and recovery to resilient  achievement--Alabama has benefitted from the devoted leadership of  Senator Richard Shelby. On the specific issue of disaster recovery, his  hard work and steady hand have helped to lead the charge. When  supplemental funding for natural disaster relief receives floor time  here in the Senate, it will be thanks to the hard work of our  colleagues like Senator Perdue, Senator Isakson, and others, and,  certainly, Chairman Shelby.   Of course, this is far from the only area in which Richard Shelby has  delivered results for his State and for our Nation. For years, he has  made a personal mission out of restoring and improving our Nation's  infrastructure. He has brought wise and decisive leadership as our  chief appropriator, and the State of Alabama bears countless signs of  Senator Shelby's dedicated service--from supporting the missile defense  and space exploration programs in Huntsville to helping to establish  the National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, where researchers forecast  floods and work to mitigate water-related hazards.   It is fitting today to praise Senator Shelby's continued service. It  also happened that, over the weekend, the senior Senator from Alabama  became the longest serving senator in the history of his State. I  couldn't be happier to recognize my friend Richard Shelby on this  occasion, and I know each of our colleagues will join me in  congratulating him on the years of faithful service to Alabamians that  have made this recognition possible.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all postclosure time on  the Rushing nomination be considered expired at 4 p.m. on Tuesday,  March 5; further, that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        Committee on Foreign Relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, March 4, 2019, at 5 p.m., to conduct a  hearing entitled ``Status of the Global Magnitsky Investigation related  to the Khashoggi Murder.''                            ____________________     I understand that H.R. 1112 has been received from the  House and is at the desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for its second reading and, in order to  place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I  object to my own request.    Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Armed Services be discharged from further consideration of  S. 252 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 92, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  preamble be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  March 5; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive  session to resume consideration of the Rushing nomination under the  previous order; finally, that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until  2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:38 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, March 5, 2019, at 10 a.m.
