 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment to H.R. 5895,  the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations  Act of 2019.   I first want to thank the gentleman from Idaho, Congressman Mike  Simpson, the chairman of the House Appropriations Energy and Water  Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee, for working with us to  develop a strong, pro-science appropriations bill.   I strongly support division A of this legislation, and I appreciate  the chairman's initiative in basic science research.   This amendment provides for critical facility upgrades and  construction of basic research infrastructure that are within the core  mission of the Department of Energy and will lead to scientific  discoveries that will maintain U.S. leadership in innovation and  technology.   In February, the House unanimously passed three bipartisan House  Science, Space, and Technology Committee research infrastructure bills:  H.R. 4376, the Department of Energy Research Infrastructure Act; H.R.  4377, the Accelerating American Leadership in Science Act; and H.R.  4378, the Nuclear Energy Research Infrastructure Act. These bills  authorized full funding for upgrades in construction of several high- priority user facilities at DOE National Labs.   This amendment provides $76.8 million from within funds appropriated  to the Office of Science to meet the House-passed authorization levels  for four of the infrastructure projects included in these bills,  including the LINAC Coherent Light Source high energy upgrade, the  proton power upgrade to the Spallation Neutron Source, the construction  of the Spallation Neutron Source Second Target Station, and the  construction of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.   My amendment also fully supports basic research in fusion energy  science, a field that could lead to a revolutionary new energy source.  Specifically, it provides $50 million from within the funds  appropriated to the Office of Science for the direct U.S. commitment  for fiscal year 2019 to the construction of the International  Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, project.   While I am pleased that division A of this legislation provides $163  million for the agreed-to hardware and other in-kind contributions,  cash contributions to ITER are not designated in the bill. My amendment  is intended to address this issue and fully fund the U.S. commitment in  fiscal year 2019.   I want to also draw attention to another shared priority with the  chairman, reinstating the Low Dose Radiation Research Program at DOE.  This program is essential to understanding the health impact of low  doses of radiation.   There is a broad consensus within the radiobiology community that  more research is necessary for Federal agencies, physicians, and  related experts to make better-informed decisions regarding low-dose  radiation.                                time  1800    Earlier this year, the House passed H.R. 4675, the Low Dose Radiation  Research Act, which authorizes $20 million in fiscal year 2019. I hope  we can work together to provide this funding for low dose radiation  research.   Mr. Chair, I again thank Chairman Simpson for his long-standing  support of basic research and investments in DOE's best-in-the-world  science facilities.   I greatly appreciate the effort the chairman has made to prioritize  fundamental science and our long-standing partnership to responsibly  fund DOE.   Mr. Chair, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment and to continue  working with the chairman to advance the House-passed authorization  levels for these important projects in conference.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate Chairman Simpson's  commitment and support.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I withdraw my amendment.
