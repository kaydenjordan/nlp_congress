 Mr. President, I remember sitting in a House Oversight  Committee hearing years ago on the Flint water crisis. At the time, my  oldest daughter Abigail was just a year old.   I remember looking out into the audience and seeing just a hand  holding a baby bottle up from the middle of a crowd in that hearing  room. That baby bottle looked exactly like the one that my own baby  drank out of. It was a little bottle with a pink top.   But unlike my daughter's bottle, the water in this one was brown, a  muddy, murky brown.   I couldn't, and all these years later I still can't, begin to imagine  what it would have been like to have to drink that water while I was  pregnant or to have no choice but to give it to my baby because the  system that I trusted to provide my family with clean, safe drinking  water had failed me.   But that kind of nightmare remains the everyday reality for far, far  too many parents across this country.   It has been 7 years since the leaders of the city of Flint tried to  save a few dollars by swapping out its drinking water supply from  Detroit's system to the Flint River, setting off a chain of events that  poisoned nearly 9,000 kids in just 18 months.   But the damage inflicted on that community will never go away, and  while Flint was a tragedy, it was not an anomaly. According to both the  EPA and CDC, there is no known safe level of lead in a child's blood.  Yet more than 6 million homes continue to get water from lead service  lines, including in my own home State of Illinois, which has more known  lead service lines than any other State in the country.   And despite lead service lines being banned nearly 35 years ago, as  of 2019, roughly half a million children under the age of 6 still had  elevated levels of lead in their blood--something that can cause  permanent brain damage.   And lead is just one of the many issues that communities struggle  with every day due to our outdated and dilapidated water systems.   But instead of working to address these known issues, the Federal  Government's share of capital spending in the water sector fell from 63  percent in 1977 to a meager 9 percent in 2017.   And now, our dwindling Federal and State investments into our water  infrastructure are allowing countless Americans to be exposed to  pollutants, whether it is from taking a sip from their kitchen faucets  or even just living near an outdated stormwater system.   Part of the problem with water infrastructure is that it is expensive  and no one sees it--out of sight, out of mind. But that only lasts  until there is a major problem, like in Texas, where over 15 million  people were temporarily left without access to clean water.   Well, we have to stop waiting for our infrastructure to fail before  we invest in it. We cannot wait around for another crisis to sicken our  families before we decide to put real State and Federal dollars into  rebuilding our drinking water and wastewater systems.   Imagine if your child was one of those who had gotten sick because  legislators refused to take action on such an obvious crisis. Imagine  if you had to be the one to get your newborn to sip on water too opaque  to see through.   We should not let even one more parent suffer through that worst-case  scenario. Access to clean water is a human right, and every American  deserves access to clean water, no matter their ZIP Code, the color of  their skin, or the size of their income.   It is long, long past time that we turn that right into a reality by  investing in the kinds of projects that would put Americans back to  work rebuilding our crumbling water infrastructure. We must  dramatically increase Federal investments to provide every family  access to the most basic human needs--clean water.   That is one reason why I introduced the Drinking Water and Wastewater  Infrastructure Act of 2021. If our Nation  [[Page S2320]]  truly wants to build back better, we can't only pour money into fixing  our roads while failing to repair the pipes beneath them.   Because water infrastructure is infrastructure, everyone needs it in  every corner of this country.   My bipartisan bill would invest significant Federal dollars to help  States, communities, and schools fix and upgrade aging water systems to  improve water quality, while fostering economic growth throughout the  country.   Our legislation seeks to reauthorize and enhance State revolving loan  funds, which are the most effective tools we have to provide States  with Federal investments that empower local leaders to modernize water  systems, implement lead reduction projects, and rebuild stormwater  overflow infrastructure.   Our bill would also continue getting shovels into the ground and  support quality jobs by reauthorizing the WIFIA financing program, an  initiative that already helped finance nearly $20 billion for water  infrastructure projects and created 49,000 jobs in just under 7 years.   It would provide more than $700 million in lead testing and reduction  programs, in part through a program very close to my heart, the  voluntary lead testing in schools and childcare facilities program,  expanding it to go beyond testing to include lead reduction   Of course, it is not sufficient to simply increase investment  levels--we must enact policies that effectively distribute critical  dollars in a fair and just manner that prioritizes the most vulnerable  Americans, and the most pressing public health and safety needs.   That is why my bipartisan legislation prioritizes environmental  justice by providing direct help to small, disadvantaged, rural and  tribal communities that have been ignored for far too long.   By lowering non-Federal cost-shares, creating new grants and allowing  for debt forgiveness, we can help communities that typically struggle  to afford traditional loans. This includes Centerville, IL, a community  that needs resources to kick start projects that will rebuild their  catastrophically failing systems that allow sewage to seep into my  constituents' homes whenever it rains.   Look, we must face the awful reality that a community's racial and  economic composition are the top predictors of waste facility  locations--and we should be outraged that these environmental justice  communities are often neglected in favor of wealthy areas that are home  to rate payers that can cover the cost of safe water.   Congress cannot abandon American communities simply because they  cannot afford to update their water infrastructure . . . especially  when we know that the Federal Government failed to prevent this crisis  from happening.   Concerns about the health effects of lead pipes date back all the way  back to the late 1800's--yet Congress didn't ban the use of lead  service lines until 1986! And even then, the Federal Government allowed  lead pipes already in the ground to remain . . . forcing too many of  our communities to essentially drink through a ``lead straw'' to this  very day.   We helped create this problem. Now, it's on us to help fix it.   Our mission lies right before us: work together to protect the health  of our most vulnerable neighbors and achieve a reality where: no  elementary-schooler is scared to use their school's drinking fountain;   no parent questions whether it's safe to give their child a glass of  water before bedtime; and   no family comes to expect that their house will be flooded by sewage  every time it rains.   At the end of the day, it's simple the condition of our water  infrastructure is a crisis. It is a crisis that is daunting, yes, and  devastating, certainly--yet it's a crisis that is solvable. Every  dollar we spend improving our water systems can help save the health of  our future generations. And that is why I hope my colleagues will join  me in voting yes on the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure  Act of 2021.            Amendment No. 1471, as Modified, to Amendment No. 1460     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to executive session and resume consideration of  Executive Calendar No. 65, Cynthia Minette Marten, to be Deputy  Secretary of Education.    Madam President, first it was 5 minutes. Then it was  10.  [[Page S2341]]  Then, 15. I had no idea where she was, and, at the time, barely even  knew who she was. All I knew was that on her first day, as not just a  volunteer but a full-time employee, our latest hire was ridiculously  late to pick me up to drive me to the next campaign stop. Not a great  look for her first task on the job.   Twenty minutes passed. Then, 25. Then, 30. She still wasn't there.   Her name was Kaitlin ``Something,'' I remembered. Well, whenever  Kaitlin ``Something'' deigned to show up--if Kaitlin ``Something''  deigned to show up at all--she would get a lesson in working for a  former military officer who believed in the sanctity of clocking in at  0855 hours if your commanding officer told you to report at 0900 hours.   Thirty-five minutes went by. Then, 40.   It was only after 45 minutes had passed that I saw her car coming  around the bend. And while I could not have noted at the time, Kaitlin  ``Something'' was about to become one of the most important people in  my life. But on that day, she made me miss an event because we were too  late.   In the 15 years since that day that she showed up so incredibly late,  Kaitlin Fahey has gone from being an intern to being in charge of  interns, to, well, being in charge of me as my scheduler and then as my  chief of staff.   She has become a trusted political adviser, a confidant, a close  friend, and an honorary member of my family--someone I knew I could  turn to for a gut check and for the most brutally honest advice, the  person who can both calm me down and rev me up and who can switch  between the two on a dime.   From greasy fast food stops along campaign routes to the hallowed  halls of the Capitol Building that I am speaking in today, Kaitlin has  never left my corner. She has always pushed for what was good and  right, for what was best not just for me but for the people I  represented--never, ever accepting the word ``no'' when a ``yes'' might  be better to help even one family in one far-flung town of our home  State of Illinois.   Day after day, year after year, in role after role, she worked  tirelessly, not on my behalf but on behalf of every Illinoisan, every  American, proving along the way that you don't need to wear a nation's  uniform to serve our country; that you can serve America without ever  going to basic training or picking up a rifle; that you can serve  America, and change her forever and for the better, simply by caring  deeply and working tirelessly to make tomorrow a little bit better, a  little fairer than today.   There are a million stories I could tell about the work that Kaitlin  has done and all that she has accomplished, but I will hold myself to  just one: when she helped change Senate rules to allow babies onto the  floor for votes so that new parents could fulfill their duties to both  their children and the Constitution, showing moms and dads in every  pocket of this country that they shouldn't need to choose between  having jobs and having kids.   You can see why I call her ``The Hammer'' and why she is one of the  only people in the world who scares the living daylights out of me, but  in the best way possible. And you can also see why I have been so lucky  to have her in my corner all these years, to have her as a partner in  office pranks, and to have her as a sister, who I could count on to  simply sit in silence on the other end of the phone and cry with me  after my miscarriage.   This month was Kaitlin's last as my chief of staff. So, today, I just  want to say thank you to her.   Thank you to Kaitlin's wonderful family also--Scott, Ronan, and  Brenna--for lending us your wife and your mom.   And thank you, Kaitlin, for every moment of the last 15 years. Thank  you for imparting your humor and for humoring me, for showing that  warmth and strength can be one in the same, for not quitting when I  tried to get you to wear a wedding dress made out of camouflage  material, or when I got the office to take part in ``Talk like a Pirate  Day'' and do every memo in ``Pirate.'' Thank you for being the kind of  person who would jump out of a car and run out into the middle of the  street to help save a lost dog--which she actually just did this past  election day.   Thank you for keeping me in line and for building our team from the  ground up, running our office--first in the House and then in the  Senate--with grace, precision, and brilliance; prioritizing empathy and  compassion, common sense, and common decency; wearing a million hats  all at once yet always making sure our staff felt valued, heard, and  ever able to serve the people of Illinois. Thank you for being my  ``Hammer.''   I don't thank you for not letting me get a Margarita machine for the  office, however. But I also thank you for being my friend, for showing  up to drive me in your car that day, albeit 45 minutes late. You were  worth waiting for every one of those minutes. I love you   I yield back.
