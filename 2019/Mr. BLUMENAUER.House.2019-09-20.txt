 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Madam Speaker, every day, thousands of Americans  unwittingly sign contracts for nursing homes, credit cards, and  employment contracts that surrender their rights to their day in court  before an impartial judge and jury.   Instead, buried in the fine print of the contract, they agree to rely  on an arbitrator who doesn't have to follow the law or facts and will  have every incentive to favor the special interests that could give  them repeat business.   Typically, arbitration is not public. The Wells Fargo practice of  opening unauthorized bank accounts would have undoubtedly been exposed  and ended sooner if Wells Fargo hadn't enforced mandatory arbitration.   This is our chance to stand up for consumers, justice, and fairness.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1423, the FAIR Act.                            ____________________
