 Madam President, I rise today to discuss yet another of  the consequences of President Biden's policies, and that is that prices  are going up, the price hikes.   Families in West Virginia and across our Nation are struggling  because the policies and priorities of these past 2 years have made  essential items and goods seemingly unattainable. Whether it is gas,  goods or services, energy prices, utility costs, small business  expenses, owning a home, or simply affording to put food on the table,  American families are squeezed at every turn.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, prices have  risen 13.7 percent since President Biden took office. A recent report  from the Heritage Foundation found that because of that staggering  rise, the average American family has $7,400 less in their pocket at  the end of the year.   This is a timely topic today because the Federal Reserve has just  announced the eighth consecutive interest rate hike they have had to  deploy in order to curb this administration's 2-year spending spree  which is fueling our high-inflation economy. But an interest rate  hike--once reserved as a measure that sends a direct signal to  policymakers--is just another Wednesday in this President's America.   Chairman Powell warned last August that the continued interest rate  increases and inflationary pressures would bring ``pain to households  and businesses.'' And, boy, does that ring true today. Meanwhile,  President Biden continues to laud small inflation changes and slowed  economic growth, but he refuses to recognize his administration's role  in the record-high prices that the American middle class is continuing  to have to face or the further economic fallout Americans are likely to  face--projected by many economists--later this year from interest rate  hikes in the past year.   So let's just dive into this a little bit. Whether it is a  conversation with Senate colleagues, waiting in line at a store, or a  constituent calling my office, the cost of food remains a central topic  of concern all across this Nation. According to the most recent reports  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the cost of groceries went up 11.8  percent from the year prior. You hear about it with meat, eggs, bread,  and butter--all the essentials. To add to this, the cost of restaurant  purchases is up 8.4 percent. In fact, the price of every food category  has continued to grow at a faster rate than its historical average.   A recent PBS analysis also points out that America's rural population  is experiencing their cost of living going up faster and lingering  longer than those in urban areas, and that is a factor that  disproportionately impacts people in my State of West Virginia. In the  words of one West Virginian who wrote in to my office, ``How are we  supposed to keep our houses warm and food on the table?''   Speaking of housing, it remains unaffordable. Because of President  Biden's price hikes, fixed mortgage rates rose from 3.4 percent in  January of 2022 to over double, 7.12 percent, in a matter of months.  The National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index  dipped below 100, signifying that average American families do not have  enough money to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. In  other words, new families and hard-working individuals who made smart  financial decisions with the hope of purchasing a home can no longer  pursue that dream because it is out of reach; it is unaffordable.   Moving to energy--something that is absolutely central to the proud  history and tradition of our State, my State--despite the recent  downturn in energy prices, it can't be forgotten that Americans are  still paying 30 percent more for energy, and at its peak in June of  2022, it was 70 percent more. With costs  [[Page S187]]  like this becoming more mainstream--actually, gas is going up just  recently--American families are having to choose again between keeping  their lights on, filling their car with gas, or buying groceries.   This is not only unfair, but it is avoidable. It is avoidable for  folks living in a country with as many resources as we have right here  in the United States. It also shows the direct impact on our families  when leaders turn their backs on American energy.   Additionally, the U.S. manufacturing industry has not been exempt  from the economic woes created by this administration. The Institute  for Supply Management's manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index--that  is a big clump of words there--fell into contraction category in  November and December of 2022. Meanwhile, despite this, President Biden  has been touting a historic manufacturing boom that doesn't really  exist. The reality is, U.S. manufacturers may be on their way to a  recession, and the downturn will likely deepen as purchasing power  decreases and interest rates continue to rise, as they did today. This  further demonstrates how out of touch the administration is from the  devastating reality that American businesses are grappling with.   So if you don't believe me--I hope you do, but if you don't believe  me, take it from my constituents. Back home, they write frequently to  express the middle-class squeeze they are feeling. Erwin from Mercer  County in Southern West Virginia said that the current economic  condition has created a choice for him between driving to work and  feeding his family.   Paige from Buckhannon said something similar. She said:         I have full time jobs and two children. I'm tearful because       I sit here [wondering and] looking at upcoming bills and I'm       having to . . . pay a bill or buy groceries.    Ronald from Cabell County, over in the Huntington area:         How do you propose that I continue to be able to live with       increasing food prices--gasoline prices--and the ever-      increasing utility costs?    Jeremy in Raleigh County told me:         My electric bill at my residence is double the cost of my       mortgage every month. This is not sustainable. I will go       bankrupt just trying to keep the lights on.    But this isn't just impacting Jeremy because Jeremy is a great family  man and a great friend, and he is trying to help his friends,  neighbors, and family pay their electric bills as well.   So I am continuously inspired by this kindness that I see and the  generosity of West Virginians toward one another, but it shouldn't have  to come to this.   So my question to President Biden this week is, When is enough  enough? Even in areas where we have prices that are decreasing in  recent months, President Biden is trying to take credit when, in  actuality, prices are still much, much higher than when he took office.   Now more than ever, American families need leadership, not misleading  messages and attempts to take credit when it is not deserved. American  families are asking for a path out from the hole created by the price  hikes my colleagues and I will continue to highlight on the Senate  floor today.   With that, I see Senator Hyde-Smith from the great State of  Mississippi here to talk about, I am sure, similar issues. She has been  a champion of affordability and the middle-class worker to try to help  meet these very challenges that I outlined. So I welcome her.
