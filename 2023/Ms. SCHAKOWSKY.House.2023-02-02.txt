 Madam Speaker, I stand before my colleagues as a  proud Jew and a proud friend and colleague of Ilhan Omar.   I don't need any of you to defend me against anti-Semitism. My  friend, Ilhan Omar, and I have worked together on the values that I  treasure as an American Jew and that she treasures as an American  Islamic woman, the only one on the Foreign Affairs Committee. That is  the third largest religion in the United States of America.   I am just furious. We have seen all kinds of anti-Semitism from the  other side of the aisle.   As Americans, we should be welcoming differences. Vote ``no'' on  this. We need to defend our values as Americans and my values as a Jew.
