 Mr. Speaker, it is the time for authorizations, and one  of the topics of discussion today, of course, is our armed services  authorizations, military bills, as we get briefings on what is  necessary to defend our country from our external enemies.   However, let us not forget that when Nikita Khrushchev spoke to the  American public in the 1960s, he said:         We will take America without firing a shot. We will bury       you. We can't expect the American people to jump from       capitalism to communism, but we can assist their elected       leaders in giving them small doses of socialism until, one       final day, they wake up and find they are living in a       communist government.    Now, how could our great country, the strongest country in the world,  be destroyed from within?   I also point out that when the KGB was active in this country in the  seventies and eighties, the majority of agents were not spies. They  were not engaged in looking for our military secrets. They were,  apparently, out in the open, trying to corrupt Americans into how they  understood our country should be operating. They were taking advantage  of our freedoms in what is supposed to be a constitution made for a  moral and religious people.   How would you go about destroying America from within? First of all,  briefly, we would try to destroy the currency. We know there has been  wild and reckless spending recently, to the degree that our debt-to-GDP  ratio is the highest it has been since the end of World War II. Our  debt to gross national product is almost 100 percent.   We were there at the end of World War II, but we knew at the end of  World War II, millions of people were going to be laid off from the  military. We were going to stop building ships, planes, and tanks that  we needed. Sure enough, we dropped from about 100 percent of GDP to a  little over 20 percent during Nixon until we began to slowly creep up  again.   More recently, in part because of irresponsible legislation like the  American Rescue Plan or the successor to Build Back Better, which were  able to pass because the Democrats had the House, the Senate, and the  Presidency and were able to use something called reconciliation to get  it done, we have now shot back up near 100 percent, near an all-time  high.   This time, we don't see an area in the future in which hundreds of  thousands of soldiers and sailors are going to be laid off or that we  are going to stop building weaponry. Contrary to that, we do see an  aging population in which the amount we spend on Social Security and  Medicare is going to continue to go up.   I think you could say getting ahold of these people in this House and  persuading way too many of them that spending doesn't work, we have  approached an area, a crisis area, which could result in the end of the  United States.   Secondly, I think if I were going to destroy America, I would try to  destroy the family. Beginning in the 1960s, we had a welfare program  that was largely conditioned upon keeping one parent, usually the  father, out of the house.   This goal was made more apparent when Black Lives Matter, which  played such a big role in the 2020 elections, outright came out and  said they were opposed to the Western-prescribed nuclear family. Of  course, there was a tight alliance between Black Lives Matter and the  Democratic Party.   Within a few years of the Great Society in the sixties, it was  apparent that the welfare system was destroying families. Patrick  Moynihan, who eventually became a Senator up here, made it clear, by  1970, we were destroying families with this welfare program.   Apparently, because some people wanted to destroy families, his  warnings went unheeded. We worked our way toward a higher and higher  percentage of children being raised without a father in the home.   We also worked our way toward too many men not having families and  not  [[Page H2449]]  having a necessary purpose in life. Therefore, the crime rate went up,  this sort of thing.   I think another area in which you can see people working toward  communism were the people who wanted to expand this welfare state. We  all know, to get so many of the programs the welfare state offers, be  it low-income housing, medical care, Pell grants, all of these things,  it is kind of conditioned upon not having a man in the house.   The next area that I think we have to look at if one is destroying  America from the inside is unlimited immigration across our southern  border. Right now, on legal immigration, we swore in about a million  people last year, which is the highest it has been since 2006.    It varies from month to month, but in a normal month right now, there  are about 10 times the number of people coming into this country as  were coming in under the prior administration.   Why in the world would you allow--completely unnecessary. This was  not a problem 2, 2\1/2\ years ago. Why would you allow virtually  unfettered immigration across our southern border unless you want to  destroy our country?   These people who come here are not necessarily educated in what it  means to be an American. They do not receive a background check that  includes their home countries. It is a recipe for disaster. Like I  said, it is at a time when we are near record numbers of legal  immigrants.   We also know that the Biden administration is deporting people who  commit crimes at a rate of about one-quarter that Donald Trump was. Not  only are you allowing more people here, but even if you catch them  doing something wrong, you don't evict them. I think one way to destroy  America is just to let unlimited numbers of people come here, in this  case, across the southern border.   The next area that I think has to be looked at is Joe Biden's  obsession with blurring the differences between the sexes, which, after  all, is the foundation for the family. We can see the push toward  transgenderism throughout all areas of society.   There is a hospital near my district in which they remove the breasts  of teenage girls, 15-year-old girls. They put people on puberty  blockers. They give people other medications. They put it in people's  minds--in boys' minds that they might not be a traditional man, in  girls' minds that they might not be a traditional woman. This is  another way, I think, to eat away at the moral fabric of America.   The area I am going to focus on today is the Biden administration's  obsession with race and trying to divide Americans by race. In his  inaugural speech, I believe he mentioned racism four times and white  supremacy once.   In other words, if you have to say what is the theme behind Joe  Biden's inaugural speech, and different Presidents have different  themes, it is racism. He has continued along that path.   When he gave his State of the Union speech here a couple of months  ago, he talked about racism with the police.   Over the weekend, he gave a speech--I believe it was at Howard  University, but at some university, a graduation speech. One more time,  his emphasis was that we have a major problem with white supremacy in  this country.   First of all, let's look at the facts. Even his premise isn't true.  Then, we will look at the damage that can be done as we try to have  Americans look at themselves racially or look at themselves by where  their ancestors were born five or six generations ago.   If you look at countries around the world, people who come here from  other than European countries, you see people succeeding wildly. By  this, I mean succeeding wildly financially. I realize finances aren't  the most important thing in the world.   Right now, the ethnic group that makes more money than any other in  the United States--and I had this pointed out by a friend of mine who  was very proud of it because he is Indian--is Indian Americans who come  here, many of them, most of them, not even knowing the English  language. They are mostly not Christian. They are Hindu, a few Muslim.  They come here and are wildly successful.   Many other groups--Filipino, Sri Lankan, Cuban--all come here and  make more money than the average American.   It is so obvious that racism does not prevent people from living the  American Dream.   Over the weekend, I spent some time with the Hmong. The Hmong are an  ethnic group from Laos that helped the United States in the Vietnam  war, and because they helped the United States, many of them immigrated  to America.   Wisconsin happens to be the State in which we have the third highest  number of Hmong, and I always enjoy talking with them to see how wildly  successful they are. Again, this is a group that is not European and  many did not know English when they came here.   When I look around my district, Hmong are, almost uniformly, living  the American Dream. Interestingly, when I talk to them, almost all of  them have formed old-fashioned nuclear families, which, I think, helps  emotionally and spiritually with their children.   Like I said, educationally, economically, across the board, the Hmong  from Oshkosh and Neenah, Wisconsin--I spent the weekend in Manitowoc,  Wisconsin--are succeeding wildly, and that is consistent with the  statistics of other ethnic groups.   So, what is Joe Biden and the Democrats' response to this wild  success of people from around the world, and people, by the way, who  are not of European heritage?   I should also point out that a couple of times I do something that I  enjoy doing. I go down and watch the swearing-in ceremonies of people  coming here legally and becoming American citizens. They have them in  Milwaukee, Wisconsin.   When I go down there, almost none of the new citizens coming here are  from Europe. Overwhelmingly, it is Asia, Middle East, sub-Saharan  Africa, Latin America, all coming here. When you talk to them, because  they have had to be around here a few years, they all already are  successful, all so proud to be Americans. None are running away from  this country, and none of them mention racism as a problem.   Again, it is further evidence that we shouldn't have a problem.   Now, how has the Biden administration met with this situation? How  has our government as a whole, over the last 50 years, dealt with this  situation?   First of all, at the beginning of Joe Biden's term, 2 or 3 months in,  we had two Democratic Senators, Tammy Duckworth and Mazie Hirono, at a  time when the Senate was 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats, so every vote  was necessary for Joe Biden to get his nominees appointed. They came  out and said that they were not going to vote for any more White men  who are nominated to positions--kind of a shocking thing.   Then, they met with Joe Biden, who, I assume, held their hands. By  the way, they said they would accept White men if they were gay. I  would assume he held their hands and said there were a few White guys  who he had to allow in his administration.   Nevertheless, an obscure legal journal did some studying after the  first 2 years of the Biden administration. They looked at the 97 new  judges, which are some of the appointments a President has to make.  When they looked at the 97 judges, I would have expected maybe 25 or 30  being White men, which would have been, I think, lower than if you just  picked a number of lawyers across the board, say, over the age of 35 to  be judges. I would have guessed 20 or 25, and I would have thought that  is clearly too low. It was five.                                time  1215    Only 5 of 97 judges appointed in Joe Biden's first year were White  men and two of them happened to be gay, which is something that has  been hidden by the American press corps.   I am not sure how typical this is of his other appointments, but  clearly Joe Biden is using this as a tool to discriminate or to divide  Americans. He is also, in his proposed budget, adding new employees in  every agency--Commerce, Interior, Education, wherever you look--to  enforce this sort of racial identification.   I am sure he plans on them weighing in as to who gets new jobs. I am  sure he plans on them weighing in on who gets grants as businesses  around the country compete for grants. This is another way in which Joe  Biden's actions are meeting his words. He wants to turn America into a  country of competing ethnic groups.  [[Page H2450]]    Another thing he is doing that has been underpublicized right now is  for the purpose of determining whether a group needs preferences or  not. We look at Asians, and by Asians, we mean people coming all the  way from Japan around Asia, all the way through Pakistan, but not Iran.  We mean people from sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania, countries  like that. We mean Latin America, which could mean Cubans, it could  mean Colombians, could mean Haitians, whatever, these people get  preferences.   By the way, they get preferences over the native born. If somebody  shows up here from Nigeria, if somebody shows up here from Bolivia, for  the purposes of the forms that American businesses have to fill out or  that universities may fill out, these people who just arrive here get  preferences over the native born, and that is true even if they are  already wealthy when they come here.   If I am a Cuban who comes here worth a million dollars or well off in  Cuba planning to be a doctor in the United States, I will right away  get preferences on these forms over Americans who have been here for  generations.   President Biden, however, wants to add another group that can walk  around with a chip on their shoulder and be told they are discriminated  against. Those are people from the Arab world. Because right now,  people from Syria, people from Algeria, people from Egypt are not  considered minorities. They don't get special treatment. Well,  President Biden has made it clear that in the future he is taking the  first administrative steps to say this group should identify by their  ethnicity, identify by where they come from. Of course, when the bean  counters in the universities, the bean counters doing the hiring in the  Federal Government, when they get hold of these people, they will look  to give them preferences because they are supposedly picked on by not  being of European heritage.   I think a lot of Americans do not realize that this affirmative  action has been around for quite some time. Affirmative action, in  general, really was promoted a lot beginning 1965, which is to say  about 57 years ago. Thomas Sowell has written about affirmative action  around the globe and, of course, affirmative action was originally  supposed to be temporary for people of African-American descent.   Well, like affirmative action programs all over the world, it was not  temporary. We have had it for 75 years. And not only is it not  temporary, but you have a bureaucracy growing up promoting this  affirmative action. As it expanded from where it initially was to  include other areas, it was expanded to include Asians, it was expanded  to include Latin Americans, it was expanded to include women.   Right now, for the purposes of forms, having talked to people who  deal with this in human resources departments around the country, all  these other groups are supposedly or sometimes advised to get  preference.   The first time I ran across this--and I will digress for one second-- you are supposed to fill out a form called the EE01 if you have either  100 employees or less than that and you contract with the government. I  first ran across this when I was contacted by a human resources woman  and they had to fill out the EE01. I think they had 100 employees, but  they also sold some of their product to the Federal Government. They  were a manufacturer.   She said the firm that they hired to see how to deal with this  relationship with the Federal Government--there was a situation in  which they had four or five engineers, they wanted to hire a fifth or  sixth engineer and they were advised by this group that they should  hire a woman. They didn't have to hire a woman, but if they didn't hire  a woman and the Federal Government looked at them, they may get in  trouble for not hiring a woman. So they gave them a card of some group  somewhere referred to as the Wisconsin Society of Women Engineers and  they were told you should hire a woman.   Then they wanted to hire another member of management and the same  group told them, you don't have to hire a minority, but if you don't  hire a minority, you might get in trouble. You should look around and  see what you can do to hire minorities.   About 20 years ago, I dealt with this situation. It has been around  for over 50 years. Again, a goal apparently of which--since we don't  have a big prejudice problem in this country--is to try to encourage  people to walk around with a chip on their shoulder or ask for  something because of their ethnicity.   There are a variety of what I think are ridiculous rules that, in  addition to the fact that it is wrong on its face, that we should look  at regarding this affirmative action program.   First of all, you self-identify. Now, an extreme example of that is  the Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, she felt that she was  a 64th or 128th Native American, so she should get preferences. But it  is more common to have somebody who is maybe one-quarter something to  self-identify as, let's say, Latin American or something.   In this new world in which we have all these overpaid bureaucrats,  both in private industry and in the government, by identifying as one- quarter Cuban, you have the potential to get preferences.    Now, that is just divisive. It is ridiculous on its face. It also  doesn't matter how wealthy you are. Like I said, you could be Barack  Obama's daughters worth millions and millions of dollars, but you fill  out the form and for the purposes of university admissions, for the  purpose of Federal employment, you are treated as somebody put upon,  somebody who should walk around with a chip on their shoulder, somebody  who should get preferences.   In any event, I think it is something that the American public should  be aware of and look to end. These programs were originally designed  only for Black Americans and when they began well over 60 years ago, it  was supposed to be something that was temporary.   Instead, Joe Biden, I believe, is using it, the progressives are  using it to try to divide America, to try to create a situation in  which our future elections are contests between ethnic groups.   America is unique in that so far in our existence, people view  themselves as Americans above all, and when they go to vote, they vote  on issues: How much should we be spending on the military?   How much should we be spending on transportation, maybe social  issues?   Abortion has recently been a big issue. Taxation, how we should deal  with taxation.   However, the people who push this, I think, are causing people to  vote and say which politician is giving me more because of where my  ancestors are from. I think that is motivation. It is very dangerous.  It has always been a problem in other countries where we have  affirmative action.   I mentioned before Thomas Sowell wrote a book about affirmative  action, an older book today, but it is as fresh today as when he  originally wrote it. In it he talks about when governments don't treat  people equally but when they are supposed to pick between different  groups, those countries break down.   I have always felt one of the problems with Canada getting together a  decent government is, of course, they are divided by language. They  have got a French part of Canada and English parts of Canada, but there  are other areas in which outright civil war breaks out.   In Nigeria, where you have different ethnic groups, different  religions, Muslim in the north, Christian in the south, they have  always had problems. I remember when I was in high school, there was a  war over Biafra in which there tried to be a breakaway in Nigeria, and  to a certain extent, the hard feelings in Nigeria were encouraged by  affirmative action sort of programs.   Same thing in Sri Lanka, a country before they had affirmative  action, they had different ethnic groups. They got along fabulously.  Once the idea got in there that the government should pick and choose  people based on their ethnicity, they had a civil war, and for a  relatively tiny country, over 30,000 people died.   India, one of the difficult things that these incredibly smart and  resourceful people have had in getting together a good country is it is  divided between dozens of ethnic groups, certainly there is a big  religious divide between Hindu and Muslim, and that has really hampered  India. They are trying to deal with it. They sometimes deal with it  through affirmative action programs and, of course, that just increases  the  [[Page H2451]]  hard feelings they have in that country.   Same thing is true with Malaysia, another country. They have to deal  with the Chinese and the native Malays and only results in trouble and  hard feelings when we go down this affirmative action path.   There are other areas, for whatever reason, in society, even without  prompting from the government in which we are judging people where  their ancestors came from. There is a good book out there right now by  Heather McDonald talking about efforts being made to get rid of  standardized testing to get into medical school.   Well, I had always thought that the smartest kids are the ones who  became doctors, but it seems some of these bean counters don't like  that. They would rather focus on where people's ancestors came from  rather than how good you do on the standardized tests.   As a result, there are medical schools which are getting rid of  standardized tests altogether. So we are no longer getting the smartest  kids to be doctors, or in some medical schools we aren't. Instead, we  wind up with kids getting into medical school in part based on an  essay, maybe the more woke the essay the better. But, again, this idea  about judging people by their ancestry is not only going to be unfair  to people, but it is going to result in doctors who are no longer the  best in their class. It is going to be doctors who filled out the essay  the most or who did the most volunteer work or something and it is  inevitably going to result in the decline of the quality of American  medicine.   Just like as we push more affirmative action in American  manufacturing, push it more in important Federal jobs, push it more in  the judiciary instead of just merit, we are going to wind up with a  less competent judiciary, less competent manufacturing firms, less  competent professors, and will result in decline in America. I do  believe it is being pushed by the same people who are pushing our  welfare state, the same people who are for unfettered immigration, the  same people who are trying to destroy the nuclear family, the same  people who are trying to blur the differences between the sexes, and  each one of these things is a march toward destroying America from  within as Nikita Khrushchev warned us and promised us 50 years ago.   I encourage our negotiators, when it comes time to negotiate the  appropriation bills, to take out the provisions that Joe Biden has to  increase the amount of racial enmity around the country. I encourage  the colleges and universities around the country to not fall for this  idea that people's identity is based on where their ancestors came from  many years ago.   I mean, think of this: I can grow up next to a Cuban family. I can  have my best friend be the son of a Cuban family. We can go to the same  schools together. We can play on the same basketball team together, but  somehow these bean counters say you are all such different people  because your great great-grandparents lived in Cuba and your great  great-grand parents lived in Germany.                                time  1230    We see such a diverse group of people. We encourage our negotiators  to take that out. We encourage the benefactors of the universities  around the country to not allow this to happen there. We encourage  people to get rid of these affirmative action programs.   One other way, by the way, that they hurt America is they encourage  what I think of as lying. I ran into a guy recently from my district  who had a business--and he knew a lot of other people in a similar  business--who had their wives named as the owner of the company. They  lied. My friend, a good honest Christian, wasn't going to lie and  pretend that his wife owned the company, so he didn't get the advantage  of this.   Mr. Speaker, those are my requests--things that the American press  corps should be paying attention to but aren't.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Education and the Workforce be permitted to file its report to  accompany H.J. Res. 45 at any time today, May 18, 2023.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 31 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, May  22, 2023, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
