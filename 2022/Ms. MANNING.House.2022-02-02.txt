 Mr. Speaker, on February 1, 1960, four young Black North  Carolina A&T State University students began a revolution with the  simple but fiercely significant act of sitting down.   David Richmond, Jibreel Khazan, Joe McNeil, and Franklin McCain,  ``The Greensboro Four,'' took their seats at the White-only lunch  counter of the Woolworth Department Store in Greensboro, North  Carolina. Despite being met with hostility and a store manager who  refused them service, the Greensboro Four stayed seated at that  counter, refusing to stand until the store closed.   The next day they returned to the Woolworth Store with 25 more  students, including Bennett Belles from the neighboring Bennett  College, an all-female HBCU. Their movement spread to 55 cities in 13  States. Protest signs read: Support North Carolina Students, in  demonstrations outside the South. By the end of 1960, 400  demonstrations had taken place across the country.   By staying seated at that counter, those students inspired the Nation  to stand up against the blatantly racist Jim Crow laws of that time.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize the Greensboro  Four and the courageous students who joined their protest, sparking a  national  [[Page H340]]  movement for civil rights. Those students exhibited great bravery in  the face of violence from counter protesters. All the while, they  remained peaceful and undeterred.   Their peaceful protest left a legacy that shaped the Civil Rights  Movement. That sit-in, and hundreds that followed, led to the 1960s  Civil Rights Act, a crucial step toward dismantling segregation.   Today, that very Woolworth Building is the location of Greensboro's  amazing International Civil Rights Center and Museum, which still  contains that lunch counter and enshrines this movement in history,  commemorating the actions of the Greensboro Four and all who joined  them. That museum was recently denied a shuttered operator grant.   Last year, I joined my fellow North Carolina Representatives, Alma  Adams and G.K. Butterfield, in leading a congressional resolution to  honor the Greensboro Four. The resolution encourages all States to  teach the history of the Greensboro Four sit-in in their educational  curriculum.   I was proud to reintroduce that resolution with Representatives Adams  and Butterfield again this year on the 62nd anniversary of the sit-in.   This Black History Month, and all year long, it is vital that we  recognize the countless contributions of Black Americans and the work  that remains to end racism and ensure equality and justice for all.                                time  1100    I am proud to be the representative of the city of Greensboro and all  of North Carolina's Triad Sixth District. I will do everything I can to  preserve this history, honor our civil rights heroes, and combat racism  and discrimination in all forms.   As we reflect on this event, it is important to recognize that even  with the odds stacked against these students, they never lost hope.  They saw our Nation broken and segregated. They faced hatred every day,  but they persevered and successfully led a movement that changed the  Nation.   Today, we draw inspiration and hope from the Greensboro Four.                            ____________________
