 Madam Speaker, today, we vote on this bill that  improves the Affordable Care Act by cutting the cost of healthcare for  families at an unprecedented, anxious time in American life.   More than 2.5 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19. In  the insurance world, that means millions more with a preexisting  condition.   Astonishingly, in the midst of this healthcare emergency, when we  should be protecting coverage, the Trump administration, last week,  asked the Supreme Court to strike down the entire ACA.   If Mr. Trump has his wish, those 2.5 million Americans, along with  130 million others with preexisting conditions, will lose the landmark  pro-patient protection that has been on the books for the past 10  years, namely, the right to health coverage even if you have been sick  before and the confidence and serenity to know that you won't be  charged more because of an illness in your past.   It is right there on the first page of the ACA, section 2704:  ``Prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions or other  discrimination based on health status.''   Yet, the administration in its brief filed with the U.S. Supreme  Court a few days ago says: ``The entire ACA must fall.'' That is a  verbatim quote.   Well, Madam Speaker, if the ACA falls, preexisting condition  protections fall with it, along with age-26 coverage for dependent  children and the elimination of lifetime limits on health coverage,  which will devastate patients with chronic illness.                                time  1300    Last night, The Wall Street Journal reported that the President once  again admitted that neither he nor his Senate majority have the  slightest clue what their plan is if their wrecking ball of the ACA  succeeds.   Madam Speaker, during the last 4 months' avalanche of layoffs,  millions of Americans have desperately reached out to their State's ACA  exchanges in search of health coverage after losing job-based  insurance, 54,000 just in Connecticut alone.   At this time of severe economic uncertainty when a deadly virus is  ravaging communities both rural and urban, we must do everything in our  power to strengthen health insurance and make it more affordable, which  this bill does. To shrink from this challenge and roll back the clock  on 10 years of progress would be a complete dereliction of duty.   Vote ``yes'' on this bill.
