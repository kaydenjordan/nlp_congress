 Madam Speaker, libertad. Freedom. Abajo la dictadura.  Down with the dictatorship.   These are the calls we are hearing from the people of Cuba.   They have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Castro  tyranny.   We see the American flag waving on the streets of Havana because they  yearn for the same thing we have: Freedom. We see the American flag  waving on the streets of Havana because that is what they want,  freedom.   Castro has taken repression to scientific levels. There are at this  hour over 500 political prisoners and thousands more are in jail.   Madam Speaker, we are begging President Biden to stand with the  Cubans now. The Castro regime has cut off the internet so no one will  see how they are torturing the Cuban people. America has the technology  to provide internet now in Cuba.   We don't need any study groups about remittances. What we need is  action. We need the President to grant the green light now so that  Cubans can organize among themselves and can stay in the streets; so  they don't feel abandoned; so they know the whole world is watching; so  they can decide their own political future. Time is of the essence.
