 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  positive effects the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already having on  individuals and businesses in the First Congressional District of  Georgia.   Two weeks ago, I traveled the First District and visited high school  students, university students, senior citizens, small businesses, big  businesses, and more to get their feedback on the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act. The results from my trip and the benefits that the First District  is already reaping were, frankly, astounding.  [[Page H1356]]    For example, Lee Container Company in Homerville said that the new  tax law has allowed them to purchase at least three machines a year and  to fully amortize them, allowing their company to grow at a substantial  rate.   Businesses like Lee Container and the large number of individuals in  Homerville that they employ are a reason it was so important to pass  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   With the new tax law, businesses can employ more people, increase  salaries, invest in their business and communities, and help our  economy to thrive.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my good friend and chairman  of the Subcommittee on Environment's legislation, the Nuclear Waste  Policy Amendments Act of 2017.  [[Page H1360]]    This legislation is important, not only because of what it means for  the future of clean energy opportunities for this country, but also  what this means for the safety of our communities. Nuclear energy has  become a safe and effective way to generate large amounts of energy  capability, while maintaining a source that doesn't produce greenhouse  gas emissions.   We have come a long ways from Three Mile Island and the safety  standards in place to ensure our communities and our grid aren't  negatively impacted by nuclear energy. The Nuclear Waste Policy  Amendments Act would finally put in place a permanent repository for  the waste generated by energy production that powers millions of homes  and businesses across the United States.   As of December, there were 61 nuclear power plants in the United  States with 99 operating nuclear reactors. Those nuclear plants provide  nearly 20 percent of the country's energy production capability. This  is significant because these plants have continued to provide reliable  flows of energy for decades, giving Americans a carbon-free source of  energy to fuel their consumption.   But one thing hasn't been addressed: what to do with that spent fuel.  We began a process in the 1980s to seek and construct a permanent  repository for the Nation's spent fuel, eventually coming to Yucca  Mountain in Nevada. This site was decided upon, due to its geological  features, and extensively studied to ensure it could be done in a safe  and effective manner.   Millions of dollars were spent studying and doing initial project  development of the site, but it was eventually halted, and that  progress was stalled. While this was going on, ratepayers in 39 States  continued to pay towards the cleanup fund for a total of nearly $40  billion. However, that money hasn't been able to be put towards a  permanent repository due to resistance.   In Georgia, at Plant Vogtle, we are currently undergoing the only  nuclear energy construction project in the country, in large part  because of issues that have deterred companies from wanting to expand.  That means that people are losing out on energy production, and it  actually creates clean energy.   My good friend's legislation authorizes the disposal of spent nuclear  fuel and high-level radioactive waste to find a safe, permanent place  in contrast to the temporary locations at each nuclear plant. It also  authorizes a consolidated interim storage site to ensure there is an  option available for the eventual transition.   This is something that needs to get done, and soon. Right now, spent  fuel is sitting on site in either dry casks or spent fuel pools without  an alternative. Now is the time for us to pass this bipartisan  legislation and recognize that we have carbon-neutral energy sources in  place, and have for decades, but we need to get this across the finish  line to support our communities and our country.   I urge my colleagues to support the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments  Act because it will give the United States the chance to, once again,  be a global leader on our nuclear energy and to secure our communities.  I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue.
