 I thank the bold and courageous women of the  House of Representatives with the Democratic Party for their strong  hearts, minds, and leadership in pressing the action for passage of  H.R. 6, which will help millions of people--men, women, and children-- who by all accounts are already Americans.   They pay taxes, serve in our military, and attend our schools. They  should not be dehumanized by calling them illegals or illegal aliens.  Don't stereotype them as drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. They are  real people contributing to America's greatness.   My district alone has over 7,000 constituents who would benefit from  these Dream, TPS, and DED reforms. These are Americans whom the system  is failing, people who grew up on the foundational American principle  that if you work hard, you can improve the future for your children.  And they do work hard.   But Republican inaction and hostility have put their American Dream  at risk, and they face deportation to a country they have never known.   My Republican colleagues should recognize that this is a good bill.  It is a necessary bill. It is a bill that will improve the country we  all love. Have a heart. Pass H.R. 6.
