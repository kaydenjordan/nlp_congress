 Mr. President, this amendment is the first step to  determine how we invest in our infrastructure moving forward.   Since 2008, we have repeatedly bailed out the highway trust fund.  That makes it a trust fund that we cannot actually trust.   A highway cost allocation study provides the data that we need in  order to make long-term, sustainable, and fiscally sound decisions  about how best to invest in our Nation's aging infrastructure. These  studies used to occur regularly, but the last one was completed over 20  years ago.   My amendment would direct the Department of Transportation to carry  out a study in 4 years, giving those of us here in Congress a full year  to analyze the results before the highway programs expire once again.  We can't continue to burden future generations with out-of-control  spending, and this amendment is a signal to future Congresses that we  must find lasting solutions for infrastructure investment.   I want to thank Senator Kelly and Senator Cornyn for their support in  this effort, and I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this  amendment.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize my summer 2021  interns. Team Lummis was fortunate to be joined this summer by an  amazing group of six interns, in both our State and DC offices. These  young people's willingness to participate in an internship shows  motivation to learn, dedication to becoming educated and engaged  citizens, and a love for the State of Wyoming and this country.   Interacting with this group of interns has been rewarding for both my  staff and me and given us renewed hope for the future. As they leave  our office and embark on their next adventures, I want to thank: Tanner  Conley, Karryn MacDonald, Payton McEndree, and Madison Stoddard who  served in my DC office; Bailey Harshell, who served in my Casper  office; and Sullivan Fagan who served in my Cheyenne office. Keep  working hard, take pride in the work you do, and don't forget to enjoy  the ride.                            ____________________
