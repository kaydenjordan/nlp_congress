 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   My friend across the aisle who is so concerned about not having  environmental policy in the NDAA certainly showed no concern in prior  years when bad environmental policy was made against protections for  prairie chicken and sage-grouse in the NDAA. Today, we can make some  good environmental policy.   These bills are familiar to us because they passed with broad  support; they are well-vetted; and they include my Northwest California  Wilderness, Recreation, and Working Forests Act, which will protect  380,000 acres of new wilderness, designate 480 miles of wild scenic  river, and includes an ambitious restoration plan to improve forest  health, promote fire resiliency, and expand outdoor recreation.   These are good bills. They deserve our support.
