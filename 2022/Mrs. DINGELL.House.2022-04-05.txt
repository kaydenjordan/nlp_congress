 Mr. Speaker, for 35 years, Fred Upton has been a  devoted public servant for southwest Michigan, all of Michigan, and our  Nation.   Throughout his career, he has always put the people he served first.  To him, bipartisan and compromise are not forbidden words. Fred knew  well that if we are going to deliver real solutions for the American  people, we need to come together and listen to all perspectives, no  matter how complicated the issue might be. It is because of that  thinking, he was able to get so much done in Congress.   I am especially proud of all that we have been able to accomplish  together. Thanks to his partnership, we were able to pass legislation  to protect the Great Lakes for future generations and lower the cost of  healthcare for all Americans. Together, we have championed removing the  harmful PFAS chemicals from our Nation's drinking water, and I am  confident we are going to get this to the President's desk.   While we may not have found harmony on every issue, Fred and I always  managed to disagree without vitriolic rhetoric and mean-spirited  language. Even through our toughest discussions, Fred always found a  way to make me laugh, except today. It is his civility that I--and  Congress--will miss the most.   Fred really believed that he was an American first, that reaching  across the aisle was important, that working together is how we get  things done for the American people. His retiring is a loss for this  country, and especially the people of Michigan.   Fred is a dear friend to me, was John's best friend, and was there  when John died. The Dingell family loves him. He is one of the greatest  Michiganders to serve our country. I wish him, Amey, and their family  the best as they prepare for the next adventure. And there will be one.  Thank you, Fred.                            ____________________
