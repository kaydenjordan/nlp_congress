 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Plaskett  for yielding and for her continued leadership in advancing equity and  access for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to speak about something that is far too  often ignored in our communities, especially the African American  community: mental health.   Before starting my career in public office, I obtained a master's in  counseling and worked as a mental health professional. As someone with  real-life experiences, I can tell you that mental health challenges are  more common than anyone thinks and that the only path forward is to be  open and honest about it so more people can get the help and support  they need to be healthy and thriving.   According to recent surveys, African Americans are 20 percent more  likely to experience psychological distress than White Americans, but  just 25 percent will seek care compared to 40 percent of White  Americans. Clearly, stigma around mental health and therapy remain a  significant barrier to connecting those in need with care.   We can all agree that Americans, no matter where they live or what  they look like, should have access to affordable and accessible mental  health services. However, this was not the case until 2010, with the  passage of the Affordable Care Act, which moved mental healthcare from  a nice-to-have to essential care--what it always should have been  considered.   Defining mental healthcare as essential healthcare was a major step  forward. But as I noted before, stigma still prevents too many from  seeking and assessing the care they need. That is why I am proud of the  efforts undertaken by the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust  and the Congressional Caucus of Black Women and Girls, which I chair  and co-chair, respectively, to destigmatize seeking mental healthcare.   Last year, we were joined by the first lady of New York City,  Chirlane Irene McCray, for a briefing on how we can destigmatize mental  healthcare and better share our personal experiences to help and  empower others. The video of that conversation is still on my Facebook  page, and it warms my heart to see women sharing their stories on the  thread months after the Facebook Live ended.   We need more events like this. We need more conversations where we  put it all on the table and accept the simple fact that, yes, it is  hard sometimes, but there are people and organizations who can help.   In addition to reducing stigma, which is something every Member of  this House can do in their own districts and communities, we need to  continue working to connect the most vulnerable with care, in  particular, those who are regularly impacted by gun violence. In parts  of Chicagoland, our young people have levels of PTSD on par with  veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.   While we absolutely must address easy access to guns--as a reminder,  H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, has been sitting on  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's desk for more than 200 days-- we cannot forget that communities have been experiencing this violence  for decades because of congressional inaction.   We talk about PTSD as post-traumatic. Many in my communities have  present-traumatic; it is not ``post.'' It goes on day after day after  day.   To break the cycle of violence, these communities need programs that  empower our young people and create hope. I always say nothing stops a  bullet like an opportunity.   We need to work together, Republicans and Democrats, House and  Senate, to ensure an end to gun violence and ensure robust programs  that address the long-term psychological impacts created by years of  unchecked violence. This is going to affect us for generations unless  we do something about it.   And, finally, I want to talk about a tragic reality in our Nation.  Suicide rates are rising. Suicide is the leading cause of death for  Generation Z, our Nation's young people. I believe our host,  Congresswoman Plaskett, talked about the effects on African American  young people. Our Nation's veterans are still struggling to access the  care they need and deserve.   In Chicagoland, we, tragically, experienced a marked rise in first  responder suicides. Likewise, we are seeing rising rates in rural  America, especially among our farmers because of severe weather, low  commodity prices, and the failed Trump trade war.   It is past time to make suicide prevention a priority. We are losing  too many fathers, sisters, sons, and neighbors to this epidemic. We are  losing too many African American fathers, sisters, sons, and neighbors  to this epidemic.   In conclusion, I want to challenge my colleagues to take up the  mantle of mental health. In 2010, this House declared mental health  essential, just like care for our heart, kidneys, and lungs. We now  recognize that our minds and mental well-being are a key part of our  overall health and should be covered as such.   However, that declaration was nearly a decade ago. We know it is  important, so we need to get to work on it now.   Let's pass Congresswoman Grace Napolitano's bipartisan Mental Health  Services for Students Act and help put more counselors and mental  health professionals back in our schools to serve our students.   Let's pass Congressman Cleaver's bipartisan Cady Housh and Gemesha  Thomas Student Suicide Prevention Act to address the shocking and  growing rate of suicide among our Nation's students and young people.   And let's pass Congresswoman Plaskett's bipartisan Territories Health  Equity Act to ensure that Americans living in territories have the same  access to quality mental healthcare as Americans living in the  continental United States.   In summary, Mr. Speaker, 2010 marked a significant and bold step  forward. We need to be bold today.  [[Page H8951]]         Well, in some communities there is a lack of  both physical and mental healthcare, but I think we still have to deal  with the stigma that people don't see mental health as a part of  healthcare.   I know, in the Chicagoland area, right when I became a Congresswoman,  actually, there were six mental health facilities shut down, so if  someone wanted help, they may have to take two buses, a taxi, on and on  and on. There is such a barrier of not only a facility not being there,  but also the ones that are around, it is so hard for people to get to  them.   And some of the neighborhoods, like I said, people don't even want to  come outside because of the violence and some of the particular--not  all over, but in some of the neighborhoods.   People are traumatized by the block they live on. They don't want to  send their kids to play in the park. They don't want to go to the  store. To deal with this every day, to hear gunshots every day, to have  to deal with violence every day, that affects you on that day, but it  affects you years later, also.    I think mental health gets put on the back  burner, that people will talk about, ``Oh, my arm hurts,'' or this  hurts, or that hurts, but they don't want to say, ``I am depressed,''  or ``I am down,'' or ``I need counseling.''   I sometimes think in our community--maybe in others, but we know in  our community, ``You need to man up,'' or be strong, or give it to God  even. You know, God will take care of this, that, and the other, so  have faith, and those kinds of things.   I think that God also put doctors and counselors on this Earth--and  therapists--for us to use them and use their services. I think not  enough of us do that, or we don't feel comfortable. If no one else in  the family ever talks about it, then you don't grow up even thinking  that is a possibility.    Definitely.    Congresswoman, you hit the nail on the head.  That is so true.   There have been so many studies that show you do better when the  person who is helping you looks like you or is sensitive to your  realities, your community, what you are really about. That is so true.   Also, that is the other thing. With the Congressional Black Caucus  Health Braintrust, the other thing that we really push to do is to  diversify the healthcare pipeline because that is the only way that is  going to change, too.   The other thing is letting our young people know that that is a good  thing, to be a counselor or a social worker or a psychiatrist or a  psychologist, that we should be looking into those fields also.   You hit the nail on the head. It is hard enough for people to go to  counseling or to admit they are depressed, so when they do seek out  care, it has to be someone who can be empathetic and sensitive to their  needs. Because if they are not, then the person definitely is not going  to go back, and then, we are back to square one.    Right. That would be devastating for our  community for that to happen. When I think about my district, which is  urban, suburban, and rural--    Yes, I do. I have 1,200 farms. The other thing  is, I have people in those areas who don't have cars. There are not  buses and things like that, so again, they don't have the  transportation or the means even to get out to go to, let's say, a  bigger town in my district to go seek mental health help.   We have to do more to have more professionals. This is not the time  to cut back. When you think about just the stresses of living today, we  need to have resources available for our students and even our  veterans, our farmers, people who we named that are suffering from  various things that are going on right now.    Right. I think it is hard enough for us to go,  and then, if we go and don't feel comfortable or feel like we are  getting the respect or getting the care, the likelihood of us returning  is not there.   I mean, you would think that with anybody, of course, that you want  to be treated with a good bedside manner, with respect. You want to  feel that the person is listening to you, not blowing you off.   Even when it comes to physical healthcare, the idea that we can take  more or we don't need this or don't need that, that has been found to  be true in how we have been treated.   The same thing in mental health. We don't want that either. We don't  want to be looked at as the angry Black man or the angry Black woman as  we are expressing ourselves.    That is why we have the issue that you know I  am very passionate about: maternal mortality and morbidity.   Interestingly enough, yes, some happen before the full term, but some  happen when the mom has the baby, and it also happens after the mom has  the baby. There could be incidents more than 2 months after the mom has  the baby. There is postpartum depression.   But if we are not taken seriously, then one thing can lead to  another.    Right.    Economic, educational, you could be in the  best physical health. Black women die at three to four times the rate  of White women. But depending on which State you go to, the rates are  higher.   In my State of Illinois, it is six to one times. I just met with  someone out there, and they said it looks like it might be even a  little higher. In New York, it is eight to one times. In the State of  Washington, it is not Black women but Native women at eight to one  times the rate of White women. Yes, it cuts across every socioeconomic  characteristic that you can find.    I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.  Anything I can do to help, of course, I am always here.
