 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation that H.R. 4951,  the VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act, legislation I  introduced and was approved by the House last year, has now been  approved by the Senate and is being sent to the President's desk to be  signed into law.   Throughout my career, I have been privileged to have close working  relationships with veterans and veteran service organizations  throughout northwest Indiana. These established relationships are what  motivated me to secure a position to the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee.   As chairman of the Technology Modernization Subcommittee, I have seen  the great need for Congress to conduct oversight and have accurate  information to ensure that the electronic health record modernization  program is able to meet the needs of our veterans.   I thank the leaders of the Senate for also seeing the value of this  legislation. And as we move forward, I look forward to obtaining the  requested information and continuing our work to ensure that all  veterans receive the world-class healthcare they deserve.                            ____________________
