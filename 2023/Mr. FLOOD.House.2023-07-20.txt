 Madam Speaker, I rise today because we are at a crossroads  in banking, FinTech, and finance.  [[Page H3879]]    Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that is going to change the  way Americans do business. The question today in front of us is whether  we would like America to lead that change or let somebody else take the  reins.   We are planning on marking up two bills next week in the Financial  Services Committee: one on digital assets market structure and the  other on stablecoins. I am going to focus my remarks today on  stablecoins.   I am not new to this subject. In the Nebraska legislature, I wrote  and passed a bill that allows for banks in Nebraska to issue  stablecoins--State chartered banks. This is an issue that I have worked  on and cared about for years.   Since 2017, stablecoins have grown to $130 billion in market cap.  That is the size of a multinational institution like Deutsche Bank.   We are not dealing with a theoretical conversation about stablecoins  here. Stablecoins have already arrived. Whether you like them or not is  irrelevant, Madam Speaker. They are here, and the question of the day  is how to regulate them, not whether to regulate them at all.   Now that we have covered the basic need for this legislation, let's  discuss a specific issue in the bill: how to treat State-regulated  institutions that want to issue a stablecoin.   Our dual banking system is the envy of the world. It allows us to  provide true regulatory tailoring, particularly for small community  banks, in our country. Were we to move away from the dual banking  system, were we to essentially gut the power and authority of the State  banking regulators, like the Nebraska Department of Banking, it would  be an absolute tragedy for our community banks.   I do not think there is a banker around that wouldn't stand up for  the dual banking system. If you are a small bank in rural Nebraska,  Madam Speaker, you shouldn't receive the same scrutiny as a GSIB, and  if you are a small bank in rural Nebraska, you probably shouldn't share  the same primary regulator as a GSIB either.   The dual banking system lowers burdens on banks, but it also ensures  that our small institutions have a line of communication to the entity  that regulates them. If every bank had to be regulated by the OCC, I  don't know that the OCC would have the bandwidth to ensure every  single, small bank in rural America gets the attention it needs  relative to larger institutions. That is not a knock on the OCC, it is  just reality.   Now that brings us back to stablecoins. Chairman McHenry's bill  currently has a State pathway for stablecoin issuance. Shockingly, some  of the same banking organizations that hail the dual banking system  seem to have a different opinion when it comes to stablecoins.   Let me be very clear, if the Federal Reserve becomes the de facto  regulator for all State regulated stablecoin issuers, it will prevent  small and midsized banks across the United States from getting into the  stablecoin market. It would fly in the face of regulatory tailoring,  the very concept that has promoted our current system that allows for  community banks to literally exist.   Our State regulators are more than capable of taking on this role.  Those who argue for regulatory arbitrage miss the point; we already  have a system in place that does this work. There is no reason for a  State chartered bank in Nebraska that issues stablecoins to be  regulated directly by the Federal Reserve when the Nebraska Department  of Banking is equipped to do the job.   Further, the bill establishes a robust floor for stablecoin issuance.  The most important part of that floor is the reserves. Under the bill-- and listen to this, Madam Speaker--under the bill, issuers must back a  stablecoin with reserves one to one.   Let's think about that for a moment. If a consumer has one stablecoin  at $1, the issuer must hold exactly $1 in reserve on that same  stablecoin.   In other words, Madam Speaker, your money isn't going anywhere. The  issuer cannot lend out your money, and they cannot invest it in risky  assets for their own gain. They must hold it in reserve as ordered by  this bill that is in front of the Financial Services Committee.   That requirement alone should go a long way to ease any anxieties  over instability. The system itself has reserve requirements that  aren't present in other parts of the financial market.   We are truly at a historic moment in the House. It is not often that  we get the opportunity to build a new regulatory system from scratch.  Regulating stablecoins is just that kind of opportunity.   It is imperative that we get it right so both the State charters and  the Federal charters can issue stablecoins.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
