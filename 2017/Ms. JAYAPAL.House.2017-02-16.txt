 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  resolution. For many people, particularly women, title X funding  literally means the difference between receiving reproductive health  care or being forced to go without birth control, critical cancer  screenings, and other preventive care.   For the 4 in 10 women who access health care at title X-funded  providers, cutting this funding would mean cutting their access to  health care altogether. For people of color, rural communities, and  those who struggle to make ends meet, cutting title X funds will  certainly have a disproportionate impact.   Let's be very clear that these funds are not controversial, but the  Republican majority in Congress and anti-choice groups are doing their  best to create a false narrative in order to demonize this funding,  which has done nothing but improve the lives of millions of people.  Cutting this funding would actually increase the number of unwanted  pregnancies by nearly 1 million in just a year alone and would increase  abortions by 33 percent.   Women need title X so they can continue to make decisions with their  doctors. It is 2017, and a woman's uterus is not a political football.
