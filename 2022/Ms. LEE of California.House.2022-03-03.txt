 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  retirement of Ms. Regina Jackson, a phenomenal leader and constituent  and a very good friend, after over 27 years of service as president and  CEO of the East Oakland Youth Development Center.   Ms. Jackson's involvement with EOYDC began in 1984 when, as a  graduate of the Coro Fellowship graduate program in public affairs, she  was invited to serve on the board of directors. Ms. Jackson has made it  her mission to invest in our children and has dedicated herself to this  work.   A key part of her mission at EOYDC has been inspiring our youth to  perform at high levels by providing a safe, nurturing environment where  young people could grow and thrive.   In addition, her contributions to our community are magnificent. She  is a global thought leader for youth development. The International  Diplomacy Council has sought her expertise to counsel agencies across  the world. Recently, with the support of my office and local East Bay  organizations, Ms. Jackson led two delegations of students to China for  a cross-cultural exchange.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the 13th Congressional District of  California, I commend Ms. Jackson for her tireless service and  dedication and wish her well in this new chapter of her life.                            ____________________
