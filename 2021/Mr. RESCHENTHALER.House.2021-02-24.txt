 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from my home State of  Pennsylvania for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us provides for the consideration of two  pieces of legislation. Let's just look at both pieces one at a time.   The first bill, H.R. 5, the Equality Act, provides for civil rights  protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer  individuals.   Let me start by saying that Republicans believe all people should be  treated equally under the law. Let me repeat that. Republicans believe  all people should be treated equally under the law. But the Equality  Act misses that mark.   Rather, H.R. 5 represents a radical departure from existing civil  rights protections that will have significant implications on everyday  life, and eliminate laws ensuring women and girls have the same  opportunities as men and boys.   Just take student athletics. H.R. 5 would redefine sex to include  gender identity, meaning a transgender woman, a person who was born  genetically male but identifies as a woman, could not be barred from  participating in girls' or women's athletics.   Further, I have concerns that, due to the lack of committee action,  this bill has not been fully thought out and it may be difficult,  frankly, if not impossible, to actually implement in line with  congressional intent.   Perhaps the most pressing example of this is the term ``gender  identity,'' which is so vague that even the special interest groups  backing this bill cannot agree on a single definition of that.   Lastly, I am troubled that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is  not applicable under this measure. Without this vital protection,  churches, synagogues, mosques, and religiously affiliated schools will  be forced to act contrary to their deeply held beliefs or stop offering  certain services to the public.   Religious freedom was once an issue that all Americans, regardless of  political party, strongly supported. It is incredibly disappointing to  see my colleagues across the aisle abandon this principle in an effort  to appease their far-left radical progressive base.   Mr. Speaker, the second part of this rule provides for consideration  of H.R. 803, the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act.  This legislation consists of 8 natural resources bills, and will create  nearly 1.5 million acres of wilderness, establish the most restrictive  Federal land use classification, as well as lock up rivers and other  lands across four western States.   Like all my Republican colleagues, I strongly support responsible  preservation of our Nation's natural resources. Remember, it was  Republican Teddy Roosevelt who started this movement.   However, my colleagues across the aisle have ignored this and have  gone way too far. This bill takes a partisan approach to public land  protection, and not a single Republican has cosponsored the underlying  measures.   Further, some of the lands affected by this legislation lie in  congressional districts where Members of Congress do not support such  actions. These Members have not had the opportunity to share their  opposition or their concerns, as bills in H.R. 803 were not marked up  by this Congress.  [[Page H605]]    H.R. 803 also ignores input from local communities, who voiced  concern that these measures will hurt local economies and rural jobs.  As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the last thing that we should  be doing is eliminating good-paying, family-sustaining jobs.   Further, this bill will actually increase catastrophic wildfires, as  the new wilderness and scenic river designations prohibit scientific  forest management.   I am especially concerned that this measure withdraws 1.2 million  acres from mineral production, including uranium, a necessary component  for the U.S. nuclear reactor fleet.   Currently, our Nation is relying on China for the vast majority of  rare earth elements and critical materials, which are necessary for  everything from building a fighter jet to a cell phone.   Just last week, we saw China threaten to cut off its mineral supply  to American defense contractors. We have watched as China has done this  to sister democracies such as Japan.   This bill will give the Chinese Communist Party, and other unstable  and hostile regimes, control over our energy and mineral needs, putting  our economic and national security at risk.   We must not cut off access to the minerals and materials necessary  for everyday life and for the protection of our Nation.    I would urge my colleagues across the aisle to seek a bipartisan  approach to these two bills, to this rule, not just today, but also in  the weeks and months ahead.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to  the gentlewoman from Georgia just to close.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from the great State of Texas (Mr. Pfluger).                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 682, the Reopen  Schools Act.   I will do this to ensure that the $54.3 billion that Congress  appropriated just last month to help schools reopen is, in fact,  prioritized to meet the expenses of actually being able to open up  schools for in-person learning.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the  text of my amendment, along with any extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Iowa (Mrs. Hinson), who will explain the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), the good doctor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I have no further speakers and at this time, and I am prepared  to close.    Mr. Speaker, Republicans believe everyone should be treated equally  under the law. But H.R. 5 is a radical approach that will have serious,  unintended consequences for female athletes, victims of sexual  violence, houses of worship, and healthcare professionals. The list  goes on and on. Critically, the bill undermines important religious  freedom protections.   As for H.R. 803, let's call this what it is. It is a land grab. This  is a land grab, which will kill jobs in rural communities. It will  leave us vulnerable to hostile nations for our energy and mineral  needs. It will restrict access and recreation opportunities for the  American public.   For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question and ``no'' on the underlying measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
