 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  H.R. 1435.   H.R. 1435 would have disastrous consequences, not only on  California's ability to regulate dangerous air pollution from its own  transportation sector, but for all of the other States who have adopted  its standards, including my home State of New York.   My colleagues, climate change is accelerating in real-time, and we  are experiencing the impact to our own detriment.   The transportation sector accounts for nearly one-third of the  Nation's greenhouse gas contributions. Heavy-duty transportation makes  up a significant piece of this polluting sector. Heavy-duty vehicles  make up approximately 6 percent of vehicles on the road but generate 59  percent of the nitrogen oxides and other dangerous pollutants that  contribute to ozone and particulate matter.   An estimated 72 million people live near truck freight routes across  the United States. These communities, whose residents are more likely  to be people of color and vulnerable populations, have lower incomes  and experience higher rates of adverse health effects.   This bill would harm and potentially reverse decades of progress on  cleaning up our heavy-duty transportation sector.   Republicans are putting polluters over people by attempting to block  States' ability to regulate air pollution from heavy-duty trucks, in  direct contradiction to the Clean Air Act.   While my Republican colleagues continue to try to block commonsense  air pollution control efforts, I, along with my fellow House Democrats,  will continue to fight for cleaner air and a clean energy future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1435.
