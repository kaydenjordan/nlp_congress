 Mr. President, while returning with Senate colleagues  from a delegation trip to Europe to further strengthen the trans- Atlantic alliance in the context of Vladimir Putin's war against the  Ukrainian people, our plane was grounded by mechanical failure. As a  result, I was unable to attend vote No. 135 on the motion to invoke  cloture on Executive Calendar No. 808, Lael Brainard, of the District  of Columbia, to be Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System.   I would have voted yea on the motion to invoke cloture had I been  able to attend the vote.
