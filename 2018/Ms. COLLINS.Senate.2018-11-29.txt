 Mr. President, each year, the 1.4 million members of the  National Association of Realtors recognize five of their own with the  Good Neighbor Award for their service to others, locally or globally. I  am delighted to congratulate 2018 Good Neighbor Elias Thomas of  Shapleigh, ME, for inspiring contributions from his hometown to some of  the poorest villages in India.   Mr. Thomas, broker-owner of EXIT Key Real Estate in Shapleigh, has  spent 40 years volunteering with Rotary International. His  compassionate work started with his local chapter, where he helped to  build meditation gardens for those with mental illness and developed  job and housing assistance programs for newly released prison inmates.  His international efforts began in the late 1990s, when he travelled to  Cozumel, Mexico, for a project to prevent the island's garbage dump  from polluting the water system.   In 2001, Mr. Thomas journeyed to India to assist in Rotary's  signature project of preventing and eradicating polio. The deplorable  living conditions and the gratitude of villagers for the Rotarians'  assistance convinced him that India was where his energy and commitment  were most needed.   Mr. Thomas has returned to India every year since then, leading teams  of volunteers and personally immunizing about 500 children against  polio. He has raised $40,000 to help pay for the corrective surgeries  of some 1,000 victims of the disease. Throughout his four decades as a  Rotarian, Mr. Thomas has raised more than $350,000 for Rotary  International's charitable endeavors.   During a 2008 trip to India, he became aware of another dire  situation there: the lack of safe drinking water in desert communities  in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, which can lead to illness  and death due to dysentery.   Mr. Thomas assembled a team of 78 volunteers from eight countries and  worked with village councils on a plan to build dams to capture the  runoff from monsoons for drinking water and crop irrigation. Every year  for the last 10 years, Mr. Thomas has led a total of 350 volunteers  from around the world, and working with local residents and without  mechanized equipment, they have hand-built nine dams that provide clean  and safe water to more than 45,000 people.   A fellow Rotarian who has been part of that team describes Mr. Thomas  this way: ``Elias has deep faith that we can bring about change. He's a  man that has dreams, and while most people talk about what they wish  they could do to help others, he does it. To Elias, everyone in  humanity is critically important.''   Elias Thomas exemplifies the motto of Rotary International, ``Service  Above Self.'' His caring spirit and boundless energy are improving and  even saving lives here at home and around the world.                            ____________________
