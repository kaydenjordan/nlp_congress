 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  21st Century Flood Reform Act.   I think what Chairman Jeb Hensarling was able to do here, and  Chairman Duffy, is put forward a bill that has really brought together  the Montagues and the Capulets, I mean, when you think about the fact  that, on one hand, you have got the environmental community supporting  this and you have got taxpayers' advocates; you have got conservative  think tanks and you have got affordable housing groups; you have the  reinsurers and you have the insurers.   We talked about two priorities that at least I was pushing to  reauthorize in the National Flood Insurance Program. One of those was  to provide better disclosure to consumers about flood risk. We wanted  them to know. And the second was to decrease the number of repeatedly  flooded properties. This bill accomplishes both of those things.    Section 108 of the bill includes language that I authored, which will  provide information to home buyers about past flood events, about the  damage, about insurance claims, about any obligation they might have to  carry flood insurance; and the National Association of Realtors  supports this commonsense approach.   Section 402 of the bill includes the bipartisan Repeatedly Flooded  Communities Preparation Act, sponsored by Representative Earl  Blumenauer and me. This means that repeatedly flooded properties, which  comprise less than 2 percent of NFIP policies but account for one-third  of all claims, are dealt with.   Responsible, community-driven mitigation is a win-win proposal, one  which will help our neighborhoods become stronger in the face of floods  and address the fiscal footing of the overall program by decreasing the  cost as this is addressed to community level.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would particularly like to thank the Pew  Charitable Trusts, their flood-prepared communities initiative, for  their support of our reform efforts.
