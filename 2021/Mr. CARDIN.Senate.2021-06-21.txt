 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this Saturday was Juneteenth, the first  official Juneteenth recognized by the Federal Government as a national  holiday--the official end of slavery in America. I commemorated and  celebrated Juneteenth with my colleague Senator Van Hollen at a meeting  of the NAACP chapter in Randallstown, MD, and we reflected on the  progress that we have made since the end of slavery and the challenges  that still remain.   It has been a long path toward justice and equality in this country,  and I think we all recognize the wisdom of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  with his famous quote that ``the arc of the moral universe is long, but  it bends toward justice.''   I think we all believe that, but in recent actions taken by State  governments to restrict voting rights, we see some very disturbing  trends that would take issue with Dr. King's statement that the moral  universe is bending toward justice. It seems like it has taken a  detour.   Voting rights is a fundamental issue of importance to a democratic  country.   After elections are over and we win, we celebrate. We celebrate the  fact that we have gotten the support of the majority of the voters, and  that is what democracy is all about. If we don't win--and I think many  of us have been involved in campaigns where our candidates have not  been successful--we go to work to try to attract more voters in the  next election so we can celebrate a victory. That is what participation  in a free society is all about. That is what democracies are about.   In repressive autocratic regimes, they will never accept the will of  the people. So they look at ways in which they can undermine the voter  record--what the voters want to do, the voters' will. In the 2020  election, we should all celebrate the record number of people who cast  their ballots. It was a record--the most ever casting their votes for  the Presidency of the United States. There were repeated reviews done  by both Democrats and Republicans at the national level and at the  State level and at the local level. It verified the simple fact that  there was no widespread corruption, that the will of the people  prevailed, and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were elected President and  Vice President of the United States.   But that did not stop former President Trump in promoting the Big  Lie. As a result of that, several States have now taken action to make  it harder for people to cast their votes. The Brennan Center has  pointed out that we have seen the worst assault on voting rights since  Jim Crow. Fourteen States have enacted 22 new laws to make it more  difficult--more difficult--for people to vote. This is unprecedented in  modern times.   So what have those laws done? Made it more difficult for voters to  vote by mail, recognizing that for many voters, they prefer to vote by  mail. We have States that have 100 percent voting by mail. There has  been no indication of fraud in voting by mail.   States have shortened the time for requesting mail-in ballots for  voting, making it more difficult for individuals to be able to vote by  mail, requiring certain requirements to vote by mail, making it more  difficult to deliver their mail-in ballots, limiting the availability  of mail ballot drop boxes. All of that had been included. Why? Because  it makes it more difficult for people who are likely to vote for my  opponent to vote. That is what the State legislatures are doing-- stricter signature requirements, making in-person voting more  difficult, and purging voter rolls simply because a person did not  vote--again, making it more difficult for people to vote. And it goes  on and on and on in the type of legislation that has already passed or  is currently being considered by many State legislatures around the  country, making it more difficult to register to vote, making it more  difficult to vote, targeting potential voters more likely to vote for  their opponents, targeting minorities, young voters, and older minority  voters.   Let me give just one example. Using Georgia as a specific example,  their recently enacted changes will disproportionately hurt Black  voters. The Georgia State law imposes voter identification requirements  on absentee ballots, makes it hard to request an absentee ballot, and  makes it a crime for groups to provide food and water to voters waiting  in line.   Georgia is basically restricting mail voting in response to a shift  in the racial demographics of the voters who use it. On the other hand,  Georgia wants to keep mail voting available for older, White mail  voters.   Voter suppression is always unacceptable, and the razor-thin  political margins in Georgia may mean that suppression efforts like  these will change political outcomes. Rather than imposing barriers to  casting the sacred right to vote, Georgia should be looking at ways to  improve voter access.  [[Page S4648]]    As the New York Times pointed out, the Georgia law comes on the heels  of a major upset for Republicans in the traditionally red State, after  voters picked Joe Biden in the Presidential election and elected  Democrats to both of the State's U.S. Senate seats. The paper noted  that the new Georgia law ``will, in particular, curtail ballot access  for voters in booming urban and suburban counties, home to many  Democrats.'' President Biden was right to call this legislation the  ``Jim Crow in the 21st century.''   There are many other examples. Georgia is not unique in the efforts  we are seeing to suppress voter participation at elections.   Look, it is fair game to try to persuade voters to vote for your  candidate. It is not fair game to suppress their right to vote.   So what is the vote this week all about, the vote we are going to  have on bringing forward the opportunity to debate voter suppression  legislation to protect the right to vote? It is simply a motion to  proceed with a debate on the Senate floor. Let me repeat that. We are  not voting on S. 1, the passage of it. We are not voting on any  specific proposal. I know my friend from West Virginia has offered a  proposal. We are not voting on that. We are voting on the right for the  Senate to take up this critically important issue or whether it should  be filibustered so we can't bring up a voter issue to protect the  integrity of the right to vote.   Now, I support S. 1. I am a cosponsor of S. 1, For the People. I am  proud to support the provisions of that bill. To me, it is carefully  drafted legislation to deal with the modern threats to voter  participation. I am extremely proud that my colleague from Maryland,  Congressman   John Sarbanes, is the principal sponsor of H.R. 1 in the  House that already passed the House.   It provides a basic Federal floor on protection of the right to  vote--on voter registration, on vote-by-mail, no-excuse balloting, 2  weeks of early voting, including weekends, no notary requirement for  absentee ballots, drop-off boxes. That is a simple voter protection  against the actions being taken by State legislatures that are aimed at  certain demographic groups, a Federal floor.   It ends political gerrymandering. I don't know how any of my  colleagues can defend the way legislative and congressional lines are  drawn today. I came from the State legislature. I am a former speaker  of the house. I was responsible for one of the redistricting plans of  Maryland when I was speaker of the house. It is just a horrible,  partisan, political process we use today to draw congressional lines.   I have been accused by my congressional colleagues in the House from  Maryland that I ran for the Senate to avoid having to deal with  congressional redistricting. There may be some truth to that, but I can  tell you this: It is time to end political gerrymandering.  Congressional districts should represent the communities' interests,  not an individual Congressman's interest. S. 1 takes a major step  forward in ending political congressional redistricting by  gerrymandering.   It provides a commitment by Congress to advance a preclearance  formula that was in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that now is not  operative because of the Shelby County decision. It puts us on a path  to once again have that important tool available in order to deal with  the freedom and right to vote.   It promotes voter security, S. 1, by eliminating the paper ballot--by  requiring the paper ballot, I should say, not eliminating it, by  requiring a paper trail. I think we all agree that we want to be able  to verify votes. The only way you can is if there is a paper trail, and  it provides for that paper trail.   It puts an end to the dominance of big money in the political system.  They do that in a couple of ways: one, disclosure--how can anyone be  against the disclosure of who is putting money into our political  system?--and secondly, providing a way in which we can get rid of the  dependence upon large special interest dollars.   It includes, S. 1, two provisions that I authored. One is a deceptive  practices act that deals with false or misleading advertisements which  are aimed at targeting minority communities to confuse and mislead  their votes.   It includes the Democracy Restoration Act, which I authored, which  deals with laws passed after the end of slavery in an effort to prevent  African Americans from voting, for, you see, there are States that  passed laws back then that are still on the books that disqualify for a  lifetime a person convicted of a felony.   The definition of ``felony'' is pretty general in many States, so we  have States where one out of five African Americans has been  disqualified from voting because of their conviction of a felony. Even  though they are fully part of our society today, they don't have the  right to vote. We need to remove that disqualification on voting.   My friend, our former colleague, John Lewis--the two of us were  elected to the U.S. House of Representatives on the same day. In an  editorial published after his death, our former colleague John Lewis  recalled an important lesson taught by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and  I quote our former colleague:         He said each of us has a moral obligation to stand up,       speak up and speak out. When you see something that is not       right, you must say something. You must do something.       Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation       must do its part.    Well, we cannot take action if we don't start, and we can't start  unless my colleagues allow us to proceed to this issue on the floor of  the U.S. Senate.   There is a reason why there are so many groups behind us taking  action. I have a Facebook Live that I do every 2 weeks with my  constituents. Jana Morgan from the Declaration for American Democracy,  which represents over 180 groups, from labor to racial justice groups,  faith groups, women's rights groups, environmental and good-governance  groups--all telling us that we need to move forward to protect our  democracy, that the Senate needs to act on this issue.   One of my guests, Virginia Kase Solomon from the League of Women  Voters--now, the League of Women Voters--you can say a lot of things  about them, but you can't accuse them of being partisan because they  are not. It is one of our premier nonpartisan institutions in America  with a proud history. They are telling us to take this bill up and act  for the sake of protecting our democracy.   We then have a chance to act, to take up amendments and vote on  amendments and vote on concerns, whether they are offered by a  Republican Senator or a Democratic Senator. That is what the motion to  proceed allows us to do, to take up these issues so we can vote on  them. But if you vote to filibuster the motion to proceed, we can't  even bring the issue up on the Senate floor for action.   I urge my colleagues not to filibuster the right of the U.S. Senate  to start the debate on protecting voter integrity, where each Member  will have an opportunity to debate the issue, and collectively we can  come together, as many of my colleagues have offered suggestions about  how we can improve S. 1, how we can make it a broader consensus, but we  can't do that unless we have the right to proceed to a debate.   I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion on the motion to  proceed so the Senate can take up this most critically important issue  to the preservation of our democracy and the integrity of the right to  vote   With that, I yield the floor.
