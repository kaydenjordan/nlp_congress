 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 588) to direct the Federal Communications  Commission to conduct a study on network resiliency during times of  emergency, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 588         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Access to Networks       in Disasters Act''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON NETWORK RESILIENCY.         Not later than 36 months after the date of enactment of       this Act, the Commission shall submit to Congress, and make       publically available on the Commission's website, a study on       the public safety benefits and technical feasibility and cost       of--        (1) making telecommunications service provider-owned WiFi       access points, and other communications technologies       operating on unlicensed spectrum, available to the general       public for access to 9-1-1 services, without requiring any       login credentials, during times of emergency when mobile       service is unavailable;        (2) the provision by non-telecommunications service       provider-owned WiFi access points of public access to 9-1-1       services during times of emergency when mobile service is       unavailable; and        (3) other alternative means of providing the public with       access to 9-1-1 services during times of emergency when       mobile service is unavailable.       SEC. 3. ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS DURING                     FEDERALLY DECLARED EMERGENCIES.         Section 427(a)(1)(A) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster       Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.       5189e(a)(1)(A)) is amended by striking ``telecommunications       service'' and inserting ``wireline or mobile telephone       service, Internet access service, radio or television       broadcasting, cable service, or direct broadcast satellite       service''.       SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.         As used in this Act--        (1) the term ``Commission'' means the Federal       Communications Commission;        (2) the term ``mobile service'' means commercial mobile       service (as defined in section 332 of the Communications Act       of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332)) or commercial mobile data service       (as defined in section 6001 of the Middle Class Tax Relief       and Job Creation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. 1401));        (3) the term ``WiFi access point'' means wireless Internet       access using the standard designated as 802.11 or any variant       thereof; and        (4) the term ``times of emergency'' means either an       emergency as defined in section 102 of the Robert T.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 588.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 588 includes a provision to facilitate the repair  of communications infrastructure in the wake of a disaster.   We know how critical communications can be following a disaster for  first responders and everyone that is impacted. I commend the bill's  sponsor for pursuing this legislation, and I thank the Energy and  Commerce Committee for working with the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee on this language.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) be permitted to control the remainder of the  time.
