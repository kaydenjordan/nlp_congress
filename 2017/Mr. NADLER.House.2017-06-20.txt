 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1393. This bill  represents a major assault on the sovereignty of the States, and it  does particular damage to my home State of New York, depriving it of  more than $100 million a year of its own tax revenue, which hardly fits  the de minimis description by the gentleman from Virginia.   The Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act would  prohibit States from collecting income tax from an individual unless  the person works more than 30 days in that State in a calendar year.   Simplifying and harmonizing the rules on tax collection across the  country is a worthy goal, and I support efforts by the States and the  Multistate Tax Commission to resolve the issue. New York has been an  active participant in these negotiations and wants to reach a fair  solution. But imposing a solution on States, and one that would cause a  large financial burden on particular States, is clearly not the answer.   The power to tax is a key index of sovereignty; yet this legislation  would prohibit States from taxing activity solely within their own  borders except as prescribed in the bill. I think that is  constitutionally dubious. Although I take a broad view generally of the  Commerce Clause, I doubt it extends to authorizing Federal regulation  of a State's ability to tax a person doing business within that State's  own borders.   This bill is also deeply troubling as a matter of policy. Under this  legislation, if you work in a State of which you are not a resident for  fewer than 30 days, your income will not be subject to tax by that  State. That amounts to 6 weeks of 5-day workweeks. While a de minimis  exception may make some sense, I hardly think that 6 weeks is de  minimis.   Ultimately, the threshold for taxation is for each State to decide  for itself. If I were still a member of the New York Legislature, I  would consider the political and economic merits of taxing out-of-State  business activity, and I would vote based on what I thought was best  for my State. But by what right does Congress step in to tell New York  that it must forego more than $100 million a year based on economic  activity that occurs entirely within its borders?   In some States, the 30-day threshold may not have a great fiscal  impact. But New York State, for example, is home to New York City, the  Nation's center of commerce, which also sits right across the river  from New Jersey and a very short distance from Connecticut. This makes  New York a major destination for out-of-State business travelers and  makes it, by far, the hardest hit State under this bill. According to  the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, losses could be  up to $120 million a year for New York.                                time  1515    This enormous financial loss would come at a time that the President  and the Republican Congress are proposing to shift significant  responsibilities to the States, while simultaneously slashing Federal  assistance. If we further deprive New York of $120 million each year,  and limit its ability to tax activity occurring within its own borders,  vital services like education, law enforcement, and healthcare could  all be on the chopping block.   During consideration of H.R. 1393 in the Judiciary Committee, I  offered two amendments that would have mitigated its impact. The first  would have reduced the bill's 30-day threshold to a far more reasonable  14 days, which is still almost 3 weeks of work without being subject to  taxation. The other would have added highly paid individuals to the  bill's list of exemptions, which would help avoid loopholes that could  allow wealthy people to escape millions of dollars of taxation.   Had my amendments been accepted, the expected impact on New York  would have been reduced by as much as $85 million a year. While still  causing a significant drain on resources, these amendments would have  gone a long way to making the bill fairer, while still achieving its  underlying goals. Unfortunately, these amendments were defeated, and,  therefore, I must oppose the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to quote from a letter from the president of the Federation of  Tax Administrators and commissioner of the Oklahoma Tax Commission  regarding this bill. She writes:         This bill breaches the core of the relationship between the       Federal Government and State governments, a relationship that       is fundamentally important to the voters of Virginia and of       Michigan. It is a clear example of the Federal Government       crossing a line that is seldom breached and, in this       instance, should not be. The attached resolution from the       State tax agencies, all of them, offers in detail to explain       the State's positions against the mobile workforce.                                time  1530    Here are the three most compelling facts:         One, States have in place a combination of laws, rules, and       compliance standards that effectively eliminate an unfair       outcome when it comes to recordkeeping and taxation of wages       earned in a State by a nonresident;        Two, these approaches, which include model legislation       developed by the Multistate Tax Commission, take into account       information that is available to employers and de minimis       activities; and        Three, H.R. 1393 goes beyond what is necessary to ensure       fair outcomes and a reasonable reporting burden, in       particular, because the bill takes away the states' rights to       require proper wage reporting and withholding even when the       employer already has the information to easily do so. It       opens up opportunities for tax avoidance.    In closing, let me note that this legislation would not just harm New  York and not just to a de minimis amount--$100 million to $120 million  is hardly de minimis--but it would also have a similar effect on other  States. That is why this bill is opposed by a broad coalition of labor  and tax organizations, including the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, SEIU, the  International Union of Police Associations, Federation of Tax  Administrators, Multistate Tax Commission, and many others.   Whether or not your State is hurt financially by this bill, however,  all Members should be concerned by legislation that so brazenly strips  from a State one of the fundamental hallmarks of sovereignty: the  ability to tax economic activity that occurs entirely within its own  borders. If we can target New York and other States with this bill,  what is to say we won't come after your State next.   I must also add that this bill is one in a series of bills that we  have seen over the last few years that chip away at the revenue-raising  and taxing ability of the States. Especially as the current majority  and the current President seek to shift more responsibilities to the  States and away from the Federal Government, we should not be depriving  the States of their ability to raise revenues as they see fit within  their own sovereignty.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this misguided bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.
