 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nominations en bloc:  Calendar Nos. 46 through No. 52, No. 82 through No. 107, No. 110  through No. 113, No. 130 through No. 139; that the nominations be  confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order to any of the nominations; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I want to say thank you to my colleagues  from Alabama and Kansas for being out here on the floor today. I regret  that we are here with this conflict and this confrontation, but I think  that it reflects the deep divisions that exist in this country when it  comes to abortion. That is something that I have always said that I  understand deeply; that I respect people's different points of view  when it comes to abortion in the United States. I do.   It has led me to conclude--and I know that not everybody agrees with  this, although the majority of Americans certainly agree with this. The  majority of Coloradans agree with this. It has led me to conclude that  this is a decision that should be made between a woman and her doctor.  That is who should make the decision. It shouldn't be made by the  government.   But at the same time I realize there are differences of opinion. I  hope that people on the other side realize that there are differences  of opinion here too.   But unlike the position that my colleague from Alabama espouses on  the Senate floor, he is not with the majority of Americans on this  issue. That might be a point of pride for him.   But I want to first call attention to the reason we are here tonight,  which is that I just asked for unanimous consent to move forward the  promotions of the flag officers at the Department of Defense. This is  the fourth time that I have been on this floor asking us to do what  Senates have done for 230 years. Never in the history of the United  States of America, literally, never in the history of the United States  of America has there been a Senator who put a blanket hold on every  single flag officer at the Department of Defense. Talk about playing  politics.   By the way, I will correct the record for a third time, if not the  fourth time. My hold had nothing to do with flag officers. Mine had to  do with a political appointee. You can look it up. I will find that  article, and I will put it in the record again.   In contrast to my hold, what the Senator from Alabama is doing and  now the Senator from Kansas and the rest of the people who are  supporting this, including Members of the House of Representatives who  were here tonight, is a blanket hold on 200 military flag officers--a  blanket hold on 200 military flag officers. That has never happened in  the history of the United States.   These are really important command positions. They are really  important. I am not going to go through all of them. The leader of the  Fifth Fleet in Bahrain is on this list. The leader of the Seventh Fleet  in the Pacific is on this list. These are positions that are critical  to checking Iran and to checking China as well.   I was just in Bahrain. We visited with people with the Fifth Fleet,  including people from Colorado who are stationed there. We know how  important the mission is. I assume they know how important the mission  is.   I have heard them say out here--the Senator from Louisiana before-- that it is not the generals who are important; it is the enlisted  people who are important. Both are important. Both are important. You  can't tell me that it is a good idea to have the Fifth Fleet not have  the commander that it is supposed to have, not to mention the fact  [[Page S1592]]  that people who have spent their entire lives--their entire lives-- learning what is needed to get promoted into a position with that kind  of trust, that kind of duty and patriotic responsibility, and when it  comes time for them to fulfill their mission, that some politician on  the floor of the Senate says: No, I am putting a blanket hold on you  and 200 other people because of my politics.   I will come back to that in a second.   Our military representative to NATO is on this list. The future  Director of Intelligence at U.S. Cyber Command is on this list. So it  is not surprising that, while the Senator from Alabama may have his own  particular view about military readiness, other observers of what is  going on here, including veterans of the DOD, are saying it is the  Senator from Alabama who is affecting our readiness.   Just last week, seven former Pentagon Chiefs from Republican and  Democratic administrations--both Republicans and Democrats--sent a  letter saying that the Senator from Alabama's block is ``harming  military readiness and risks damaging U.S. national security.'' That is  not me. That is them.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Letter From Seven Former United States Secretaries of Defense                                                        May 4, 2023.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell: As former       Secretaries of Defense, we strongly urge the Senate to act       expeditiously on the nearly 200 nominees for general and flag       officer who are being blocked from Senate confirmation.        The blanket hold on the promotion or reassignment of these       senior uniformed leaders is harming military readiness and       risks damaging U.S. national security. Because the Senate is       required to confirm every general and flag officer for       promotion or for reassignment, this practice has       traditionally been a pro-forma exercise, except where there       have been specific concerns about individual nominees, which       were then handled separately.        The current hold that has been in place now for several       weeks is preventing key leaders from assuming important,       senior command and staff positions around the world. Some are       unable to take important command positions, such as leading       the 5th Fleet in Bahrain and the 7th Fleet in the Pacific,       which are critical to checking Iranian and Chinese       aggression, respectively. Others include the next military       representative to NATO, a post essential to coordinating       allied efforts in support of Ukraine, as well as the future       Director of Intelligence at U.S. Cyber Command. Leaving these       and many other senior positions in doubt at a time of       enormous geopolitical uncertainty sends the wrong message to       our adversaries and could weaken our deterrence.        Moreover, if this blanket hold is not lifted, nearly 80       three- and four-star commanders who are ending their terms in       the coming months will not be able to be replaced. Worse,       this will impact certain members of the Joint Chiefs of       Staff, including the Chairman of the JCS.        There are also real-world impacts on the families of these       senior officers. Most cannot move and resettle their       families; their children cannot enroll at their next schools       on time; and spouses cannot start new jobs at the next duty       station. We can think of few things as irresponsible and       uncaring as harming the families of those who serve our       nation in uniform.        We appreciate that Senators can have sincere and legitimate       concerns about a Pentagon policy, including as it may relate       to broader domestic or social issues. These lawmakers also       deserve timely and thorough responses to their questions.       However, we believe placing a hold on all uniformed nominees       risks turning military officers into political pawns, holding       them responsible for a policy decision made by their civilian       leaders.        Rather, senators should leverage the numerous means       available to them to challenge and change DOD policy, such as       introducing legislation, conducting oversight hearings, or       amending the annual National Defense Authorization Act.        We, therefore, strongly urge the Senate to ensure the       continued readiness of the U.S. armed forces by lifting the       blanket hold and promptly voting to confirm these uniformed       nominees.            Sincerely,      Hon. William J. Perry,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. William S. Cohen,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. Robert M. Gates,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. Leon E. Panetta,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. Chuck Hagel,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. James N. Mattis,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. Mark T. Esper,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.     Quote:         Leaving these and many other senior positions in doubt at a       time of enormous geopolitical uncertainty sends the wrong       message to our adversaries and could weaken our deterrence.    Today--today--the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Austin, wrote:         The longer that this hold persists, the greater the risk       the U.S. military runs in every theater, in every domain, in       every Service.    He said that this uncertainty ``diminishes our global standing as the  strongest military in the world.''   I don't think it is surprising that he would say that or that it is  political that he would say that. It is stating the obvious when you  can't do something that we have done for 230 years because of politics  that has infected the floor of the Senate.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have Secretary Austin's  letter printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        May 5, 2023.      Hon. Elizabeth Warren,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Warren: Thank you for your letter requesting a       full accounting of the impact on our national security and       the risks to our military readiness resulting from Senator       Tuberville's indefinite hold on the confirmation of our       general and flag officers.        I appreciate and share your deep concern over this hold,       which is unprecedented in its scale and scope. Delays in       confirming our general and flag officers pose a clear risk to       U.S. military readiness, especially at this critical time.        The Department of Defense has 64 three- and four-star       nominations pending for positions due to rotate within the       next 120 days. These include the Chief of Staff of the Army;       the Chief of Naval Operations; the Commandant and Assistant       Commandant of the Marine Corps; the Director of the National       Security Agency and Commander of United States Cyber Command;       and the Commander of United States Northern Command.        Additionally, several one- and two-star nominations are now       on indefinite hold for general officers and flag officers       slated to take command or support critical positions across       the Joint Force. Within the next nine months, approximately       80 three- and four-star rotations are projected across the       Department. Those positions include the Chairman of the Joint       Chiefs of Staff, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, and the       Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. In total, between now       and the end of the year, the Department projects that       approximately 650 general and flag officers will require       Senate confirmation.        This indefinite hold harms America's national security and       hinders the Pentagon's normal operations. The United States       military relies on the deep experience and strategic       expertise of our senior military leaders. The longer that       this hold persists, the greater the risk the U.S. military       runs in every theater, every domain, and every Service.                              Mission Vacancies         The tenure of Service Chiefs is limited by law, and thus,       incumbents must vacate their positions at the appointed time       and may only be extended under extraordinary circumstances.       Collectively, these positions oversee more than 1.2 million       active and reserve component Service members and provide       Service personnel and resources to the commanders of the       unified combatant commands. By law, Service Chiefs preside       over the capabilities, requirements, policies, and plans of       their Services and serve as the principal military advisors       to the Secretaries of the Military Departments. Put simply,       our Service Chiefs train and equip the Joint Force. Without       these leaders in place, the U.S. military will incur an       unnecessary and unprecedented degree of risk at a moment when       our adversaries may seek to test our resolve.        The hold causes especially acute, self-inflicted problems       in new domains of potential conflict. The Director of the       National Security Agency and Commander of United States Cyber       Command, is responsible for supporting every combatant       commander and Service member around the globe--including       troops in hostile or hazardous areas--with actionable signals       intelligence and cybersecurity support. The Director also       ensures  [[Page S1593]]       that military communications and data remain secure and out       of the hands of our adversaries, safeguarding our advanced       command, control, communications, computer intelligence,       surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities against the       People's Republic of China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, ISIS,       and more. Failing to fill this position weakens the       cybersecurity of the United States.        Furthermore, delays in confirming a large number of one-       and two-star general and flag officers jeopardizes our       current and future readiness. The Department relies on these       experienced leaders to execute tactical actions every day and       extend our strategic advantages for the long term. General       and flag officers at this level are responsible for executing       strategy, acquiring new technologies, enhancing tactical       effectiveness, conducting joint training, and strengthening       global alliances. These general and flag officers also       provide direct leadership and mentorship to thousands of       enlisted Service members and junior and field grade officers       across the Department. Their importance cannot be overstated.                           Power Projection Abroad         General and flag officers provide oversight of the       Department's military and civilian staffs, help decide how we       employ our forces, and take care of the Service members,       civilians, and families in their organizations. Delays in       confirmation will soon foist vacancies on the most senior       military positions across each of the Services, imposing new       and unnecessary risks on U.S. warfighters across multiple       theaters of operations.        The hold also makes it harder for the United States to       fulfil its global leadership responsibilities, including to       our treaty allies and our valued partners around the world.       Our smoothly running normal processes and predictable       military transitions have long set helpful expectations among       allies and partners. Now, however, this hold has created       unnecessary uncertainty. That diminishes our global standing       as the strongest military in the world, which is in large       part based on our stable processes and orderly transitions.        General and flag officers have the authority to make       decisions and commit resources, develop key policies, work       with our allies and partners, and confront our rivals and       foes. The full impact of this hold may not be immediately       noticeable because of the resilience built into our military       organizations, but over time, the hold will cause cascading       impacts to our readiness and needlessly hinder our ability to       meet our strategic objectives in the Indo-Pacific, Europe,       the Middle East, and beyond.        The absence of experienced and Senate-confirmed senior       leadership limits our ability to deepen our cooperation with       our allies and partners through multilateral training and       cooperative engagements. Recent exercises, such as Balikatan       2023 with the Armed Forces of the Philippines or joint U.S.-      Israeli naval activity in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, may       become even more difficult if delays in confirmation force       other leaders to take on the responsibilities of officers       held up by the Senate. This hold could force senior leaders       to become dual-hatted, which would force them to juggle       competing priorities and sap their ability to excel.                           Knowledge and Expertise         Our general and flag officers cultivate their expertise and       experience over decades of service. Military units need       leaders, and our Service members deserve to be led by fully       confirmed general and flag officers. The failure to confirm       leaders in key roles transfers strategic risk down the chain       of command and forces our units to operate with less       experienced decision makers in charge. By destabilizing the       senior military promotion and rotation process, we put our       short- and long-term readiness at significant risk.        Failure to fill these positions in a timely manner is       simply irresponsible. We owe it to our Service members to       provide them with the best leadership possible, and the       current hold jeopardizes the continuity and effective       transition of leadership.                         Service Members and Families         This hold disrupts not only our most senior military       leaders but their families as well. Service members and       military families are resilient, but the current hold adds       another layer of stress and unnecessary uncertainty.        The damage here includes not just the disruption to our       most senior officers, but also profound confusion and       disturbance to our rising one- and two-star general and flag       officers and their families. Extended holds increase the time       from selection to promotion, which could further delay       promotion timelines by 12 to 24 months. This impedes not only       the current cadre of officers but those in the groups behind       them as well.        General officer and flag officer end strength is tightly       controlled by statute. Promotion of one cadre of officers is       possible only with the retirement of others. Long-term holds       have a corrosive and cascading effect: they prevent our       rising officers and their families from being able to predict       promotion and rotation windows, which can increase the       pressure to leave the military in favor of greater stability.       The more our normal promotion processes are jolted, the more       we risk the loss of the diverse warfighting and technical       expertise that America needs to confront its 21st-century       security challenges.        The current hold also means delaying or canceling permanent       change of station moves--not only for those now nominated and       on hold but also for numerous officers and their families who       must be extended on station to prevent critical gaps.       Military children will be unable to move to new schools when       the next school year begins, which imposes needless       additional stress on those students and their families.       Military families enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member       Program may endure serious delays or be unable to access the       services and support that they need and deserve when they       transition to their new duty stations. And outstanding       military spouses may not be able to accept or start new jobs       because they cannot predict when they could start. The       families of our general and flag officers serve right       alongside their Service members.        The current hold imposes additional burdens upon our       military families that are both unnecessary and       unconscionable.                             A Perilous Precedent         As such, the Department urges the Senate to resolve the       current situation as swiftly as possible to limit these       serious consequences. Never before has one Senator prevented       the Department of Defense from managing its officer corps in       this manner, and letting this hold continue would set a       perilous precedent for our military, our security, and our       country.        The ripple effects of this unprecedented and unnecessary       hold are increasingly troubling. Ultimately, the breakdown of       the normal flow of leadership across the Department's       carefully cultivated promotion and transition system will       breed uncertainty and confusion across the U.S. military.       This protracted hold means uncertainty for our Service       members and their families and rising disquiet from our       allies and partners, at a moment when our competitors and       adversaries are watching.        As public servants and officials sworn to protect and       defend our Constitution, I hope that we can all acknowledge       the national security risks posed by these needless delays       and come together to safeguard the lethality and readiness of       the most powerful fighting force in human history.        Thank you for your continued strong support for our Service       members and our national security. I again urge swift action       to confirm all U.S. general and flag officers.            Sincerely,                                              Lloyd J. Austin, III.     Today, any American who wants to read this stuff can  actually read all of it and see all of it.   The Senator from Alabama--and he said it again tonight--has said that  he will continue to hold these promotions for ``as long as it takes''-- ``for as long as it takes''--to which, I think, the obvious question  is, As long as it takes to what? What is the political principle for  which he is on the floor, using the unprecedented tactic of holding up  every single flag promotion in the DOD and our U.S. military? What is  it that he is trying to do? What principle is he trying to enshrine?   The rule that he is objecting to and the rule that my colleague from  Kansas is also objecting to is a rule that does three things.   One thing it does is to say, if you are in need of reproductive  healthcare and you are a woman who is in our military, that you can  take paid leave to be able to do that. You don't have to take unpaid  leave to travel to a place if you are stationed in, for example, a  place like Alabama where abortion is illegal--I think only with the  exception for the life of the mother.   There is no exception for rape or incest if you are serving in a  State like Alabama--where a doctor could go to prison for 99 years for  performing an abortion, where they are having debates down there about  whether or not they can use laws that are written for fentanyl and  apply them to the use of chemicals during an abortion. It is a State in  which, by the way, a majority of Alabamians says there should be some  access to abortion.   But if you are somebody who is stationed there through no fault of  your own, you don't get to decide where you are going to be if you sign  up and you get sent to, for example, Alabama. What the Secretary of  Defense said was, OK. We are going to pass a rule that says that if you  have to take leave, you can take paid leave.   We are going to say that if you need to take a minute to think about  whether you want to talk to your superior officer about the condition  that you are in and the procedure that you have to take, then you can  take a little bit longer to do that, to tell your commanding officer.   We are saying, also, that we can pay for your travel just like we do  for other care--to leave your duty station and go someplace else. Those  are the three things.   So when he says ``as long as it takes''--I gather what he means when  [[Page S1594]]  he says ``withdraw the memo''--it is as long as it takes to make sure  that a woman cannot travel from her duty station to someplace else and  have that paid for like other procedures; that a woman has to take  unpaid leave--she can't get paid leave even though she can for other  procedures; and that a woman has to tell her commanding officer the  minute that she learns of this.   Those are the three things. Those are the three things. That is why  he is objecting to every single flag officer's promotion. I don't know  what to do about that because I will bet you--I can't prove it, but in  standing here tonight, I will bet you that 80 percent of the American  people, no matter what their positions are on the underlying issue  here, would agree with those three policies.   By the way, I didn't compare abortion to bunions or abortion to  LASIK. What I said was those other procedures are things to which the  same rules apply. That is what I said. The reason that is important to  this debate and to the discussion that we are having right now is that  my colleague from Alabama is saying that if it doesn't say  ``reproductive services'' or ``reproductive healthcare'' or  ``abortion'' in the statute books, that means that there is no ability  for the Secretary of Defense to write rules to protect the rights of  our enlisted--in this case, enlisted women. That is what he is saying.   What I have pointed out is that there is no place in the statute that  says that you can go get your foot work done or LASIK surgery. That is  not in the statute because this body and the House of Representatives  confers judgment for this on the leaders of the Defense Department.  And, unlike the Senator from Alabama, I actually have a lot of sympathy  for the minefield that they are having to navigate.   By the way, one other thing I just want to point out for the record  so that it is absolutely clear is that nothing in this rule says that  the U.S. Government is paying for an abortion. There is nothing in  this. There is nothing in these three things. So to anybody on that  side who says that is what this is about, that is a debate for another  day. That is not the debate for this.   But why would I say I have sympathy? Why do I have sympathy? I have  sympathy because something has happened in America that I could never  have imagined 30 years ago. I don't remember now when it was 30 years  ago--1997? I can't do the math. I hope the pages can do the math--1993?  I don't even have the date right. It was when I was in law school.  Something has happened that I never would have imagined, and that is  that the Supreme Court of the United States, for the first time in our  history--for the first time since Reconstruction--has ripped away from  the American people a fundamental right, a fundamental freedom. When I  was the pages' age here, I never would have imagined that would have  happened. When I was in law school, I never imagined that would have  happened.    That is because, from our founding until today, in general, this  country's history has always been about expanding freedoms and  expanding rights and making our country more democratic, more fair, and  more free. But, after a 50-year campaign--none of this was accidental.  After a 50-year campaign led by some people on the other side of the  aisle here, they finally got what they wanted, which is Roe v. Wade's  being overturned, and we are having to deal with the consequences of  that as a society, as a country. The Secretary of Defense is having to  deal with that.   When they say there has been a 40-year consensus, that consensus was  ripped violently from the American people by the Supreme Court. It  stripped us of a 50-year consensus when it came to a woman's right to  choose, when it came to that fundamental freedom. Then there were some  people on the other side of the aisle who said: Don't be so hysterical.  This is just returning it to the States. You don't need to worry about  it.   I don't think that was ever a genuine thing to say, but let's look at  the facts here. Eighteen States have banned abortion since this  happened. Nine of those States have no exceptions for rape or incest.  In Texas, they are paying $10,000 bounties if your friend or your  neighbor or the person down the street reports on you and reports that  you are going to pursue something that has been a fundamental right in  the United States of America for 50 years--something that has been a  fundamental right in the State of Colorado, the State that I represent.   My colleague says that I am pro-abortion. That is not why I am out  here. That is not why I am out here. I am sure he didn't mean to say  that. I am out here because I believe that my judgment isn't better  than the judgment of a woman and her doctor and that the government  shouldn't be making the decision. I am proud to live in a State that  was one of the first States--probably, I think, the first State in  America--to enact a woman's right to choose even before Roe v. Wade was  passed, and it was the first State to codify Roe v. Wade after--after-- the Supreme Court overturned that precedent.   Think about what is happening in Florida. It is one of the biggest  States in America. It is one of the largest States. I can't remember.  Is it the third largest State or the fourth largest State? It is huge.  It is huge. They have just banned abortion in Florida at 6 weeks-- banned it at 6 weeks. When I was the age of these pages and when I was  in law school, that would have been unimaginable.   There might be a reason the Governor down there signed that law at 11  o'clock at night. There might be a reason--because 65 percent of  Floridians think it is a terrible idea. They think that this should be  a decision that is made between a woman and her doctor. They don't need  their Governor telling them. They don't need a Senator telling them.  They don't need the Federal Government telling them or weighing in on  this incredibly difficult decision.   And we are here tonight because, as a result of that--I would say-- balancing act, that commonsense approach that the Secretary of Defense  has tried to take here when it comes to the people who are serving in  our military, we now face real harm to our national security.   Part of the challenge is the recruitment challenge that my colleagues  talk about on the Republican side. And I can tell you the studies that  have been done that have asked the question about what the reversal of  Dobbs is going to mean for recruitment in the Department of Defense.  The Presiding Officer won't be surprised to know it is not good. It is  not going to make matters better if you think that you can be assigned  to a State where they have outlawed abortion or they are saying that  doctors can get a 99-year prison sentence or there are no exceptions  for rape or incest or the life of the mother; or you are in Florida,  and now you have a 6-week ban. That may affect the recruiting that goes  on in the U.S. military, not to mention the 700,000 civilians who serve  in the Department of Defense.   Servicemembers don't decide where they are going to serve; DOD  decides. Before Dobbs, our troops at least had some assurance. Today,  they don't have any assurance. That is why we are here.   So any talk of this 40-year consensus ignores completely what has  happened, and what has happened is the Supreme Court overturning Roe v.  Wade.   I just want to say to my colleagues, tonight, that I think it is  important for the American people to understand, it is important for  the next generation of Americans to understand, that this did not  happen by accident. For 50 years, there has been a campaign in America  to strip us of this fundamental right, to strip us of this fundamental  freedom.   When I was in law school, in the early 1990s, it was just after this  new legal doctrine had been invented in America called originalism. I  have said here on the floor that I think whoever came up with that name  should get the Pulitzer Prize for political names. It is genius. It is  genius because the idea is that, somehow, by putting on your  originalist view of the world, you are going to be able to divine what  the Founding Fathers were writing when they wrote the Constitution;  that, if you are a judge, you are restricted to what they refer to as  the plain meaning of the Constitution; and that, if you can't get to  the plain meaning, you should be able to divine their intention as  close to the text as possible, as if it is possible to divine the  original intent of the Founders, because, if you are somebody who  believes that you can do  [[Page S1595]]  that, you are channeling George Washington or Thomas Jefferson or Ben  Franklin or John Adams; that you have a leg up on anybody else who is  trying to interpret what the Constitution says because, if you know  what they were originally saying, if you have that secret decoder ring  to tell you what they were originally saying, then that gives you an  elevated position over anybody else who might disagree with you. In  fact, there isn't really room for disagreement since you have divined  what the Founders believed.   I have no idea where the pages are in their history lessons on the  American Constitution. I hope they do. I am sure they do. But anybody  who has read anything about the Constitution of the United States knows  that almost every word is a product of compromise. Almost every word is  a product of compromise.   There are some things in there where it is not confusing about what  they said. I owe my friend Angus King for this. I ask unanimous consent  to have printed in the Record an article that he wrote, my colleague  from Maine.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Amy Coney Barrett's Judicial Philosophy Doesn't Hold Up to Scrutiny                (By Angus King Jr., Heather Cox Richardson)         The Constitution should be the sturdy vessel of our ideals       and aspirations, not a derelict sailing ship locked in the       ice of a world far from our own.        During her confirmation hearings, Amy Coney Barrett argued       that the judicial philosophy known as ``originalism'' should       guide judges in their interpretation and application of       constitutional principles. Most famously associated with the       late Justice Antonin Scalia (for whom Judge Barrett clerked),       this idea sounds simple and sensible: in determining what the       Constitution permits, a judge must first look to the plain       meaning of the text, and if that isn't clear, then apply what       was in the minds of the 55 men who wrote it in 1787. Period.       Anything else is ``judicial lawmaking.''        In some cases, interpreting the Constitution with an       originalist lens is pretty easy; for example, the       Constitution says that the president must be at least 35       years old (``35'' means, well, 35), that each state has two       senators (not three and not one), and that Congress is       authorized to establish and support an Army and a Navy. But       wait a minute. What about the Air Force? Is it mentioned in       the text? Nope. Is there any ambiguity in the text? Again,       no. It doesn't say ``armed forces''; it explicitly says       ``Army'' and ``Navy.'' Did the Framers have in mind the Air       Force 115 years before the Wright brothers? Not likely.        So is the Air Force unconstitutional, even though it       clearly fails both prongs of the ``originalist'' test? No, a       more reasonable and obvious interpretation is that the       Framers intended that the country be protected and that the       Air Force is a logical extension of that concept, even though       it wasn't contemplated in 1787. This isn't judicial       lawmaking; it's judges doing what they're hired to do.     There are supposed to be--not supposed to be; there are-- there are two Senators from every State. That is in the Constitution. I  don't think we are going to disagree about what that means.   I know that people on the floor staff tonight are thinking: I wish  there was one Senator from Colorado who would stop talking.   And I will stop talking. But that is what it says, and I can read the  plain meaning of that--``two Senators.'' But it becomes less clear when  the words are things like--again, credit to Angus King--``due  process,'' or when the words don't even show up in the Constitution of  the United States--``Air Force''--because they didn't have a single  plane when they wrote the Constitution of the United States.   I think that Thomas Jefferson's view of this was certainly closer to  mine than some others, which was that they expected the government to  evolve. They expected the interpretation of these documents, over time,  to evolve. That is a good reminder, by the way, of the disagreements  that the Founders had, originally.   As to their original intent, some of them were slaveholders, in the  case of Thomas Jefferson, in the case of George Washington, in the case  of Madison. Some of them were abolitionists, in the case of John Adams.  But that was a fundamental thing that ended up being wrestled to a  horrendous compromise that allowed slavery to continue in the United  States of America, and the results of that horrible compromise are  going to be with us for the rest of our days.   But if you had told me when I was in law school that a majority of  the Supreme Court of the United States would subscribe to originalism,  I wouldn't have believed it. I would not have believed it--maybe one  Justice. There had never been a Justice on the Court who ever signed up  to that thing called originalism because it hadn't been invented yet.  You know, it had just been invented.   But I read Justice Alito's majority opinion for the Supreme Court in  the Dobbs case, and, man, he believes it because the fundamental  conviction is: If it wasn't a freedom in 1868, it is not a freedom  today; it is not a right today. That is what the originalist's view  would be.   The dissent points out that the men--the men, the men--who ratified  the 14th Amendment in 1868 ``did not perceive women as equals, and did  not recognize women's rights. When the majority says that we must read  our foundational charter as viewed at the time of ratification . . . it  consigns women to second-class citizenship.''   By definition, how can that not be true? Women were second-class  citizens when the Constitution was written. They were second-class  citizens when the 14th Amendment was passed in 1868. It took women in  this country another 50 years--almost, almost--after a hundred years of  fighting for it, to get the right to vote in America, the self-evident  right to vote.   And because the Supreme Court majority didn't have to wrestle with  the realities of this freedom, the realities of this right, because for  them the only pertinent question was: Was it around in 1868? That is  not completely unfair to them; they were asking a question like was it  around 300 years, 400 years ago but ignoring the 50 years that it had  been a right, that it had been a freedom in the United States of  America. They didn't have to contend, nor did they want to contend,  with the effects their decision was going to have on everyday people in  the United States of America, including people who served in our  military.   One of the very first calls I got after Dobbs was decided was from a  woman whom I know who was an officer in the Air Force, who called me  and said me: Michael, let me tell you a story about my life and  decisions I had to make. And, now, what are people going to do?   We talked about the privacy issues that were at stake. Those aren't  even touched on here.   If I were in charge, I would hope that we would have something in  there about privacy. We don't have anything. There is not even anything  about privacy. Everybody in the unit is going to know everything that  there is to know.   She wanted to talk about that, but what she really wanted to talk  about is readiness; this is going to affect our readiness.   In response to that concern, the Pentagon drew up these three  policies: travel allowances for servicemembers, as I mentioned; being  able to take your absence without unpaid leave; and more time for  servicemembers to be able to tell their commanding officers. That is  all it is.   Now the Senator from Alabama is out here saying that, you know, it is  making the DOD into an abortion factory, or--he didn't say it tonight,  but he said it before--into an abortion travel agency, and that is why  he is holding up these 200 flag officers.   I am really worried--I am really worried--about what the implications  of this are because I don't know what is going to make him stop, and I  don't know what damage is going to be done to our national defense in  the meantime.   I will say I believe very strongly that this country should codify  women's rights to choose at the national level. I believe that. I  believe that. Most Americans agree with that position. Most Americans  disagree with the Supreme Court. Most Americans disagree with the 50- year campaign that has reversed Roe v. Wade.   We have to adjust to this new reality. It is not about evading laws  or evading statutes. It is about supporting the men and women in our  military, in our armed services. That is what this is about. That is  what this is about.   To hold hostage the promotions of flag officers at DOD because of  your particular view of a woman's right to choose or whether Dobbs was  rightly  [[Page S1596]]  decided by the originalist majority that now sits on the Supreme  Court--that is pretty tough, man. That is pretty tough. It is tough  enough that this right has been stripped and this freedom has been  stripped.   I think there are people who thought it wasn't really going to happen  in America. I said I thought it wasn't going to happen. I didn't. I  didn't. When I was the age of the pages here, when I was in law school  and college, the last thing from my mind is that this would happen. I  think it is surprising to the American people, and I think it would be  very surprising to the American people if they knew that there was a  Member of the U.S. Senate using a procedure that has never been used in  the history of our country to try to impose their view of social  policy.   And I don't think the American people should accept this. I will tell  you, I know that Colorado doesn't accept this. In Colorado, as I said  earlier, we protect reproductive care for servicemembers. We protect it  for everybody in my State, and we do everything we can to protect our  readiness as well.   We are home, in Colorado, to the U.S. Air Force Academy; to Fort  Carson, to Schriever, to Peterson, to Buckley; and to Space Command. In  the case of Space Command, we have a live example of how the Supreme  Court's decision could hurt our national security. This is one of the  saddest stories that I know. I am sorry to be here tonight telling this  story because I think decisions about where to locate our military  installations should be made in the national security interest of the  United States of America. That is what I believe. It is devastating to  think that we could have had a situation where elected leaders-- politicians, a President--could play politics instead of making a  decision in our national security, but in the case of Space Command,  that is exactly what happened.   Every top general in the Air Force who was asked recommended Peterson  in Colorado Springs as the home for Space Command, and there were three  reasons. One was, it could get stood up faster than if it were moved  anywhere else; it was going to be cheaper to repurpose buildings that  were there; and because they were also concerned that if they moved it  from Colorado, there would be massive attrition, both in the DOD  workforce and the civilian workforce. That was their conclusion. That  was their conclusion: Leave it in Colorado. And President Trump  overruled them. Every general said: Leave it in Colorado. They went  into the White House. The President made a different decision and said:  Move it to Alabama. Let's send Space Command to Alabama.   How do I know he made the decision on politics, not on national  security? How do we know that? Well, he went first on a radio program  called--this is President Trump. He went on a radio program called the  ``Rick & Bubba Show,'' and they asked him, and he said: I  singlehandedly moved it to Alabama. They wanted it to be somewhere  else, but I singlehandedly moved it to Alabama.   The GAO and DOD's own inspector general confirmed these facts-- confirmed these facts--about the generals saying it should be in  Colorado and President Trump saying: I singlehandedly made the  decision.   Mayor John Suthers, who is the mayor of Colorado Springs, confirmed  these facts. In fact, in a letter to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall,  here is what Mayor Suthers wrote: In the spring of 2019, President  Trump told him that ``despite any process the Air Force was pursuing,  he''--President Trump--``would make the decision `personally', and the  only question is whether it would be before or after the 2020  election.''   In February 2020 when Mayor Suthers--not that it matters, but just  for the record, Mayor Suthers is a Republican mayor. This is not a  Democratic mayor who is recalling these statements by President Trump;  it is a Republican mayor.   In February 2020 when Mayor Suthers again made his case to President  Trump to keep Space Command in Colorado, Trump asked him if he was a  Republican.   He is a Republican. I don't know why that mattered, but he is a  Republican.   When Mayor Suthers replied that he was, President Trump asked what  President Trump's chances were of carrying Colorado in the 2020  election. After Mayor Suthers responded that his chances were  ``uncertain,'' he noticed that made the President seem ``perturbed.''  President Trump said again he would make the decision after the 2020  election and he wanted ``to see how it [turned] out''--to see how the  election turned out.   The generals all recommended Colorado. They went into the White  House. Donald Trump, President Trump, overturned what they said, and,  in his own language, we know the reason why.   I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record,  Madam President.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      March 7, 2023.        Dear Secretary Kendall: I am the Mayor of Colorado Springs,       Colorado, and have been since June 2015. I have also served       as the Attorney General of Colorado and U.S. Attorney for       Colorado. During my role as Mayor, I have been involved in       the effort to retain US Space Command headquarters in the       city.        While I am hardly an unbiased observer of the process, I do       want to relate two conversations I had with former President       Donald Trump that led me to conclude the President's decision       to move Space Command headquarters to Huntsville, Alabama was       a wholly political one. Both conversations took place on the       tarmac at Peterson Space Force Base and both were witnessed       by high-ranking officers in the US Space Force. The first was       in the spring of 2019 when President Trump came to Colorado       Springs to speak at the Air Force Academy graduation, and the       second came in February 2020 when he came to the city for a       political rally. In both instances, I was the first to greet       him when he got off Air Force One and I mentioned Colorado       Springs had been the home of all previous iterations of Space       Command, and we hoped to remain the permanent home of Space       Command headquarters. In the spring 2019 meeting, I was       surprised to hear the President assert that, despite any       process the Air Force was pursuing, he would make the       decision ``personally'', and the only question is whether it       would be before or after the 2020 election. The February 2020       meeting was more extensive and enlightening. My wife Janet       and I were both standing next to high-ranking Space Force       officers. When I once again made my pitch to President Trump,       he asked me if I was a Republican mayor. When I replied that       I was, he asked what his chances were of carrying Colorado in       the November election. When I said they were ``uncertain'' he       seemed perturbed. He then turned to the high-ranking officer       in the Space Force and asked him, ``Is this where it should       be?'' The high-ranking officer replied, ``Absolutely, Mr.       President.'' The President then reiterated that he would make       the decision and said it would be after the 2020 election.       ``I want to see how it turns out,'' he said.        Because of these conversations with the President, and the       role played by Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks in the rally       before the storming of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, I       was disappointed, but not surprised, that the President,       after the decision to move to Huntsville was made a week       before he left office, fully admitted to Alabama Audiences       that he ``single-handedly'' made the decision to move the       command to Huntsville.        I understand there are some in the Biden Administration who       contend the Trump Administration's decision to move Space       Command headquarters was not wholly political, despite the       former President's public assertions to the contrary. I hope       my conversations with President Trump, which were witnessed       by others, as related herein, will shed further light on the       matter.        I would be glad to answer any questions you or anyone else       might have about the matter, or provide an affidavit, if       requested.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                   John W. Suthers,                                          Mayor of Colorado Spring.     Madam President, and instead of removing this stain of  politics from this decision, DOD, I am sad to say, has proceeded as if  nothing were wrong, as if there were just a garden-variety bureaucratic  process that they are going through, an inevitable outcome that  preserves that political judgment, which would be a horrendous  precedent for our country--horrendous. It would ratify a political  decision that should have been a decision made in the interests of our  national security. It would be a green light for future Presidents to  do that kind of thing.   There are estimates that the attrition could be as much as 80 percent  if you move this from Colorado to Alabama. The reason this comes up in  the context of this debate is that, in Colorado, we have preserved a  woman's right to choose. In Alabama, they have banned it--no exceptions  for rape or incest. And now the Representatives, the  [[Page S1597]]  Senators from Alabama don't want anybody to be able to pursue their  interests and their judgments about their own healthcare.   President Trump's decision would be a self-inflicted wound as we face  a major land war in Ukraine and the saber-rattling that we are hearing  in the Pacific. Every day that goes by, there is another article about  how critically important our space assets are in this fight for freedom  all around the world.   I am really, really pleased that President Biden is coming to  Colorado Springs next month to speak to the graduating class of the Air  Force Academy, and I hope that is going to give us the opportunity to  learn about this decision and how harmful it was and give us the chance  to restore integrity to the process--to ensure that national security,  not politics, drives our basing decision--and at the same time give us  the chance once again to stand on the side of expanding rights and  expanding opportunity in America, not restricting it.   The Supreme Court had no interest--had no interest--in grappling with  the consequences of their ruling on our country, on our society, on the  men and women in uniform, on our national security. They didn't have to  because if it wasn't a right in 1868, it is not a right today; if it  wasn't a freedom in 1868, it is not a freedom today.   The men and women in our 21st-century Department of Defense deserve  better than that. The men and women who have signed up to serve this  country selflessly deserve better than that.   I heard my colleague from across the aisle say that this was a  country about the stronger defending the weaker. I don't think that is  what this is about. The responsibility each one of us has--each one of  us has--whether we are born strong or weak or rich or poor or in  Colorado or in Alabama, to uphold our national security, to uphold our  democracy, to make sure that we land on the side of our highest ideals.   I think most people feel like there has been too much politics in  America lately. I think people would see that they have fundamental  disagreements with each other about a woman's right to choose or an  endless number of things, but I also think people could understand what  would happen if, instead of continuing to debate, continuing to have a  conversation, that our attitude was ``I am just taking my ball and  going home'' or, in the case of the Senator from Alabama, ``I am going  to hold up 200 flag officers who have been duly promoted in our  Department of Defense.''   So I don't know how this is going to end, Madam President. This is  not a great day in the history of the U.S. Senate. There is a reason  why all of our colleagues going back for 230 years haven't put the kind  of hold that we have seen put on today.   It is staggering to me that, at a moment when the majority of  Americans are saying that they think the decision in Dobbs was wrongly  decided, that they think this decision should be made between a woman  and her doctor, that we would be out here on the floor of the Senate  using tactics that nobody has ever used before to impose one's personal  view on the rest of the country.   I would ask that the Senator from Alabama reconsider the position he  has taken, and I would ask the Biden administration to undo the  terrible political decision President Trump himself said he was making  singlehandedly, over the objection of the generals in the Air Force.   Now, in the wake of the decision in Dobbs and seeing what the  intention is among some folks on the other side of the aisle, there is  no excuse to picking up this military installation and moving it all  the way across the country, the United States of America, just to  ensure that women don't have the free exercise of their freedom and to  ensure that it would be delayed as a result of going there and that we  will be less safe as a result of it going there.   I know the temptation is strong to not overturn the previous decision  because people, I think, are worried about looking political. It would  be political to keep this political decision in place. They need to  listen to the words of the Republican mayor, John Suthers; listen to  Donald Trump's own words; listen to what the generals said.   But this is the fourth time I have been out here, Madam President, on  this issue, and I am going to keep coming back as long as it takes. I  appreciate your patience and your indulgence this evening.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary public service career of Dr. Alan S. Rudolph as he  concludes his tenure as vice president for research at Colorado State  University--CSU--one of the Nation's top research universities.   Dr. Rudolph received his undergraduate degree from the University of  Michigan, an MBA at George Washington University, and a doctorate in  zoology from the University of California, Davis. As a National  Research Council postdoctoral fellow, his work at the U.S. Naval  Research Laboratory NRL showed how we can learn from organisms that  survive extreme environments to protect biosensors and blood products  for use in the field.   Following his time at the NRL, he was recruited to join the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency--DARPA--as chief of biological  [[Page S1599]]  sciences and technology, where he led new strategic efforts for  investments in biosciences and biotechnology. He led seminal programs  in biorobotics, including starting the design and prototype of Spot,  the Boston Dynamics robotic dog, and brain machine interfaces, where he  led new programs in brain-controlled prosthetics.   In 2003, he left civil service for the private sector to start new  corporate biotechnology efforts with Adlyfe, an Alzheimer's diagnostics  company, and Cellphire, Inc., which freeze dries blood products. In  2010, Dr. Rudolph was recruited by the Obama administration and  inducted into the Senior Executive Service to lead the Department of  Defense Biodefense Program as Director of the Joint Science and  Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense. At the Pentagon,  Dr. Rudolph invested in broad programs to protect the Nation, including  new antibody treatments that saved the lives of three Americans in the  U.S. during the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Dr. Rudolph concluded his 17- year civil service career leading the Department of Homeland Security's  Chemical and Biological Science and Technology Office.   In 2012, through an international research foundation started by Dr.  Rudolph, he led a project across over 30 countries to demonstrate the  application of brain technology to help injured patients relearn their  ability to walk in the Walk Again Project. The trial culminated at the  opening of the World Cup in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where a paraplegic  opened the world games by kicking a ball onto the pitch with a new  prosthetic under brain control.   Dr. Rudolph's outstanding public service continued when he became  vice president for research at Colorado State University in Fort  Collins, CO, in 2013. At Colorado State, he oversaw record-breaking  annual research expenditures approaching $500 million annually and  representing 38 percent of the university's overall budget. During his  service, he doubled the number of specialized centers and institutes,  including the Center for Healthy Aging, One Health Institute, and Data  Science Research Institute, and catalyzed other partnerships in mental  wellness, climate adaptation, and agricultural sustainability. Today,  CSU ranks among the top tier of research universities in the United  States.   Dr. Rudolph has served on numerous executive-level committees and  advisory boards. He was a member of the executive board for the  Colorado BioScience Association, board member at Innosphere Ventures,  and chairman of the board of CO-Labs, which represents 30 Federal  research laboratories in the front range. He was on the board of the  Colorado Energy Research Collaboratory and the Colorado Department of  Education's Higher Research Alliance.   Dr. Rudolph has been recognized for his public service, including a  meritorious civil service citation from the Office of the Secretary of  Defense for his contributions to life sciences and national security  investments. He also won numerous research awards for his scholarly  publications in blood research and tissue engineering.   Dr. Rudolph has performed outstanding Federal service, showing an  unwavering commitment to promoting science in service of the public,  and has earned the trust and utmost respect of his colleagues and the  citizens of Colorado.   I am pleased to honor Alan S.
