 Mr. Speaker, the release of the Carter Page FISA  warrant makes it clear that the FBI was right to examine the  connections between Page and the Trump campaign as well as their  communications with Russian sources.   These warrants cast serious doubt on the credibility of the so-called  Nunes memo, which is demonstrably inaccurate.   Earlier today, the President's press secretary announced that the  administration was considering stripping top level former national  security officials of their security clearances on the grounds that  they, ``politicized public service.''   I would question whether any use of intelligence could be more  political than writing a misleading document, namely the Nunes memo, to  unjustifiably malign the integrity and competence of the FBI in order  to shield the President.   It is clear that congressional Republicans are attempting to  delegitimize the FBI and, through it, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's  ongoing investigation.   We must protect the independence and integrity of this investigation,  and I urge Speaker Ryan and the House leadership to do so immediately.                            ____________________
