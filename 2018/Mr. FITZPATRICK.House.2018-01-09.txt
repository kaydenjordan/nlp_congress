 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of  Philip Gutis.   Mr. Gutis is from New Hope, Pennsylvania. At the age of 56, he has  been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Early-onset  Alzheimer's currently affects hundreds of thousands of Americans who  are under the age of 65. Diagnoses for this debilitating neurological  disease in its early stages can be arduous and frustrating, as many of  the symptoms resemble less serious issues like stress.   Mr. Gutis recently visited my district office to discuss living with  this disease. He detailed the pain, stress, and confusion that he felt  when first diagnosed. He described how simple tasks can become  challenging when dealing with memory loss. But his message was not to  complain about his ailment, it was to be a voice for other individuals  who live with Alzheimer's, those who are unable to have their voices be  heard.   Alzheimer's is a serious neurological disease. Though there is no  cure, treatment for symptoms can help slow the progressive effects of  dementia.   I stand in support of Mr. Gutis and all those living with  Alzheimer's.                         Doylestown Health Foundation     Mr. Speaker, the Doylestown Health Foundation is a  healthcare network that has provided critical care to the Bucks County  community for over 90 years. In recognition of its continued work,  Doylestown Health recently received $10 million in gifts, the largest  amount in their history.   The pair of $5 million donations were given by two families with  close ties to the Doylestown Health Foundation. Richard and Angela  Clark have had four generations of family cared for at Doylestown  Hospital, while Alex Gorsky, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson, and his  wife, Patricia, have served on the hospital board and board of  directors, respectively.   Supporting institutions in our community through charitable donations  are crucial to community prosperity. The generous gifts of the Clark  and Gorsky families are earmarked for vital projects like a new heart  and vascular center.   With contributions like these, the Doylestown Health Foundation will  be able to continue providing optimal care to those in our Bucks County  community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4581) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to  develop best practices for utilizing advanced passenger information and  passenger name record data for counterterrorism screening and vetting  operations, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4581         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Screening and Vetting       Passenger Exchange Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PASSENGER SCREENING BEST PRACTICES.         (a) In General.--Not later than 270 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security       shall develop best practices for utilizing advanced passenger       information and passenger name record data for       counterterrorism screening and vetting operations.        (b) Considerations.--The Secretary of Homeland Security       shall, to the greatest extent practicable--        (1) make available to certain countries, including visa       waiver program countries under section 217 of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187), the best practices       required under subsection (a); and        (2) provide assistance to such countries in implementing       such best practices.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) and the gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today to voice my full support for H.R. 4581, the Screening  and Vetting Passenger Exchange Act of 2017. This legislation directs  the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop best practices for  utilizing advanced passenger information, or API, and passenger names  record data, or PNR, for counterterrorism screening and vetting  operations.   It also enables the Secretary to share those practices with our  allies, including countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program,  and to provide assistance in implementing these practices in those  countries.   Having access to API, which is biographic information, and PNR data,  which is data about reservation and itinerary information, allows our  homeland security professionals to confirm the identities and travel  patterns of potential criminals and terrorists before they enter the  United States.   Allowing our men and women on the front lines to fight against  terrorism, to work with Visa Waiver Program countries to make sure that  they rise to the same standards only increases the safety of our  Nation, the safety of all Americans traveling abroad, and the safety of  all people across the globe. This legislation is a step in the right  direction toward addressing further potential emerging threats.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support our Nation's  Homeland Security by supporting my bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the Homeland  Security Committee.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Screening and Vetting Passenger Exchange Act. I want to thank  Congressman Fitzpatrick for bringing this important legislation. The  United States is currently experiencing one of the highest terror  threat environments since  9/11.   Despite crushing the caliphate in Iraq and Syria, ISIS continues to  demonstrate its capability to inspire attacks on the West, including in  the homeland. The two terror attacks in New York City late last year  are stark reminders of this reality and the threat facing the United  States. Given the nature of this evolving threat, I established a task  force on denying terrorists entry into the United States last year and  I appointed Representative Mike Gallagher to head up the effort.   I would like to thank all of the members of the task force for their  hard work in making this effort a success. I charged this task force  with examining how terrorists might infiltrate the homeland,  identifying challenges with current U.S. Government information sharing  and vetting procedures, and reviewing the screening agencies' structure  and bureaucracy.    After completing its review, the task force issued a report outlining  its findings and providing seven recommendations designed to address  the identified gaps. These recommendations were the basis for several  of the bills we are considering today. As evidenced by the recent spate  of attacks, there is a large population of radicalized individuals in  Europe who are willing to commit violence in the name of terrorist  groups like ISIS. We must remain vigilant and cannot forget many of  these individuals are just one flight away from the United States.   Given the seriousness of this threat, we must do more at home and  abroad to screen and vet people seeking to enter the United States. The  bills we are considering today will enhance our capabilities by  improving information sharing and promoting efficiencies in the  screening and vetting process, helping ensure the homeland is the best  secured against terrorist infiltration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) that the House suspend  the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4581.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4433) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  require the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of  Homeland Security to achieve security of sensitive assets among the  components of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other  purposes, as amended.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4433, the Securing  Department of Homeland Security Firearms Act of 2017.   A recent report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of  Inspector General, entitled, ``DHS' Controls Over Firearms and Other  Sensitive Assets,'' found that, between fiscal year 2014 and fiscal  year 2016, personnel from DHS and its components misplaced a total of  2,142 highly sensitive assets, including 228 firearms and 1,889 badges.  [[Page H51]]    DHS is charged with the safety of our Nation and its citizens. The  OIG report indicates that not only are there some DHS personnel not  being held accountable for failing to safeguard their sensitive assets,  they are also not receiving proper training on how to properly  safeguard and keep track of such equipment. Given the importance of  DHS' mission, this is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker.   H.R. 4433 follows the OIG's recommendations and requires DHS' Under  Secretary for Management to promulgate a departmentwide directive to  DHS personnel aimed at achieving adequate security over DHS firearms  and other sensitive assets. H.R. 4433 mandates that this directive  include descriptions of what equipment is classified as a sensitive  asset, requirements for securing Department-issued sensitive assets,  and recordkeeping requirements for reporting lost or stolen firearms  and other assets.   H.R. 4433 also requires DHS to update its Personal Property Asset  Management Program Manual to include procedures and training on how to  safeguard assets, both on and off duty, in accordance with the  directive.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 4433, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) that the House suspend  the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4433, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark National Law  Enforcement Appreciation Day.   In 2017, 128 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of  duty. Despite the significant danger they face, these brave men and  women continue to put their badge on every day, leaving their loved  ones at home, to protect our friends, our families, and our  communities.   I was fortunate to be a member of the thin blue line for nearly a  decade and a half as an FBI special agent. During that time, I worked  with some of the most dedicated, mission-oriented professionals in the  Nation, to include Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers.   I ask that today, and every day, all Americans take a moment to  reflect on what our law enforcement officers do to protect our  liberties and to ensure the safety of our communities. We owe them a  debt of gratitude for their service and for their sacrifice.   As I did last year, I urge the President to observe this day by  lighting the White House blue this evening.                            ____________________
