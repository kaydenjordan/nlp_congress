 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S1566]]     Mr. President, 10 years ago, millions of American  families were on the verge of devastation. The failure of Bear Stearns  in March of 2008 was the first major signal of a coming financial  crisis that would cost 9 million people their jobs and millions more  people their homes or their savings. Lives and plans and dreams would  be crushed--and even after the economy began to recover its footing,  millions of American families would have to spend years just to get  back to where they started before 2008. A lot of those families have  given up the dream of home ownership forever, and many are still  struggling today.   But in the next few days, with broad support among Republicans and  far too much support among Democrats, the Senate is on the verge of  passing a bill that puts American families in danger of that same  devastation all over again.   Over the last few days, I have talked about what this bill will do. I  have explained how it strips consumer protections for American families  who are trying to buy a home, particularly in low-income communities  and communities of color. I have talked about how this bill will peel  away vital safeguards we put on large banks after the financial crisis  to make sure they can't crash the economy all over again.   Now, as the bill is on the verge of passing the Senate, I want to  stop and just ask a basic question: Why? Who exactly is asking us to do  this?   Our constituents hate it. A recent poll showed that an overwhelming  majority of Americans oppose this bill. So why is it that the only  thing Washington can agree to do on a bipartisan basis in this Congress  is to help out giant banks?   I will tell you why. Washington's amnesia is legendary. We go through  the same cycle like clockwork. When the economy is looking good,  lobbyists flood Congress and tell politicians it is perfectly safe to  roll back the rules on the big banks. It is always the same set of  arguments: America needs more lending for more economic growth. Our  country is losing ground to its competitors. Banks have learned their  lesson and don't need rules to behave responsibly. And here is the  kicker question: What could possibly go wrong? Every time, it works.   It works even though the lessons of history are clear. Strong  financial rules help create a strong economy that works for everyone,  and when we weaken the rules, it sets the stage for another financial  crisis--a crisis that, every time, hits America's working families the  hardest.   Let's go back to the beginning of the 20th century. A lot of our  financial regulations in the United States come from the Great  Depression. Before then, Washington ignored the booms and busts that  rocked the country every few years. But after the unemployment rate  topped 20 percent in the 1930s and the U.S. economy shrunk by about 30  percent, Washington--this Congress--finally got its act together to  pass some laws.   Here is what they did. First, they looked at all of the places where  people put their money--banks, home, markets--and then they built  regulators for all of those different kinds of investments. Congress  did something really smart. It put a law in place called the Glass- Steagall Act. It broke up the biggest banks, and it separated the banks  that take deposits and make mortgages from high-risk institutions like  investment banks.   This worked reasonably well for about half a century. There wasn't a  single major financial crisis. But then, starting in the late 1970s and  early 1980s, bankers, looking for higher profits and bigger paychecks,  set their sights on government rules. They wanted less regulation and  more freedom to trick their customers, to trap their customers, and to  cheat their customers.   It started in the savings and loan industry. These institutions,  which specialized in home mortgages, started to become insolvent  because of the rising inflation and flaws in their business model. So  the bank lobbyists had a solution: Deregulate them. They said: Instead  of just safe mortgages, why don't we let these institutions put out  some riskier stuff in hopes that some of these gambles will pay off  big. The Reagan administration agreed, but the plan failed. Over the  next decade, taxpayers spent $132 billion to bail out these  institutions. That was in the 1980s.   But why stop there? Deregulating the thrifts, as disastrous as it  was, was just small ball. Thrifts were allowed to gamble only with a  chunk of their own money. The lobbyists wanted to tear down all of the  barriers, throwing savings accounts and risky, complicated securities  into one big institution and then letting that bank gamble with all of  it.   They dreamt of a Wall Street where banks could take the money in  grandma's checking account and use it to gamble in the markets. They  wanted to tear down the wall Glass-Steagall had created between boring  banking and high-risk trading.   In 1999, the conditions were perfect to rip up the rules. Why? The  economy was cruising. Unemployment was down to 4.2 percent. The markets  were on fire. The Dow, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ smashed every record  in their paths. In fact, the NASDAQ grew at 85.6 percent in 1999, the  biggest annual jump for a major index in U.S. history. One respected  finance professor gushed:         It's amazing. Every year we say it can't be another year of       20 percent-plus (gain)--and then every year it's a 20       percent-plus gain.    It was the prime time for the bank lobbyists to strike. They swarmed  Capitol Hill pushing, pulling, cajoling, running from the House to the  Senate and back again, and most of this was happening behind closed  doors. But on a clear, cold day in February of 1999, eight bankers and  two lobbyists testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee, and  the knives were out for Glass-Steagall. The euphemism people used then  was ``modernization.'' When lobbyists start talking about modernization  and clarification, it is time to buy a parachute.    Let me tell you about KeyCorp, one of the banks that would be taken  off the watch list in the bill we are going to be voting on in the  coming days. Back in 1999, the CEO of that company testified that the  ``financial law modernization that strengthens our financial  institutions in and of itself will enhance safety and soundness.''  Think about what that means. Behind the buzzwords, that CEO was making  the amazing claim that if banks were just allowed to take more risks  and make more short-term profits, it would actually make the financial  system safer. In other words, if we just deregulate the banks, they  will become safer.   He wasn't the only one to make a claim like that. The vice chairman  of JPMorgan said: ``There is a consensus shared by most financial firms  and their customers, as well as policymakers, that these rules restrict  competition, reduce consumer choice, and are not necessary to protect  consumers or insured financial institutions.'' In other words, rules  are the problem--if banks could just do whatever they wanted,  everything would be great.   Guess what. The pitch worked. Nine months later, in late 1999, a bill  to repeal key parts of Glass-Steagall and roll back other financial  rules passed both Houses of Congress overwhelmingly. Ninety Senators  voted yes. Senator after Senator, including quite a few who are still  here today, came to the Senate floor and praised the bill for  modernizing our financial rules and getting rid of unnecessary and  outdated requirements.   But not everyone was fooled. Some Senators knew better. Senator Paul  Wellstone from Minnesota warned that Congress ``seem[s] determined to  unlearn the lessons from our past mistakes . . . [and] is about to  repeal [Glass-Steagall] without putting any comparable safeguard in its  place.''   Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota was especially prescient. He  said:         I think we will look back in 10 years' time and say we       should not have done this but we did because we forgot the       lessons of the past, and that that which is true in the       1930's is true in 2010. . . . We now have decided in the name       of modernization to forget the lessons of the past, of safety       and of soundness.    But Congress ignored their warnings. For the bargain price of $300  million in lobbyist bills, the big banks saw their wildest dreams come  true. With the repeal of Glass-Steagall, too-big-to-fail megabanks were  born. Citibank became Citigroup. J.P. Morgan became  [[Page S1567]]  JPMorgan Chase. The banks got bigger and bigger and bigger.   But the lobbyists weren't done yet. Over the next decade, they tried  over and over to expand the loopholes that they had punched until both  the regulators and the regulations gave way. By the middle of the  decade, the conditions were right. Markets broke records. The  unemployment rate was below 5 percent. It was time for the lobbyists to  go at it again. Hand-tailored suits and Gucci loafers swarmed Capitol  Hill. Meetings were scheduled. So were fundraisers. Their efforts again  occasionally spilled out into the public hearing rooms.   This pitch might sound familiar. In 2006, the head of risk at  Citigroup, on behalf of the Financial Services Roundtable, told the  House Financial Services Committee: ``The U.S. needs to modernize its  capital regulations, and there are a variety of new approaches that all  represent a significant improvement over the current system.'' In other  words, the regulations are outdated.   Steve Bartlett, a former Congressman who was a lobbyist for the 50  biggest banks, told the Senate Banking Committee in 2005: ``Outdated  laws and regulations impose significant, and unnecessary, burdens on  financial services firms, and these burdens not only make our firms  less efficient, but also increase the cost of financial products and  services to consumers.'' In other words, set the banks free, and let  them do whatever they want. What could possibly go wrong?   In 2005, the head of the American Bankers Association told the  committee: ``The cost of unnecessary paperwork and red tape is a  serious long-term problem that will continue to erode the ability of  banks to serve our customers and support the economic growth of our  communities.'' In other words, in the end, these rules hurt consumers.  Let the banks do whatever they want to consumers.   Then, just as the lobbyists were gaining momentum, the economy they  created crashed. It was 2008, and millions of families lost their  homes, millions lost their savings, and millions lost their jobs. But  the lobbyists didn't lose their jobs. They peddled myths about the  economy and the financial system, and they kept right on working for  the big banks. All during the efforts to pass financial regulations to  get our economy out of the ditch, the bank lobbyists were there. They  pulled in more than $1 million a day lobbying against financial reform.   When the American people started to demand action in the wake of the  2008 crash, the reforms passed anyway. But the lobbyists didn't give  up. They didn't go away. Before the ink was dry on Dodd-Frank, they  jumped right back in and started lobbying to roll back the new rules.   So here we are again. It took years, but the economy is humming  again. In 2016, the unemployment rate dipped below 5 percent for the  first time since before the 2008 crisis. In 2017, the Dow jumped 25  percent, and the NASDAQ grew by 28 percent. And you know what that  means--it means the bank lobbyists have once again taken center stage,  insisting that it is safe to deregulate their clients again, all in the  name of economic growth and empowering consumers. It is the same  argument as before.   Last spring, bank lobbyist Greg Baer said:         After nearly a decade of fundamental and continuing changes       to financial regulation, now is an opportune time to review       the efficacy of our current bank regulatory framework. My       testimony will focus on reforms that could directly and       immediately enhance economic growth.    In other words, turn the big banks loose, and let's see what they can  do.   Harris Simmons, the CEO of Zions Bank, which will be kicked off the  watch list under the bill that is now under consideration, recently  testified that ``the uncertainty surrounding [Dodd-Frank reforms] can  cause banks to withdraw or limit certain kinds of lending.'' To put it  another way: Get out of the way and let the big banks cheat their  customers again. It is good for bank profits.   Here we go again. I get it. Our financial regulations need work.  There are things we could do to reduce the load on community banks, and  there are still big dangers to consumers that we should take up. But  this bill isn't about the unfinished business of the last financial  crisis; this bill is about laying the groundwork for the next financial  crisis.   I will make a prediction. This bill will pass, and if the banks get  their way, in the next 10 years or so, there will be another financial  crisis. Of course, when the crash comes, the big banks will throw up  their hands and say that it is not their fault, that nobody could have  seen it coming. Then they will run to Congress and beg for bailout  money, and--let's be blunt--they will probably get it. But just like in  2008, there will be no bailout for working families. Jobs will be lost,  and lives will be destroyed. The American people, not the banks, will  once again bear the burden.   Then, caught in a fog of amnesia, the lobbyists and regulators and  elected officials in Washington will scratch their heads and wonder how  in the world it could have possibly happened again. But the American  people won't be confused about it at all. They never are. They are much  smarter than the people around here give them credit for. They won't  wonder why it happened; they will know why it happened. They will know  it was because the people in Washington ignored working people in order  to do the bidding of the guys in fancy suits and the handmade shoes who  write the fat campaign checks. Look at the numbers. Seventy-eight  percent of Americans think big banks have too much control over Members  of Congress. That includes 68 percent of people who voted for Donald  Trump. Everyone knows that Congress sold them out last time, and  everyone expects it to happen again this time.   As we prepare to vote on this bill, I ask my colleagues one more  time, do the job you were sent here to do. Stand up for the people who  sent us here. Stop doing the bidding of big bank lobbyists, and start  working on the things that can make a difference in the lives of  working people around this country. The American people need it. The  American people deserve it. The American people will demand it. If you  refuse to do it, don't be surprised when they hold you responsible.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
