 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, since President Biden took office on  January 20, 2021, he has willfully ignored what has been happening at  our southern border. The President and leaders of his administration  try to convince people that what they were seeing with their eyes was  not a crisis but was merely a challenge. When that flopped, they  attempted to blame the previous administration for the flood of  humanity coming across the southern border, even though the immigration  surge has now reached epic proportions since President Biden took  office.   Now, once again, they appear to be ignoring the problem altogether.  We have had 17 months with more than 150,000 illegal border crossings  each month--17 months, 150,000 migrants each month--and the Biden  administration seems to be saying: What is the problem? Their decision,  apparently, is to stay the course.   What little attention there has been to the impact on the border  crisis tends to focus, though, solely on the migrants, and, of course,  that is part of the concern. No one is suggesting that we treat them  with disrespect or in an inhumane manner. In fact, just the contrary is  true. We know that people coming into the country outside of the legal  immigration system endure a brutal journey just to get here. They pay  thousands of dollars to cartels and coyotes--or human smugglers--and  often the women and girls are raped and abused. Migrants who slow down  the coyotes will be abandoned and frequently left to die. We see that  particularly in South Texas around the Falfurrias checkpoint, where we  see the migrants coming across the river.   Then they are put in stash houses in inhumane conditions and then  driven north through the Border Patrol checkpoints. But because of  their fear of being discovered, the coyotes tell them: Get out of the  vehicle and walk around the checkpoint and meet us on the north side to  continue our journey. The problem is, this time of year, the weather  and temperatures are brutal. Frequently, ranchers in Brooks County,  which is the county where the Falfurrias checkpoint is located, find  the bones of migrants who did not make it or otherwise dead bodies.   Migrants are certainly the face of the Biden border crisis, but they  are not the only ones being hurt by the failure of the administration  to deal with this crisis. When thousands of people a day illegally  cross our border, it impacts our entire border security apparatus. We  are seeing unprecedented numbers of people showing up at the border,  and unfortunately it is part of a plan to overwhelm the capacity of law  enforcement to deal with these numbers. This is part of a business  model of the drug cartels. Flood the border with migrants. Distract the  Border Patrol, who have to leave the frontlines to transport, process,  and care for the migrants, creating huge security gaps.   There is no question that the cartels and criminal organizations are  exploiting those gaps to traffic dangerous drugs. They are bringing  across heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana--name your poison.   The truth is, these transnational criminal organizations--sometimes  called cartels--are commodity-agnostic. They are in it for the money,  and they will sell anything or anybody to make money.   But without a doubt, the most alarming drug that is crossing the  border today is fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. Last year, the Biden  administration may have not noticed, but 108,000 Americans died of drug  overdoses last year alone, and the vast majority of those drugs came  across the southern border because of the business model I just  described. The majority of those deaths involve synthetic opioids like  fentanyl. Fentanyl is especially dangerous because as little as 2  milligrams can be deadly. That is a lethal dose that fits on the tip of  a sharpened pencil.   Customs and Border Protection doesn't track fentanyl seizures by  milligrams, although it logs them in pounds. Since October last year,  Customs and Border Protection has seized more than 10,600 pounds of  fentanyl. And, no, they didn't get it all; that is just what they were  able to interdict and seize. But that 10,600 pounds of fentanyl is more  than 2.4 billion lethal doses--enough to wipe out the entire U.S.  population more than 7 times over.   You would think this would be a matter of serious concern for the  administration, an operation which uses migrants to distract law  enforcement from being able to interdict a dangerous drug coming into  the United States and taking tens of thousands of Americans' lives,  but, frankly, it hasn't even registered any kind of reaction by the  administration.   The good news is, thanks to the hard-working Customs and Border  Protection officers, those 10,600 pounds of fentanyl never ended up on  our streets or in our local communities, but the bad news is, there is  a whole lot more where that came from.   Cartels exploit the security gaps across the border to smuggle drugs  into our country. While the first stop may be Texas or another State  along the southern border, these products don't stop there; they are  quickly distributed by networks of criminal gangs across America to  every community--not just cities but rural communities as well.   Fentanyl poses a unique danger because not only is it incredibly  potent, but it is also a lot cheaper than these other drugs. Illicit  drug makers will lace substances with fentanyl to cut expenses and to  hook the user, and buyers often have no idea what they are actually  getting.  [[Page S4456]]    This is a big problem in Texas but not just in my State but across  the country. But we have seen a surge of fentanyl-related deaths in my  State. Last year, more than 1,700 Texans died from fentanyl overdoses,  and we continue to see the heartbreaking toll this drug is having on  communities of every size. Cities across the State have experienced  strings of overdose deaths likely tied to batches of drugs laced with  fentanyl.   There is no single profile to describe the victims of these fentanyl  deaths that cover every age, every demographic, and every walk of life,  but one of the most concerning trends we have seen is a spike in  teenage overdose deaths.   Nationwide, 77 percent--77 percent--of all teen overdose deaths last  year involved fentanyl. Fentanyl is, believe it or not, the leading  cause of death of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45--a shocking  statistic. Teenagers may think they are buying prescription opioids-- things like OxyContin or some other drug--but they may be unknowingly  taking drugs that contain a deadly dose of fentanyl in addition.    One Texas community is feeling the devastation of this situation at  an almost unimaginable degree. In Hays County, situated just southwest  of Austin, 2\1/2\ weeks ago, only days into the new school year, a 15- year-old high school sophomore died from a suspected fentanyl overdose.  Sadly, this wasn't the first death in the Hays Consolidated Independent  School District. It wasn't even the second. In 1 month's time, this  school district lost three students to fentanyl-related overdoses. The  other two students were both seniors. We are talking about young people  who are at the starting point in their lives. They have endless  potential and an army of people who want to see them succeed and live  happy, productive, and successful lives, but that human potential is  lost because this deadly drug has made its way into our country, into  our communities, and into our schools.   But Texas isn't the only State confronting a wave of fentanyl  overdoses. A few weeks ago, a woman in Colorado found her 13-year-old  grandson, Jose, leaning over the bathroom sink, unresponsive. Jose's  family said he had no history of illicit drug use, and they believe he  received a pill from someone on his way home from school. That pill  contained enough fentanyl to kill this energetic eighth grader who had  his entire life ahead of him.   Sadly, this is an all-too-familiar story. Earlier this summer, a 15- month-old toddler in Georgia died after being exposed to fentanyl. The  same thing happened recently in California, also to a 15-month-old  infant.   Law enforcement in big cities and small towns alike have seen a spike  in arrests and overdoses connected to fentanyl. The problem has gotten  so bad that a number of major cities, including Las Vegas, San Diego,  and New York, have installed vending machines to distribute lifesaving  shots of Narcan, which is an antidote to fentanyl overdoses--vending  machines on the city streets of an antidote for fentanyl because the  problem has become so pervasive. This is a crisis facing everyone from  toddlers to teens to adults of all ages.   Last year, more than 71,000 Americans died from a fentanyl overdose.  That is 71,000 out of the 108,000 drug overdose deaths that I mentioned  a moment ago. Given the rate at which fentanyl is coming into the  United States, I fear the worst is still to come.   Drug cartels are taking advantage of the security gaps at the border  and going to extreme lengths to boost their sales. For example, last  month, the Drug Enforcement Administration seized brightly-colored  fentanyl tablets in 18 States. Children appear to be the target  demographic for what the DEA is calling rainbow fentanyl. They are  small, colorful pills that look like candy, as well as pressed blocks  of powder that look like sidewalk chalk. Mexican drug cartels and  others have turned a dangerous and deadly drug into something that any  child would be quick to pick up.   No, there is no question there is a crisis at the border  notwithstanding the fact that President Biden and his administration  have been ignoring it for the entire time he has been in office. It is  certainly hurting the migrants, but it is also having a deadly impact  on the American people.   Coming from a border State, I have visited the border many times, and  I have spoken often to the officers and the agents who are on the  frontlines of this fight. They know well about how the cartels are  gaming the system, using the migrants to divert and distract while  moving deadly drugs into the country. But, frankly, they cannot stop  this humanitarian crisis on their own. They need a change in policy  that can only come from Congress working with the administration. But  so far, the administration has refused to take any steps--any steps at  all--to address the migrant surge, and so the problem continues day  after day after day.   I know the mayors of New York and Chicago and Washington, DC, have  expressed concern that migrants are being bused to their cities, even  though they advertise themselves as sanctuary cities, but, frankly, I  think if that is what it takes to get the attention of the mayors of  those cities, who can then hopefully get the attention of President  Biden and his administration, that it is worth it.   Unless something changes, though, the 108,000 Americans who lost  their lives to drug overdoses, including the 71,000 who lost their  lives to fentanyl last year, will only go up. More fentanyl will come  across the border and find its way into our communities. More cartels  and criminal organizations and street gangs will get rich off of our  suffering. And more of our children, our neighbors, our friends, and  loved ones will die.    We often talk about the need for a humane response to the border  crisis. And these conversations largely focus on migrant care, and  there is no question these individuals should be treated humanely. But  a humane response also involves consideration for the impact this drug  infestation is having on the American people.   By allowing our border to descend into chaos, the President may think  he has taken a humane route, but he is sorely mistaken. Families are  burying their loved ones, children are losing their schoolmates, and  our country is suffering while the cartels get richer and richer and  richer.   Until we can get this crisis under control, the cartels will continue  to move drugs across the border and poison our communities. No, an open  border policy is not humane; it is not sustainable; and despite what  President Biden may think, it is not benefiting anyone.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
