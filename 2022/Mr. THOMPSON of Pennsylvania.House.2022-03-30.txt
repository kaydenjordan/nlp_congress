 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  the life and legacy of the gentleman from Alaska, Representative Don  Young, the dean of the House.   Don was a dear colleague, friend, and brother in the Lord. He loved  Alaska and respected the institution of the House, where he represented  his constituents for five decades. As dean of the House, he was the  longest-serving Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives'  history.   He was a tireless fighter for Alaska and an unparalleled public  servant. It has been a privilege to serve with such a strong  longstanding Member, who was truly a force of nature. My closest  moments with Don were shared on the House floor at our weekly Bible  study where we discussed the promises of God's Word.   While we mourn his passing and lift his family in prayer, I will be  celebrating a life well-lived.   Madam Speaker, Scriptures in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 instructs us  with these words: ``Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be  uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve  like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.''   Don Young had hope.   Well done, good and faithful servant.                            ____________________
