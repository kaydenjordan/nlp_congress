 Mr. President, I would like to say that I appreciate and  am very touched by the remarks of the good Senator from South Carolina,  Mr. Graham.   And I thank Senator Graham so much for his support and his presence  here tonight.    Mr. President, I would just like to thank my colleagues  Graham, Bozeman, and Lankford for being here this evening to support  this effort.   We need to make certain that our Nation's Capital doesn't become a  national embarrassment, and we need to make certain that we send a  strong message that the American public have had it with crime in  America. The crime spree that is happening in our major cities must  come to an end.   We are putting a marker on the ground tomorrow. I want to thank all  my colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, who are joining me in  this.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
