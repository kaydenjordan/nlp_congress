 I ask unanimous consent that I be able to complete my  remarks before the vote gets underway.    Mr. President, I had hoped we had put the idea of changing  the Senate filibuster rule to bed when two Members of the Democratic  Party in the Senate pledged to oppose any attempt to abolish the  filibuster, but, unfortunately, the Democrat leader has revived this  idea and has said that he plans to hold a vote on changing the  filibuster rule on or before January 17.   Democrats have offered a lot of bad ideas over the past year--a lot  of bad ideas. But it is possible that abolishing the filibuster is by  far the worst. Abolishing the filibuster would mean fundamentally  changing the character of the Senate and removing one of the most  significant protections for minority rights in our system of  government.   Our Founders recognized that it wasn't just Kings who could be  tyrants. They knew majorities could be tyrants, too, and that a  majority, if unchecked, could trample the rights of the minority.   And so the Founders combined majority rule with both representation  and constitutional protections for the minority. They established  safeguards, checks and balances throughout our government, to keep the  government in check and ensure that the rights of the minority were  protected. And one of those safeguards was the U.S. Senate.   In the House of Representatives, majority rule is emphasized, and the  Founders could have left it at that. They could have stuck with a  single legislative body. But they didn't. Why? Because they were  worried about the possibility of tyrannical majorities in the House  endangering the rights of the minority.   The author of Federalist 62 notes:         A senate, as a second branch of the legislative assembly,       distinct from and dividing the power with, a first, must be       in all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles       the security to the people, by requiring the concurrence of       two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy. . .       .        Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated       by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies, to       yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to       be seduced by factious leaders, into intemperate and       pernicious resolutions.    That is from the author of Federalist 62.   So the Founders created the Senate as a check on the House of  Representatives. They made the Senate smaller  [[Page S31]]  and Senators' terms of office longer, with the intention of creating a  more stable, more thoughtful, and more deliberative legislative body to  check ill-considered or intemperate legislation in attempts to curtail  minority rights.   As time has gone on, the legislative filibuster has become perhaps  the key way the Senate protects minority rights. The filibuster ensures  that the minority party and the Americans it represents has a voice in  the Senate. It forces compromise. It forces bipartisanship. It  encourages a greater level of stability and predictability.   Even in the rare case when a majority party has a filibuster-proof  majority in the Senate, the filibuster still forces the majority party  to take into account the views of its more moderate or middle-of-the- road Members, thus ensuring that more Americans are represented in  legislation.   Removing the filibuster would erase this protection and allow the  majority, including an incredibly narrow or merely technical majority,  as Democrats have right now, to trample minority rights.   In the words of one former Senator, ``We should make no mistake. . .  . It is a fundamental power grab by the majority party. . . . Folks who  want to see this change want to eliminate one of the procedural  mechanisms designed for the express purpose for guaranteeing individual  rights, and they also have a consequence, and would undermine the  protections of a minority point of view in the heat of majority  excess.''   That is former Senator, now President, Joe Biden, one of the many  Democrats who has opposed abolishing the filibuster, because, of  course, Democrats were singing a different tune on the filibuster just  a couple of years ago.   When President Trump urged Republican Senators to abolish the  legislative filibuster--and, I would add, dozens of times--Democrats  were strongly opposed. In 2017, 32 Democrat Senators, including now- Vice President Harris and a majority of the current Democrat caucus,  signed a letter urging that the legislative filibuster be preserved,  and Republicans agreed and refused to abolish the legislative  filibuster despite the former President's repeated urging.   It is not because we didn't have a lot of legislation that we wanted  to pass; we did. And we knew that abolishing the filibuster would make  it a whole lot easier to advance our agenda, but we also knew that the  Senate wasn't designed to let a slim majority of Senators push through  whatever agenda it wanted and that abolishing the legislative  filibuster would quickly come back to haunt us when we were in the  minority again. And so we resisted our own President's urging and  preserved--preserved--the legislative filibuster.   Now, however, many Democrats, who not only supported but actively-- actively and repeatedly--used the filibuster during the previous  administration to block major coronavirus relief legislation and police  reform legislation, have apparently decided that rules protecting the  minority should only apply when Democrats are in the minority.   Apparently, Democrat minorities deserve representation, but  Republican minorities do not.   It is a particularly outrageous position when you consider the fact  that, right now, Democrats have nothing more than a technical majority  in the Senate. The Senate is currently divided 50-50. The only reason  Democrats have a deciding vote in the Senate is because the Vice  President is a Democrat. That is hardly the kind of majority that  should make Democrats feel free to steamroll minority rights.   And let me put aside the question of minority rights and Democrats'  hypocrisy on this issue for just a moment.   I want to talk about two things: One, my Democrat colleagues should  be very sure that abolishing or amending the filibuster will come back  to haunt them. That is simply the way of things. They only have to look  back at Democrats' decision to abolish the filibuster for judicial  nominations.   I think I can speak for most of my Democrat colleagues when I say  that it came back to haunt them and probably sooner than they expected.  More than one Democrat, faced with President Trump's judicial nominees  and his Supreme Court appointments, openly regretted their party having  abolished the judicial filibuster. I would urge my Democrat colleagues  to remember that.   And I would urge them to remember that if they regret having  abolished the judicial filibuster, they are likely to regret abolishing  the legislative filibuster even more.   I would also urge them to remember that they barely have a majority  now, and that even the strongest majorities eventually end up back in  the minority. Sooner or later, abolishing or amending the legislative  filibuster will come back to haunt them.   I get that my Democrat colleagues want to accomplish big things.  Well, I would just like to remind them that it is possible to  accomplish big things in a bipartisan fashion. I know, because we did  it at the Commerce Committee when I was the committee chair, but it  does require a real willingness to compromise and an acceptance of the  fact that the Senate is not designed to let a narrow majority  unilaterally impose its will.   Finally, I urge my Democrat colleagues to think about what abolishing  the filibuster would mean for ordinary Americans. Of course, it would  mean decreased representation for any Americans whose party was a  minority, but it would also mean highly unstable government policy and  a resulting lack of confidence in government as well as a sharp  increase in partisanship, which, I venture to say, is not what we need  around here right now.   In his discussion of the importance of the Senate as a stabilizing  body, the author of Federalist 62 notes that ``a continual change even  of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence, and every  prospect of success. . . . In the first place, it forfeits the respect  and confidence of other nations, and all the advantages connected with  national character. . . . The internal effects of a mutable policy are  still more calamitous. It poisons the blessing of liberty itself. It  will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of  their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be  read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be  repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such  incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can  guess what it will be to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of action;  but how can that be a rule, which is little known, and less fixed?''   Abolish the filibuster, and we will end up in exactly the situation  the author of Federalist 62 feared--with an inconsistent and ever- changing set of laws.   An all-Democrat government will quickly push through whatever  measures it judges to be the best, and an all-Republican government,  when it takes power, will do the same.   And again, neither party should be so arrogant as to think that the  opposing party will never again gain control of government. The  government was in unified Republican hands just 3 years ago; today, it  is narrowly in Democrat hands, and it will continue to shift.   Abolish the filibuster, and policy will shift sharply with it: social  policy on abortion, religious freedom, and other issues; regulatory  policy; tax policy; foreign policy, and the list goes on.   In short, to quote Federalist 62, the laws would ``undergo such  incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can  guess what it will be to-morrow.''   And such incessant changes of national policy would unquestionably  heighten partisanship in this country.   As the laws became more extreme, the tension between Republicans and  Democrats, conservatives and liberals, would only heighten--here in  Congress, yes, but, most importantly, throughout the country among  ordinary Americans.   Our government would no longer be perceived as government of the  people and for the people. It would now be perceived as government of  and for Democrat Americans or Republican Americans, depending on the  party in power.   Democrats may think that some of the bills that they are advancing  will serve the American people.   Well, something else that will serve the American people is  moderation and predictability in our government, and that is something  that we will lose if we turn the Senate into the House of  Representatives and abolish protection for minority rights.  [[Page S32]]    When Republicans were repeatedly faced with the prospect of  abolishing the legislative filibuster during the previous  administration, we said no, not because there wasn't important  legislation we wanted to pass but because we knew that the best thing  for our country and for our future representation in the Senate was to  preserve this essential protection for the minority.   I urge my Democratic colleagues to think of their future and our  country and make the same decision.   I yield the floor.
