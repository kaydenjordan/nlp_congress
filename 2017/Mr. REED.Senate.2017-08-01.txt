 Mr. President, we know that the quality of teachers and  principals are two of the most important in-school factors related to  student achievement. Yet the pipeline into the profession has been  neglected. If we want to improve our schools, it is essential that we  invest in the professional preparation of teachers, principals, and  other educators. As such, today, I am reintroducing the Educator  Preparation Reform Act with my colleagues Senators Casey and Coons to  ensure that the Federal government continues to be a partner in  addressing this critical national need.   Today, we are facing a crisis in education. According to a research  brief from the Learning Policy Institute, we have seen dramatic  declines in enrollment in teacher preparation programs--an estimated 35  percent decline between 2009 and 2014. We also continue to see high  rates of attrition among educators. If these trends continue, there  will be an estimated gap of more than 100,000 between the number of  teaching positions open and the number of teachers available to be  hired annually through 2025.   The impact of these shortages falls the hardest on our most  vulnerable students in our highest need communities. Rhode Island is no  exception. Providence, our largest school district, is facing an acute  shortage of teachers certified to teach English language learners. My  home State has also reported shortages in special education, science,  math, and school nurses.   We cannot solve this problem without improving both teacher and  principal preparation. We need to make sure that our educator  preparation programs are worthy of the professionals entering the field  and the students they will serve. That is why it is more urgent than  ever that we enact the Educator Preparation Reform Act.   Our legislation builds on the success of the Teacher Quality  Partnership Program, which I helped author in the 1998 reauthorization  of the Higher Education Act. It continues the partnership between high  need school districts, institutions of higher education, and educator  preparation programs to reform pre-service programs based on the unique  needs of the partners. Among the key changes are specific attention and  emphasis on principals and the addition of a residency program for new  principals. Improving instruction is a team effort, with principals at  the helm. This bill better connects teacher preparation with principal  preparation. The Educator Preparation Reform Act will also allow  partnerships to develop preparation programs for other areas of  instructional need, such as for school librarians, counselors, or other  academic support professionals.   The bill streamlines the accountability and reporting requirements  for  [[Page S4672]]  teacher preparation programs to provide greater transparency on key  quality measures such as admissions standards, requirements for  clinical practice, placement of graduates, retention in the field of  teaching, and teacher performance, including student-learning outcomes.  All programs--whether traditional or alternative routes to  certification--will report on the same measures.   Under our legislation, States will be required to identify at-risk  and low-performing programs and provide them with technical assistance  and a timeline for improvement. States would be encouraged to close  programs that do not improve.   We have been fortunate to work with many stakeholders on this  legislation. Organizations that have endorsed the Educator Preparation  Reform Act include: the American Association of Colleges for Teacher  Education, American Association of State Colleges and Universities,  Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, Council for Christian  Colleges and Universities, Higher Education Consortium for Special  Education, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National  Association of Elementary School Principals, National Association of  Secondary School Principals, National Association of State Directors of  Special Education, National Disability Rights Network, National Network  of State Teachers of the Year, Public Advocacy for Kids, Rural School  and Community Trust, and the Teacher Education Division of the Council  for Exceptional Children.   I look forward to working to incorporate this legislation into the  upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I urge my  colleagues to join us in this effort and support this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we know that the quality of teachers and  principals are two of the most important in-school factors related to  student achievement.
