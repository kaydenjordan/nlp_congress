 Incredibly powerful winds, good sir. Yes,  sir.    I thank my friend, the gentleman, for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today simply to remind America of southwest  Louisiana's plight in the wake of Hurricane Laura. While the national  media and much of America has moved on, I will not allow the people of  Louisiana to be forgotten here in Congress.   Just 2 weeks ago, my district witnessed the most powerful hurricane  in our State's modern history, sustained winds above 150-miles-per- hour, a storm surge over 10 feet, a catastrophic loss across much of  the State.   Thousands of families have been displaced. Many are still without  power, without water, without access to the internet, without  sanitation. Virtually all infrastructure, public and private, was  heavily damaged.   Behind me are images from my district. These are not isolated  examples. This is every street, every neighborhood, and every business  across two entire parishes of southwest Louisiana and beyond.   I am grateful to President Trump for his quick response. He was on  the ground just as soon as we could safely land Air Force One. I am  grateful for his response and his strong commitment.   I am so thankful for the outpouring of support from faith-based and  charitable organizations and from the countless first responders and  volunteers who are working tirelessly to help Louisiana recover.    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues in Congress  should provide, as I was saying, every necessary Federal resource. We  must do everything in our power to ensure that southwest Louisiana is  not forgotten as we work through the long and difficult recovery.   I have seen firsthand the best of Louisiana, neighbors helping  neighbors, communities coming together to rebuild and recover.   It is what Louisiana does. We stand back up. Our people are  resilient. We will rebuild.   Louisiana, stand strong. You are not alone. You are loved. You are  respected. You will never be forgotten. We stand with you as one  through this recovery.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I  thank you, Mr. Speaker, for recognizing me.   My friend and colleague is discussing the deterioration of  traditional American values in our Nation this evening, and I think it  is appropriate that we as a nation take pause and reflect upon our own  lives, our own families and our histories, the traditions and cultures  which we represent, the men and women we strive to be as we seek, from  bended knee, the very deepest part of ourselves, the whisper of our  Lord Himself within us, His spirit that dwells there, to seek perhaps  the best part of us, the undiscovered and sometimes difficult-to- recognize truth that He has placed within our breast.   During the course of my life--I am 59 years old. I was born in 1961,  the seventh of eight children. I have witnessed the deterioration of  traditional American values.   As a failed and fallen man, arisen myself, redeemed by the blood of  our Lord and savior, I have contributed to the demise and deterioration  of our society in my small part. I struggle as a man.   Our journey, if you will, is to recognize that we are imperfect and  to seek that perfection, for our Nation itself was founded by imperfect  men who were driven by perfect intent.   The founding words of our original documents include, ``in order to  form a more perfect Union.'' This is a very humble statement by men of  wisdom and great stature of spirit. ``In order to form a more perfect  Union'' are words that recognize that we are imperfect men.   Therefore, during this time, this era of turmoil and tribulation and  violence and mob rule, great division--included amongst that division  is this Chamber--I think it is appropriate that my friend, that my  brother brings this to the focus of the Nation today.   Growing up in high school in the seventies, attended high school in  the seventies, every vehicle in the parking lot, a country school, had  a rifle or a shotgun in the back glass, maybe a pistol under the seat,  maybe all three. We didn't have school shootings.   When I began college in 1979 at LSU, I began to work my way through  college as a carpenter. The company I worked for, we did historical  renovations. In order to qualify, Mr. Speaker and my friend, for the  historical plaque for that renovation, a certain process had to be  followed. We had to determine the original structure of that residence.  You could tell by the nature of the cut, whether it was a power cut or  hand cut, how old it was; and with careful review and knowledgeable  eyes, you knew exactly how that home was originally built. This is what  fascinated me as a young man beginning college and working hard with my  hands with the skills my father had taught me.    Do you know what these houses built 100 years ago in the middle of a  large city, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, do you know what they didn't have,  Mr. Speaker and my friend?   I will answer that question to observe the rules of the House.   Do you know what those houses did not have 100 years ago? Locks. They  had no locks.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I ask us all to reflect on what happened to that  country. What happened to the country that was bequeathed unto us, a  country where the parking lots of high schools were filled with  vehicles with weapons and we had no school shootings, a country where  homes were built in cities with no locks? What happened to that  country?   I am prayerful that the answer to what happened to that country lies,  as it always has, deep within us as men and women, as children of God.  And we must seek, as a nation and within this Chamber, by this body, we  must seek the guidance of our savior, His whisper deep to guide us  through these troubling times.   I am thankful for men and leaders like my friend Representative  Arrington, who has, by the grace of God, brought this topic to the  floor today, and I am humbled that he would allow me to rise unscripted  and address my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the American  people, whom I love.   Let us return to the civility, love, and respect that founded our  Nation, for therein is born courage and the will to move forward  through any challenge.
