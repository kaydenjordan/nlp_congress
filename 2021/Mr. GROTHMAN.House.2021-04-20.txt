 Mr. Speaker, I would like to address what I think is  the biggest crisis to our sovereignty since I have been here, and that  is what is going on at the border.   It is hard to think of something new to say, but I want to point out  as we pursue an open borders policy that it greatly increases the power  of the Mexican cartels.   Because the Mexican cartels have a monopoly on letting people in this  country, I heard a story of two people who weren't part of the cartels  trying to sneak people across. Two of them were skinned alive, and a  third one was partially skinned and sent back to say: This is what  happens if you try to push people across without going through the  cartels.   I want to point out an anecdote of a father and a, perhaps, 7-year- old girl who were murdered for trying to come across without the  approval of the cartels.   I would like to address the 70,000 people who died from illegal drugs  this year. I was recently at the Milwaukee DEA, and I was told last  year 540 people in Milwaukee County died of illegal drug use, and the  local agents suspected that all 540 were killed by drugs or ingredients  from drugs that came across the Mexican border.   Please, President Biden, do something about the crisis on the border.
