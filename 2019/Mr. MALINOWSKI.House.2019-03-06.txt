 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1.   When I was running for Congress, I heard again and again that  Americans are losing faith in their government, asking why the votes  they cast don't lead to the outcomes they want.   At a time when we are so divided, I can think of nothing more  unifying than a bill that addresses the source of their discontent.   To those who have raised concerns about H.R. 1 here, let me say that,  in my district, I have not met a single person, Republican or Democrat,  who thinks it is a good idea to let nondonors spend millions of  untraceable dollars on political attack ads or to have a campaign  finance system so opaque that Russian oligarchs can easily channel  money into it.   I haven't met a single person, Republican or Democrat, who thinks it  is  [[Page H2379]]  just fine for Members of Congress to serve on corporate boards or for  Presidents to hide their tax returns, or anyone who is pleased with  partisan gerrymandering or who is happy that we have done nothing to  secure our elections from foreign hacking since 2016.   These are not partisan issues among the American people. On the  contrary, when I vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1, I will be doing what the vast  majority of my constituents are demanding: to make our democracy work  better for everyone, regardless of our party or our point of view.   I can't wait to cast that vote.                            ____________________
