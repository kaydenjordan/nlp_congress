 Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate confirmed former  Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue to lead the Department of Agriculture.   We also took the next step in advancing Rod Rosenstein to serve as  Deputy Attorney General. I look forward to confirming Mr. Rosenstein so  he can get to work without further delay.   After we take that vote, we will be able to advance the Department of  Labor nominee, Alexander Acosta. Mr. Acosta has an impressive  background that will serve him well as he leads the Department on  issues that can support America's employers and employees as well as  the overall economy.   I am pleased Mr. Acosta has outlined his commitment to ensuring that  the Department of Labor encourages, rather than hampers, job growth--a  welcome change after 8 years of job-killing and opportunity-destroying  rules and regulations under the Obama administration. I encourage my  colleagues to support his nomination so he can begin this important  work to help create jobs, enhance workforce development, and support  middle-class workers.   As we advance these nominees, Senators are also continuing  discussions on government funding legislation. These talks have been  part of a bipartisan, bicameral process from the start, with  appropriators having continued negotiations over the State work period.  I look forward to more productive conversations with Senators, our  House colleagues, and the White House so we can get this important work  done quite soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, many decades ago, historic tragedy  befell a continent, and unimaginable horror visited a people.   Behind cold steel gates and within huddled boxcars, man's capacity  for cruelty reached grim new frontiers. An inhuman campaign of  extermination by an inhuman regime not only took aim at the Jewish  people but also tore deep at the collective bonds of our humanity. The  scars of the Holocaust continue to run deep in the sinew of our history  and of our humanity. It must never be repeated. It also must never be  forgotten.   Today, the President of the strongest Nation in the world will again  join with survivors in the Capitol Rotunda to help ensure it never is.   Today's Days of Remembrance ceremony serves as yet another reminder  of the immeasurable suffering that was inflicted upon millions of  innocent men, women, and children during the Holocaust, especially the  Jewish people. It also serves as a reminder of our responsibility as  free people to stand against evil and defend those who are persecuted.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, this is one of those days I never look  forward to. In my time in the Senate, I have had a lot of outstanding  chiefs of staff. It is a pretty impressive group of men and women who  have been in that position with me over the years--none more impressive  than the person who, unfortunately, I have to say goodbye to today.   I am here today to pay tribute to Brian McGuire, the chief of staff  in my personal office, who is going to be leaving after well over 10  years of service in several different capacities but over the last few  years as my personal office chief of staff. He is really a uniquely  gifted person. He is one of the most skilled writers I have ever  encountered and, in fact, in my career, the most skilled writer I ever  encountered. But in addition to that, he is good at a whole lot of  other things, too, as I will subsequently describe in my remarks.   As I think back about the chiefs of staff I have fortunately been  lucky enough to have, none has been better at so many different things  than Brian McGuire. I always hate to see these talented people go, but  we know the best way for each of us to operate is to do what is in our  own best interests. Of course, he has reached the point where he has a  big family. There are more lucrative alternatives out there--maybe not  as much fun and not as meaningful as daily life around here but  important to making sure our families are taken care of.   It is hard to know really where to begin with Brian. He came to my  office in 2007. It was a critical time. I had just been elected Senate  Republican leader. We were not in the majority, but I had just been  elected to this position. There was a lot of pressure to get things  right.   Obviously, I was setting up a new staff in the leadership office. I  wanted the best I could find. When we set out to hire a speechwriter, I  certainly wasn't envisioning an upstate New Yorker with a master's in  philosophy and a resume that included stints at HUD and the Schenectady  Daily Gazette. From HUD to the Schenectady Daily Gazette and a guy from  Albany, NY--not exactly what I had envisioned, but that was Brian  McGuire, and he quickly proved himself in that role. That wouldn't  surprise anyone who knows Brian. He is, as I said earlier, a skilled  writer. He is bright. He is talented. He is guided by faith and his  family. He is also the consummate professional, going above and beyond  each and every time, no matter what the challenge, and we have plenty  of them. As the years went by, there would be many different  challenging situations--communications challenges, policy challenges,  political challenges--but whatever the issue, Brian always rose to the  moment.   After the 2014 election, when I became majority leader, I asked Brian  to leave speechwriting behind and become the chief of staff in my  personal office. He agreed, fortunately. He took to his new opportunity  to serve the people of Kentucky with similar skill and always good  humor.   These days, you would be forgiven for thinking Brian had spent his  formative years in Albany, KY, rather than Albany, NY. He is an  adaptable guy. He led my office in pressing the Commonwealth's  priorities on issues as diverse as industrial hemp, clean coal  technology, and the fight against heroin and opioid abuse. So we can  see the versatility, from a skilled writer from New York, of all  places, to an effective advocate for Kentucky and Kentucky's interests.   Brian will be ably succeeded by another impressive individual, Phil  Maxson, a Kentucky native who I know will continue Brian's legacy of  service to Kentucky and who will serve with similar distinction.   Brian McGuire probably never imagined he would find himself here.  Like me, he grew up dreaming of a career in the Major Leagues. As he  put it, though, you can either hit the fastball or you can't. And since  neither of us could, we ended up here. But Brian is more than just  another power hitter; he, like his idol growing up, the Mets' Keith  Hernandez, is an all-star. Brian is an indispensable utility player who  can play every position, and I am not sure what I would have done  without him. He is also one of the most interesting guys you will meet.  Brian has a great sense of humor and a rather infamous reputation for  spot-on impressions. He is probably the only one around here who holds  Keith Hernandez and Aristotle in similar reverence and can reference  each with similar ease.   At his core, though, Brian is incredibly grounded. He is all about  the things that really matter--his Catholic faith, his two beautiful  children, Stella and Max, and his wonderful wife Ashley. Ashley, I am  happy to say, is due with their third child next month--just in time  for Mother's Day. So Brian has a lot to look forward to as he climbs  the next mountain. I hope he takes some time to look back and reflect  on all he has accomplished here in his time with us.   Let me say again that Brian McGuire, on so many different occasions,  has made me look so much better than I am. I could never thank him  enough for the enormous contribution he made not only to my career but  to Kentucky and to the Nation. So it won't surprise my colleagues to  know I am going to miss Brian McGuire a lot.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
