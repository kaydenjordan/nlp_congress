 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Kentucky for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, look, I am pleased that Democrats here are upset about  what has happened to the post office. My regret is, you didn't get  upset during the Obama administration when they were shutting down our  post offices, not just getting rid of 12,000 mailboxes, shutting down  processing centers. In my district, when they shut down the Overton  processing center, it meant mail going from Tyler to Longview, or vice  versa, went to Dallas then to Shreveport and back.   The Deputy Attorney General came to my office--I had been demanding a  meeting with the Postmaster General--  [[Page H4290]]  but, oh, no. No time for that. They had no decency. They tried to say  390 miles would be cheaper and quicker than going 30 miles.   It is an outrage what the Obama administration did, including their  Postmaster General, who was in office until June 15 of this year.   Wake up. Let's complain about the post office during the Obama years.
