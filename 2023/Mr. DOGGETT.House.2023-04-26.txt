 Mr. Speaker, I oppose this Republican ``Default on  America'' act because it will create more deficits for millions of  Americans. It will create an educational opportunity deficit for the  students that are relying on Pell grants, seeing them slashed, and  their hope for debt forgiveness dashed. It would create an educational  opportunity deficit for the children that are denied preschool.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On April 26, 2023, on page H2027, in the second column, the  following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I oppose this  Republican default on America act      The online version has been corrected to read:  Mr.  Speaker, I oppose this Republican ``Default on America'' act    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Though our Central Texas Food Bank is already overwhelmed, another  deficit would mean more hunger. Rent assistance would also be cut for  40,000 Texans, as we have an affordability crisis.   Perhaps the biggest deficit of all out of this bill, their failure to  address the climate crisis. Once merely ignoring science as climate  deniers, they have now become destroyers of even the most modest  measures Democrats took to address the climate crisis and incentivize  renewable energy, create new jobs, and lower energy costs. Instead,  they promote more fossil fuels and more fossilized thinking.   For the health of Americans, the health of our economy, and the  health of our planet, reject this fraudulent bill.
