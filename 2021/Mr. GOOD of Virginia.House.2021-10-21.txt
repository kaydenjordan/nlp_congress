 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the leadership  and perseverance of Appomattox County High School coach, Doug Smith.   Doug Smith has led the Appomattox Raiders football team since 2012.  Under his leadership, the team has boasted a 32-game winning streak,  and won State championship titles in 2015, 2016, and 2017. While Coach  Smith's record is amazing, his leadership extends well beyond the  field.   Coach Smith has truly united the community behind their team, as  evidenced by the large groups on Friday nights. One cannot visit  Appomattox County without seeing the impact Coach Smith has made on his  students, his coworkers, and the community at large.   Modeling by example, he has taught his student athletes to be  productive citizens, such as when the team famously came out in full  force to help those affected by the devastating tornado that hit  Appomattox in 2016.   However, Coach Smith is best known for his relationship with Jesus  Christ, his eternal perspective, and his focus on those things that  matter more than football. This has been most clearly displayed since  the fall of 2020, as Coach Smith has faced a great personal challenge  of his own with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma  cells.   He has been a tremendous testimony through this journey. Thankfully,  it appears that the Lord has him on the road to recovery. My continued  prayers are with Coach Smith as he continues to fight this terrible  disease.   I thank Coach Smith for his commitment to service and leadership.  Coach Smith is an inspiration to us all about the importance of serving  others, even through personal challenges.   Commemorating Sailors and Marines aboard USS ``Forrestal'' on July 29,                                    1967     Madam Speaker, I rise to remember and express  gratitude to the brave sailors and marines who were wounded or lost  their lives fighting the catastrophic fire aboard the ship, the USS  Forrestal.   July 29, 2021, marked the 54th anniversary of one of the most tragic  fires in U.S. naval history. On July 29, 1967, the USS Forrestal, which  was supporting combat operations off the coast of Vietnam, was impacted  by an accidental rocket that ignited a fire and triggered several bomb  explosions on the flight deck.   Sailors and marines on board, including several Virginians, bravely  fought the fire for 18 hours. Despite the courageous efforts of the  crew, 134 men died, 161 were wounded, and 21 aircraft were destroyed.  Sadly, veterans wounded that day are still fighting their claims with  the VA, such as my constituent, Mr. David Cephas Smith, of Vinton,  Virginia. These heroes were not awarded the Purple Heart because their  wounds did not occur during enemy combat, but their bravery still  merits recognition.   We are forever grateful for the service of veterans, like Mr. Smith,  who were wounded or sacrificed their lives battling this fire aboard  the USS Forrestal.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice to identifying this as the worst  of the many crises created by this President. It is hard to identify,  with so many things going in the wrong direction in our country, what  is the worst crisis. But the absolute worst crisis we are facing is the  crisis of the illegal invasion at our southern border.   I submit that never in the history of the country has our own  President intentionally done more to harm the United States than this  President has done in the first 10 months of his administration.   Here we are on pace for over 2 million illegal aliens to cross our  southern border. We have had over 200,000 a month for some 2 or 3  months in a row. But the good news is, we are going to stop that  200,000 pace this month. We are expected to smash it by setting an all- time record, with 400,000 illegal crossings this month.                                time  1715    I have been to the southern border three times already in my first 10  months here in Congress, something that our President apparently has  never done, Mr. Speaker, been to the southern border, and something our  Vice President apparently has never done, been to the southern border.   I have been there to meet with ranchers, local law enforcement, folks  who live at the border, and the Border Patrol, who are living every day  with what is happening at our southern border.   Everything and everyone that crosses the southern border does so  under the control of the Mexican cartels. There is no compassionate  piece to our border situation, our immigration policy at our southern  border, when you have drug trafficking, human trafficking, child  trafficking, sex trafficking. People are coming through all kinds of  terrible conditions across our border. They are making every town a  border town, every city a border town, every State a border State.   I was there to witness illegals being placed on planes as we flew  back from McAllen, Texas. They were being flown wherever they wanted  around the country.   When my colleague from Illinois asked the lady beside her to show her  the paperwork from DHS, it said: You have to report at a date to be  determined in Miami; we will get back in touch with you and have you  report to a court date. No specific time, no specific way in how we are  going to get control of that person.   Get used to, American people, what we are seeing from the Haitian  crisis at the border. The 15,000, 25,000 that assembled most recently,  they are not being stopped, not sent home, but distributed into the  interior of our country.   Now we find out they are even flying them during the night to places  around the country at taxpayer expense. They are not trying to fix it.  They are trying to hide it from the American people. They are  willfully, intentionally, purposefully facilitating this invasion of  our southern border.   You have to ask why. Why is this happening? Why would an  administration, why would a majority party, the Democrat Party, support  this invasion of our southern border? No borders.  [[Page H5776]]    Why would they intentionally stop the already-funded completion of  the southern border wall? Just because it was started by the previous  President? Why would we pay contractors not to complete the wall? Why  would we allow hundreds of thousands a month to come across our border  unvetted? Whether it is because of a health issue or a criminal  background, or whatever the reason is, why would they allow that to  continue to happen?   In the short run, it is because it is Democrat voters. In the long  run, it is because they don't believe in American exceptionalism. They  don't believe it is worth preserving the culture of our country, and  they want to change our country to look like socialist Europe.
