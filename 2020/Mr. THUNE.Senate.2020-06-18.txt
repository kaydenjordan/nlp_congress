(3) Tribal considerations.--In distributing amounts under       this subsection, the Commission shall consider the broadband       internet access service needs of residents of Tribal lands       (as defined in section 54.400 of title 47, Code of Federal       Regulations, or any successor regulation).

(ii) Rule of construction.--Nothing in clause (i) shall be       construed to prohibit the Commission from using amounts made       available under subsection (d) to supplement the provision of       support under the high-cost programs, as authorized under       paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection.
