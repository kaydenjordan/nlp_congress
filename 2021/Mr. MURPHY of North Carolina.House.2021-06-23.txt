 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of the Hyde amendment and stand to denounce President Biden's  budget that proposes the most radical pro-abortion budget in decades.   For nearly 45 years, the Hyde amendment has saved millions of lives  by ensuring no taxpayer dollars are appropriated to support abortion  services. This amendment has been included in every single government  funding bill with widespread support since 1976. Even President Biden  himself voted in favor of the amendment for decades.   What has changed? Who is running the show at the White House?   The Democrats love to talk about the big lie. The biggest lie in the  country right now is President Biden's promise to be bipartisan.   The good people of eastern North Carolina do not want their hard- earned tax dollars paying for abortions, like done with Planned  Parenthood. We must put faith and family back in the center of our  lives and promote policies that support our innocent unborn.   I am a physician. Abortion is not healthcare. It is murder. The  Constitution is clear on our right to life, and the Hyde amendment  protects that. I believe the Hyde amendment should be included in every  budget.                            ____________________
