 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership and for yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, we simply must do more for pediatric cancer and the  children and families who are impacted by it. That is why I urge  adoption of S. 292. It is also H.R. 820. I would like to thank my  colleagues--Congressman McCaul, Congresswoman Speier, Congressman  Butterfield, and Congressman Kelly--for leading the charge on this. It  has broad bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I mostly want to thank the families and the parents  across America who have helped educate us--folks like Bonnie Woodworth;  her husband, Scott; and kids Joe, Delaney, and Piper--who have educated  me and  [[Page H4354]]  many policymakers across the Tampa Bay area. See, they lost their  daughter and sister, Tatum, in 2012 to pediatric cancer.   On behalf of so many families who often are held back by the pain of  losing a child or dealing with childhood cancer, they channeled their  energy into making things better for other families. They have educated  me and others, along with Mary Ann Massolio with the 1Voice Foundation,  back in the Tampa Bay area.   I am so happy that it is paying off today. What they have explained  is that, after you suffer this diagnosis, it is very isolating. America  doesn't do a lot of research on pediatric cancer. It is not coordinated  very well, and the resources just are not there to help bring families  together to get through these kinds of varied diagnoses.   The STAR Act hopefully will make things better because we are going  to ask the Centers for Disease Control to do more with States to track  pediatric cancer. We are going to do a little more research on how it  is best to care for survivors. We are going to try to endeavor to do  better in coordination of care for kids with pediatric cancer, do more  on research, and also, help folks in the minority community who often  don't have the resources dedicated to them that they need.   Hopefully this will bring great relief to the families, and I urge a  swift adoption.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  his leadership and for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, S. 204 is harmful legislation that offers a false hope  of access to investigational therapies and endangers patients who have  serious and life-threatening diseases. The bill establishes a dangerous  and unnecessary alternative pathway that is void of any FDA review or  oversight. It is opposed overwhelmingly by the patient community.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to the Speaker and  minority leader from 104 patient advocacy groups. It includes such  groups as the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the  American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation--all opposed  to this bill--the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and about 100 more.                                                      May 21, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      The Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The undersigned       organizations collectively represent millions of patients       with serious and life-threatening diseases. We write to       express our strong opposition to the Trickett Wendler, Frank       Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try       Act (S. 204).        On March 21st, The House of Representatives passed a       version of the Right to Try Act (H.R. 5247), that       incorporated important patient safeguards such as more robust       informed consent and public reporting requirements,       additional Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight, and       a narrower definition of eligibility for this pathway. The       Senate version does not include these safeguards and       therefore could greatly increase the likelihood of our       patients being harmed by unsafe and ineffective experimental       therapies. Therefore, this version is substantially worse for       patients.        We reiterate our concern with creating a secondary pathway       for accessing investigational therapies outside of clinical       trials. This pathway removes FDA approval and consultation       and would not increase access to promising therapies for our       patients because it does not address the primary barriers to       access.        FDA's expanded access program, though imperfect,       facilitates access to investigational therapies for over a       thousand patients facing serious and life-threatening       conditions each year. FDA repeatedly approves over 99 percent       of requests while sometimes making important dosing and       safety improvements to proposed expanded use. Conversely, it       is often times the pharmaceutical company that denies access       to its investigational therapy outside of its clinical trials       for any number of reasons.        The Senate version of the legislation is less safe than the       pathway proposed in the House version and is dangerous       compared to the current expanded access process. The Senate's       bill would allow unproven therapies to be given to patients       without FDA notification for up to a full year and would not       establish any standards for informed consent.        Additionally, both versions prohibit FDA from halting       access to these experimental therapies short of placing a       clinical hold on all clinical research on the therapy in       question. Both House and Senate versions would also remove       FDA's consultation on dosing, route of administration, dosing       schedule, and other important safety measures available under       FDA's current expanded access program.        While we did not support the recent House passed version of       this legislation, the House legislation includes improved       patient safeguards compared to the Senate version. The Senate       version would negatively impact patient safety substantially,       and our collective organizations are strongly opposed. We       appreciate past efforts in the House to consider stakeholder       perspectives and desire to continue the dialogue, but       returning to the Senate version is simply not the way       forward.

Mr. Speaker, this bill is a bill in search of  a problem. FDA has approved 99 percent of the expanded access requests  it receives. FDA's expanded access program approves nearly all requests  for investigational drugs or biologics it receives.   Physicians at the FDA are available 24 hours a day to approve any  emergency expanded access requests that the agency receives, and it  typically grants those emergency requests immediately over the phone  and nonemergency requests in a median time of 4 days and generally no  longer than 30 days. FDA has also taken actions to streamline this  entire process.   The process of clinical trials at FDA is vital to the protection of  the health of all of our neighbors and the folks we represent. In 11  percent of expanded access applications, FDA has raised a red flag and  said: Do you know what? You have got to change this.   That is who we are trying to protect here: the actual patients. The  patient groups across the country agree with us.   Many States have tinkered with right-to-try laws, but this is  different. Forty States have enacted right-to-try laws, but there is no  evidence that anyone has obtained the type of therapy via these laws  that couldn't have been obtained through the FDA's expanded access  program.   Right-to-try laws do not compel companies to provide patient access  to these treatments. Therefore, under these laws, patients still do not  have a right to try, only the right to request it from the company.   Sometimes those insurance companies will say: Do you know what? We  are not going to pay for it.   So that is going to be another barrier.   Mr. Speaker, in the end, these right-to-try laws put patients at  higher risk by prohibiting and weakening the FDA oversight, leaving our  neighbors on the hook to cover the cost of unproven treatments.   For all of these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill. Join with  the patient advocates across America, who, in this letter, called this  a dangerous proposal.
