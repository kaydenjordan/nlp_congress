 Madam Speaker, it certainly saddens me to have to  come call legislation harsh and cruel; for if there is anything that we  should do in a bipartisan or, frankly, nonpartisan manner, it should be  the complement to the Statue of Liberty, which, over the centuries, has  been the standard-bearer of the values and virtues of this Nation.   I am saddened that we have come to a point, having worked on the  Judiciary Committee with outstanding leaders like my ranking member, my  chairman, the subcommittee ranking, Ms. Lofgren, for many years on real  immigration reform, here we are today.   Let me tell you why I am opposed to this. It may be because I  represent Americans, Americans who are in the 18th Congressional  District in Texas. It may be because we are one of the most diverse  cities--my mayor says the most diverse city--in the Nation. It may be  that we have South Asians and Haitians. We have people from Eastern  Europe. We have those, of course, who are Latino. We have those from  the Caribbean, and Africans, and many, many more. We have those from  Europe.   Here is what this bill will do. It will quash any opportunity for mom  and dad to bring in extended family members, citizen mom and dad to  bring in their family members. It ends legal immigration and what we  have called the values of America, family reunification.   At the same time, the ugly name that has been given to diversity  visas is not true. Those who come through the diversity visa for small  countries--should we discriminate against small countries?--have the  highest level of education and go into medicine and science and try to  help.   Then there is no relief for DACA. People who are military,  paramedics, lawyers, teachers, we are dependent upon them, having grown  up here, loving this Nation, pledging to the flag, pledging to the  United States flag.   Then, finally, let me say that it is a sin and a shame that we have  such an administration.    Then, as we have not done anything for DACA, we have  not done anything for the children snatched away from their families,  the children that I saw for 2 days on the border at Texas--Roger, who I  held in my hands; maybe the 2-year-old like this--because what it does  is it does nothing to reunite the children. It does nothing, after 20  days, to be able to protect them, because the fake executive order does  not go beyond 20 days.   Frankly, we don't know where the 2,000 children are, and I know the  values of the faith community in America are to reunite. I am saddened  that we have this bill. I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for  yielding the time.   I would offer to say that those Guatemalan Americans, El Salvadoran  Americans, those Americans from the country of Mexico, and others who  serve in the United States military, certainly reflect the diversity of  this Nation.   I would offer to say that, sadly, this is the image that is America  today. It is not the Statue of Liberty. I stand to oppose this bill  because I know, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, we had  a plan that was bipartisan that would provide for border security that  included technology and barriers.   Now, we have succumbed to a process which every good-thinking person  has to oppose, including the business community. Law enforcement  opposes this legislation, in particular, because it makes communities  less safe.   Just this week a Texas sheriff's deputy was arrested for sexually  assaulting a 4-year-old girl and threatening to deport the undocumented  mother if she reported the claim. Good law enforcement officers  understand that they need to have people report the crime.   We know that it was an immigrant, a researcher, who helped us get the  polio vaccine.   Finally, young people who now are coming to this country, snatched  away from their parents, unaccompanied youngsters as well, will no  longer have the protections of the special immigrant juvenile status.  It strips crucial protections for abused, abandoned, and neglected  children by limiting their ability to access special immigrant juvenile  status.   This bill is a bad bill. It is not an immigration bill. It is a bad  bill and it really is not for the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition of H.R.  4760, the ``Securing America's Future Act of 2018.''   H.R. 4760 is a DREAM Killer Bill that fails to fix our nation's  fractured immigration system.   This bill slashes legal immigration, it cripples our agricultural  industry, criminalizes undocumented immigrants, undermines our public  safety, and denies critical protections for children and families.   H.R. 4760 withholds grants from communities implementing community  trust policies that limit law enforcement officials questioning an  individual's immigration status.   This Republican-sponsored bill forces local governments to comply  with Trump's mass deportation agenda, despite Republican's historic  demands that the federal government stay out of people's lives.   My colleagues and I will never vote in favor of a bill that  perpetuates the administration's mass deportation agenda, especially in  light of the human rights violations we are currently witnessing at our  U.S.-Mexico border.   When I visited the border this past weekend, what I witnessed was  horrific. It was not the America that I know and love.   Since early May, more than 2,300 children have been separated from  their parents.   By playing the blame game and putting the burden on Congress to fix  what President Trump alone has started, the Administration issued an  Executive Order yesterday that pretends to open the door for a halt of  his intentionally barbaric policy of separating families intended to  deter people from attempting to cross the border.   The new policy detains entire families together, including children,  but ignores legal time limits on the detention of minors.   The President is ignoring the immigration laws that set the precedent  on this arena.   The Flores Settlement, issued in 1997, was the result of a class  action lawsuit filed on behalf of immigrant children in the U.S.  District Court for the Central District of California.   It requires the government to release children from immigration  detention without unnecessary delay to parents, relatives, or those  willing to accept custody.   It also mandates that the government cannot keep children in  detention for over 20 days.   Trump's executive order is in direct violation of the Flores  agreement by allowing children to be detained for well-over 20 days.   H.R. 4760 is a politically motivated bill intended to spread the  false narrative that immigrants are criminals, liars, and job stealers  who are somehow a drain on our society and deserving of punishment.   Nothing could be further from the truth.   Many of our nation's most beloved and respected figures that are even  taught about in schools, were immigrants.   H.R. unfairly and unnecessarily subjects immigrants to lengthy  criminal sentences, as well as excessive detention and unreasonable  scrutiny.   The restrictive features of the bill--including asylum provisions,  cancelling the applications of 3 million people waiting to immigrate  legally, and permanent reductions in legal immigration--we are told are  a small price to pay to help Dreamers gain a pathway to citizenship.   However, this is not the case.   The CATO Institute recently reported that 82 percent of Dreamers  would not even benefit from this bill's citizenship path.   H.R. 4760 does not provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers;  instead, it denies Dreamers the coveted American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to H.R. 4760, the  ``Securing America's Future Act of 2018.''   This bill offers minimal protections for Dreamers in exchange for  implementing Trump's mass deportation plan.   It includes a litany of bad proposals from the House Judiciary  Committee.   It eliminates most family-based immigration categories, as well as  the diversity visa program.   It mandates the use of E-Verify on a nationwide basis, thereby  crippling industries such as agriculture, restaurants, hotels,  construction, and many others.   It purports to address concerns in the agricultural industry. But its  solution is to replace the 1 to 1.5 million undocumented farmworkers in  this country with an army of guest workers at drastically depressed  wages.   This would undermine the wages and working conditions on farms and a  host of other sectors (like forestry, logging, and food processing)  that employ many U.S. workers and have never been considered  agriculture.   It subjects each and every undocumented immigrant over the age of 18  to criminal prosecution by making it a crime to be here without  immigration status.   This would effectively turn most undocumented immigrants--including  the parents of the Dreamers the bill purports to help--into criminals  overnight.   It undermines our asylum system by establishing impossibly high  evidentiary burdens and denying asylum to those that travel through  ``so-called'' safe third countries.   It removes critical protections for unaccompanied children and  creates a scheme to swiftly remove them without an opportunity to see a  judge.   It also abolishes important child safety protections for children  traveling with their parents.   No Path to Citizenship: In exchange for all of the above, and much  more, the bill offers no path to citizenship.   Instead, it creates a renewable ``contingent nonimmigrant'' status  that would perpetually deny Dreamers the American Dream.   Dead on Arrival: We are only voting on this bill to appease members  of the House Freedom Caucus.   A similar bill offered by Senator Grassley only received 39 votes in  the Senate.   The bill is simply too extreme for many Republicans, as indicated by  letters of opposition from right-leaning groups such as the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, the Koch-brothers funded LIBRE Initiative, and the  CATO Institute.   Expands Family Separation: The Trump/Sessions zero-tolerance  prosecution policy is fueling the wave of family separation at the  border.   This bill doubles down on the use of criminal prosecution by making  unlawful presence a misdemeanor, or a felony under many circumstances.   This would exponentially increase family separation in the interior,  as it transforms non-violent, civil immigration violations into  criminal offenses.   The result would be the arrest, conviction, and detention of millions  of immigrants.   Harms Children: Republicans will likely argue that this bill treats  unaccompanied alien children (UACs) from Central American like those  from Mexico and therefore does nothing more than remedy a loophole in  the law.   But in fact, this bill removes basic protections for all UACs. Among  other things, the bill: removes protections for young children aged 13  and under, as well as children with disabilities; eliminates an  existing provision allowing limited government funding for counsel for  UACs, relegating many children to appear in immigration court without  legal representation; requires DHS to investigate and remove all  potential UAC sponsors. This would both disincentivize sponsors from  coming forward to claim children and overburden state foster care  systems:   eliminates the ability for all UACs to first present their asylum  claims to specially trained USCIS asylum officers in a non-adversarial  setting. UACs would instead be required to present their claims in open  court to an immigration judge, opposite a trained ICE trial lawyer, and  likely without legal representation; and   strips crucial protections for abused, abandoned and neglected  children by limiting their ability to access Special Immigrant Juvenile  status.   Makes Communities Less Safe: The bill withholds DHS grants and other  law enforcement grants from communities that implement community trust  policies that limit or restrict law enforcement questioning of an  individual's immigration status.   Although Republicans often demand that the federal government stay  out of people's lives, the bill forces local governments to cooperate  with Trump's mass deportation agenda.   Republicans have long sought to turn ``sanctuary cities'' into a  pejorative term, but studies show that such jurisdictions have  ``statistically significantly lower'' criminal activity compared to  other jurisdictions.   Law enforcement officials across the country oppose these provisions  because it would make their communities less safe.   For example, Latinos in three major cities have been reporting fewer  crimes since Trump took office, particularly as it relates to domestic  violence and sexual assault.   Just this week, a Texas sheriff's deputy was arrested for sexually  assaulting a 4-year-old girl and threatening to deport the undocumented  mother if she reported the crime.   If enacted, the bill would supercharge Trump's deportation agenda,  thereby turning undocumented immigrants into prey for criminals.   Destabilizes Agriculture: The bill mandates E-Verify use nationwide,  despite the reliance  [[Page H5432]]  on undocumented immigrants by several large sectors of the U.S.  economy.   To address labor concerns in agriculture and various other  industries, the bill creates a massive new guestworker program in which  undocumented farmworkers may purportedly participate.   But the bill's unrealistic and anti-worker provisions would have  devastating impacts on those workers, as well as similarly situated  U.S. workers and employers.   Among other things, the bill provides status to undocumented  farmworkers through a ``report to deport'' guestworker program that  requires them to first leave the country--including their homes and  families--with no assurance that they would be able to return.   Few would participate in such a program.   The guestworker program would eventually result in millions of  guestworkers in the country, and all would be paid at far-below market  wages.   This combination would have devastating impacts on the labor market-- not only in agriculture, but in other covered industries such as  logging, forestry, and food processing.   Given what Republicans often say about the need to protect U.S.  workers, we cannot see why they would support this bill.   Fails to Fix the Broken System: The bill fails to repair our  fundamentally broken immigration system.   H.R. 4760 is simply a politically motivated bill intended to  propagate the fiction that immigrants are criminals, liars, and job  stealers who are somehow a drain on our society and need to be  punished.   Nothing could be further from the truth. Immigrants generally play a  positive role in our society, and this bill unfairly and unnecessarily  subjects them to lengthy criminal sentences, as well as excessive  detention and unreasonable scrutiny.   Republicans have long championed their identity as the ``Party of  Lincoln,'' but this bill proves that they have clearly become the  ``Party of Trump.''   Trump champions nativist fear-mongering, relies on alternative facts,  and seeks to send America back to the dark ages of isolationism and  cultural in-fighting.   This is the wrong direction for our country.   Family Immigration Led To John Tu's Billion Dollar Company.   John Tu created wealth, shared that wealth with his employees and  demonstrated people can achieve the American Dream while also  fulfilling the dreams of others.   Immigrant entrepreneurs possess relatively few options for starting a  business and remaining in the United States.   There is no startup visa that allows individuals to receive permanent  residence specifically for starting a business.   Once someone acquires permanent residence (a green card) he or she  has the freedom to start a business in America.   That is why the stories we hear about successful foreign-born  entrepreneurs come almost exclusively from individuals sponsored by an  employer or family member.   John Tu is a great example of this.   John Tu (No. 87 on the Forbes 400 list) was born in China in 1941,  where he lived with his parents and sisters.   He describes himself as a mediocre student unable to attend the best  Chinese colleges.   He was denied a visa to the United States and instead applied to a  college in Germany, where in 1978 he earned a degree in electrical  engineering.   ``My dream of coming to the United States persisted,'' said John in  testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration.   He recalled visiting his sister, who was living in Boston.   She had come to America as a student and married a U.S. citizen born  in Taiwan. That trip reignited his dreams.   ``My experience brought me to the conclusion that in the U.S. one can  be anything he wants. I decided right then that I would find a way to  make my home in America.''   His sister, who became a U.S. citizen, sponsored John for immigration  through the immigrant preference category for the siblings of U.S.  citizens.   As someone willing to take a chance on a new country, it's not  surprising John Tu quickly became an entrepreneur.   He started a one-man gift shop in Arizona, where his sister had moved  to, and sold collectables imported from China.   A few years later, John ventured into commercial real estate,  eventually buying a condominium in Los Angeles.   In California, he met David Sun, his future business partner, who  also was born in China.   In 1982, John Tu and David Sun started a computer hardware company  called Camintonn Corporation.   They later sold the company to AST Research, with each man earning  about $1 million.   But a year later, John and David lost almost everything.   Their broker, a trusted friend, invested poorly, which caused their  savings to be nearly wiped out in the October 1987 stock market crash.   John Tu and David Sun picked themselves up and did what entrepreneurs  do best--they started another business.   Their new company, Kingston Technology, sought to fill a niche in the  marketplace for computer memory products.   ``Kingston soon began developing memory products for a variety of PCs  and thriving beyond either of our expectations.   It is ironic that from the biggest financial failure came my most  successful venture,'' said John.   The company grew to over 500 U.S. employees and by 1996 was valued at  $1.5 billion.   Not surprisingly, this attracted the interest of buyers. That year,  John and David sold 80 percent of Kingston to Japan-based Softbank  Corp.   While the sale initially made news, it is what John Tu and David Sun  did with the proceeds that generated worldwide attention: The two men  set aside $100 million in profits from the sale and awarded bonuses to  their American employees, something virtually unheard.   In many cases, the bonuses ranged from $100,000 to $300,000.   This decision changed the lives of those working at Kingston,  allowing many to fund dreams for themselves and their children.   ``The bonus meant a great deal to the employees, for some it meant  ridding themselves of debt, for others a down payment on a house, and  for one person the opportunity to return to college and finish his  education,'' said Kingston employee Gary McDonald.   He decided to use the bonus money to fund schooling and assistance  for his four children, two of whom had special needs, including one  with autism.   ``Without the bonus it would have been much more of a financial  struggle,'' he said.   Fate intervened and in July 1999, for business reasons, Softbank  decided to sell its 80 percent share in Kingston back to John Tu and  David Sun for less than half of the original sale price.   Today, Kingston is ``the world's largest independent manufacturer of  memory products,'' according to the company.   Kingston employs more than 3,000 people around the world and  maintains its headquarters in Fountain Valley, California. It has  garnered a number of awards, including Fortune magazine's list of the  ``Best Companies to Work for in America.'' John and his company  Kingston contribute to many charitable causes.   An Immigrant And An Immigrant's Son Saved Americans From Polio.   Polio struck future presidents and poor children alike, becoming an  epidemic that consumed Americans throughout much of the 20th century.   Immigrant Albert Sabin and the son of an immigrant, Jonas Salk,  developed the vaccines that ended polio as a threat to Americans.   Neither Salk or Sabin--or their life-saving Polio vaccines--would  have been in America if not for family immigration.    ``Without Sabin and Salk, American children would continue to be  paralyzed for life by polio,'' Michel Zaffran, director of polio  eradication at the World Health Organization, said in an interview.  ``Their contribution is quite simply immeasurable.''   Americans today do not consider polio a threat. That was not always  the case.    ``No disease drew as much attention, or struck the same terror, as  polio,'' according to David Oshinsky, author of the Pulitzer  Prizewinning book Polio: An American Story.   ``Polio hit without warning. There was no way of telling who would  get it and who would be spared.   It killed some of its victims and marked others for life, leaving  behind vivid reminders for all to see: wheelchairs, crutches, leg  braces, breathing devices, deformed limbs.''   Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair throughout his  presidency, is the most famous victim of polio.   But at its approximate height, in 1949, around 40,000 cases were  reported in America, according to Oshinsky.   In San Angelo, Texas, one out of every 124 residents contracted the  disease, resulting in 24 deaths and 84 cases of permanent paralysis,  affecting mostly children.   Cases of polio first appeared in the U.S. in the 1800s.   The invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s allowed  researchers to see the virus that causes the polio infection, which is  spread through fecal waste, from one person to another, by hand, food,  water and other methods.   When Albert Sabin was born in Poland in 1906, Americans could not  have known this Polish infant would someday grow up and change their  lives.   ``When he was 15, his family came to the United States to escape the  murderous pogroms [against Jews] that erupted there following World War  I,'' according to David Oshinsky.   ``The Sabins settled in Paterson, New Jersey, an immigrant textile  center, where his father took a job as a weaver. Fluent in Polish and  German, but knowing no English, Sabin was tutored by a cousin who  encouraged him to avoid the dead-end life of the silk mills by getting  an education.''   Sabin did well in high school, while working to help support the  family, and accepted an offer from an uncle who offered to pay his  college tuition if he agreed to join him as a dentist.   Albert did not enjoy studying dentistry and lost his uncle's  financial support.  [[Page H5433]]    In a great example of mentoring, the well-regarded New York  University (NYU) professor William Hallock Park, a bacteriologist, saw  something in Sabin and arranged for a scholarship.    Mr. Speaker, we have a humanitarian crisis at our  borders.   A crisis initiated by an administration that purports to be the  champion of `family values' but whose actions do not value families.   Yesterday, after much deserved criticism and push back, President  Trump signed an executive order that modified his ``zero-tolerance''  policy by detaining parents and children apprehended by the U.S.  Customs and Border Protection together, possibly on military bases,  instead of separating them.   The executive order, however, is silent regarding where the families  would be detained  [[Page H5495]]  or whether children will continue to be separated from their parents  while the facilities to hold them are located or built.   We have so much work to do, because even in ending the heinous  practice of separating families, there are still many legal and  practical obstacles.   Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and  Families, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services,  initially stated that ``there will not be a grandfathering of existing  cases.''   Mr. Wolfe was later to be corrected by Brian Marriott, Senior  Director of Communications for the Department of Health and Human  Services, who stated that Mr. Wolfe had ``misspoke'' and insisted that  ``it is still very early, and we are awaiting further guidance on the  matter.''   Mr. Marriot then said that ``reunification is always the goal'' and  that the agency ``is working toward that'' for the children separated  from their families because of President Trump's policy.   While there is a possibility that the children could be connected  with other family members or sponsors living in the United States, it  is not necessarily the parent they were separated from at the border.   This raises the heart-breaking questions of what happens to the more  than 2,300 children who have already been separated from their parents  under the president's ``zero tolerance'' policy?   We have all heard the wailing of detained immigrant children on audio  tapes and we have all seen the heartbreaking pictures.   The latest reports suggest that very young infants, some as young as  3 months old, are being separated and being placed in ``tender age  shelters.''   This is outrageous.   This past weekend, I was at a processing center in McAllen, Texas and  the Southwest Key Programs' Casa Padre which houses 1,500 children,  most of them separated from their parents.   I saw people huddled in cages.   I saw children who certainly needed to be with their parents.   Like nine-month old baby Roger, who I held in my arms.   Or Leah, a one year old, separated from her grandmother and her  sister, whose love for her would have provided comfort and protection.   As the Founder and Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus and  as a parent and grandparent, this is unacceptable.   Studies have documented that when young children are forcibly removed  from their parents, the traumatic experience engenders long-term  negative effects on their physical and mental health and well-being  suffers.   In one famous experiment in Romania, doctors considered the results  later in life of those children separated from their parents.   The activity in the children's brains was much lower than expected.   ``If you think of the brain as a lightbulb,'' Charles Nelson, a  pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School said, ``it's as though  there was a dimmer that had reduced them from a 100-watt bulb to 30  watts.''   The children, who had been separated from their parents in their  first two years of life, scored significantly lower on IQ tests later  in life.   Their fight-or-flight response system appeared permanently broken.   Stressful situations that would usually prompt physiological  responses in other people--increased heart rate, sweaty palms--would  provoke nothing in the children.   The effects of these traumatic experiences--especially in children  who have already faced serious adversity--are unlikely to be short- lived, and can likely last a lifetime.   The stressed endured by a child in custody is exacerbated when the  child does not speak a language that is not English or Spanish.   Although the government has a legal obligation to provide reasonable  language services to unaccompanied minors, many children arriving to  the U.S. speak indigenous languages and have little or no translation  assistance provided by the U.S. government.   The last time this nation had policies that promoted the forcible  separation of children from newly arrived persons was slavery: a dark  chapter in this nation's history that we should not revisit.   Today, the parents of these thousands of children will not be  deterred from finding ways to reunite with their children, even  reentering the United States under the threat of imprisonment.   It would be unconscionable to prosecute parents under these  circumstances.   The level of callousness displayed by this administration towards  those seeking refuge within our borders is shocking and the world is  taking note.   Yesterday, Theresa May, the Prime Minister of our closest ally Great  Britain, denounced the ``zero-tolerance'' policy on the floor of the  House of Commons.   His Holiness Pope Francis said the ``zero-tolerance'' policy is  contrary to Catholic values.   The Most Reverend Bishop Michael Curry stated that for Christians,  Jesus of Nazareth is the standard of conduct for your life--he tells  us--``love God and love thy neighbor.''   However, the Trump Administration has forgotten that.   The United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen  defended this egregious policy.   Attorney General Jeff Sessions used Romans 13 (submit to rulers) to  justify the ``zero-tolerance'' policy.   It is outrageous to use the Bible--Romans 13--to justify this policy.   However, many used Romans 13 to justify horrors in history such as  slavery and Nazism.   The more operative biblical passages should be, Matthew 7--the golden  rule--or Matthew 25--I was a stranger and you welcomed me (``least of  these'').   National policy regarding immigration legislation should not create  greater fear for families already traumatized by intolerable conditions  in their home countries.   U.S. immigration policy should not deter refugees from seeking asylum  within our borders.   I am thankful to the 60 members of the United States Senate of  Congress who said enough is enough to the despicable ``zero-tolerance''  policy.   I am thankful to the Republican governors of Maryland and  Massachusetts who ended their contribution of National Guard  deployments because they too are saying ``not in my name.''   But there is still more work to be done.   We should welcome mothers carrying their babies to a safe haven and  ensure the safety of their children.   The Trump administration is utterly failing in its basic duty to  treat all persons with dignity and compassion.   Rather, it is making a mockery of our national values and reputation  as a champion of human rights.   We are a great country with a long and noble tradition of providing  sanctuary to the persecuted and oppressed.   And it is in that spirit that we should act.   We can do it; after all, we are Americans.                            ____________________
