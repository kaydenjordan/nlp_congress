 Madam President, I rise today to talk about what is  really a ``once in a generation'' opportunity, and that is the  opportunity we have right now to reform our outmoded and complex Tax  Code and also, most importantly, to provide tax relief for our Nation's  families, farmers, and small businesses.   Our Tax Code has not been updated since 1986. When you think about  all that has changed over the last 30 years, you know that modern  advances in technology have drastically revolutionized the way business  is conducted. Today, the creation of the internet, substantially  increased automation, and instant communications have created dramatic  changes and in many ways have brought us closer in terms of  communication and have interconnected our global economy in ways we  never could have foreseen back in the 1980s, when we last reformed our  Tax Code.   So it is past time--not time but past time--to modernize our outdated  Tax Code to the 21st century. We must do so in order to ensure that  American businesses can compete on the global stage, while providing  tax relief to hard-working middle-class families who have been  struggling to get and stay ahead over the last decade.   The recently released tax blueprint proposes sweeping tax reforms  that will benefit working families and small businesses throughout the  country while promoting job creation, economic growth, and global  competitiveness. This country was built on hard work by individuals and  families who strive each and every day to make ends meet to provide for  their loved ones and to plan for retirement. The current Tax Code is  complex and has many loopholes that do nothing to help our hard-working  families keep more of their own hard-earned money. Our tax framework  will help individuals and families in my home State and across this  country to get ahead by generating new jobs through sustained economic  growth while lowering the overall tax burden and putting more money  back in the taxpayers' pockets.   We do this in a number of ways: by doubling the standard deduction,  by eliminating taxes on the first $12,000 earned by an individual and  $24,000 earned by a married couple, effectively establishing a zero- percent tax rate as the bottom bracket--the bottom tax rate. That means  that nearly 81 percent of North Dakotans who claim the standard  deduction could see a significant increase in their take-home pay. That  is true of other States across the country as well. Further, we are  consolidating and lowering the tax rates across the board while  simplifying the Tax Code to make it fairer for everybody.   At nearly 70,000 pages long, it is no wonder that Americans currently  spend 6 billion hours a year complying with the Tax Code. In fact, 94  percent of taxpayers choose either to pay someone else or to use  software to prepare their taxes because of the complexity of our Tax  Code. Our goal for tax reform is to allow the vast majority of  Americans to file their tax returns on a single page--a simple  calculation, something they can do themselves. We want to reduce the  cost and stress that many Americans feel during tax season.   Further, our tax framework aims to create greater opportunities for  small business owners, farmers, and others to help grow our economy and  be more competitive than ever before. While we focus on a business  friendly State in North Dakota--we have a very business friendly  climate--the Federal tax continues to place an undue burden on the  nearly 71,000 small businesses that operate in our State, which is more  than 95 percent of all of the employers in the State. Again, this is  something that applies across the Nation. The driver of our economy,  the backbone of our economy is small business. They are the job  generators. They are the job creators. We have to do more to help them  do what they do, which is to create jobs and to grow our economy.   The same applies to our family farmers. My State alone has more than  30,000 family farms and ranches. Their marginal tax rate can reach as  high as almost 45 percent, nearly twice the average rate of the rest of  the industrialized world. That creates real challenges. This tax  framework follows the example we have set in our State by restoring  economic opportunity, by lowering the tax burden, and by enacting a  pro-growth tax code.   Economists in general agree that high corporate taxes reduce wages to  workers, raise costs to consumers, and reduce returns on retirement  savings. That affects all of us. Maintaining high tax rates does  nothing to improve the fairness of our system. It only punishes  everyday citizens and reduces economic opportunities for all Americans.   For far too long, our Tax Code has incentivized American companies to  send jobs and investment overseas, instead of keeping them here at  home--keeping that investment, keeping those jobs here at home.  Consequently, large multinational corporations now hold approximately  $2.6 trillion overseas. That is money that could be repatriated back to  the United States for investment in American jobs here at home. Our  framework would end the loopholes and the incentives that keep foreign  profits offshore by moving to a territorial tax system and encouraging  repatriation of these offshore funds, bringing that investment back to  America. This is about getting the American economy going again and  creating jobs and opportunity here at home rather than overseas.   It is vital that we advance a comprehensive tax reform that  simplifies the IRS code and simplifies rates. Putting more money in the  pockets of working individuals and families and empowering private  investment will drive domestic job creation and increase wages through  higher demand for labor and lower business costs. All the while we can  ensure stable government revenues through a broader tax  [[Page S6341]]  base, a growing economy, and a more efficient tax system. That means  that we will continue to be able to fund our priorities as we work to  get our debt and deficit under control.   Ensuring U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace and providing  tax relief to middle-class families will benefit both current and  future generations. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  work together to get tax reform done for the people of my State of  North Dakota, for their respective States, and for Americans across  this entire country.   With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.    Mr. President, 75 years ago, on October 13, 1942,  the men of the 164th Infantry Regiment, North Dakota Army National  Guard, landed on Guadalcanal to make history as the first U.S. Army  unit to offensively engage the enemy in either theatre during World War  II.   The soldiers, supplies, and the rifles they carried were welcomed by  the beleaguered First Marine Division that had been fighting on the  island since August. The prize was the strategic airfield captured by  the marines and coveted by both Allies and the enemy as a key location  to champion air and naval superiority in that area of the South  Pacific.   On Guadalcanal for only 12 days, the trained but untested soldiers  were thrust into the second battle for Henderson Field on the night of  October 24. The 3rd Battalion trudged up muddy slopes to fight shoulder  to shoulder with Lt. Col. Chesty Puller's marines as waves of Japanese  threatened the thin line protecting the airfield. The next day, having  proved its mettle, the 164th Infantry remained in charge of that line  as the marines moved to an adjacent location. The Japanese attacked the  164th sector on the night of October 26, incorrectly believing the new  Army troops could not hold the line. The 164th held firm at the  location that became known as the Battle of Coffin Corner, earning the  respect of the marines in the form of a Navy Presidential Unit  Citation.   The lineage of the 164th Infantry Regiment carries significant  history as North Dakota National Guard infantrymen were called to serve  in the Spanish American War, the Philippine Insurrection, Mexican  Border Incident, World War I, World War II, and the Korean war. The  regiment ceased to exist in 1955, its companies reorganized to engineer  units, but the esprit de corps of the combat soldiers has remained  intact.   On the 75th anniversary, to the day, of the regiment's landing at  Guadalcanal, the 164th Infantry Association will hold its last annual  reunion, ending a tradition that began in 1945. On Saturday, October  14, the 164th Association will host a public event to recognize the  service and heritage of the unit that was so important to the history  of the North Dakota Army National Guard, the State of North Dakota, and  the United States of America. Eight veterans of Guadalcanal will attend  this event, ages 94 to 98, and they will represent all members of the  regiment, living or remembered, as this important chapter of North  Dakota military history ends.                            ____________________
