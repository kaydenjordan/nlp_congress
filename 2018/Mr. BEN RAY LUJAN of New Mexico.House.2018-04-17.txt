 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a  great New Mexican and American hero, Sergeant First Class Roy Tachias  of Albuquerque, who is here with us today.   In 1950, Roy Tachias was deployed to Korea, where he saw fierce  combat. One night, Roy was ordered to mount a forward listening post.  That night, in darkness, he witnessed the Chinese Army approaching.  Alone, Roy began to shout, shoot, and throw grenades at the waves of  soldiers. This threw the enemy into disarray and stopped the attack.   By morning, Sergeant Tachias had single-handedly killed 33 enemy  soldiers and taken one prisoner. He earned the Silver Star for  conspicuous gallantry and heroism. Stars and Stripes called him the  ``One Man Army.'' Sergeant Tachias was wounded five times in Korea and  received the Purple Heart with a Bronze Star with valor.   After the war, Roy married and settled in California. He eventually  returned to the Army and served two tours in Vietnam, where his  leadership and bravery earned him another Bronze Star. In 1976, he  retired and returned home to New Mexico.   It is with great gratitude, pride, and respect that we recognize his  service today. New Mexico is humbled by his lifetime of service that  began on the Korean Peninsula in 1950, and has continued to inspire  those around him.                            ____________________
