 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of  National Gun Violence Survivors Week.   Every day in America, 103 people are killed by gun violence, and many  more survivors are left to deal with the lifelong trauma. This is  horrific and it demands action.   It is one of the reasons that last year the House Judiciary  Committee, on which I sit, as well as the House of Representatives,  passed for the first time in over a quarter century, significant gun  legislation. We passed universal background checks.   It is now before the Republican-controlled Senate, and I ask them to  simply do their jobs and put that bill up for a vote.   I am also grateful that last month, California's 33rd Congressional  District's Youth Advisory Council, which consists of high school  students in the area, got together to discuss ways to address the gun  violence epidemic.   At their recommendation, I am proud to lend my support to bills like  Ghost Guns Are Guns Act and Jaime's Law, both of which I believe will  protect American lives.                            ____________________
