 Madam Speaker, America's veterans are facing an  unemployment crisis that threatens their livelihoods. While this  current government focuses on giving jobs to illegal immigrants,  approximately half a million veterans are out of work as of March 2021.   Americans often talk about their love of our troops. As politicians,  we often take victory laps through our districts meeting veterans and  pledging to work for them. Now it is time for us to act on that pledge.  The THRIVE Act represents a commonsense step to empower both veterans  and educational institutions who provide much-needed workforce  training.   I come from a family of veterans. For six generations, the men of my  family have served their country proudly in the Armed Forces. I  represent the first generation to enter a different type of service.  While I cannot say I have experienced the trauma and sacrifice that our  men and women have experienced on the battlefield, I have witnessed the  brutally difficult task of transitioning back to the home front. If we,  as elected Representatives, can ease that process and reduce veteran  unemployment in one fell swoop, then I firmly believe that we are  obligated to do so.   The THRIVE Act would ensure that the additional authorities and  funding Congress provided for unemployed veterans work as intended to  help veterans in need to find good, well-paying jobs. Let's enable our  veterans to transition back into civilian life. Those who have given so  much to this Nation deserve nothing less.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                time  1430
