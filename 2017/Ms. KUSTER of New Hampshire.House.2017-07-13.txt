 Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for  passage of my three amendments to the National Defense Authorization  Act last night.   Two of my amendments would address our Nation's opioid crisis as it  impacts or Nation's servicemembers and veterans. They would direct the  Defense Department to study the effectiveness of their opioid  prescriber education policies and require Department providers to  counsel or give referrals to the VA for transitioning veterans that  suffer from addiction or chronic pain.   My third amendment would direct the Department of Defense to analyze  sexual coercion in the military as part of its annual report on sexual  assault.   While I commend the Department for their progress in reducing the  occurrence of sexual assault in the military, more work needs to be  done. Understanding sexual coercion is important to the safety of our  brave men and women, and important for our national security.                            ____________________
