 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, which  I proudly cosponsored.   Four years ago, my wife and I adopted a young child from an  orphanage. People say it changed his life. It changed ours.   This year, the theme of the March for Life is ``The Power of One,''  meaning that every single person can change the course of history if  given the chance to live. Every year, 1 million unborn babies are  stripped of the right to life, which our Declaration of Independence  calls unalienable.   Moreover, those opposed to abortion have been forced to violate their  consciences through taxpayer-funded abortions. This legislation will  reinforce a culture of life by making current prohibitions against  taxpayer-funded abortions permanent.   Madam Speaker, I stand in the spirit of ``The Power of One'' to give  voice to the voiceless, rights back to the unborn, and I urge passage  of this legislation.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on  each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Colorado has 14\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 3\1/2\ minutes  remaining.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin).   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)
