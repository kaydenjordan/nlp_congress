 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the  Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, I'd like to express my  support of H.R. 302 the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization  Act of 2018.   Maintaining the safety of our national airspace is paramount, and I  am pleased that the provision for Single-Piloted Commercial Cargo  Aircraft was removed. Additionally, this bill also highlights a strong  focus on airline passenger safety and consumer rights by emphasizing  provisions such as minimum legroom, seat width and flight attendant  rest mandates.   Finally, this legislation provides Hurricane Florence recovery  funding, which emphasizes the importance of providing timely assistance  to areas prone to natural disasters, similar to those in my home state  of Texas.   Above all, this bill improves the airline passenger experience,  provides long-term airport funding, improves disaster recovery, and  ultimately strengthens the U.S. economy and aviation workforce.
