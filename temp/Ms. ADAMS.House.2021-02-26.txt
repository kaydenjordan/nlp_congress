 Mr. Speaker, I raise my voice today to add my support for  the steps taken by the House Agriculture Committee under the leadership  of Chairman David Scott to include provisions in H.R. 1319, the  American Rescue Plan Act, to begin to correct the long and documented  history of USDA discrimination against producers of color.   The existence of this longstanding discrimination cannot be disputed.  Every year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture spends billions of  dollars in programmatic and direct support for American producers and  we know that those resources have, unfortunately, not been equitably  distributed due to discrimination. The provisions included in sections  1005 and 1006 of the American Rescue Plan Act are a tailored approach  towards correcting the wrongs felt by too many.   I am not alone in raising my voice and support for these provisions.  In addition to the support of many Members of the House Agriculture  Committee and of the 117th Congress, more than 200 organizations have  voiced their support for this language. Among those who have spoken out  in support of these provisions are:   Advance Carolina, Raleigh, NC; Advancing Collective Equity, Portland,  OR; African Alliance of Rhode Island, RI; Agri-Cultura Cooperative  Network, Albuquerque, NM; Agricultural Missions, Inc., New York, NY;  Agroecology Research-Action Collective, Oakland, CA; Alabama Rivers  Alliance, Birmingham, AL; Alabama State Association of Cooperatives,  Epes, AL; Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, Oxnard, CA; Alliance for the  Great Lakes, Chicago, IL; Alliance for the Shenandoah Valley, New  Market, VA; American Farmland Trust; American Federation of Government  Employees, Local 3354, Saint Louis, MO; American Sustainable Business  Council, Washington, DC; Amy's Kitchen; Atrisco Valley Farm LLC,  Albuquerque, NM; Bayer; Ben & Jerry's Homemade, Inc.; Black Family Land  Trust, Inc., Durham, NC; Black Farmers and Agriculturalists  Association, Tillery, NC; Black Farmers and Ranchers New Mexico,  Jerales, NM; Bolthouse Farms; Boulder County Farmers Markets, Boulder,  CO.
