 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas for all of his hard work here.   I just heard one of our colleagues over here suggest that somehow  Republicans are in favor of a government shutdown. No one desires a  government shutdown.   What we desire and what we are working towards is changing how  Washington works. That is the commitment that we made to the American  people. That is why they gave us the majority.   How do we do that? We have to change the decades of reckless spending  and corruption. We have to change the weaponization of the Federal  agencies that are designed to protect and serve the American people  instead of being used against them.   We have to change the opening of the borders that is destroying our  communities contributing to the rising crime wave.   We have to change the way that the Biden administration is  administering the economy.   We have to change the radical shift, the forced transition that they  are trying to push us into, this radical green energy transition. It is  nonsense.   The American people have had enough. They see the Democrat policies  destroying our economy, destroying our security, destroying opportunity  for their children and grandchildren.   We are taking a stand here. We are operating in good faith. We are  negotiating together for the best outcome for the people, and we do not  desire a shutdown.
