 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                         Japan--AEGIS Weapon System         The Government of Japan has requested to buy two (2) AEGIS       Weapon Systems (AWS), two (2) Multi-Mission Signal Processors       (MMSP) and two (2) Command and Control Processor (C2P)       Refreshes. Also included is radio navigation equipment, naval       ordnance, two (2) Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Systems,       Global Command and Control System-Maritime (GCCS-M) hardware,       and two (2) Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), U.S.       Government and contractor representatives' technical,       engineering and logistics support services, installation       support material, training, construction services for six (6)       vertical launch system launcher module enclosures,       communications equipment and associated spares, classified       and unclassified publications and software, and other related       elements of logistical and program support. The total       estimated program cost is $2.150 billion.        This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy       and national security of the United States by improving the       security of a major ally that is a force for political       stability and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region.       It is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Japan in       developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-      defense capability.        This proposed sale will provide the Government of Japan       with an enhanced capability against increasingly       sophisticated ballistic missile threats and create an       expanded, layered defense of its homeland. Japan, which       already has the AEGIS in its inventory, will have no       difficulty absorbing this system into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support does not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor for the Aegis Weapon System and Multi-      Mission Signal Processors will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and       Mission Systems, Washington, DC. The Command and Control       Processor Refresh will be provided by General Dynamics, Falls       Church, VA.        There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require annual       trips to Japan involving U.S. Government and contractor       representatives for technical reviews, support, and oversight       for approximately eight years.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-08       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1.

This sale consists of the modified J7 Foreign       Military Sales (FMS) baseline (AWS Baseline 9.C2 along with       Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) 5.1 capability). No       integrated Anti-Air Warfare capability will be provided. AWS       Software, documentation, combat system training and technical       services will be provided at the classification levels up to       and including SECRET within approved release and disclosure       guidelines. The manuals and technical documents are limited       to those necessary for operational use and organization       maintenance.        2. Hardware includes AWS Computing Infrastructure       Equipment, including Blade Processors, Fire Control System       (FCS) MK 99, Vertical Launching System (VLS) MK 41, combat       system support equipment, logistics support equipment, and       the Digital Signal Processing Group. The Digital Signal       Processing group will be derived from the Multi-Mission       Signal Processor and will be integrated with Lockheed       Martin's Solid State Radar (SSR) which is being procured by       Japan via Direct Commercial Sale contract. The Digital Signal       Processing Group will be capable of BMD mission only. The       hardware is UNCLASSIFIED.        3. The AN/UYQ-120(V) Command and Control Processor (C2P)       System is a Tactical  [[Page S766]]       Data Link (TDL) message distribution system that provides       real-time control and management of Tactical Digital Data       Links (TADILs) in support of all major surface ship and shore       Command, Control, and Communications (C3) systems. The C2P is       a follow-on Technical Refresh (TR) upgrade for the legacy AN/      UYQ-86(V) variants 1 through 7 of the Common Data Link       Management system (CDLMS). The AN/UYQ-120(V) C2PS has three       variants depending on the host site in which it is installed       and only uses trusted software. The highest classification of       the hardware and software to be exported is SECRET.       Identification and security classification of classified       equipment, major components, subsystems, software, technical       data, documentation, training devices and services to be       conveyed with the proposed sale.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary obtained       knowledge of the specific hardware or software in the       proposed sale, the information could be used to develop       counter-measures which might reduce weapons system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that Japan can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Japan.                            ____________________
