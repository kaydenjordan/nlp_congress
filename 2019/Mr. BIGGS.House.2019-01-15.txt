 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate all the  Members of the Arizona Legislature who took their oaths of office to  begin a new term this week.   The start of each legislative session is exciting: an opportunity to  keep promises made to constituents and make Arizona a better place to  work and raise a family.   As ever, legislators will face challenges that will impact millions  of Arizonans. I look forward to working with my former colleagues,  especially those in the east valley, for the benefit of our  constituents.   I recognize and give special congratulations to incoming Senate  President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers. I wish everyone in  the Arizona Legislature, including staff, a productive legislative  session in the months to come.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  organizing this.   To be honest with you, I really can't believe we still have to have  this conversation. The idea that the United States of America should  turn a blind eye to protecting its national borders violates one of the  few responsibilities enumerated to the Federal Government in the  Constitution, the one we just swore an oath to just a couple weeks ago,  to ensure the security of our Nation and provide for its defense. How  can anyone argue that we are safer as a nation by not having any idea  who is entering our country today?   Unlike many Members of Congress, I was born and raised in southern  Arizona, mere miles to the Mexican border, not too far away, an hour or  so drive. I have met with Border Patrol agents and ranchers who live in  the region several times alone recently. There is no other way to put  this: The situation on the American side of the border is dire and  equally as grave on the other side.   For 8 years under the Obama administration, the Federal Government  effectively told Americans that their safety and their sovereignty were  not important. They told Border Patrol and ICE agents that the jobs  they were doing were essentially pointless, because the Obama  administration was going to find as many ways as possible to prevent  further border security and circumvent the immigration laws passed by  Congress, including reducing the pay of Border Patrol agents.   If the House Democrats have their way, they will continue down this  suboptimum, irresponsible path until it is simply too late.   I visited the 75-mile stretch of the border that crosses through one  of Arizona's Indian reservations. Along the way, the Border Patrol  agent who was guiding us pointed out drug shacks and lookouts that the  cartels use to alert smugglers of the Border Patrol's presence. It is  astounding, quite frankly.   Some will argue that there is fencing along many of those miles and  try to convince you that the area is secure and no fencing is  necessary. But let me tell you something, that is not true. The fencing  consists of a single strand of barbed wire. There might be some  Normandy barriers, those cross barriers, now and then, and there is  some pole fencing, all of which easily can be walked over or stepped  through. No one who has been there can argue with a straight face that  the ability to walk across the border with little effort can be called  secure.   On that same trip, I met with cattle ranchers near Nogales. Each of  those families has encountered multiple illegal aliens on their  property--in fact, on a regular basis. It is so grave that they set up  cameras so they could capture footage of the illegal traffic. I have  seen that footage; I have seen the videos. It is not groups of sweet  mothers and children coming across. It is groups of armed, young men,  with drugs strapped to their backs, 50-pound packages. They are wearing  carpet shoes to disguise their footprints in the dirt.   I recently spoke with a rancher along the border. He has told me that  he has been victimized by three home invasions and more than a dozen  burglaries, not counting the near constant trespasses that victimize  his family.   I am curious to know what the open border advocates think about that  kind of traffic. Should known drug smugglers have the freedom to  traipse across private property and come into America? These Americans  own their land, but the House Democrats see no reason to protect them  from this invasion.   To any Member of the Chamber who disagrees with border security, or  doesn't know how to describe it, including with a wall, how would you  feel about constant trespassing and vandalizing of your own property?  Don't you think the government should do something about it, or should  we just turn a blind eye?   During a more recent trip, I had lunch with about 15 rank-and-file  Border Patrol agents working in southern Arizona. These are the men and  women defending our borders every day. They are putting their lives on  the line, chasing after armed drug smugglers and being assaulted by  illegal aliens they encounter.   By the way, just a couple of weeks ago, there was one attacked who  had his face broken open by a rock after he was bitten and punched and  attacked. Let me tell you, it leads to low morale in the agency.   They are the only DHS law enforcement agency that received a pay cut  under the previous administration, and we can't fund them back yet. I  don't understand that.   When they hear Members of Congress condemn the work they are doing  and advocating instead for lawlessness and open borders, these agents  have little incentive or motivation to continue fighting for our  Nation's security.   This morning, I stood, like others have mentioned, with Angel  Families who have lost loved ones. Two of them are in my district, the  families of Brandon Mendoza and Grant Ronnebeck. They have suffered  unjust harms. They have lost their children.   When I hear the gentleman from California say, oh, we can't get to  the Smithsonian museum, well, for these people, their children will  never get to the Smithsonian museum. They will mourn, and they do  grieve. I am thankful for them standing up.   I will just tell you, ladies and gentlemen, there is a crisis on the  border. We must deal with this with courage.    I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to quit being  obstructionists. We have to fund a border wall and the border security  asked for.
