 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  supplemental bill for Hurricane Harvey relief. This bill will provide  $15.3 billion in emergency funding, including $7.4 billion for FEMA's  Disaster Relief Fund, $7.4 billion for Community Development Block  Grants to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and $350  million to support the Small Business Administration's Disaster Loan  Program to assist small business and homeowners.   This supplemental bill is not only a critical first step to provide  basic needs of food, shelter, and water for those in immediate need,  but it also provides initial funding to begin the process of rebuilding  and recovery for those communities devastated by Hurricane Harvey.   Further resources and hard work will be required. I will continue to  work closely alongside my colleagues and the Appropriations Committee  to meet the present and emerging needs of our neighbors across the  Southeast. My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by these  devastating storms.   This bill addresses the urgent needs of those affected by Hurricane  Harvey. It sends a powerful message to all that we are here for them  and we will be working hard for them throughout the recovery. Mr.  Speaker, I strongly encourage a vote on this bill.   As an aside, I grew up in Houston, Texas. I was born there, I grew up  there. I remember floods, but I never remember floods that washed away  people's homes and their livelihood. This is a once-in-a-lifetime  situation down there, may we all pray, and it is time to get it done.
