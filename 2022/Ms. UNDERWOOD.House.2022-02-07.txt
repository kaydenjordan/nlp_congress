 Mr. Speaker, last week, House Democrats advanced yet  another historic investment in the American people, the America  COMPETES Act. Not only will the America COMPETES Act strengthen our  economic and national security, it supports the production of U.S.  semiconductors, which play a role in nearly every sector of our  economy.   This critical $52 billion investment in semiconductors will address  chip shortages and supply chain disruptions, lowering car costs for  consumers while creating good-paying jobs. I have heard from my  neighbors how much they have been feeling the recent spike in new and  used car prices and wait times, and this bill will help.   The America COMPETES Act also makes transformational investments in  research, authorizing a new program to advance accelerator technology  and build on the work of scientists at Fermilab National Accelerator  Facility in my district.   I am proud to support this comprehensive legislation to boost  American competitiveness and broaden economic opportunity, and I urge  my colleagues in the Senate to act swiftly to send it to President  Biden's desk.                            ____________________
