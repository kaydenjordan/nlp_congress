 Mr. Speaker, I come before this body today with a heavy  heart. A dear friend of mine, Mr. Paul Booth, we lost him 12 days ago  to leukemia. Mr. Booth was a man who dedicated his life to the simple  idea of fairness--fairness for workers, fairness in all aspects of  life.   Paul Booth was a leading adviser to nearly every union president over  the last several years at the American Federation of State, County and  Municipal Employees. He also worked hard to lift up dignity in all  aspects of his life.   He was a student organizer and brought attention to the folly of the  U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war, and he had been active in making  Americans' lives better his entire life.   He understood the very simple idea that working people have dignity  and that they must be treated to reflect that dignity by their  government. He also understood that the linkage between hard work and  prosperity should always be close and tight. He recognized that, in our  country today, you can work very hard and still only make it. That is  why he was one of the first people to work for a living wage policy in  this country. He was fighting for a living wage before it was popular.   Paul Booth also happened to have a marvelous partner. Her name is  Heather Booth, and everybody knows Heather.   But I just want to say, when people who make a life of service pass  from this life, it is important that we recognize the tremendous debt  we owe them.   I want to thank Paul and Heather Booth for their mentorship of me and  for their service to our country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker and Members, it is important to understand  the big picture here.   When the Supreme Court takes up Janus, yes, they are going to be  talking about fair share. Is it legal, is it constitutional, for  someone to benefit from being represented by a labor union that has to  fight for them and then still not have to pay anything to help at all.  That will be the question before the Court.   But that is just a very small part of what is really going on. What  is really going on, Mr. Speaker, is that we see the deconstruction of  the American middle class. The question is: Will America be a land of  opportunity; or will it be a land of stagnation where you can work as  hard as you want to, but you are never going to be able to make enough  to really make it?   What is going on here, Mr. Speaker, is that the conservative movement  in our country is trying to break the link between hard work and  prosperity as they rifle money and channel it to the very richest among  us, and working people just have to hope for the best and work hard  just to get back to work for whatever they can scrape together.   Because at the end of the day, labor unions have given workers a  voice which has helped create the great American middle class. The  lightbulb and the semiconductor are not the great inventions of  America. They are great inventions, but the greatest invention of the  United States of America is this big, giant middle class which you can  work hard and get into.   This is what is under threat. This is what we are fighting to uphold  tonight.   Now, Janus is a decision that takes place within the context of other  decisions. Let us not forget Shelby County, a case which attacked our  right to vote. Let's not forget Citizens United, a case which says  corporations are people and they can spend as much money on elections  as they choose. Let's not forget these tax cuts passed just about a few  weeks ago which rifle money to the richest among us and undermine  American workers.   We are in the middle of a battle over whether or not the United  States will continue to be a place where hard work pays. That is what  this fight is about. And that, Mr. Speaker, is what we invite everyone  to understand the union difference. If you are Black, being in a union  means you are going to make more money than other folks. If you are a  woman, it will mean the same thing. If you are a veteran, it will mean  the same thing. Unions have always done more for the people who are in  them, and we want to get more people in unions, not fewer.   The attack that we see tonight in the form of this Janus v. AFSCME is  an attack on that union advantage. But unions have helped everybody,  Mr. Speaker. If you look at wage stagnation in America, what you see  since World War II, right up until the 1970s, is pay going up and up  and up for working people until we see union density begin to break  down, and it is at that point that we begin to see wages flatten out  and stagnate.   Unions create not just good pay and good benefits for their workers,  but they actually create benefits for all workers because unions create  the wage floor and lift up all boats.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that this is African American History Month  only a few days away beginning in February. We must remember people  like A. Philip Randolph, who was not only a union leader, he was a  civil rights leader. We can't forget about E. D. Nixon, who helped  start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which led to the beginning of the  modern American civil rights movement. And let us not forget our  beloved Martin Luther King, whose birthday we celebrated a few days  ago, and who we will recognize the 50th anniversary of his  assassination this year, died fighting for workers of the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Workers, who is one of the  litigants in this case, the Janus case.    So I want to say, if you care about income inequality, if you care  about prosperity for working people, you have got to get on the side of  fighting against this Janus decision. This is what is going on.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Ellison for his  comments. Well done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee). And you talk about a fearless fighter, Mr. Speaker, Ms.  Sheila Jackson Lee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  his leadership in galvanizing all of us, and I thank my colleagues for  very eloquent messages on the floor of the House regarding Janus v.  AFSCME Council 31.   Let me acknowledge Lee Saunders and the AFSCME family, who have been  champions in fighting for the rights of all labor, and that is why we  are on the floor of the House today, because we wanted to, in our way  as legislators, join in this magnificent fight for constitutional  rights of the First Amendment.   And let me take issue with the 1977 Supreme Court case Abood v.  Detroit Board of Education and turn the Fourth Amendment back to  supporting those workers who, in fact, want to associate and  participate in unions.   Let me also thank my colleague Chairman Richmond of the Congressional  Black Caucus for galvanizing us as well in this effort.   We offered a resolution to honor Echol Cole and Robert Walker. On  February 1, 1968, it will be 50 years that these two sanitation workers  in Memphis were killed in a horrific accident when the compactor on  their sanitation truck malfunctioned. The key is that these individuals  had no rights, no benefits. They had no death benefits. They had no  protection for their families. They had nothing. And that is why this  Supreme Court decision is so crucial and why I hope that the Supreme  [[Page H665]]  Court of the United States will rule in favor of AFSCME against this  wrongheaded approach to those who are trying to speak on behalf of  those who support the rights of workers.   The Supreme Court cases did the flip of the First Amendment and  suggested that the First Amendment of those who disapproved unions was  being violated. I believe that the Supreme Court got it completely  wrong and that the First Amendment rights of those who move positively  to be part of a union could be argued vigorously that their rights are  being violated. Not only their rights are being violated, but their  rights to have a liveable wage and to work in a safe and protected  workforce and workplace. That is what I think the real question is as  to why those who want to be in a union must be defeated by the  constitutional premise of the First Amendment.   My First Amendment is to join the union and to secure the rights and  benefits of those. I hope that the Supreme Court will look to the fact  that union members who desire to have fees selected and utilized for  the union deducted from their salary have every much a right to the  First Amendment. You can opt out, but you should not deny those members  the right to the First Amendment to have their voices heard.   In particular, it is important to note the benefits that have come  about to the African-American community. And that is the African- American community has seen increasing wages. African-American union  workers earn up to $10,000 or 31 percent more a year than nonunion  workers. In 2011, nearly 20 percent of employed African Americans  worked for the State, local, or Federal Government compared to 14  percent of other groups. And African Americans are less likely than  other groups to work in the private sector.   So let me say this about why I stand here to support the unions and  their right to the First Amendment to deduct fees to be able to express  their rights. Let me just quickly say as I close: Do you know among the  many things that unions have helped us get are weekends, all breaks at  work, paid vacations, family medical leave, sick leave, Social  Security, minimum wage, civil rights, overtime, child labor laws, and  workman's comp?   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is an important discussion because  so many good elements of saving lives, so much so that those dear  sanitation workers would not have lost their life, came about from the  sacrifice of unions, and we should provide them with the First  Amendment right.   Let me salute Clara Caldwell who will be honored by our union  brothers and sisters in Austin, Texas, and let me say the right thing  for the Supreme Court to do is rule on behalf of the unions and their  rights to the First Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record points about African Americans  and Labor Unions, facts about Janus v. AFSCME Council 31, and 36  reasons to thank the union movement.                     African Americans and Labor Unions         1. Historically, the path to the middle class for African       Americans was through a union job.        2. African-American workers are more likely to be union       members.        3. Unionized workers promote greater income equality and       prevent wage discrimination.        4. African American union workers earn up to $10,000 or 31%       more per year than non-union members.        7. Few African Americans are self-employed--only 3.8%       reported being self-employed in 2011--making them almost half       as likely to be self-employed as Whites (7.2%).        8. Unionized workers are more likely to receive paid leave,       more likely to have employer-provided health insurance, and       are more likely to be in employer-provided pension plans.        9. Unions play a pivotal role by ensuring workers have       continued educational access for their current roles as well       as encourage workers to pursue higher education.        10. Nationally, 77 percent of union employees in 2009 were       covered by pension plans that provide a guaranteed monthly       retirement income. Only 20 percent of non-union workers are       covered by guaranteed (defined-benefit) pensions 20%.        11. Union workers are 53.9% more likely to have employer-      provided pensions.        12. When unions are strong and able to represent the people       who want to join them, these gains spread throughout the       economy and the overall community.        13. Workers who form unions are able to boost wages, which       helps attract and retain staff.        14. When non-union companies increase their wages, it gives       all workers more purchasing power.        15. Communities with a strong middle class have sufficient       tax revenues to support schools, hospitals and roads.        16. Historically, pensions, social security and personal       savings ensured that workers could retire with dignity.        17. With the current recession and the attack on pensions,       many workers are left to depend on social security and their       personal savings alone.        18. Many African American elders find themselves in a       precarious situation after decades of work.        19. Union members played a critical role in the civil       rights struggles of the past and that involvement continues       today.        20. When Martin Luther King Jr. was jailed for civil       disobedience, unions and union members frequently came to his       aid with the legal and financial help he needed.        21. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin both union leaders       help to organize the March on Washington in 1963 and in       countless cities around the country.        22. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed while in       Memphis to aid striking sanitation workers.        23. Today, labor unions are still on the forefront of       efforts to ensure that the gains of the past are maintained       and to fight for those still denied opportunity and equality.           Facts About Janus v. AFSCME Council 31--Source: AFSCME         Facts of the Case        In 1977, the Supreme Court, in Abood v. Detroit Board of       Education, upheld against a First Amendment challenge a       Michigan law that allowed a public employer whose employees       were represented by a union to require those of its employees       who did not join the union nevertheless to pay fees to it       because they benefited from the union's collective bargaining       agreement with the employer.        Illinois has a law similar to that upheld in Michigan. The       governor of Illinois brought a lawsuit challenging the law on       the ground that the statute violates the First Amendment by       compelling employees who disapprove of the union to       contribute money to it. The district court dismissed the       complaint on the grounds that the governor lacked standing to       sue because he did not stand to suffer injury from the law,       but two public employees intervened in the action to seek       that Abood be overturned. Given that Abood is binding on       lower courts, the district court dismissed the claim, and the       Seventh Circuit affirmed dismissal for the same reason.        Legal Question Presented:        Should the Court's decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of       Education should be overturned so that public employees who       do not belong to a union cannot be required to pay a fee to       cover the union's costs to negotiate a contract that applies       to all public employees, including those who are not union       members?        Janus v. AFSCME Council 31 threatens our union and all       working families. This case, which will come before the       Supreme Court in February, represents a huge threat to our       union. As a local leader, you are critical to how we defend       and protect our union, our members and public services in the       face of this threat.        This lawsuit aims to take away the freedom of working       people to join together in strong unions to speak up for       themselves and their communities. In February, the U.S.       Supreme Court will hear the case and a decision is expected       by the summer.        What are fair share fees, and why are they important?        Unions work because we all pay our fair share and we all       benefit from what we negotiate together. Fair share fees       provide public service workers with the power in numbers they       need to negotiate better wages, benefits and protections that       improve work conditions and set standards for everyone.        Each public service worker chooses whether or not to join a       union, but the union is still required by law to represent       and negotiate on behalf of all public service workers--      members and non-members alike. All employees receive the wage       increases, benefits and workplace rights negotiated through       the union.        The corporate special interests behind this case want to       take away our ability to build strength in numbers. That is       why they want the Supreme Court to rule that workers can       receive all the benefits of a union contract without       contributing anything in return. All workers should chip in       their fair share to cover the cost of representing them.        Is anyone ever forced to join a union or pay for politics?        No. The simple truth is that no one is forced to join a       union and no one is forced to pay any fees that go to       politics or political candidates. That is already the law of       the land. Nothing in this case will change that. This case is       about taking away the freedom of working people to join       together, speak up for each other and build a better life for       themselves and their families by undermining their ability to       form strong unions.        What is the real impact of this case?        When working people have the freedom and opportunity to       speak up together through unions, we make progress together       that benefits everyone. The wealthy elite behind this case       are trying to use the highest court in the land to take away       our freedom to create the power in numbers to secure better       lives  [[Page H666]]       for ourselves, our families, our communities and our country       by undermining our ability to form strong unions.        If fair share fees are struck down, employees who benefit       from the gains that the union makes will not have to pay       anything toward the cost of that representation. If the       billionaires and corporate CEOs behind this case get their       way, they will take away the freedom of working people to       come together and build power to fight for the things our       families and communities need: everything from affordable       health care and retirement security to quicker medical       emergency response times.        What is this case really about?        The case aims to erode the freedom to form unions to       improve our lives and the communities we serve. Real freedom       is about making a decent living from our hard work; it's also       about having time to take a loved one to the doctor, attend a       parent-teacher conference and retire in dignity. The       corporate special interests behind this case do not believe       that working people should have the freedom to negotiate a       fair return on their work.        Who is behind this case?        The National Right to Work Foundation is part of a network       funded by corporate billionaires to use the courts to rig the       rules against working people. For decades, these wealthy       elites have used their massive fortunes to gain outsized       influence to chip away at the progress unions have won for       all working families. Now they want the highest court in the       land to take away our freedom to come together to protect       what our communities need: a living wage, retirement       security, health benefits, the ability to care for loved ones       and more.        How do unions benefit our communities?        People in unions continue to win rights, benefits and       protections for all working people and their communities.       When public service workers belong to strong unions, they       fight for staffing levels, equipment and training that saves       lives and improves the public services our communities rely       upon. And when union membership is high, entire communities       enjoy higher wages.                   36 Reasons To Thank the Union Movement         1. Weekends        2.
