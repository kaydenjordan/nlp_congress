 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, the  Climate Risk Disclosure Act, H.R. 1187.   I would like us all to imagine for a moment that you had all of your  wealth tied up in a single company, and you knew that that company was  on track to lose nearly 20 percent of its value thanks to a known and  avoidable threat. You call the CEO, and the CEO responded by saying: We  have it taken care of, but I am not going to explain how.   That is the reality that the climate crisis is creating for our  global economy.   Swiss Re recently found that global GDP will decrease by 4 percent if  we meet the Paris climate accords, and if we stay with business as  usual, 18 percent.   Domestically, the CFTC has come to roughly the same conclusion,  estimating that for every 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature, we can  expect a 1.2 percent reduction in annual GDP growth.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my friends that that is material. It is a big  deal.   Those economic losses are due to the wildfires, droughts, blackouts,  and superstorms that have already caused $500 billion of damages in the  past 4 years, and investors understand this.   The fossil fuel industry has spent 10 years slashing prices. And do  you know what? They are still losing market share to lower-cost  renewables and efficiency.   ExxonMobil didn't write down $20 billion because they are woke. They  wrote down $20 billion because the free market is beating them.   Investors want to know how to reallocate their capital in response to  that risk. They want to know how to allocate it to more productive  uses. That is why there were over 140 climate-related shareholder  proposals at U.S. companies during the 2020 proxy season. But we, in  this body, have not done our job to protect those investors.   Let us be very clear. When we talk about investor protection, every  company in the world would like to have asymmetry of information. Our  job is to make sure that if you love free markets as much as I do, as  much as those of us on this side of the aisle do, then you have to make  sure that they have full transparency of information. Right now, public  companies have no obligation to disclose their exposure to climate- related risks, nor is there a consistent format for those disclosures.  This bill would fix that.   It directs the SEC to issue a rule requiring every public company to  disclose its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, the total  amount of fossil fuel-related assets that it owns or manages, how its  valuation would be affected if climate change continues at its current  pace or if policymakers successfully restrict greenhouse gas emissions  to meet the Paris goals, and its risk management strategies related to  the physical and transitional risks of the climate crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I want to reassure my friend from Arkansas  that the bill does direct the SEC to tailor those disclosure  requirements to different industries to make sure that the burden is  borne most heavily by those companies with the greatest contribution to  that risk.   When it comes to making this transition, markets are some of the most  [[Page H2837]]  powerful tools we have, but efficient markets depend on transparent  information. It is on us to provide that efficiency, to unleash the  power of our entrepreneurs and our capitalists to create jobs and  economic growth, and to leave a better planet than the one we  inherited--but only if we act.   This is a win for capitalism, a win for consumers, and a win for the  planet that we will pass on to our grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of our Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor), my friend and the distinguished chairwoman of the Select  Committee on the Climate Crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her words and  her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Carbajal), my friend and one of the funnier Members of Congress,  but heartfelt today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Levin), my friend and a distinguished member of the Select  Committee on Climate Crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur), whom I am delighted was able to make time in a busy  appropriation season to come down and join us today.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to take some time now to rise  to talk about something that I have talked about--some would say too  much--on this floor. To yet, again, discuss the grave threat and the  massive opportunity that is the climate crisis.   Even as we talk right now about the necessity of limiting global  warming to less than 1\1/2\ degrees Celsius, let's follow the math; the  planet has already warmed by 1 degree, we only have \1/2\ degree to go.  The last 7 years were the hottest ever on record. Even in spite of the  pandemic, global levels of carbon dioxide have hit record levels. In  fact, the last time CO2 levels were as high as they are  right now was 4 million years ago. Sea levels were 50 feet higher. That  is the reality of what happens when heat melts ice, ice dumps water.  This is the reality we have made.    If we are to be judged by our works and we do nothing more in this  moment, that judgment will not be pretty. That is our challenge and it  is our opportunity.   But this change in CO2 levels didn't happen over a million  years, it didn't happen over a thousand years, it didn't even happen  over a hundred years. Half of all the CO2 we have ever  emitted as a species since that first fire that some upright hominid  built in a cave a million years ago, half of all the CO2 we  have ever emitted was since 1990. That is within my lifetime. It is  within the lifetime of almost all of the Members of this body.   That is nearly a century after Svante Arrhenius discovered the  greenhouse effect, since the science was basically settled; 100 years  after the photovoltaic effect that was invented that powers solar  panels today; and more than a decade after the fossil fuel companies  knew about climate change and decided to promote misinformation instead  of acting.   In 1989, when the U.N. formed the IPCC, when Ronald Reagan's EPA  said, we need to create a global cap and trade program to reduce a  global pollutant--to protect the ozone hole, chlorofluorocarbons. When  that same EPA and the subsequent George Bush--both Republican  Presidents, I would add--they said, let's take that same model and  apply it to a domestic pollutant, acid-rain forming compounds.   We have sugar maples in New England because of their leadership. We  have a shrinking ozone hole because of their leadership. When they did  that at the end of the 1980s, we were on the right track 30 years ago.  What do we have to do now to turn this ship around?   The heck of it is, we know what we have to do to reduce our emissions  and we know how to do it, building out clean energy infrastructure,  creating and building wind turbines, solar panels. Building big things  is what America is good at. We do not need to be constrained by our  ambition, my goodness.   When the New Deal was passed, we electrified 80 percent of rural  America in just 15 years. I would like to think our capabilities are  even greater now. Let's embrace that opportunity. The hard questions in  this line of work are the zero sum ones.   How do you allocate wins to some parties when they imply a loss to  another? That is not climate.   The hard questions in clean energy policy are not how we allocate the  pains of this transition; they are how we allocate the gains of this  transition. Clean energy is cheap energy. If you don't believe me, ask  anyone with a solar panel on their roof how much they paid for  electricity yesterday. Ask anybody with a coal plant, they know that  number.   The clean energy transition means it is a win for the folks who get  to go to work building more efficient buildings and wind turbines and  solar panels. It is a win for every American.   I've polled this. 100 percent of Americans like to pay less for  energy. They would all win. 100 percent of Americans like cleaner air.  They will all win. 100 percent of Americans do not want to live on a  coast that is flooding or forests that are on fire or derechos that are  coming across the Midwest.   Our obligation is to seize this chance and to make sure--this is a  hard problem, but it is a good problem--to make sure that those gains  are equitably distributed throughout our society.   The President's infrastructure proposal is just that. It isn't just a  chance for clean energy, it is a make-or-break  [[Page H2877]]  opportunity to finally do what is scientifically necessary before it is  too late.   Proposals like a clean energy standard, a build-out of electric  transmission lines, requirements for purchases of clean energy will  help send our emissions from the electric sector to zero and will be  the bedrock of a new clean economy.   Cutting some or--let's be ambitious--all of the $650 billion a year  that the IMF has said that we currently subsidize the fossil fuel  industry, will finally give us efficient markets in our energy sector.  $650 billion--that is about how much we spend on Medicaid--subsidizing  an energy that can't compete under a free market.   So help make lives better for hundreds of millions of Americans now  and in the decades to come.   Now 12 years ago, when Waxman-Markey was the debate du jour, we let  an opportunity to act on the climate crisis pass us by. Since that  time, we have kept emitting and temperatures have kept rising.   I told you, I have given this speech a few too many times. I don't  want to be giving this speech a year from now. I don't particularly  want to be giving it tomorrow. I certainly don't want to be giving it  12 years from now.   We have a chance now to act while our planet can still afford it, and  we can embrace that because our wallets are going to love it.   Before I took this job, when I was running a clean energy company, I  had a board member who gave me a piece of advice that has always stuck  with me, he said: In the end, the only thing that really matters in  this life is whether your grandchildren can say they were proud of you.  Let's be clear. Our grandchildren are not going to be proud of us. They  are not going to pat us on the back for doing only what was politically  possible. They don't care.   What matters is, did we do what was scientifically necessary? And I  have a lot of colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of  this building, who will say, You are naive, Casten, what is necessary  is so far in excess of what is politically possible, we just can't do  that.   If that is your approach to this moment, the only thing I know for  certain is you are not cut out for leadership. Our moment, our  challenge in this moment, is to make what is necessary possible, it is  all that matters. Because while the best chance for climate action was  30 years ago, our last chance is now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).                                time  2015     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great  State of New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury), whose reputation has preceded her  during her short tenure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield again to gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Castor), who is the chair of the Select Committee on the Climate  Crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I am reminded as I listen to the gentlewoman  speak--I know our whip always likes to quote George Santayana who said  that those who don't study their history are doomed to repeat it.   We are at the cusp--it has probably already started--of the third  great energy transition we have had as a species. The first one was  when we transitioned from depending on muscle power to mechanical  power. The second was when we transitioned from mechanical power to  electric power, and this transition from dirty energy to clean energy.  Every one of those transitions has been a massive boon in labor  productivity. It takes a lot fewer people to run a steam shovel than it  does John Henrys to dig a hole in the ground, and it takes a lot fewer  people when you can electrify the country to build all the industries  that we have grown accustomed to than it does when you have to live  within a pulley's length of the waterwheel.   With those opportunities have come all that we think of as great and  truly American. We have freed up people's time to invest in whole new  ideas and take away the drudgery of work. But the history we have to  acknowledge is that every one of those transitions has also been  extremely disruptive for the people involved.   I like to tell folks back home that only a Luddite would say we never  should have invented the steam shovel. But you have to be deeply evil  not to empathize with John Henry.   As we go through this transition that we are in right now, we are  going to create a tremendous amount of wealth because we are going to  grow labor productivity again. We are going to have the opportunity, as  many people already do, to generate electricity without depending on  coal mines and coal railroad lines and natural gas pipelines, and, Mr.  Speaker, you are going to be able to do this on your roof from the sun  or from the wind or from more efficient geothermal. That is going to  free up a whole lot of time to do a lot of innovative things. But it is  going to be disruptive for a lot of communities.   There is no doubt that there is a rising tide of wealth that is  already upon us. There is also no doubt that not all rising tides lift  all boats. Tsunamis tend to swamp them out sometimes, and in the  tsunami of wealth creation that is coming down, let's make sure that we  look out for the least among us.    Mr. Speaker, I think there is a refreshing change coming  in our energy structure primarily because all of those old power  plants--that some of the utilities in Florida that we are fighting  because they still have all that capital they wanted to amortize--those  plants are getting old, and they are making the decisions that  intelligent businesses always make: I am going to invest in the stuff  that is clean and that generates a high return.   Florida Power & Light Company is a utility that, frankly, has been  one of the leaders in deploying wind energy. It took them a little  while to do it in their own district, but they certainly did it all  over the country, because they knew that was a good place to put their  investors' money to work. And we have seen that leadership, I think,  throughout the business sector in this country. There is a reason why  we are creating so many more solar jobs, and so many more wind jobs.  Jobs in the energy efficiency sector I think is the largest supplier of  new labor.                                time  2030    But I don't think that absolves us as regulators.   I am remembering when you and I formed what I think we thought was  going to be a vary small delegation to Madrid a little over a year ago;  and we had our pins that said ``We're Still In,'' because we knew, of  course, that the prior administration had pulled out of the Paris  accord. And I still have a picture that I carry around and show to  people of the two empty seats in front of the United States delegation  sign when every other country in the world was there.   But I remember there was a--and I wish I could remember the name-- European parliamentarian that came up to me and said: You know, we know  from experience that when the United States doesn't lead, bad things  happen.   And I said that we thought we were alone out there. But you remember  when we got there, there were a lot of businesses that were there and  there were lot of cities that were there. We spent a long time at a lot  of university booths. And we were still in because we were still in,  not just because it was a slogan on a pin; because all those companies  that made zero carbon commitments and are committing to it because  their shareholders are demanding it.   One-third of all of the assets under management in global equity  markets right now are in ESG funds. People care. They don't--whether  they care for moral reasons, whether they care because they are greedy,  it doesn't matter. They care.  [[Page H2879]]    We have had over 1,200 State and local officials call on Congress to  pass the American Jobs Plan because they care. Environmental and labor  organizations across the country have pushed for us to act now because  they care.   I am reading in the Tampa Bay Times. Recently, Dr. Rich Templin says:  ``Everyone who stands for fair, union jobs and climate action can come  together. In this plan, pro-workers and pro-environment voices can sing  in unison.''   We know that is true.   Now, the challenge--you started by asking about the energy sector. If  we are really honest, what we all know in this line of work that we are  in is that losers always cry louder than winners cheer.   People who have got a loss of investment in this space know exactly  what they have to lose. Future generations aren't here yet.   Our job here today is to look around the room and see who is not in  the room and make sure we advocate for them. The rest of them are doing  a pretty good job on their own, I think.    Mr. Speaker, when we deregulated our power industry in  1992, with the energy policy act, that was never presented as being an  environmental bill, as far as I can remember. It was designed to  encourage people to build cheaper power.   And what did they build?   The nuclear industry went from running 60 percent of the time to  running 90 percent of the time. We started building a whole lot of wind  and solar. We basically stopped building inefficient gas plants, and  the only new gas plants were combined cycle plants that are almost  twice as efficient.   Since that bill was passed, the CO2 emissions in our power  sector have fallen from 1,300 pounds a megawatt hour to 900, and the  price of power has fallen by 6 percent.   Now, there are those who say that is because of the fracking  revolution. And there are people who say a lot of things, I guess. It  happened because economics drives clean energy.   You know what people didn't build since 1992?   Coal. It is a really lousy investment.   In just those 10 years, after 1992, we built 200,000 megawatts of new  gas turbine capacity. Twenty percent of the entire U.S. power grid,  which was twice as efficient as what it displaced, was built in  response to economic signals and drove down the CO2  emissions of the grid. That is a start.   For us to do what we have to do from this point going forward, we  have to electrify everything. We have to figure out how to electrify  our transportation fleet; electrify the way our factories make goods  and services, how our homes keep us warm.   In order to do that, we need to build at least 1,000 gigawatts; 1,000  megawatts; 1,000 kilowatts--whatever unit you would like--of new  generation. That is about as much as generation as we already have in  this country.   We are then going to need to build the wires to connect that up to  all the new loads. And I think as we heard at a climate hearing, they  said that is going to take at least $350 billion of investment. And  those investments are going to make money because people are now  connecting up a cheaper energy source that is giving people what they  really want, which isn't electricity.   What people really want is a hot shower and a cold beer, and it is  going to give them that cheaper.   It is going to help us build out electric vehicle charging stations.  We are talking about massive amounts of public--and private-sector  investments that are not only going to put people to work; is not only  going to give us a more sustainable economy; it is going to leave more  money in people's wallets.   The single best thing we can do to disadvantaged communities is cut  their energy bill. That is what we are going to do. All we need is the  ambition. And I am so glad that we are in this moment and with this  President and this Congress that is rising to that challenge.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to close, as I often do, by  observing that there are really only three things we have to do as a  country.   The first thing we have to do is cut the energy--double the  efficiency with which we convert energy into economic activity. If we  were to cut our energy use per dollar of GDP in half, we would almost  be at the level that Switzerland has already achieved. I think we are  [[Page H2880]]  better than Switzerland, personally, but let's at least aspire to be as  good as Switzerland; double our efficiency.   The second thing we have to do is do the research and development to  figure out how to decarbonize industries like steel- and cement-making  because we don't know how to make silicone; we don't know how to make  steel; we don't know how to make cement; we don't know how to make  fertilizer without fossil fuels today. That is an R&D challenge we have  to figure out.   Then we have to get to zero CO2 emissions; not by 2050,  not by 2030, by 1990. We have to get back to 350 parts per million in  the atmosphere because that is the point that we can say to our  children: We are leaving you a better planet than the one we inherited,  where wildfires are not the norm, where droughts are not the norm.   And is it going to be easy?   No. But we know how to do it.   The first thing we ought to do is take our hand off the emergency  brake. Stop subsidizing yesterday's technology. Embrace markets.  Embrace innovation. Embrace all that makes us American. Stop  subsidizing the fossil fuel industry by $650 billion a year.   Unleash the power of our innovators. Unleash the power of our  entrepreneurs. Unleash the power and the innovation of all our great  universities and national labs who will figure out how to do these hard  things.   And then, yes, even after we do all that, make significant Federal  investments in the things that the private sector is not very good at,  like transmission, like coast-to-coast broadband, like EV stations. We  have done it before. That is how we built the railroads. It is how we  electrified the country.   It is not going to be easy, but it will be necessary. It will be  inspiring, and it will be a story that we will tell our grandchildren  about because we will be able to tell them that we were there, in this  moment; we saw what was necessary, and we made it possible. I think  that is something worth doing.   It is our opportunity. It is our moment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
