 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the  underlying legislation, and I urge my colleagues to take a step back  and consider the unintended consequences of this legislation.   As a former member of the Judiciary Committee, I had the opportunity  to hear firsthand from a very diverse range of stakeholders on their  experiences in dealing with the Copyright Office, and one of the most  common refrains I heard was the dire need for modernizing the Office  and updating their IT systems to be more user-friendly. So I was very  disturbed to learn recently that 6 years and nearly $12 million were  wasted on yet another failed government IT project, this time at the  Copyright Office. This waste of taxpayer dollars is unacceptable, and  any legislation to reform the Office ought to have successful  modernization as its primary goal. This legislation fails that test.   H.R. 1695 sets back the clock on considerable progress that has been  made already under the leadership of the new Librarian of Congress, Dr.  Carla Hayden. The bill puts the power to appoint the head of the  Copyright Office in the hands of a President who, as of February, still  had around 2,000 appointments sitting empty. This kind of delay will  set back the Office when it is finally on the right track.   And to what end?   It seems that this bill is just another solution in search of a  problem.   A vote for this bill is a vote to stop progress, a vote to continue  to waste tax dollars, and a vote to add one more person to the list of  positions that President Trump seems to have no interest in filling. I  am very concerned that this is a misguided experiment without a clear  purpose and that taxpayers will be the ones who foot the bill when it  doesn't succeed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
