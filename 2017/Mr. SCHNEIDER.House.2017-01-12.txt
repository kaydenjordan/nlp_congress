 Mr. Speaker, in his farewell speech, President Obama  said that if anyone can put together an alternative healthcare plan  that is demonstrably better and covers as many people at less cost, he  would publicly support it. I feel the same way.   The ACA is not perfect, and anyone who is serious about working to  improve our healthcare system should count me as a willing partner. But  that is not what we have heard from President-elect Trump and my  Republican colleagues. Their irresponsible plan is to repeal ObamaCare  and then figure out what comes next. That is like jumping ship without  a life raft or a plan.   Repealing ObamaCare will leave 1.2 million people in my State without  health insurance, allowing insurers to again deny coverage based on  preexisting conditions or put annual and lifetime caps on coverage, and  deny young people the option of staying on their parents' plan. This  will hurt real people who depend on the Affordable Care Act.   I urge my colleagues to join me in finding ways to improve our  Nation's healthcare system rather than burning it down.
