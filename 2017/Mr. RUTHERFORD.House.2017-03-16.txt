 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for  this opportunity.   I rise today, Mr. Chairman, in support of H.R. 1259, the VA  Accountability First Act, because our veterans deserve to receive the  best care possible, and our VA personnel deserve to work alongside only  the best qualified and professional caregivers.    Mr. Chairman, I am proud to serve almost 100,000 veterans in  northeast Florida, and this important bill will ensure that veterans  throughout the Nation get the care and respect that they have earned.   In addition, thousands of good and caring VA employees dedicate their  lives to serving our veterans in some of their greatest times of need.  But it is unfair--unfair--to these many hardworking VA employees when  those working alongside of them engage in misconduct and they are not  held accountable.   Mr. Chairman, our veterans deserve better, and our caring,  hardworking VA employees deserve better. As has been stated multiple  times, this bill does not eliminate employee due process. My colleagues  and I in Congress carry a sacred obligation to our veterans, have a  sacred obligation to our Nation to improve accountability at our VA.
