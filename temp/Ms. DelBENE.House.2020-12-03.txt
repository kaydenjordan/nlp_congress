 Madam Speaker, almost 7 years ago, on March 22, 2014,  Washington experienced one of its worst natural disasters ever. In a  matter of seconds, a tragic landslide near Oso killed 43 people,  destroyed over 40 homes, and severely damaged public infrastructure and  private property.   That day forever changed the people of Oso, Darrington, Arlington,  the Stillaguamish Tribe, and the Sauk-Suiattle Tribe. But even in the  aftermath of the landslide, it was incredibly inspiring to see a  community come together to help each other through this tragedy. That  is why I introduced this bill, the National Landslide Preparedness Act.   In 2016, I introduced the first version of this bill and have been  working tirelessly to get it signed into law. This will allow  significant progress to be made in landslide science and will allow  communities to be better prepared for when landslides do occur.   As the Oso landslide demonstrated, simply sending aid after a tragic  natural disaster is insufficient. We need to do more to fund programs  and research efforts to prevent future natural disasters from becoming  national tragedies.   In recent years, we have seen dramatic increases in extreme weather  events, and we need to do everything in our power to make sure that  communities across the country are better prepared. Given the  importance of this issue, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  bill. Getting it signed into law is long overdue, and I hope the Senate  will pass this bill quickly and send it to the President's desk for his  signature.
