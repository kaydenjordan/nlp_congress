 Madam Speaker, the people of Puerto Rico  deserve to live in dignity with the freedom to determine their future.  That is why I rise in support of the Puerto Rico Status Act.   The act simply provides Puerto Ricans the opportunity to determine  their future and choose whether statehood, independence, or sovereignty  and free association makes the most sense for them.   Colleagues, I hope we can all agree that we all value basic human  rights, and that means, like every American citizen, our Puerto Rican  neighbors deserve true representation, equal rights, and everything  that flows from that.   After Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017, boricuas in the  Tampa Bay area came together to advocate for resources to rebuild the  island. The disparate treatment became so plain at that time, but it  has existed for decades, even as Puerto Ricans have given their life in  service of America's freedom.   So it is time that the territorial status of Puerto Rico be  reexamined. It is unsustainable and cannot continue. Puerto Ricans  deserve the opportunity to have their say.   I thank Representatives Velazquez, Soto, Ocasio-Cortez, Gonzalez- Colon, Leader Hoyer, and Chair Grijalva for crafting this landmark  legislation for self-determination per the democratic values that we  hold dear.   Vote for self-determination and freedom and democracy for everyone. I  urge you to adopt this bill.
