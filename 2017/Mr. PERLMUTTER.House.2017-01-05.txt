 ``The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall  not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the  public safety may require it.   ``No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.''    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman just spoke about liberty.  My friend from Pennsylvania spoke about self-rule. Today we are talking  about bureaucrats, but what we really should be talking about is the  effect of this bill on our agencies in Homeland Security and our  intelligence agencies, given the unprecedented intrusion by the  Russians in our elections and other affairs of this Nation. If we don't  stay focused on that liberty and the foundation for freedom so that  another country doesn't interfere with our affairs, we as Members of  Congress are ignoring the oath that we just took 2 days ago.   So I would suggest to my friends that I appreciate there can be  overregulation, but I would suggest you have to look closely at how  this bill affects our ability to protect our liberties and our freedom.  I am afraid it affects it badly, in the face of interference that we  haven't seen from another country since 1776.
