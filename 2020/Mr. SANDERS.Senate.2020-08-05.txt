 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as everybody knows, this country faces at  this moment an extraordinary set of crises--in fact, crises that are  unprecedented in the history of our country. We are in the midst of the  worst public health crisis since the Spanish flu of 100 years ago, and,  sad to say, this Senate has done nothing to address that crisis over  the last 2\1/2\ months.   Over the past 4 months, the coronavirus has infected nearly 5 million  Americans and caused 160,000 deaths, and the Senate is doing nothing.   Incredibly--and this is incredible--more Americans have been killed  by the coronavirus than by the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Persian  Gulf war, 9/11, the Afghanistan war, and the Iraq war combined, and the  Senate is still not acting.   We are in the midst of the worst economic meltdown since the Great  Depression of the 1930s, and the Senate is doing nothing.   Since March, more than 30 million Americans have lost their jobs.  Last week, the Senate allowed a $600-a-week increase in their  unemployment benefits to expire. Over half of the American people have  seen a loss in their income. Yet the Senate continues to do nothing.   Forty million Americans--an unbelievable number--40 million Americans  are in danger of being evicted from their homes while the Senate has  allowed a moratorium on evictions to expire.   This is no great shock. Everybody knew this would happen. Yet the  Republican leadership here has allowed that moratorium to expire.   Twenty-six million Americans cannot afford food to feed their  families, and those Americans are lining up at emergency food banks in  record numbers, the vast majority of whom have never been to an  emergency food bank in their lives, and the Senate is doing nothing.   A recordbreaking 5.4 million Americans recently lost their health  insurance. Under our dysfunctional healthcare system, when you lose  your job, you often lose your health insurance, and that now leaves us  with over 90 million Americans who are uninsured or underinsured; that  is, 90 million Americans who today worry about whether they can afford  to go to a doctor when they or their kids are sick. The Senate is doing  nothing.   In total, American households have lost a staggering $6.5 trillion in  wealth since this pandemic began. It is an unimaginable number. What  does that mean? That $6.5 trillion is a number much too large for many  of us to fathom, and the Senate does nothing.   Although I know there is some obfuscation about this, what everybody  in America should understand is that over 2.5 months ago, the House did  its job. Over 2.5 months ago, the U.S. House of Representatives did its  job, and they passed legislation responding to the enormous pain and  suffering that the American people are now experiencing. They did their  job, but the Senate has not.   The Heroes Act passed by the House in May would extend the $600-a- week increase in unemployment benefits until January. I want everybody  to understand that. I think sometimes there is confusion. The House did  its job. Under the House bill, if that bill were passed here today here  in the Senate, people would continue to get that $600 supplement in  their unemployment benefits.   The House bill would provide over $900 billion to State and local  governments to prevent the massive layoff of teachers, firefighters,  nurses, construction workers, and millions of other workers who are  serving the public during this horrific pandemic. Over 1 million  workers who work for State and local governments have already lost  their jobs, and if we do not provide substantial aid to State and local  governments, there will be a mass epidemic of job loss there.   The House bill would provide hazard pay to essential workers, which  is something that is long, long overdue. People are putting their lives  on the line and sometimes dying in order to provide us with groceries  or to get us to work on a bus or on a train. Those workers need hazard  pay, and that is what the House did.   The House also passed a provision in their legislation to require  businesses to adopt strong health and safety standards to protect their  employees and their customers.   The House bill would provide $175 billion in rental and foreclosure  assistance to make sure that millions of Americans do not lose their  homes or get evicted from their apartments and end up out on the  streets.   The House bill also provides vital funding for nutritional  assistance, for election security--an enormous issue here, whether or  not we are going to have free and fair elections--and also substantial  funding for the U.S. Postal Service, which is now being sabotaged by  the Trump administration. That is what the House passed 2.5 months ago.   Do I agree with everything that was in the House bill? No, I don't. I  think much of it, however, is excellent. But we can and should make  improvements in that bill here in the Senate. That is what we should be  doing--accepting the bill and improving it.   Two and a half months after the House passed its bill, Senate  Republicans finally woke up, and they said: We have to do something. We  have to respond. The public wants us to respond. We have to do  something. And they finally released their bill to respond to the  coronavirus crisis. Unfortunately, although not surprisingly, the  Republican plan is woefully inadequate for the working families of our  country, for the elderly, for their children, and for the poor, while  at the same time it provides even more corporate welfare to the rich  and the powerful. One might think that in the midst of this terrible  pandemic, my Republican colleagues could control themselves just a bit  and not pile on more benefits to the people who don't need them and  maybe--just maybe--pay attention to the people who do need help.   The Senate Republican bill provides nothing for hazard pay. If you  are a grocery store worker, if you are a truckdriver, if you are a  busdriver, if you are working in mass transit, nothing in that bill is  provided for hazard pay. There is nothing for nutrition assistance and  nothing for the 92 million Americans who are uninsured or underinsured.  Ninety-two million people are uninsured or underinsured in the midst of  a terrible public health crisis, and the Republican legislation ignores  that reality completely. There is nothing for the U.S. Postal Service  and nothing for State and local governments, many of which are on the  verge of bankruptcy.   Here is what that Republican bill does contain. It does include  another  [[Page S4914]]  $29 billion for the Pentagon. Last week, this body passed a $740  billion bill for the Pentagon, which is more money than the next 11  nations combined, most of which are our allies--a huge military budget,  but clearly, in the midst of the pandemic, the Pentagon needs even  more.   The Republican bill does include another tax break for the meals and  entertainment of wealthy CEOs. The Republican bill does include another  $1.75 billion for an FBI building, $1 billion for new surveillance  planes, $636 million more for F-35s, $360 million more for a new  missile defense system, and $283 million more for Apache helicopters. I  am not quite sure what Apache helicopters have to do with a pandemic,  but be that as it may, they did put money in for the helicopters and  for the Pentagon.   Under the Republican bill, if you are a wealthy business executive,  you will get a 100-percent tax deduction for a three-martini lunch--a  100-percent tax deduction for having lunch at some fancy restaurant and  spending another couple hundred dollars on your meal. But if you are  one of the 26 low-income Americans who do not have enough food to eat,  you get nothing in the Republican bill. In other words, when  Republicans, in their bill, refer to nutrition, they are talking about  tax breaks for the rich who eat at expensive restaurants but not one  nickel for the children in this country who are facing hunger.    Under the Republican bill, if you are a profitable defense  contractor, you will receive an additional $11 billion in corporate  welfare, but if you are one of the 92 million Americans who are  uninsured or underinsured, you get nothing.   Under the Republican bill, if you are a business owner who forces  employees to work in an unsafe and unhealthy environment, you are  rewarded. The Republican bill will provide you with the immunity you  need from lawsuits if your workers get sick or die from the  coronavirus. In other words, you have employers who are saying: You  have to come back to work, or else you are going to get fired and not  be able to feed your family. But the working conditions that we are  providing for you are not protective of your health, and if you get  sick, if you die, you are on your own. Don't hold us responsible for  that.   The Republican bill does not provide a nickel for essential workers  during this pandemic, but it does make sure that you do not receive the  hazard pay or the personal protective equipment that you need and  deserve.   Unbelievably--unbelievably--in the richest country in the history of  the world, we have tens of thousands of workers--not only doctors and  nurses but workers from all kinds of professions--who are interacting  with the public who need high-quality personal protective equipment,  and they don't have it.   While the Republican bill slashes unemployment benefits by 43 percent  for 30 million Americans who lost their jobs, it continues a $135  billion tax break to 43,000 millionaires, primarily in the real estate  and hedge fund industry. In other words, we stop the $600 benefit for  unemployment, but we maintain a $135 billion tax break for the wealthy.   It goes without saying that I am strongly opposed to the Senate  Republican proposal. Instead of listening to the needs of the military- industrial complex, we should be listening to the needs of working  families and the poor. Instead of providing more tax breaks to the very  wealthy, we need to provide more economic relief to the tens of  millions of Americans who are hurting economically.   Just last month, I asked my constituents in Vermont and, in fact, all  over this country to write to me, email me, and tell me how the  economic crisis we are in has impacted their lives. We received  thousands and thousands of responses.   I would like to take a moment to read just a few of the many stories  that came into my office because I think sometimes it is very easy for  us to live in a bubble and not really appreciate what is going on. It  is especially more difficult when, because of the pandemic, many of us  can't get out the way we would like to get out. So I used our email  approach to reach out to people in Vermont and around the country and  asked them to tell me what is going on, what is going on in your lives.  Let me just repeat and read to you some of the responses--a few of the  responses that I received.   A gentleman named Dominic from Williston, VT, wrote:         Without the additional $600/week benefit, my benefit will       automatically revert to the minimum $191/week.    So he is now getting $791. If he didn't have that $600, it would be  $191.         At that rate, my wife and I will be in serious crisis       within a month.    Like millions of other people, Dominic does not have a lot of money  in the bank. If he did not get that $600 on top of his unemployment  benefit, which in Vermont, for him, would be $191 a week, he would be  in a serious financial crisis.   Denise from Waitsfield, VT, wrote:         I lost my job due to COVID-19 on March 16, 2020. The PUA       program and the additional $600 per week is keeping our       family out of debt and allowing us to afford our mortgage.       Without PUA and the additional federal stimulus, our family       would not be able to survive financially.    In other words, without the unemployment and that $600 supplement,  her family would not be able to survive financially.   Casey from Burlington, VT, wrote:         I have been unemployed since March 20th and have no job to       return to and limited options for finding a new job in a       timely fashion; losing the extra $600/weekly unemployment       benefit would be devastating for me. I know it would be the       same for so many others, including many friends and family.    Amanda from Isle La Motte, a beautiful town in Northern Vermont,  works, as it happens, while living in Vermont, for an unemployment  office in the State of Massachusetts. She wrote--and this speaks to the  job that she now has:         I have heard heart wrenching stories. I've had moms crying       that they can't feed their kids, families telling me they've       been evicted and are homeless. A single dad who was a self-      employed musician, he cried with me saying his savings had       run out, he had no money for food. This man's story will       stick with me the rest of my life. I've cried so many days       for all these people I can't help. I suggest the government       officials work in an unemployment call center for a day. The       heart-wrenching stories they will hear.    I thank Amanda for that. I thank Amanda for the work she is doing and  what she is trying to do but for reminding us that, in too many  instances, Members of Congress are isolated from the reality that is  taking place out there.   The stories go on and on and on. Now that the $600 a week in  unemployment benefits has expired, now that the moratorium on evictions  has also expired, this crisis is only going to get worse and worse and  worse. In my view, we need to extend the extra $600 a week in  unemployment benefits for the 30 million Americans who have lost their  jobs. I think that is a no-brainer.   People are hurting. People are desperate. People cannot feed their  kids. People are going to be evicted from their homes and their  apartments. We have to respond to that pain and extend that $600  supplement to normal unemployment.   I would go further. I believe that we need to make sure that every  working-class person in this country receives $2,000 a month until this  crisis is over so they can have the security they need that they and  their family are going to survive this crisis with dignity.   And we cannot continue to ignore the reality that 92 million  Americans today are uninsured or underinsured. While I, of course,  believe in Medicare for All and will continue that fight, at least  during this crisis, we should make sure that all of the 92 million who  are uninsured or underinsured get covered by Medicare for their out-of- pocket expenses. It is not asking too much that, during this crisis,  people who have private insurance or Medicare or Medicaid not have to  pay out-of-pocket expenses.   We need a coronavirus relief bill that benefits the working class of  this country and low-income people, not the wealthy and the well  connected.   Now, what I think many people do not fully understand--it doesn't get  a whole lot of attention--is that, during this pandemic, not everybody  is hurting. Not everybody out there needs the Senate to act. While over  30 million Americans have seen their $600 a week in unemployment  benefits expire, thanks to the emergency actions taken by the Federal  Reserve to prop up the stock market, 467 billionaires in this country  have seen their wealth go up  [[Page S4915]]  by over $730 billion since the pandemic has begun. Let me repeat that:  467 billionaires have seen their wealth go up by over $730 billion in  the last several months of this pandemic.   Millions of people are unemployed, struggling to put food on the  table, but 467 billionaires have seen their wealth go up by over $700  billion. Meanwhile, during the last 4 months, while the very, very  wealthy have become much richer, American households have seen their  wealth go down by $6.5 trillion.   In all likelihood, in the midst of everything else we are  experiencing, we are currently looking at what is likely the greatest  transfer of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the very rich  in the modern history of this country. A massive transfer of wealth:  the working-class and middle-class poor getting poorer; the people at  the very, very top becoming phenomenally richer.   In other words, in the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of an  economic meltdown for working families, in the midst of a great  struggle regarding systemic racism and police brutality, in the midst  of the existential threat to our planet of climate change, in the midst  of a President undermining democracy and moving this country in an  authoritarian direction--in the midst of all of that, we are also  seeing a massive increase in income and wealth inequality and the  movement in this country toward oligarchy.   Let me just give you a few examples of the incredible growth in  inequality that is taking place right now as we speak. While Amazon is  denying paid sick leave to its employees, while they are denying hazard  pay and personal protective equipment to 450,000 of their workers, Jeff  Bezos, the owner of Amazon, has increased his wealth by over $70  billion. Yes, one person, during the pandemic, has seen his wealth  increase by $70--7-0--billion.   While U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the starvation wages at Walmart  by providing food stamps and affordable housing and Medicaid to the  workers who are employed by the Walton family of Walmart, the Walton  family--the owner of Walmart--has made over $20 billion during the  pandemic and now has a net worth of over $200 billion. While 40 million  Americans face eviction, Elon Musk has nearly tripled his wealth over  the past 4 months and now has a net worth of more than $70 billion.   While millions of Americans are lining up at emergency food banks  because they don't have enough money to put food on the table, Mark  Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, has increased his wealth by more  than $37 billion during the pandemic and is now worth over $70 billion.   In a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when so many  people in our country are hurting, it is morally obscene for  billionaires to use a global pandemic as an opportunity to make  outrageous profits and to very substantially increase their wealth, and  that is why I will be introducing legislation tomorrow to tax the  obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during this public health  crisis.    According to Americans for Tax Fairness, if we tax 60 percent of the  windfall gains these billionaires made from March 18 until August 3, we  could raise over $420 billion. That is enough revenue to allow Medicare  to pay all of the out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for every man,  woman, and child in this country over the next 12 months.   So that is the choice we have to make. Do we have a tax on the  obscene increase in wealth that has taken place for a few hundred  billionaires during this pandemic or do we have a fair tax on their  wealth and say to every man, woman, and child: During this crisis, you  will no longer have to pay anything out of pocket for the healthcare  you and your family need?   By taxing 60 percent of the wealth gains made by just 467  billionaires--so, in a nation of 330 million people, we are talking  about a tax on 467 of them--a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of 1 percent.  Just by doing that, we could guarantee healthcare as a right for all  people in this country for an entire year.   By the way, if anybody out there is very worried about the impact of  this tax on the billionaires, on the people who are being taxed--how  will they survive a 60-percent tax? That is a high tax. Do you think  they are going to make it? Well, we have left them more than $310  billion to survive with. That is a $310 billion increase in their  wealth. That is what we have left them.   In my view, above and beyond this circumstance, above and beyond the  pandemic, this Nation must address the obscene level of income and  wealth inequality which exists. It existed before the pandemic, and it  is even worse now. In my view, we can no longer tolerate three people  in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of our Nation  at a time when 30 million Americans have lost their jobs and 93 million  people are either uninsured or underinsured. We need to reconsider our  value system and make it clear that so few cannot have so very much,  such obscene wealth--which is exploding during the pandemic--while so  many of our people are living in economic desperation.   Now is the time to develop a new set of priorities and a new set of  moral values for this country. Now is the time to tax the winnings of a  handful of billionaires to improve the health and well-being of tens of  millions of Americans. The time is long overdue for the Senate to act  on behalf of the working class of this country, the people who are  hurting like they have never hurt before--not in our lifetime--and have  the courage to tell the billionaire class, who are doing phenomenally  well, that they cannot have it all.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
