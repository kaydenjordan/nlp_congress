 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to honor the life and service of Decatur Township Supervisor Lisa  Stanley who passed away this weekend after a long health battle.   Lisa Stanley was a dedicated public servant, a lifelong member of the  Decatur community, and a fierce advocate for equality and justice.   Whether it was helping women with high-risk pregnancies, working with  members of the Boys and Girls Club, or serving Illinois and the  citizens of Decatur, Lisa spent her entire career fighting to make a  difference.   As we mourn her loss, let us remember her contributions to our  community and send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones and  everyone who has been touched and inspired by her life of service.                            ____________________
