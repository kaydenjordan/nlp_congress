 Soon, we will be voting on Judge Jackson's nomination,  and I would like to explain why I am voting against her appointment to  the Supreme Court.   Since the White House announced Judge Jackson's nomination, I have  emphasized the need for a thorough and fair process. Unfortunately, the  majority party weren't concerned about the rigorous examination of her  record. The White House and the majority party have shielded important  information. We don't have any nonpublic document from her time at the  Sentencing Commission, and the Obama White House held back more than  48,000 pages.   Judge Jackson also gave the White House confidential, nonpublic  probation recommendations for some of her  [[Page S2064]]  cases, but when we asked about a probation document filed on the  Hawkins case, Judge Jackson claimed that she was not able to access  records for her old cases because that was allegedly because she was no  longer on the district court. And we now know that she sits on the DC  Circuit Court of Appeals.   Now, if that is true, there are many unanswered questions about how  information the White House thought was helpful was so easily obtained.  So we should take into account that all the helpful information has  already been leaked.   That brings me to the merits of Judge Jackson's nomination. For  judicial nominees, their philosophy ought to decide--how to decide  cases ought to be a primary consideration.   Part of having a judicial philosophy is having an understanding of  the fundamental principles of our Constitution. Natural rights are a  part of that system. Judge Jackson explained to us that she does not  ``hold a position on whether individuals possess natural rights.''   Now, that ought to be very shocking. Natural rights are basic to our  constitutional system and principles of limited government. Because we  all know our country was founded on the belief that is expressed in the  Declaration of Independence:         All men are created equal [and] they are endowed by their       Creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are       the Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.    And that was further nailed down in the Constitution of the United  States.   Our Constitution vests the three branches of government with very  limited power. All other powers not given to the Federal Government are  reserved for the States and to the people thereof.   The principle of limited government is what makes America an  exceptional nation and sets our Constitution apart. Judges must have a  proper understanding of those basic principles; and the way Judge  Jackson answered those questions, particularly the answers she gave to  Senator Cruz, shows that she lacks that very necessary foundation.   Now, I want to go on to a few other examples. At the hearing, Judge  Jackson testified about one of her decisions involving the First Step  Act. In that case, prosecutors had rock-solid evidence against a  dangerous drug kingpin, but Judge Jackson was displeased the government  pursued a mandatory minimum sentence.   So she misused a motion for compassionate release to resentence that  person to a sentence she thought he deserved.   As the lead author of the First Step Act, I know that is not what we  wrote the statute to do. The act was supposed to allow elderly inmates  and those suffering from terminal illness to petition the court for a  sentence reduction. The statute also allows for a reduction if the  court finds an ``extraordinary and compelling reason.''   Judges should use great discretion. Judges should weigh against the  charge, the dangers to society, and the risk of recidivism.   At her hearing, Judge Jackson said that she based her ``extraordinary  and compelling'' finding on the nonretroactive changes to the law. This  radical interpretation is terrible and dangerous.   Congress chose which provisions the First Step Act would apply  retroactively. The Senate is currently considering legislation that I  cosponsored with Chairman Durbin that makes some of the First Step Act  provisions retroactive, but that is Congress's role, not Judge  Jackson's role.   Senator Durbin and I wouldn't have been able to broker a compromise  on that legislation if Senators thought the judges would rewrite the  law and insert their own views from the bench. Decisions like this will  make bipartisan work, particularly on criminal justice reform, harder  to do.   A case by the name of Young is just one example of Judge Jackson's  lenient approach to criminal law and sentencing. She also declined to  apply a number of sentencing enhancements that Congress put into the  sentencing guidelines.   A case by the name of Make the Road New York v. McAleenan is another  case that shows how Judge Jackson used her methodology to reach a  result that contradicts the plain text of the law. Congress gave the  Secretary of Homeland Security--and these are the words from the law-- ``sole and unreviewable discretion'' to decide whether illegal  immigrants should be subject to expedited removal within 2 years. Judge  Jackson reviewed the Agency's decision anyway, and it seems clear why.   She went out of her lane to comment on the policy as, in her words,  ``a terrible proposal.'' And she claimed that the government attorneys  made an argument that ``reeks of bad faith.'' ``Reeks of bad faith''  are her words.   In fact, her decision and her rhetoric are unfounded. So that is why  her decision earned a strong rebuke from the panel of liberal and  conservative judges when she was reversed by the DC Circuit.   Judge Millett, an Obama appointee, explained it this way in the  opinion:         [T]here could hardly be a more definitive expression of       congressional intent [than] . . . ``sole and unreviewable       discretion.''    These are just a few examples of Judge Jackson's judicial activism.  Because her record clearly shows she does not believe in or act within  the limited and proper role of a judge, I will vote against her  confirmation.   I yield the floor.    The majority leader is going to come to the floor, and  I will yield the floor for him when he comes here, but I would like to  yield the floor without losing the right to the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to thank my staff who  worked on this nomination.   First, I would like to recognize the contributions of Kolan Davis, my  chief counsel and staff director. Kolan was assisted by Brendan  Chestnut, my chief counsel for nominations.   The staff in the nominations unit also worked incredibly hard on this  nomination. They include Lauren Mehler, Gabi Kenny, Vetan Kapoor, and  Raija Munk.   The permanent nominations team received some reinforcements for this  Supreme Court nomination. Annie Croslow joined my staff to lead the  team of special counsels assisting on this nomination. That team  includes Annika Boone, Kyle Cole, Isaac Fong, Jenna Lorence, Daniel  Morales, and Luke Zaro. This team scoured Judge Jackson's record. They  spent countless hours reviewing her opinions, her speeches, and pulling  filings and transcripts for her cases. Their exhaustive review helped  the Republicans on the committee prepare for her confirmation process.   I also want to thank the communications director, Taylor Foy, as well  as the deputy communications director, George Hartmann, Aaron Britt,  Annie Richardson, Jennifer Heins, and Megan Behrends also contributed  to the communications effort.   Other staff also helped review and prepare for the nomination,  including Dave Lewen, Lauren Stimpert, Rachel Wright, Erin Creegan,  Tianna Torrejon, and Chesney Mallory, as well as law clerks Carly  Hviding, Luke Bunting, and Noelle Daniel.   Finally, I want to thank the rest of my Judiciary Committee staff for  their continued work during this process and also thank my deputy staff  director, Rita Lari, for her advice and leadership.    Madam President, lots of pundits are trying to get into  President Putin's head and looking for some so-called off-ramp. Now, I  am not a pundit, and I do not pretend to be able to read Putin's mind.  However, I do listen carefully to those closest to Russia who have  better insights than the American pundits, academics, and foreign  policy theorists.   I happen to be cochair of the Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus, so I  interact regularly with Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians--three  countries that in 1940 the Soviet Union absorbed into it, and then  since about 1990, they have been independent of Russia. So you can see  these countries are historically Western in every sense except  geography, but they have had a long and often painful exposure to the  Russian-Soviet-KGB way of thinking.   Our Baltic friends can help others in the West who cannot seem to  fathom what is going through Putin's mind. The fact that we cannot  understand Putin's mindset is because he doesn't think like modern  Western leaders.   Now, this is important insight from my Baltic contacts. Putin is  stuck in the 17th and 18th centuries. Now, you know I like history, so  this is something that I can understand. Putin thinks like a czar  expanding his empire. He regrets the collapse of the Soviet Union--not  because of communist ideology but because it reconstituted the Russian  empire.   In foreign policy, it is easy to assume other countries are just like  us. Experts don't know what to make of an 18th-century imperialist.   Some observers have speculated that Putin has gone crazy because he  does not seem to be acting rationally, but from the standpoint of  someone who thinks Ukraine is not a real country, as Putin has said for  decades, and who regrets the collapse of the ``evil empire,'' he is  acting rationally.   Our Baltic allies have been warning the West that Putin is an  aggressor since well before the current invasion of Ukraine, before the  2014 invasion of neutral Ukraine, before the disastrous Obama  administration ``reset'' of relations with Russia, and before the 2008  invasion of Georgia.   The Baltics have often been dismissed as hysterical or Russophobic or  at least exaggerating when they warn about Russia. Well, the world has  awakened to the fact that the Baltics were right all along.   We should have armed Ukraine to the teeth years ago. Putin only  understands strength.   What lessons should have been learned from Putin's pattern of  aggression over the years? Putin only understands strength, and  weakness is provocative.   During the Hungarian uprising of 1956, when the Hungarian people were  protesting to break free of Soviet control, the Eisenhower  administration in this country paid lipservice to the aspirations for  freedom but was secretly obsessed with not provoking the Soviets.   Eisenhower's Secretary of State, Dulles, made his speech in Dallas,  TX, where he said this:         The [United States] has no ulterior purpose in desiring the       independence of the satellite countries. . . . We do not look       upon these nations as potential military allies. So you can  see the expansion of NATO today proves how wrong Dulles was at that  time.    However, after the Dulles speech, he then cabled the U.S. Embassy in  Moscow, instructing that this be brought to the attention of the  highest Soviet authorities. Any wonder why Hungary wasn't freed at that  time?   The Estonian historian and also its former Prime Minister, Mart Laar,  maintains that this message from Dulles was interpreted by Moscow as a  carte blanche to intervene and the Americans would not stand in the  way. That is why he titled the relevant chapter in his book on the rise  and fall of communism in the region ``The lost opportunity: 1956.''   So what do our Baltic friends advise right now in the face of Putin's  threats to escalate if we supply Ukraine with fighter jets or other  advanced weapons?   Believe it or not, their advice is to relax. In other words, don't  overreact to Putin's threats.   We have a nuclear deterrent and Putin knows that. The more we show we  are scared by his threats, the harder he will push. And we absolutely  need to stop declaring what we will not do in regard to Russia's  invasion of Ukraine. That just seems to embolden Putin to push harder.   The failure to push back the previous Russian aggressions--and that  is not just a Biden problem. That is a problem of both Republican and  Democratic Presidents before. Also the failure to enforce previous  redlines in Syria and the perception of weakness from the Afghanistan  pullout debacle--those three things are at least part of the reason for  what is going on in Ukraine.   I hope President Biden has picked up on this as well.   Now is the time to redouble our efforts to reinforce Ukraine. Putin  appears to have accepted that he cannot conquer all of Ukraine, but he  is very definitely repositioning his forces to take as big of a chunk  of the country as he can.   Ukraine must win this war--on to victory. Anything short of a Ukraine  victory is an invitation for further Russian aggression elsewhere and,  who knows, maybe even encouraging China.   We have got to stop the finger-pointing. We have got to stop the  excuses, and we have got to get Ukraine air defenses, drones, and  anything else to shift the balance.   To date, the United States and our allies have supplied the heroic  Ukrainian military with the kinds of weapons that have allowed them to  hang on while their cities are shelled and civilians are massacred.   The battle for Kyiv may have been won, but the battle for the east is  only going to intensify. Unless we tip the balance, this could go on  for a long, long time.   We have seen how brutal the Russian occupation has been in just 1  month. Imagine months and months of this in eastern Ukraine.   I have a bill with my friend Senator Durbin to guarantee that the  United States will backfill certain critical weapons transferred to  Ukraine by our eastern flank of NATO allies. Many NATO countries have  been very generous in handing over their weapons to Ukraine. This is  leaving a security gap in those very countries. But they know that if  Putin isn't stopped in Ukraine, then those countries are at greater  risk. As Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas says, Putin cannot even  think he has won or his appetite will only grow.   Some of our NATO allies also have air defense systems and drones that  could make a big difference in Ukraine.   There are rumors of negotiations to supply items needed in Ukraine,  provided there is agreement to acquire American replacements. My bill  with Durbin would provide that assurance up front without the redtape  that seems to be involved in almost everything we do to help Ukraine.   Putin has talked constantly about what he calls ``demilitarization  and denazification'' as his justification for launching this brutal  invasion of Ukraine. That phrase does not make much sense on its face,  but, again, we have to keep in mind that Putin has an imperial mindset.   No military analyst looking at Ukraine and Russia could possibly  think that Ukraine posed any military threat to Russia. The Russian  military dwarfs the Ukrainian one in manpower as well as equipment. In  fact, it is clear that Putin and his military leaders underestimated  the fighting ability of the Ukrainians.   The same is frankly true of NATO's military power along Russia's  borders. What Putin means by ``demilitarizing'' is to shrink Ukraine's  military to the point that that country is indefensible. He wants  Ukraine totally susceptible to Russian threats, meaning back within  Russia's sphere of influence.   Now, what about the term ``denazification''? Ever since World War II,  Soviet leaders routinely labeled those in the Soviet Republics who  expressed a desire for independence that they were fascist or Nazi. It  is pretty clear that Putin's initial goal was to  [[Page S2075]]  eliminate Ukraine's current government, starting with President  Zelenskyy. So despite being descended from Holocaust survivors,  denazification starts, from Putin's point of view, by eliminating a  Jewish President, Zelenskyy.    A recent article in a Russian state-run publication, RIA Novosti,  confirmed that denazification means that the elected government must be  eliminated as well as the Ukrainian military. But this article goes on  to say:         However, in addition to the top, a significant part of the       masses who are passive Nazis, accomplices of Nazism, are also       guilty. They supported and indulged Nazi power. . . .       Denazification will inevitably be de-Ukrainianization.    This ought to be very chilling to all of us, especially in light of  the massacre at Bucha that we saw on television this week and other  Ukrainian cities.   That statement reminds me of this quote from Catherine the Great  after she completed her takeover of an independent Ukrainian state just  10 years before our own Declaration of Independence:         Every effort should be made to eradicate them and their age       from memory.    ``Them'' meaning the Ukrainians.   Stalin killed millions of Ukrainians by intentionally starving them  to death with the same goal in the early 1930s.   Now, you know that Putin has praised Stalin and is now imitating  Stalin.   The U.N. Genocide Convention defines genocide to mean ``any of the  following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a  national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such: (a) Killing  members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to  members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group  conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction  in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births  within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to  another group.''   That sure seems to fit with what we know about Putin and his  occupation of Ukraine.   There is one last lesson that we can learn from our Baltic friends.  Despite the murder and deportation to Siberia of masses of Estonians,  Latvians, and Lithuanians to suppress their national identity, there  were 10 years of active guerilla warfare by bands of what they called  Forest Brothers. In fact, resistance never really ended until the  Baltic countries threw off Soviet rule.   I will leave you with the first few lines of the Ukrainian national  anthem:       The glory and freedom of Ukraine has not yet perished.      Luck will still smile on us, brother-Ukrainians.      Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,      And we, too, brothers, we'll live happily in our land.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
