 Mr. Speaker, I rise on the anniversary of the House  passage of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act.   It is has been 1 year since we stood together in this Chamber,  Democrats and Republicans, and voted to pass a commonsense bill that  will help save lives; 1 year since we voted to prevent unnecessary gun  deaths and keep guns away from those who should not have them; 1 year  since we acted to protect our children, to protect our communities, and  to protect our families.   One hundred Americans die every single day from gun violence. In  2020, there have already been more gun deaths in the United States than  our peer countries will experience in an entire year. That is  unconscionable, and it is why 90 percent of our country supports  universal background checks.   Yet, we are told that, instead of changing our laws, we must have  more active-shooter drills; more first graders coming home with tears  in their eyes, 6-year-olds asked to decide for themselves whether they  are more likely to survive by hiding in a closet or if they should rush  the gunman; more mother's reading messages from their children locked  inside a school that plead: Mom, if I don't make it home, I love you,  and I appreciate everything that you have done for me.   Too often we are told that we must accept these tragedies, but  millions of Americans refuse to accept that, and I stand with them.   Today marks 1 year since we passed the Bipartisan Background Checks  Act.   Tomorrow marks 1 year since the passage of the Enhanced Background  Check Act, which would close the Charleston loophole.   I introduced a bill that would give loved ones and law enforcement  more tools to keep guns away from those who are a danger to themselves  or to others, tools that would help people like Mary Miller-Strobel,  whose brother, Ben, was a combat veteran suffering from depression and  PTSD.   Mary and her family worried about his mental health, and they drove  to every gun store in their area pleading with the store owners not to  sell her brother a gun. Ben Miller died by suicide. He used the gun he  bought at his local gun store.                                time  1015    There is injustice in this year without action. I know that sense of  injustice. On black Friday in November 2012, my son Jordan was sitting  in the back seat of a car at a gas station with his  [[Page H1229]]  friends. A man pulled up next to them and complained about the loud  music that they were playing.   He pulled out a gun and he fired 10 shots into that car hitting  Jordan three times, killing my only son.   I lost my son. But I am still his mother and I am on a mission to  help protect the lives of children like him all over America.   I made a promise to my community that I would act in Washington.   I promised that I would take that sense of protection, that love a  mother has for her only son, and use it for my community, use it for  the American people.   I promised I would dedicate my life to families like mine in  Marietta, Georgia, who are terrified that they will send their kids to  school and never see them come home. They are terrified they will be  me.   I pray that on the 1-year anniversary of H.R. 8, that we remember  that this is in our hands. We remember families like Mary's. We  remember children graduating from high school. We remember Florida. We  remember communities all across this country. Their lives are in our  hands.   I want to thank my colleagues, survivors, and volunteers, and  advocates across America that are here with us today for your tireless  work to pass this landmark legislation and protect our families.   I pray that God bless us all in this fight to save American lives.                            ____________________
