 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th  birthday of Mr. John Barfield from my home State of Louisiana.   Mr. Barfield served in World War II under George S. Patton as part of  the ``Hell-on-Wheels'' 2nd Armored Division. He was deployed to many  different posts throughout Europe and northern Africa and fought in  nine  [[Page H1564]]  major battles, including D-day and the Battle of the Bulge. During his  time in service, he was wounded twice and awarded two Purple Hearts for  his bravery and his sacrifice.   Please join me in wishing a happy birthday to a true American hero,  Mr. John Barfield, whose courage and dedication to this country are  second to none.                            ____________________
