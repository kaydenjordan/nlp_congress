 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I object.   I also want to thank the Senator from Utah for his consideration.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, now I would ask unanimous consent that it  be in order to call up the following amendments to the Reed-Inhofe  substitute amendment No. 3867, as modified, in the order listed, and  that these be the only remaining amendments in order: 1, Cruz No. 4656;  2, Kaine No. 4133; 3, Peters-Portman No. 4799; 4, Scott of Florida No.  4831; 5, Marshall No. 4093; 6, King-Rounds No. 4784; 7, Hawley No.  4140; 8 Hassan-Cornyn No. 4255; 9, Paul No. 4395; 10, Sanders No. 4654;  11, Daines No. 4236; 12, Menendez No. 4786; 13, Lujan-Crapo No. 4260;  14, Lee No. 4793; 15, Sanders No. 4722; 16, Portman-Shaheen No. 4540;  17, Menendez No. 4860; 18, Risch No. 4859; 19, Durbin-Lee No. 3939; 20,  Shaheen-Collins No. 4584; 21, Kennedy No. 4660; 22, Ossoff-Tillis No.  4802; 23, Lankford No. 4100; 24, Cardin-Wicker No. 3980; that the  Senate vote at 10 a.m. on Thursday, December 2, in relation to any  first-degree amendment offered in the order listed above, with 60- affirmative votes required for adoption of the above amendments in this  agreement; further, that upon disposition of the above amendments, the  Senate vote on cloture on amendment No. 3867, as modified, upon  reconsideration; and the motion to invoke cloture on H.R. 4350 be  withdrawn; that if cloture is invoked upon reconsideration, the Reed  amendment No. 4775 be withdrawn and the Senate vote on the substitute,  as modified and as amended, if amended; that the bill be considered  read a third time and the Senate vote on the passage of the bill, as  amended, if amended; and that there be 2 minutes for debate, equally  divided in the usual form, prior to each vote, all without further  intervening action or debate.     Madam President, I object to the modification.    Madam President, in reserving my right to object, the  Senator from Florida is right.   The key issue here is the blue slip, which originates from the  constitutional language mandating that all revenue bills must begin in  the House of Representatives. If it is determined by the House that it  is a revenue bill, then anyone--I am informed in the House--can object,  not just to the amendment of the gentleman from Florida but to the  entire bill.   Essentially, if we pursue this, we would put at risk the entire  National Defense Authorization Act for reasons that could be related to  the issue the Senator from Florida brings up, but it could be related  to many other issues, and there are quite a few issues in this bill.   So, for that reason, I would object to the modification.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
