 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to express the extent to  which I am proud of my constituents in southwestern Connecticut in  Connecticut's Fourth Congressional District, but also to observe that  just as in this country we have work to do in addressing the racial  disparities that exists in all of our institutions, we have work to do  in Connecticut's Fourth District.   Mr. Speaker, I was enormously proud that after we began to bend the  curve on coronavirus--thanks to the leadership of our Governor, Ned  Lamont--just as we saw those numbers begin to decline, like the rest of  the country, my constituents were appalled by the brutal murder of  George Floyd in Minneapolis. Nobody was unaffected by what we saw that  day.   To the great credit of my constituents, people rose up in the broad  diversity of my constituency. My constituency includes some of the  wealthiest, small, and--yes--very White towns in the country: Towns  like New Canaan and Darien. It also includes diverse cities that  struggle with the issues of urban poverty: Bridgeport, Norwalk, and  Stamford.    But as one, my constituents rose up--young, old, poor, wealthy,  Black, White, straight, LGBTQ--and demanded progress and change, and  they did it peacefully. They did it side by side with the leaders of  the Police Department of Stamford, of Wilton, of New Canaan--police  chiefs standing side by side with Black Lives Matter protestors. That  was a good thing. That was an example of how we come together in the  face of something awful.   But I also rise because there is no room for complacency. I remind my  fellow citizens of Connecticut, while we are a progressive State, and  while we did come together in all of our communities, it could happen  here. I remind my constituents that Connecticut was actually the last  State in New England in 1848 to eliminate slavery. That is just a few  years before Abraham Lincoln did so in the South and around the  country. So there is no place for complacency amongst my constituents.   And the truth is, as I have observed and many have observed, what  happened to George Floyd is the pinnacle atop a structure of four  centuries of racism and discrimination. Of course, George Floyd is not  alone. The names echo in the chamber of shame in this country.   Breonna Taylor. Tamir Rice. Ahmaud Arbery. The names echo, and they  go on and on.   But those Black Americans who have been killed unjustly sit atop a  structure of the denial of equal access to opportunity. And that is in  our systems of housing, our systems of education, and in the private  sector.   So even as I celebrate and express my pride in my constituents, we  need to be there for the broader struggle. We need to be there as we  consider how we make one of the more segregated parts--at least with  respect to housing in the United States--more fair. We need to be there  when we contemplate the fact that too many of our Black and Brown  brothers and sisters don't have the access to the extraordinary  educational institutions in the State of Connecticut and around the  country.   Mr. Speaker, we need to be there. It is good to show up and protest  peacefully when a Black man is murdered at the hands of the police, but  it is not enough because that act sits atop an edifice--a four-century  long edifice--of discrimination, the effects of which still echo  through every aspect of our society.   Mr. Speaker, it is not just my constituents. It is this Chamber and  this Congress that must get serious about addressing the unequal  distribution of opportunity in this country. That is our mission. I  just said goodbye, with so many of my colleagues, to  John Lewis. I  know that is what John would have us do, and I know that he would have  us do it with grace and with dignity and humility.   Mr. Speaker, that is what I charge my constituents with, and that is  what I hope this Congress will address, in the memory of  John Lewis,  who just left us this morning.                            ____________________
