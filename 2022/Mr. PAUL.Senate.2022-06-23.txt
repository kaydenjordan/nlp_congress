 No. Go ahead.    Mr. President, Jon Miltimore, who writes for the Foundation  for Economics and Education writes:         Red flag laws don't involve precogs seeing into the future.       Yet, like precrime, they are designed to prevent a crime       before it happens, even if it means violating civil rights in       the process.    Miltimore asks several important questions: Can people who are  flagged as threats be involuntarily committed? Are they appointed legal  counsel? Will a Federal database be established to track flagged  citizens?   These are questions that civil libertarians should be asking,  especially since many people who are red-flagged will have committed no  crime.   There will simply be, like Philip Dick's ``Anderton,'' people who  might commit or might be a danger to someone. Miltimore reminds us that  the idea of precrime didn't originate with ``The Minority Report.'' In  ``1984,'' Orwell writes that Big Brother's ``endless purges, arrests,  tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations'' are not the result of  people breaking laws, for there are no laws in Oceania. These  punishments, readers learn, are merely the wiping out of persons who  perhaps might commit a crime at some time in the future.   Red flag laws are well-intentioned. Everyone is searching for a way  to prevent the senseless massacres of school mass shootings.   I think accessing the violent criminal records of juveniles is a  reasonable way to try to prevent these killings. Though, really, most  States have already laws on the books that criminalize threats of  violence. The problem isn't a lack of laws to stop these killers, it is  a lack of persistent application of existing laws.   The shooters at Parkland and Buffalo both committed criminal threats  in advance of their killing sprees, and yet law enforcement did not  vigilantly prosecute them. Instead of seeking to enforce existing laws,  States have, one after another, instituted red flag laws to use gun  confiscation orders to try to predict crime in advance.   The problem comes in trying to create such laws and still protect the  constitutional right to bear arms for the innocent.   Basic aspects of the Constitution should not be abandoned, such as  the right to confront your accuser. Some red flag laws allow anonymous  accusers to initiate a gun confiscation order.   That is not just, and that is not constitutional.   We should not abandon the right to legal counsel, the right to  confront the evidence. Many State red flag laws allow gun confiscation  orders without the defendant even knowing they have been accused of  anything. Many State red flag laws allow guns to be confiscated without  hearing evidence from both sides.   Jacob Sullum, in Reason, writes of Colorado's red flag law that the  standard of proof for the initial gun confiscation order when the  accused does not have an opportunity to respond--see, for the initial  order, the accused is not present or doesn't need to be present, and  the evidence comes from one side. But the standard that is used is  called the preponderance of the evidence, meaning the standard used is  that the accused is more likely than not to pose a significant risk.   Historically, gun rights were only removed when the defendant was  convicted of a crime using a constitutional standard of ``beyond a  reasonable doubt.''   As Philip Mulivor writes at PJ Media:         Because ``reasonable doubt'' has been long established as       the standard of proof for criminal cases, it must naturally       apply to judicial proceedings in which an individual, who has       not even been charged with a crime, can be stripped of a       constitutional right. Nevertheless, red-flag laws often rely       on ``a preponderance of the evidence,'' a radically       diminished standard of proof. This, above all other       injuries--    According to Philip Mulivor--       to due process, offends our system of liberty and [a] fair       trial.    Colorado's red flag law, as well as many other States', confiscates  guns using a less-than-constitutional standard.   Using a preponderance-of-evidence standard, which is a standard lower  than the Constitution uses for criminal cases, allows a gun  confiscation order when a judge decides that it is a better than 50-50  chance of a person being a ``significant risk.''   Think about that. It is a little better than 50-50 that the person  who has come before me, whom I have heard evidence only from the person  who doesn't like that person--it is 50-50, maybe it is 51-49, but I am  going to take away a constitutional right, whereas in a court  proceeding where you are convicted of a crime, where you lose your gun  rights because of a felony, the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt.   In practice, the other problem with the red flag laws is that judges  will be inclined to err on the side of caution. When the only evidence  comes from someone who believes the respondent poses a threat, judges  will rarely, if ever, decline to issue a temporary gun confiscation  order.   One might ask if our laws should allow the abridgement of a  constitutional right when only one side of the evidence is presented.  Imagine if the proceeding is a complaint filed by an unhappy spouse in  the midst of a divorce. Most cases of divorce involve one side cheating  or at least one side lying. It is exceedingly difficult to ascertain  the truth in a divorce proceeding even when both sides are heard. One  can just imagine what mischief might occur if divorce proceedings only  allowed testimony from one side.   If you think red flag laws will be easy to adjudicate, just imagine  the case involving Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.   As Sullum points out, there is--from the judge's point of view, ``The  possible downside of rejecting a petition''--a serious downside--``the  death of a respondent or someone else--will weigh  [[Page S3125]]  heavily on the judge's mind, while the temporary deprivation of the  subject's constitutional rights will seem trivial by comparison.''   The presumption will be, if the temporary order, where you only heard  evidence from one side, was granted, that the judge is taking a real  risk by overturning or not granting the permanent order when evidence  is actually heard on both sides.   So you begin with a temporary order--it is ex parte; you don't have  legal counsel; evidence is only heard from one side--but then you get  to the next stage and you say: Well, the person gets justice later.  They are going to get a lawyer. There will be a proceeding. There will  be due process at a later date.   Yet the cards are stacked because think of the perspective of the  judge, think of the predicament of the judge. He now has before him an  emergency order that says this person is a dangerous person. For him or  her to rule otherwise, they are taking a big risk because the first  judge or the first ruling said this person is dangerous. Now the judge  has to say and has to somehow attest and prove and live with themselves  that he is now attesting this person is not a danger.   But the first hearing was only one side of the evidence. The first  hearing may have been an aggrieved party in a divorce. It may have been  an unhappy person who doesn't like you at work. It may have been  someone who doesn't like your political views and is reading online and  says, that so-and-so had a picture of a gun, or that so-and-so made  some sort of violent innuendo. Read Twitter. Find out how much of that  is going on. There is a danger to this.    It is not that anyone is downplaying the sad, awful nature of these  massacres and that we don't want to stop them, but we should do it in a  fashion consistent with the Constitution.   With the red flag law, the initial hearing has evidence only from  those who accuse you of something. That cannot be justice. The bedrock  aspect of justice in our country is that you get legal counsel, that  there is a debate back and forth.   Go to family court--and you think some of this won't originate from  family court? You think there is not going to be an angry spouse who  says: My husband cheated on me. My husband is a hunter. I am going to  accuse him of something so I can get his guns taken away from him.   You have to hear both sides. How could you only hear from the angry  spouse? In divorce, we don't hear from one side. How could we have a  hearing where you take away an amendment--or take away a constitutional  right from the Bill of Rights without hearing evidence on both sides?   You say: Well, we will hear it at the second hearing 14 days later.   The problem with the second hearing is you now have a judge who feels  the incumbent pressure of not changing an initial ruling, a feeling of,  well, we have already decided this person is a threat, and now I have  to take the responsibility of guaranteeing they are not a threat.   See, if you had the jurisprudence, if you had the due process in the  first hearing, then you wouldn't have to worry so much about it being  fair in the second hearing. If you have time to go before a judge, I  see no reason why you don't have time to have your attorney present.  They have time enough to have a hearing. They have time enough to hear  the person accusing you. Shouldn't they have time enough to have  someone defending you?   In Colorado, a temporary gun confiscation order lasts for about 14  days, at which point the judge has to schedule a hearing where the  accused finally has a chance to challenge the claims.   At this second proceeding, the legal standard is a little greater--at  least in Colorado. It goes from preponderance or 50-50--slightly better  than 50-50--it goes from a standard of that to a standard that is  ``clear and convincing evidence.''   Under Colorado's red flag law, though, the first gun confiscation  order needs to show imminent risk, but when you get to the second  order, interestingly--the order that is going to last a year--you don't  have to prove that the person is an imminent risk; all you have to say  is that they might be a risk at some point in time. So we have lost  sort of the imminence to it.   In 14 days, the imminence is gone, and now we have a proceeding where  we are going to hear evidence on both sides, and you can have counsel-- not always guaranteed counsel, but you at least can have a lawyer  present. In order to remove a gun confiscation order, though, and  recover one's Second Amendment rights, the burden, though, is now  placed on the accused.   So there is something that is very, very common and is throughout all  of our jurisprudence: that you are innocent until proven guilty; the  burden is on the government. But now, once you have gone through one of  these gun-restraining orders, in order to get your rights back, you  have to prove that you are not a risk. The burden is now on the accused  to prove that either you are sane or that you are not a risk. It is  proving a negative. If you never were a risk, how do you prove that you  are no longer a risk? How do you prove you are the negative of  something? How do you prove that you are not a risk? This turns typical  jurisprudence on its head. Instead of innocent until proven guilty, the  burden is for the accused to prove his or her innocence. This is the  opposite of what our jurisprudence system was founded upon.   Sullum writes:         If the judge issues a [gun confiscation order], it lasts       for 364 days unless the subject seeks early termination and       shows by clear and convincing evidence that he [or she] does       not pose a significant risk.    Rhode Island's red flag law is similar, remaining in effect for about  a year before the accused can challenge it.   For the accused to restore his Second Amendment rights, once again,  the burden is on the accused to prove they are innocent.   The ACLU of Rhode Island asks an important question: How does one  prove this negative, and how does one do it with such a high burden of  proof? The ACLU concludes that in ending a gun confiscation order,  ``the burden should be on the GOVERNMENT to prove by clear and  convincing evidence that it should remain in effect, not on the accused  to halt the continued imposition.''   This is the ACLU of Rhode Island saying the burden should be on the  government the same way the burden is traditionally in any other court  proceeding in our country. You don't have to prove you are innocent;  the government must prove you are guilty.    If the government is going to take away your Second Amendment right,  shouldn't the government have to prove that you are either a threat or  that you are guilty of something?   Eagle County Sheriff James Van Beek notes that when the subject of a  gun confiscation order tries to have it terminated, ``the burden of  proof is not on the [government], as it is in every other legal case,  but instead, is placed on the [accused] to prove that the accusations  are wrong.''   Sheriff Van Beek explains that ``proving one's sanity could be very  difficult, as it is highly subjective.'' But proof of one's sanity is  not enough to remove a valid gun confiscation order since the accused  can be a threat even if determined to be sane.   Van Beek also worries that ``if a person is truly in a mental crisis,  this aggressive approach will create even greater stress, possibly  resulting in a violent overreaction, as their personal property has  been taken without a crime ever having been committed.''   In Maryland, this is precisely what happened. When police attempted  to serve a gun confiscation order, a fight ensued. The person was  startled by it. He had never heard there was a problem. They showed up  at his house, and he ended up dying in the ensuing altercation.   When police seize guns from the subject of a gun confiscation order,  Sheriff Van Beek notes, ``[t]here is no warning or ability to defend  themselves against the charges.''   In addition, if troubled individuals understand that seeking care  exposes them to the risk of a gun confiscation order, some may be  inclined to avoid psychiatric help.   With the large universe of people who can initiate a gun confiscation  complaint, from ex-girlfriends, to former roommates, to grandparents,  to in-laws, to second cousins, Sullum concludes that ``the  opportunities for malice or honest error are multiplied.''   In some ways, the process really is biased throughout because of the  risk  [[Page S3126]]  aversion on the part of the judge. Once a gun confiscation order is  issued and the accused has been labeled a threat, many judges will  simply not want the responsibility of judging otherwise because of the  deadly consequences if they are wrong.   Sullum concludes:         Given that bias, the indeterminacy of ``significant risk,''       and the difficulty of predicting [an accused's] behavior, it       seems inevitable that the vast majority of people who lose       their constitutional rights under this sort of law will [in       actuality] pose no real threat to themselves or others.    Philip Mulivor, writing at PJ Media on the constitutional  deficiencies of gun confiscation orders, points out another deficiency.  He says:         The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine, a cornerstone of American       jurisprudence, requires laws to be written ``in a manner that       does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory       enforcement.''    He goes on to say:         By forcing a judge to predict a person's future criminal       behavior in the absence of any violation of law, red-flag       statutes descend to the most disreputable level of       ``arbitrary and discriminatory'' legislation.    Mulivor concludes that ``due process is always denied when a law  fails to comport with the Vagueness Doctrine's imperative for clear and  consistent standards.''         Fortunately, the Vagueness Doctrine--    This is also Mulivor's point--         is most likely to prevail when an ambiguous law threatens a       constitutional right, such as free speech or the right to       keep and bear arms.    The ACLU of Rhode Island has written perhaps one of the best reasoned  critiques of red flag laws.   The ACLU of Rhode Island writes:         We are deeply concerned about [the red flag law's] breadth,       its impact on civil liberties, and the precedent it sets for       the use of coercive measures against individuals not because       they are alleged to have committed any crime, but because       somebody believes they might someday commit one.    The ACLU of Rhode Island writes that the court order authorized by  this legislation would be issued without any indication that the person  poses an imminent threat to others. The order would be issued without  any evidence that the person ever committed, or has even threatened to  commit, an act of violence with a firearm.   The ACLU continues: The Rhode Island red flag law--that the standard  for seeking and issuing an order is so broad it could routinely be used  against people who engage in overblown political rhetoric on social  media.   Realize what we are talking about here. We are talking about red flag  laws being used against people for overblown political rhetoric. If you  have been on social media, that is 90 percent of what is on social  media.   This is, once again, the ACLU of Rhode Island: Without the presence  of counsel, individuals who have no intent to commit violent crimes  could nonetheless unwittingly incriminate themselves regardless of  lesser offenses because, when they are brought in without a lawyer,  they can be questioned as to other things that could possibly be  illegal.   ``The heart of the legislation''--Rhode Island's gun confiscation  orders--``requires speculation--on the part of both the petitioner''-- the accuser--``and judges--about an individual's risk of possible  violence.''   Mulivor writes:         But psychiatry and the medical sciences have not succeeded       in this realm, and there is no basis for believing courts       will do any better.    He concludes that the potential impact on individuals subject to  these gun confiscation orders involves much more than a long-term  seizure of lawfully owned firearms.   This is once again from the Rhode Island ACLU. They point out that  without a right to appointed counsel, respondents can be forced to  submit to a mental health evaluation, be subject to fairly widespread  notifications even before a court order has been used against them,  face contempt proceedings and prison for failing to abide by any part  of the order and unwittingly place themselves in danger.   So the Rhode Island red flag law actually requires that people be  notified that you are a risk to them, that they are a potential victim,  before the order is issued. So we are not talking just about the lack  of due process in the sense that you don't have a lawyer there, you may  not have been accused of a crime or informed that you might be  potentially going to commit a crime, but, also, in advance of the judge  even making the judgment, the police are told that if this accusation  is being made, they must inform people.   So you have to imagine the innocent. We can all imagine the guilty.  We say: Lock `em up. Take away their guns.   But imagine the innocent. Imagine someone who is innocent and he is  in a divorce proceeding and his angry spouse calls up and says, He's a  threat. They go, and even before the judge makes the court order, the  judge and the police say: We must inform those who he might be a threat  to.   What if that involves his business place? Are we going to inform his  boss? Are we going to inform his friends? We are going to call all the  schools in the area.   What if they are innocent? You haven't even heard the evidence that  is only coming from one side. What if they are innocent? Can you  imagine a person's life--entire life--being ruined? How do you ever get  employment again? Do you think he could be fired if the boss has now  been called by the police and they say: We have a gun order against  this guy because we think he's a threat. He might be a threat to his  fellow employees; he might be a threat to his wife; he might be a  threat to schools. We are going to do this, and we are letting you know  so you can be aware.   Who wants that person to work with them?   If you are doing a background check years later and they have had a  gun confiscation order in their background, who ever wants to work with  this person?   So you have to imagine what happens to the innocent. We can all  imagine the terrible, horrible murdering psychopaths who committed  these massacres and how we want them locked up, how we want to prevent  the killings.   But you have to imagine when you have sweeping laws, what are the  potential abuses of the law. You have to imagine what it would be like  to be an innocent person accused of something in a divorce proceeding  where it escalates and they ask for a gun confiscation order and it is  based on malice and it is based on lies and deceit and anger over a  broken marriage.    This can and will happen. It happens in family court every day. The  difference between a divorce and a gun confiscation order is that in a  divorce, if it is very messy, you hear both sides. In a gun  confiscation order, the initial order to take away a gun, in almost  every red flag law, involves only the judge and the accuser. Nobody  believes that to be justice. It has never been justice.   I mean, when people point out the injustice of systems in legal  systems, they go back to Venice, and they point out the doge. They had  a lion's mouth, and you could put your complaint in the mouth, and it  was anonymous, and they would make people walk the Bridge of Sighs to  prison or to death.   That wasn't justice. We point that out as the height of injustice-- anonymous accusations, hearing only one side.   There are some people who argue that the bedrock of our jurisprudence  is the adversarial process of the legal system. The adversarial process  is: You get a lawyer, the other side gets a lawyer. And you know what?  We go one step further in our system. The government has a lawyer. You  have a lawyer. But you know what? The presumption is that you are  innocent.   We start out with the presumption of the individual being innocent,  and we add the hurdle to the government--the burden of proof that they  must prove your guilt. And in the Constitution we say for a criminal  offense, we must prove the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. And yet we  are talking about taking away fundamental constitutional rights with  only hearing the evidence from one side and the standard would be a  preponderance of the evidence.   What is a preponderance? It is 50-50. And if it is 51-49, we think  the person may be a threat. But we have only heard from their spouse,  and we didn't hear from them. We only heard from their estranged spouse  or we only heard from the person who is angry with them from work or we  heard only  [[Page S3127]]  from the person from the opposite political persuasion that read their  writings on the internet.   We can see. We can all see the mischief for this.   So I wish, in the middle of this, in the middle of these tragedies,  that we would think of what we could do.   New York has already got these red flag laws. New York has got lots  of them. New York has got a lot of gun control, and yet the shooting  happened in Buffalo.   But the kid in Buffalo had made a threat. It is a felony to make a  threat to kill others. He could have been prosecuted.   So I fear, even with this law, if we don't pay attention to the laws  we already have, if we don't persist and persevere in prosecuting these  kids that show this danger--we already had--it is not that we just had  the signals they might; they are committing crimes. Why don't we  prosecute them? Why don't we use the laws on the books? But I would say  that there is a big risk today to encouraging, across the country,  jurisprudence where you don't have legal representation, where the  adjudication is based on evidence only from one side, and then you  finally get your day in court and you get your lawyer, and everybody is  petrified of reversing a decision where you have been named a threat.   I think we want the same thing in the end. My hope, though, is that  people would be very careful because I would not want to see a day  where we change and reverse justice in our system such that people are  guilty until proven innocent.   The bedrock of American jurisprudence is ``innocent until proven  guilty.'' The burden is on the government. And until we can make red  flag laws consistent with innocent until proven guilty, we should  reject them.    Mr. President, today I want to honor the 100th  anniversary of the founding of the Daviess County Farm Bureau.  Established in 1922 by a handful of people, the Daviess County Farm  Bureau quickly grew to include approximately 100 farmers. With  membership dues of only $2, the organization was forced to meet  wherever it could: the courthouse, the rural electric office, and even  members' homes. It was in these early meetings that the Daviess County  Farm Bureau first dedicated itself to advocacy on behalf  [[Page S3157]]  of farmers, and soon after, the organization began lobbying in the  Commonwealth's capital for the electrification of rural Daviess County.   In its early years, the Daviess County Farm Bureau supported the  community through disaster and development. In response to the flood of  1937, the organization provided support to the local hospital, fire  department, and Red Cross. The organization took on local issues; this  included conducting a study to establish a tobacco warehouse and  assessing warehouse charges related to the sale of tobacco. Daviess  County Farm Bureau also established a food locker refrigerating and  processing plant, formed a committee to head a funding drive--which  ultimately raised a total of $23,669--for Kentucky Wesleyan College,  and started a successful newsletter in the ``Messenger Inquirer''. In  response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Daviess County  Farm Bureau partnered with River Valley Behavioral Health to create the  ``You're Not Alone'' campaign, which sought to bring mental health  awareness to rural communities.   Today, after a century of service to Daviess County, the Commonwealth  of Kentucky, and farmers everywhere, the Daviess County Farm Bureau  continues to serve as ``The Voice for Agriculture.'' By lobbying the  county, State, and Federal governments, the Daviess County Farm Bureau  ensures that the needs of its membership are communicated to and  considered by elected officials. Daviess County Farm Bureau is also  active in the Kentucky Farm Bureau and American Farm Bureau.   In addition to its advocacy efforts, the Daviess County Farm Bureau  still supports a number of local programs and organizations. These  include 4-H clubs, Future Farmers of America chapters, and local  schools and teachers that incorporate agriculture education in the  classroom. The organization also sponsors the Annual Farm Expo, the  Farm-City Breakfast, and the annual Rooster Booster Breakfast hosted by  the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce. Daviess County Farm Bureau  is also responsible for administering several programs offered by the  Kentucky Farm Bureau, including the Institute for Future Agricultural  Leaders--IFAL--the Leadership Enhancement for Agricultural Development  program, and college scholarship programs.   A dedication to advocating on behalf of farmers and a love of  community have defined the first 100 years of the Daviess County Farm  Bureau's history. In celebrating this momentous milestone, we also cast  a hopeful eye toward the future. I have no doubt that the Daviess  County Farm Bureau will play an integral role in shaping that  future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Simon's Shoes of Henderson, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Operating a small business requires unparalleled commitment and  perseverance, traits that have been inherited to each successive  generation of the Simon Family. Jacob Simon immigrated to Henderson,  KY, from Lithuania in 1910, following his two brothers who made  Henderson their new home years prior. He began as a peddler selling  merchandise across the county, but at times found it difficult to  attract clients due to his lack of English. Insistent on improving his  craft, Jacob developed a sense of trust with the locals as his career  as a peddler led him to become a steadfast member of the community. As  such, it did not take long for Jacob to embrace Henderson as his home.  In the following years, Jacob mastered English, became an American  citizen, and opened Simon's Shoes in January 1919.   In addition to footwear, Simon's Shoes offered a diverse array of  clothing, and the store quickly became known for carrying any type of  garment one could desire, from suits to base layers. His childhood in  Lithuania and initial years in America had taught Jacob key principles  of saving and being conservative with money, which were integral to the  success of his business and the store's ability to survive the Great  Depression. When Jacob's son, Larry, became involved in the family  business, they decided to narrow the focus of the store to specialize  in shoes.   As the store continued to flourish, Larry, who eventually took  ownership of the business, was able to purchase the former J.C. Penny  building next door and use this space for the store's inventory. The  decades of success made Simon's Shoes a destination for people across  the State and beyond. To this day, residents from Evansville,  Owensboro, Louisville, St. Louis, as well as tourists traveling along  the Ohio River make the journey to visit Simon's Shoes. Customers are  continuously attracted by their wide range of shoes, inclusive of  varying sizes and widths, and their benefits as a full-service store.   Three generations of the Simon family have been involved in the  operations of Simon's Shoes, the latest Simon to take the reins being  Larry's son Bruce Simon. Even as the store passes down through the  successive generations, the Simons remain active members of the  business for as long as possible. In 1975, then 85-year-old Jake Simon  told local newspaper ``The Gleaner'', ``When I draw my last breath,  that store will be in my consciousness.'' Likewise, Larry continues to  visit Simon's Shoes often, stating that he would be in the store up to  6 days a week for several hours each day at 84 years of age. The  Simons' passion for their business has grown into a now-century long  catalyst for its success, as the store that once occupied a fraction of  the building on First and Main Street now consists of three buildings  on the same corner. Congratulations to the entire Simon family and to  the whole team at Simon's Shoes. I look forward to seeing their  continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
