 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I couldn't help but think today that the  distinguished Presiding Officer and I both had the opportunity to be  prosecutors. And I thought today about prosecutors--I listened to what  former President Donald Trump said. I listened to him with horror and  disbelief, especially when I saw it on television, and he was obviously  reading his words off a teleprompter and knew exactly what he was  saying.   He basically said that if he was reelected, he would be inclined to  give Presidential pardons to the people who stormed the U.S. Capitol a  year ago, January 6--the people who came in here as insurrectionists;  the people who came in here doing enormous damage and injuries; the  people who caused many to die; the people who set up a gallows outside  the Capitol with a noose on it with Vice President Pence's name on it,  saying that if he is not willing to ignore the law and suddenly give  the Presidency to Donald Trump, a man who had lost by millions of  votes, this is what he deserved, the gallows.   It is the sort of thing that if you saw it in a B-rated horror movie,  you would say this is so unbelievable, but here it is real.   You had people committing terrible crimes--destruction of property,  injuries to people, trying to kill and eventually did kill police  officers. I remember that day, and I am sure the Presiding Officer  does, because we were all on the floor of the Senate as the Vice  President was rushed off the dais where the Presiding Officer is right  now and where I opened the U.S. Senate just minutes ago.   And then, before we knew what was going on, we suddenly saw several  other plainclothes police officers come in here and a big one in a  uniform carrying a submachine gun with a vest that said ``POLICE.'' We  were told we had to leave and go to the safe room and were escorted out  by armed police  [[Page S396]]  officers. If it weren't for some of the brave operations of these  officers, we had Members of both parties who could have been victims of  the mob.   And just minutes after we were escorted from here, this place was  stormed by some who thought it was the House of Representatives. I  mean, they just obviously had been inspired to come up here and storm  the Capitol. They wanted the election turned over at the request of  Donald Trump to give it to him even though he had lost. And I thought-- I never thought I would see something like this.   I remember when I was a young law student at Georgetown Law School, I  would come up here and sit in the Gallery and watch this place, this  body, and watch both Republicans and Democrats debate everything from  civil rights to voting rights and routine matters. I thought, ``What a  place to be.'' These extraordinary Senators from both parties from all  over the country speaking about the laws and the Constitution of our  country.   I remember, even after I went back to Vermont after I was practicing  law and became a prosecutor, I thought of the days I was here with my  parents and others just watching this body and how thrilled I was when  I came here, thinking the U.S. Senate can and should be the conscience  of the Nation. And then I looked on television and saw a man who was  decisively defeated for reelection to the Presidency, saying to his  followers: If I am elected President again, I can pardon all these  criminals who came in here, these insurrectionists--people, actually,  many whom it is very clear were encouraged to come here and storm the  Capitol at his request.   We are a nation of laws. We are not a nation of individuals; we are a  nation of laws. And we survive as a nation and we excel as a nation if  we follow the law, if all of us do. On the Senate floor, we can debate.  Both parties can disagree on things, and we do often. I think we all  believe in the fact that we have laws, and you must follow them.   When I was a prosecutor, I thought, if somebody broke the law, there  are consequences for it. I cannot imagine what it would have been like  as a young prosecutor if I heard somebody running for high office in my  State--in this case, a Governor--who said: Go ahead. Break every law  you can to help me get elected because I will pardon you as soon as I  get in there. I think I would be before a grand jury pretty quickly  talking about that candidate. Yet that is what we see.   How could anybody be so blinded to what this Nation is that they will  ignore what this Nation is? How can anybody be so blinded to the laws  of this country that they can ignore those laws? How can anybody be so  blinded to our Constitution that they can ask people to violate the  Constitution?   ``Commit crimes in my name, and don't worry, I will take care of you.  I will make sure you are pardoned.''   This country has to get back to--Republicans and Democrats alike-- believing in the rule of law. Disagree if we want, disagree at the  ballot box, but follow the law and stop giving the impression to the  rest of the world that we are some kind of a pending dictatorship,  where the law and the Constitution are set aside for the whim of  whoever is elected.   I will speak more on this at another time. I know the distinguished  Presiding Officer has spoken out on this matter before. I greatly  admire what she has said, and I will continue to speak out.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before the holidays, the U.S.-China  Economic and Security Review Commission, USCC, released its 2021 Report  to Congress. As is customary, the report reflects a bipartisan  consensus, with unanimous support from the 11-member commission. It  includes 32 recommendations to the Congress, each of which is worth  serious consideration, especially in light of the announcement that  Chinese President Xi Jinping will rule for at least another 5 years.   This is not the first time that I have spoken about China and the  importance of increasing our Nation's competitiveness. I think we all  recognize that it is an issue that impacts, directly or indirectly, the  lives of every American. Today, I want to call attention to China's  expansionist foreign policy, particularly one section of the USCC's  report that discusses Chinese investments in Latin America and the  Caribbean.   Chinese foreign policy has become increasingly bold, with goals that  are both economic and political. China's economic goals are twofold:  increasing access to raw materials while developing new markets for  Chinese products. China has supported growth in parts of Latin America  by financing mining, transportation, electric power generation, large  scale agriculture, and other infrastructure projects.   However, there is a dark side to this increased investment and trade.  Countries' reliance on commodity exports and China's control over  supply chains strengthen China's influence in Latin American and  Caribbean economies. With so much of these countries' economies  dependent on continued trade and positive diplomatic relations with  China, it is no wonder that we see some governments bypassing  regulatory standards in order to obtain further investment  opportunities. This increased dependence can undermine democratic  institutions, weaken environmental and social safeguards, and encourage  corruption and violations of human rights. The Chinese Communist Party  is promoting its own political agenda by supporting authoritarian  regimes, promoting pro-China media, and strong-arming governments into  isolating Taiwan.   The USCC makes five recommendations to counter these trends: first,  respond to Chinese economic, diplomatic, and security initiatives by  expanding U.S. funding mechanisms for infrastructure projects, the  distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and educational exchanges; second,  increase support for governments in Latin America and the Caribbean to  create foreign investment review processes and require the Department  of State to report to Congress on progress; third, require the Director  of National Intelligence, Department of State, and Department of  Defense to submit an unclassified report detailing the implications of  Chinese investment in port infrastructure, Chinese military presence at  such ports, and the potential for leveraging such ports for Chinese  military purposes in the future; fourth, require that all applications  for U.S. foreign assistance include a disclosure of debt owed to  Chinese entities; and finally, create a partnership between coastal  Latin American countries and U.S. Government authorities identified in  the Maritime Security and Fisheries Enforcement Act to increase  maritime domain awareness and combat illegal Chinese fishing.   I urge the administration to consult with Congress on a path forward  to implement each of these recommendations.   The Senate's fiscal year 2022 State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs Appropriations bill includes $653.8 million for assistance for  the countries of Central America, including $100 million for localized  development in the Northern Triangle. Additional funds are included for  economic and security assistance for the Caribbean countries. We must  support programs in these countries that prioritize the well-being of  their citizens, protect their national sovereignty, and encourage fair  trade and investment by supporting community policing, maritime  security, energy independence, elementary and secondary education,  anti-gang programs, employment opportunities, programs to improve  government transparency and accountability, and by strengthening civil  society. These are long-term investments, but they will provide the  most effective alternatives to Chinese influence.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on January 6, 2022, I made a statement  about the extreme hardships and insecurity that are a daily reality for  the people  [[Page S406]]  of South Sudan, despite independence 10 years ago that held so much  promise and hope for that country. That independence came as a result  of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which took years of negotiations  facilitated by the United States, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and  it provided a roadmap for political stability, economic development,  respect for human rights, and justice.   Since then, two former warlords, President Kiir and Vice President  Machar, who were never elected, have dominated the political landscape  in South Sudan. It is they, throughout these critically important  formative years, who have had the executive power and the  responsibility to transform the aspirations of independence into  tangible improvements in the lives of their people. Ten years later, it  is fair to ask a simple question: What have they done?   I would answer that question with these questions:         After ten years, is South Sudan a country at peace where       the rights of the people are respected and their basic needs,       such as safe water, sanitation, food, shelter, and health       care are being met?        Has South Sudan's vast oil wealth been invested wisely in       public infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, public       transportation, roads, and bridges after decades of civil       war?        Is the country's agricultural economy expanding and       reaching new markets?        Are children in school and are teachers receiving a decent       salary?        Are South Sudan's youth, who make up a majority of the       population, able to find jobs?        Do the security forces have the training, equipment, food,       and barracks they need to maintain the peace, and are       soldiers and officers receiving adequate pay?        Are government ministries led and staffed by trained and       honest professionals?        Is the Parliament defending the people's interests?        Is the judiciary independent, and the courts accessible and       trusted by the people? Have those who committed crimes       against humanity and other gross violations of human rights       been prosecuted and punished?        Have the many thousands of South Sudanese refugees and       internally displaced been able to return home to rebuild       their lives?        Is civic space being protected so civil society activists       and independent journalists can function without fear of       harassment or threats?        Has the necessary work been done to create the conditions       for transparent, free, and fair elections in which candidates       from all political parties can participate?        Has sustained progress been made in any of these areas?    I think the answers are obvious, and the people of South Sudan know  the answers. Despite billions of dollars in international aid and  billions of dollars in oil revenues, the government of South Sudan has  failed every test.   Today, South Sudan ranks as among the world's most corrupt country  and, despite its oil wealth, one of the hungriest country in the world.   We should remember that the Republic of South Sudan would not exist  were it not for the sacrifice of millions of South Sudanese who gave  their lives in the fight for independence. But it is also a fact that  had it not been for the support of the United States, South Sudan would  not be a Republic today.   I have been a U.S. Senator for 47 years, so I remember when South  Sudan existed only in people's dreams. I remember when John Garang  would visit the U.S. Congress seeking support. He was an inspiring  leader, and we supported him. I supported him. And we welcomed South  Sudan's hard-fought independence.   But since John Garang's tragic death in 2005, we have seen how greed  and personal ambition can thwart the aspirations of an entire  population.   The January 21 response of the office of the President of the  Republic of South Sudan to my statement of January 6 was as revealing  as it was predictable.   The office of the President accuses me of calling for ``regime change  through uprising and violence.'' Anyone who read my statement, as the  author of that accusation surely did, knows it to be absurd on its  face. There is not a single word in my statement that remotely suggests  what the office of the President accuses me of. Their resort to  fabrication and intimidation is the all-too-common tactic of  governments to deflect attention from their own failures. We have seen  it even in our own country.   The people of South Sudan have experienced far too much war, far too  much violence, far too much displacement, far too much insecurity, and  far too much hunger and misery. The last thing they need or want is  more violence, and nothing I have said would suggest otherwise.   There are countless examples. Just a few days ago, on January 23, 5  kilometers from Bor, the capital of Jonglei State, armed militia  reportedly slaughtered 35 and injured 17 civilians, including women and  children. Property was looted, and huts were burned down. The people of  South Sudan know too well that these violent acts are orchestrated or  condoned by the country's leaders. In a letter dated November 25, 2020,  addressed to the President of the U.N. Security Council from the Panel  of Experts on South Sudan, they reported the following:         Political and security disputes within President Kiir's       coalition have contributed to conflicts that have killed and       displaced civilians in Jonglei and the Greater Pibor       Administrative Area. Rival factions within the Government       supplied weapons to various ethnic militias from the       Government's stockpile. Between May and August, eight       humanitarian staff were killed, humanitarian facilities were       looted and destroyed, and thousands of civilians were       displaced at a time of widespread flooding in Jonglei and the       Greater Pibor Administrative Area.    The killings on January 23 were part of the same pattern, yet those  who bear responsibility for these attacks accuse advocates for peaceful  change of promoting violence.   Rather than falsely accuse me and South Sudanese civil society  organizations that have repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to  non-violence, the government should put a stop to these attacks and ask  itself the questions I have posed.   It should also reflect on the fact that U.S. S. Res. 380 passed  unanimously, with the support of 100 U.S. Senators, Democrats and  Republicans, less than 2 months ago. I remind the office of the  President what we said:         Whereas despite years of fighting, widespread suffering of       South Sudanese civilians, punitive actions by the       international community, and 2 peace agreements, the leaders       of South Sudan have failed to build sustainable peace, and       critical provisions of the Revitalized Agreement on the       Resolution of the Conflict [R-ARCSS] . . . remain       unimplemented;        Whereas the leaders of South Sudan have consistently failed       to uphold their responsibilities to create the conditions for       peace and prosperity, have prioritized self-preservation and       corruption over the needs of the people they represent, have       acted in bad faith in the implementation of cease fire and       peace agreements, and have betrayed the cause of freedom,       resulting in the loss of millions of lives; and        Whereas South Sudan has not held an election since its       independence and the current leaders of South Sudan were       appointed or installed through transitional arrangements       based on peace agreements.    That Resolution also urged the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury:         (A) to prioritize investigations into illicit financial       flows fueling violence in South Sudan;        (B) to work with the Secretary of State to update, on a       regular basis, the list of individuals and entities       designated under the South Sudan sanctions program, including       individuals at the highest levels of leadership in South       Sudan and from within the National Security Service; and        (C) to coordinate, in cooperation with the Secretary of       State, with the United Kingdom and the European Union on       South Sudan-related sanctions designations and enforcement.    So rather than make up falsehoods about those asking such questions,  including me, the People's Coalition for Civil Action, and other South  Sudanese activists and organizations that want nothing more than for  the promise of the R-ARCSS to be realized so the people of South Sudan  can enjoy the security and prosperity they are entitled to, I urge  President Kiir and Vice President Machar to put their country first.   Rather than falsely accusing others of violence or resorting to  provocations to create a pretext for persecuting and silencing them,  they should listen to them. They should listen to the voices of the  people, expressed in the National Dialogue, that South Sudan needs a  new beginning.   Rather than claim to have taken significant steps to put South  Sudan's failing economy on a solid footing, which fools no one, they  should open up the government's books so people can see the receipts  and expenditures.   Rather than hide behind the R-ARCSS to preserve the status quo, they  should implement it in letter and spirit, including by unifying rival  security  [[Page S407]]  forces, by promulgating a new constitution, and by opening up the  political space in the country.   Rather than make excuses to delay elections as they have repeatedly  done before, they should set a date, in accordance with the R-ARCSS,  for national and Parliamentary elections, and they should support a  roadmap for creating the necessary conditions for the refugees to  return and for multiparty democratic elections to succeed with the  support of the army. And without delay, they should declare their  unconditional commitment not to contest the next election and to  relinquish power as soon as South Sudan's newly elected leaders take  office.   The sad reality is that while the South Sudanese people won their  independence from Sudan, they remain captives of the same ruthless and  corrupt warlords who created so much ethnic conflict, bloodshed, and  misery during the civil war and who have not been held accountable.   They simply reinvented themselves as political leaders, with a stamp  of legitimacy from the international community, while continuing to act  like the warlords they are and always were.   They have shown no interest in implementing the R-ARCSS or any other  peace agreement.   They have shown no interest in the welfare of their people.   They have shown no interest in anything except holding onto power,  avoiding justice, and enriching themselves.   It is time to listen to the people of South Sudan and for the United  States to reassess its policy toward South Sudan. The White House and  the State Department need to recognize that the status quo in South  Sudan has been a dead end for years and consult with Congress on a new  way forward. As a first step, the U.S. should use the authorities that  already exist, including the Global Magnitsky Act, to sanction key  officials in South Sudan's National Security Service, which has long  functioned as a criminal enterprise that engages in extrajudicial  killings, arbitrary detention, torture, and other heinous crimes.   Real peace requires justice, and it requires respect for fundamental  rights regardless of ethnicity, race, or religion. It requires free and  fair elections and equitable economic development. These should be at  the heart of our policy.                            ____________________
