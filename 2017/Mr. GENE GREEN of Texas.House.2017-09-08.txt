 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  hundreds of thousands of victims of Hurricane Harvey in Houston and  Harris County and all along the Texas Gulf Coast, and urge Congress to  immediately pass the $15.25 billion dollar emergency aid bill before us  today.   For six days, the Texas Gulf Coast was hammered by Hurricane Harvey,  bringing destruction beyond anything witnessed in living memory in our  state.   The storm dropped four feet of rain on Greater Houston. Over 100,000  homes and residences were flooded in Harris County alone. Authorities  believe at least 70 Texans were killed due to Harvey, and that number  will continue to rise.   Houstonians and Texans are a proud and independent people. We take  pride in our can-do attitude, as witnessed by our brave first  responders and countless volunteers who rescued neighbors during the  worst of the flooding.   Full recovery from this unprecedented disaster will take years, but  right now we need Congress to pass this emergency relief bill that will  help the people of Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast sustain current  relief efforts and onto the road to recovery.   God bless America and God bless Texas.
