 Madam Speaker, I rise to offer a prayer for the victims  of the tragic violence in Odessa, Texas, on August 31.   The victims were: Mary Granados, Leilah Hernandez, Edwin Peregrino,  Joe Griffith, Rodolfo Julio Arco, Kameron Karltess Brown, and Raul  Garcia.   Heavenly Father, we come to You today asking for prayer, asking for  peace that passes all understanding on the men and women in Odessa,  Texas, and the families of the suffering.   We ask that You wrap Your loving arms around them at this dark hour  in their lives. Thank You, dear Heavenly Father.   We ask these things in Jesus' name.   I would also like to recognize the law enforcement officers and first  responders of Midland and Odessa who acted quickly and courageously in  their response to this tragedy. We owe these brave men and women more  gratitude than words can express.                            ____________________
