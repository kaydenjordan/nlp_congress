 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Boys & Girls  Clubs of Harrisonburg in Rockingham County, which will celebrate its  25th anniversary on December 21.   Since its founding in 1955, this organization has grown from just one  location to now more than seven throughout the region. For the past  two-and-a-half decades, they have worked to ensure children in  Shenandoah Valley have a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment to  call home after school.   They are committed to fulfilling their mission to help mold our  region's youth into productive, caring, responsible citizens through  programs focused on academic success, healthy lifestyles, good  character, and citizenship.   Serving more than 900 kids annually, ages 5 to 18, for the past  quarter-century, the positive contribution the group has had on the  valley's youth is immeasurable.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the organization on its first 25 years of  success and wish them many more. Our community is forever grateful for  all they do.                            ____________________
