 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a fallen Indiana  State Trooper, Aaron Smith. He was tragically killed in the line of  duty just last month.   Trooper Smith, of Whiteland, Indiana, served his fellow Hoosiers as  both a State Trooper and a sergeant in the Indiana National Guard.   We will never forget Trooper Smith's service and sacrifice to our  Indiana community and our entire Nation, and I offer my deepest  condolences to his family and friends. He was a hero.   May Trooper Smith, as well as all our fallen officers, rest in peace.                        Congratulating Elisabeth Coon     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Elisabeth  Coon, Indiana's Sixth District Congressional Gold Medalist.   Elisabeth resides in Bargersville, Indiana, and is currently a  student at Cardinal Christian Academy Home School.  [[Page H3212]]    She earned the prestigious Congressional Gold Medal for completing  over 400 hours of community service, dedicating 200 hours to learning  how to run a small business, improving her fitness by running 5Ks, and  attending an expedition in Colorado.    Congratulations to Elisabeth on her achievements, and I wish her the  best of luck on her future endeavors.     Condolences to Victims Impacted by Recent Storms and Thanking First                                 Responders     Madam Speaker, on June 25, numerous thunderstorms in  central Indiana developed into tornadoes with damaging wind and large  hail.   I offer my sincerest condolences and prayers to those impacted by the  storms, as well as thank our brave first responders who have never  failed to respond and put their lives on the line for us.   God bless our first responders.          Recognizing the Sixth District Agriculture Advisory Board     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Sixth District  Agriculture Advisory Board.   Indiana's ag industry is essential to America's ag success, and  Hoosier farmers are at the backbone of America. Therefore, I will  always make sure to consult my ag advisory board on all issues  affecting the agriculture industry, especially as Congress looks toward  the 2023 Farm Bill Reauthorization.   I thank this fine group of 15 Hoosier farmers for all their insight,  and it was great to see them again in June.                          Thanking First Responders     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about my recent visit  to the Columbus, Indiana Fire Department. During the visit, I spoke  with Fire Chief Lay and was able to see the department's training  operations taking place right there in the Sixth District.   Thank you to all our first responders for the work they do, and may  we never forget that they are putting their lives on the line every  single day.   God bless everyone at the Columbus Fire Department, and God bless all  the fire departments in the Indiana Sixth District.                     Thanking Centerstone Health Services     Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my sincere thanks to  Centerstone Health Services. I recently had the opportunity to visit  Centerstone in Columbus, Indiana, and learn about their great work  providing behavioral and mental health care, addiction treatment, and  crisis services.   Centerstone operates 25 clinics and over 500 residential or  supportive housing units, serving about 30,000 patients in my district.  Still, more needs to be done to expand access to care to those  suffering from mental illness.   Medicaid's outdated IMD exclusion serves as a barrier preventing most  access to care for the most vulnerable in our communities.  Unfortunately, without treatment, these individuals find themselves on  the streets, in jails, or, of course, worse.   I urge my colleagues to work together and remove the IMD exclusion.                      Skyrocketing Crime in Indianapolis     Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise my concerns about  skyrocketing crime in Indianapolis, Indiana. In just the past 2 years,  497 people were killed in homicides in that city. This is the city's  deadliest number on record.   This is the direct result of the Democrats' soft-on-crime policies,  reckless bail reform efforts, and, of course, their ``defund-the- police'' rhetoric. Hoosiers and the American people deserve better.   It is long past time for the Biden administration, the Indianapolis  mayor's office, and Congressional Democrats to join us in cracking down  on crime to help make our streets safe again.                            ____________________
