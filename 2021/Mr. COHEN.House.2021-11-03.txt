 Madam Speaker, the House continues to pursue the  bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better bill. There  will be a Rules Committee meeting today on those bills. Hopefully, they  will come to the floor and will pass with bipartisan support, as the  infrastructure bill was passed with bipartisan support in the Senate.   The House has been working to get the framework improved to include  other issues. There are so many good issues that we can have in this  bill, and we hope to have the maximum possible.   But as a baker once said, and my father implored me as a child: Look  at the doughnut, and not at the hole.   We will pass a very good bill, hopefully bipartisan.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R.  390, which would fully name the Federal building in Memphis for Odell  Horton, a great jurist. Right now, it is the Clifford Davis-Odell  Horton Federal Building, and this would remove Clifford Davis' name  from the Memphis Federal building.   In one of my first acts as a Congressman, the first bill I passed was  a bill to add Judge Horton's name to the Federal building and to call  it the Clifford Davis-Odell Horton Federal Building. I initially hoped  to simply rename the building for Judge Horton, but the political will  to do that was not present at that time.   Now, here we are in 2021, and the political will is present,  including the family of the late Clifford Davis, who we communicated  with, and they suggested that it should be renamed. The family said:  ``We are proud of Cliff Davis' many contributions to Memphis, but his  membership in the Klan and his support for Jim Crow cannot be  excused.''   I completely agree and believe it is time to ensure that all of  Memphis can look with pride and respect at their Federal building and  have a name for this great jurist who served in that Federal building.   Judge Horton left a remarkable legacy as the first Black Federal  judge appointed since Reconstruction. Judge Horton also served as chief  judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of  Tennessee. He served as an assistant U.S. attorney, the first African- American member of Mayor Henry Loeb's city administration as the head  of health and hospitals, and the president of LeMoyne-Owen College, a  historic HBCU located in Memphis.   Judge Horton was a man of honor who dedicated his life to public  service for the betterment of west Tennessee. Judge Horton broke down  racial barriers and served the judicial system well. Judge Horton is  long deserved in this individual distinction.   I thank the entire Tennessee delegation and Mr. Guest for joining in  the movement to pass this bill and honor Judge Horton in this singular  manner. I also thank Chairman DeFazio, Chairwoman Titus, and Ranking  Members Graves and Webster for advancing this bill to the floor.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this bill.
