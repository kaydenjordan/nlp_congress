 Mr. Speaker, I take this time to recognize and honor the  late, great John Camacho, also known as Chubado, who sadly left this  world a few years ago. John left behind his lovely wife, Darleen, and  children, Janice and Jeremy.   A proud son of Guam, John received numerous accolades for academic  excellence during his time at Fresno State University where he obtained  a bachelor of science in civil engineering.   In 1978, he and his friend Henry Simpson were the brain children of  Smokin' Wheels, which consisted of off-road motorcycling, buggy, and  truck endurance.   In 1979, John participated in the Baja 1000, which remains one of the  most prestigious off-road obstacles in the world.   On behalf of the Nation and the island of Guam, and in these sacred  Halls of democracy, I honor and recognize John Camacho as a founding  father of motorsports on Guam and as a renaissance man for the sport in  the region.                            ____________________
