 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and memorialize a fallen  hero, Riverside County Sheriff's Office Deputy Brett Harris, who gave  his life serving our communities.   Every day, our law enforcement officers say good-bye to our loved  ones and make our community safer no matter the cost.   On May 12, 2023, Riverside County Sheriff Deputy Brett Harris was on  duty responding to a request for assistance before he was involved in a  serious motor vehicle collision that caused him significant and  traumatic head injuries. At only 27 years old, Deputy Harris succumbed  to his injuries the following day, surrounded by his family and his  wife, Myreia, in a hospital ICU.   Today, a wife and a family mourn a loved one, a public servant, and a  friend. Let us honor and cherish the memory of a good man, loving son,  and a devoted husband who served our communities well and who loved  music, the arts, and video games.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone present on the House floor to join me in  a moment of silence for Deputy Brett Harris, his family, and every  fallen peace officer who has answered the call, put their lives on the  line, and sacrificed themselves for our safety.                            ____________________
