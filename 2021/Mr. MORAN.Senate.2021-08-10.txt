 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3795, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, there is no denying that we have a  humanitarian crisis at the southern border. I have witnessed this  personally. Just last month, Customs encountered 200,000 individuals  attempting the dangerous and deadly trek across the southern border. At  least tens of thousands of these individuals have been released into  our country without an official court date.   The Biden administration's rollback of immigration laws has not only  magnified the humanitarian crisis, but it has left our law enforcement  with the impossible task of trying to slow the flow of illegal  crossings while also attempting to stop drugs, weapons, and human  trafficking entering our country.   My amendment simply states that we must enforce our existing  immigration laws to address the humanitarian crisis and to increase  resources for smart and effective border security, improve asylum  processing, and reduce immigration court backlogs.   Voting no on this amendment signals a refusal to acknowledge we have  a humanitarian crisis on our southern border and an unwillingness to  support our existing immigration laws.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this straightforward amendment.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
