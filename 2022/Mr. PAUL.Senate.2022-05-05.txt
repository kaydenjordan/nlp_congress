 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week, I  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize the small business, P31 Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils and  Homemade Products of Morgantown, KY, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   As any small business owner knows, the path of entrepreneurship is  rarely straight and narrow. As is the case with this small business  owner, Tabby Daugherty, who opened P31 Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils  and Homemade Products, also known as P31 Storefront Insiders, in 2018.  P31's story began a couple years prior to her official opening date. In  2016, Tabby was a part-time employee at Life-Skills, working with  adults with disabilities while she raised her several children. As a  mother of a large family, she strived to keep the meaning of Proverbs  31 at the core of her work and home life. What served as a motto of  sorts became the inspiration for her business and its name, hence the  P31.   Proverbs 31:17-18 reads, ``She dresses herself with strength and  makes her arms strong. She perceives that her merchandise is  profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.'' Taking from that  verse, Tabby sought to make herself and her household more self- sustaining and started to make her own laundry soap. Word gathered  around town, and soon, there was widespread interest in Tabby's  homemade soap. This do-it-yourself project and the demand it garnered  soon led to her founding her own business.   A business selling soap grew into a venture that offered over 100  products. After a friend suggested she start creating products using  essential oils, Tabby expanded her variety of products and began to  sell moisturizers, serums, bracelets, and diffusers. She also creates  custom products used to treat maladies. Around town, people know Tabby  as a giver, evident in her role as a mother of a big family and in her  previous job at Life-Skills looking after those with disabilities. For  that reason, many put their faith in her and her products, often coming  to her with a special request for a specific blend. Tabby gladly takes  all requests even though it requires extra time and care  [[Page S2358]]  on her part to learn how to create these specially-requested items.   Customers keep coming back to P31 Storefront Insiders because they  appreciate the diligent care Tabby takes in creating her line of items.  The citizens of Morgantown and beyond seek her out because they know  that all her products are made with real ingredients, are made in  store, and are created without fragrances or synthetic products.  Moreover, Tabby and her business operations abide by a strict set of  codes, the most fundamental of which is customer appreciation. Patrons  walk in to feel welcomed and lifted up. Tabby keeps the essence of her  favorite proverb at the core of her life and her shop, evident for all  to see.   Tabby is a strong force within the Morgantown community. She stays  involved with the local chapter of the Boys and Girls Club, as well as  the local bass fishing team. She also makes sure her business is there  to fill any sort of community need that may arise, for example, in  previous clothes drives she has offered P31 Storefront Insiders as a  drop-off location. And when her children's sports team needed to raise  money for new equipment, she took a creative approach towards lending a  hand: providing the ingredients of her famous soap to the team's  players, requiring them to make it and sell it on their own. In this  way, she provided the team the tools to achieve their fundraising goals  but allowed the children to take responsibility for their efforts.  Given its popularity, she has also opened that opportunity to other  Butler County schools.   A giving and charitable spirit permeates throughout Tabby's life and  her business. She currently offers a ``Maggie Collection'' product line  of bracelets. Maggie is a local young girl who was diagnosed with  leukemia, and P31 donates $2 from every bracelet sold towards Maggie's  treatment. Tabby also hosts an in-store bible study every Wednesday for  local teenage girls, allowing them the opportunity to speak about  devotion over pizza and soda. Without a doubt, Tabby is a force for  good, and she capitalizes on her position as a local entrepreneur to  help improve the lives of those around her. She truly captures the  benevolent essence that so often goes hand in hand with the  entrepreneurial spirit. I want to congratulate the whole team at P31  Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils and Homemade Products and wish Tabby  the best of luck. I look forward to watching her continued growth and  success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
