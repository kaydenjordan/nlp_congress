 I want to thank my colleagues from Minnesota and  Missouri for all of their hard work on this issue. I would like to ask  my colleagues through the chair about section 111 of the bill amending  section 415 of the Congressional Accountability Act. A new  subparagraph, which will become 415(d)(1)(D), describes certain  violations for which reimbursement is required by a Member of the House  of Representatives or a Senator. I am interested in my colleagues'  understanding regarding how that language should be interpreted?    Thank you. That clarification is helpful for my  understanding and for my colleagues' understanding as we take important  steps to better address harassment in the U.S. Congress.                            ____________________
