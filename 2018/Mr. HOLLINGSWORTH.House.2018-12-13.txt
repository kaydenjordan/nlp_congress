 Mr. Speaker, every morning our heroes in law  enforcement wake up and they kiss their loved ones good-bye, knowing  that there is always a chance they may not return that night.   Last night, in Charlestown, in Clark County, in the Hoosier State,  one of those heroes, Sergeant Ben Bertram of the Charlestown Police  Department did not return home. Sergeant Bertram was killed in pursuit  of a suspect into an adjoining county, doing his duty, doing what he  loved, and protecting Hoosiers all the way across the State.   It is with deep sorrow our community back home mourns his loss, and  celebrates his sacrifice to the Hoosier State.   We thank Sergeant Bertram. Rest easy.                            ____________________
