 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I was Governor of Florida in 2010 when the  Deepwater Horizon rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana. It killed 11  people and sent millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.   I witnessed firsthand the tar balls on our beaches, the marine life  drowning in oil, and the billions of dollars of economic damage  inflicted on countless families and small businesses.   As the largest offshore oil spill in American history, this should  have been a huge wake-up call to everyone. Floridians said never again  and voted almost 70 percent in the last election to ban offshore  drilling because, as we learned, drilling doesn't have to take place  right off our shores to upend your way of life.   My amendment is simple. It reinstates two critical rules regarding  offshore drilling and safety regulations,  [[Page H7631]]  the Well Control Rule and the Production Safety Systems Rule, that were  put into place after the Deepwater Horizon disaster itself.   Sadly, the current administration has chosen to ignore the mistakes  of our past and has, instead, weakened these rules, opening the door to  self-regulation and less stringent standards. That is why my amendment  codifies these rules in their previous form, reinstating critical  safety requirements and reducing the risk of another tragedy.                                time  1545    I would like to thank the bipartisan cosponsors of my amendment, the  Rules Committee for making the amendment in order, and the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Barragan) and the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Price) for their tireless efforts to support these regulations.   Finally, on behalf of Florida's 13th District, I give my heartfelt  thanks to the distinguished bipartisan colleagues from Florida,  Representative Castor and Representative Rooney, for their tireless  leadership on the underlying bill to keep drilling out of the eastern  Gulf of Mexico for good.   In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to drill at all. But as long as  drilling does occur in the western and central Gulf, the site of the  Deepwater Horizon spill, we must do everything in our power to make  sure that history does not repeat itself.   I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment so that no State ever has  to endure another Deepwater Horizon.   Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva), my colleague, the chairman of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Madam Chair, first, I thank the chairman for his support  of the bill. I appreciate that very much.   In response to my colleague from across the aisle, what is necessary  and what is important is to make sure that we have stringent rules on  this dangerous industry, to make sure that we protect our ecosystem and  our environment.   As I said, we, as Floridians, already understand it, voting almost 70  percent of the vote in the latest election to ban offshore drilling  from our beautiful coast.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
