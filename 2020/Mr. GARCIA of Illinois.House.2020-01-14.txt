 Madam Speaker, I am delighted to be on the  floor this afternoon and to join the gentlemen in honoring the life and  the memory and the legacy of Richard Barnett.   Richard was a neighbor of Chicago's Lawndale community. He lived just  a few blocks from my house. He worked as a U.S. Postal Service employee  prior to his retirement in 1982. He was very devoted to his wife and  his children and was involved in his local community--in the schools,  in the parks, and in the churches--and every aspect of civic life as a  good community resident.   But Richard was also a mentor to me in my earliest days as a  candidate for political office. From the early 1980s, when I first  stepped up, I learned how to organize in communities of color so that  they could become politically empowered at the local, State, and  Federal level.   He helped enrich my understanding of the Voting Rights Act and how  the Federal law could help Chicago's Latino communities in the early  1980s elect people to Chicago's city council, to the State general  assembly, to the Cook County board, and, yes, even to the Federal  Government, a position that I can say I hold, in part, because of the  mentorship of Richard Barnett.   Richard was deeply committed to dismantling the infamously corrupt  and discriminatory and exclusionary Chicago political machine with new  political movements that were rooted in Chicago neighborhoods, and he  wanted to usher in an era of equitable and honest government.   Richard was instrumental in bringing together multiracial,  multiethnic, and faith coalitions across Chicago to advance progressive  public policies.   He helped me in my elections to the Chicago City Council, to the  Illinois Senate, to the Cook County board, and to Congress. I will be  eternally grateful for all of his assistance and mentorship and  friendship over nearly a period of four decades in the city of Chicago.   Richard was a true son of his community, his people, and people all  over Illinois and across the country because he sought to empower and  to give a voice to the people who were voiceless.   Long live Richard Barnett.                                General Leave
