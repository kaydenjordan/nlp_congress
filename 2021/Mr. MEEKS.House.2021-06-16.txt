 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters for her  leadership on the Financial Services Committee.   Today, I urge bipartisan support for H.R. 1187, including the passage  of my amendment, the Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity  Act.   As we continue these conversations about equity and closing the  racial wealth gap, this amendment is a key component because it will  empower investors with better data to drive diversity efforts in  corporate America. This is precisely because investors recognize that  profit, performance, and inclusive governance are logically  intertwined.   That is why my amendment, which I want to thank Representative  Maloney and Representative Torres for working with me on, seeks to  enhance the SEC's current diversity disclosure regime by requiring  public companies to disclose race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual  orientation, and veteran  [[Page H2852]]  status on the boards and in the C-suites.    Madam Speaker, the American economy cannot reach its full  potential without fully redressing persistent barriers that have kept  whole communities from being able to build wealth and share in  opportunities of prosperity.
