 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2379, which  will permanently reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership program.   I want to particularly thank Mr. Pascrell, as well as Mr. King, for  taking the lead on this very important legislation.   In 1997, I co-authored the original legislation to create the  Bulletproof Vest Partnership program with the gentleman who originated  the idea for this legislation, and who was the original cosponsor, our  good friend, former colleague, Representative Frank LoBiondo, from the  State of New Jersey; he had been active over the last 22 years in  having the act reauthorized, which is why I strongly support this bill  to add permanence to it.   As has been mentioned during the debate, there have been over 13,000  jurisdictions who have been helped. I represent the First Congressional  District in Indiana, and in Fiscal Year 2018 the Bulletproof Vest  Partnership program provided $80,738 to local law enforcement in  Northwest Indiana. This assisted in the purchase of about 200 new vests  for officers who are protecting our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here to reiterate my strong support for this  legislation, and I ask my colleagues to support it.
