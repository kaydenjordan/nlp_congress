 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a  practical bill that will ensure healthy, safe housing.   H.R. 1690, the Safe Housing for Families Act, now named the Carbon  Monoxide ALERTS Act, or CO ALERTS Act, would require the installation  of carbon monoxide detectors in all federally assisted public housing  to prevent needless deaths.   The legislation I introduced with my colleague,   Joe Cunningham of  South Carolina, passed out of the Financial Services Committee  unanimously, and bipartisan action in the Senate is well underway.   Secretary Carson of the Department of Housing and Urban Development  testified in support of our efforts to put an end to carbon monoxide  deaths in public housing.   Allow me to share a story about Gwendolyn and Anthony Fleming, who  were residents of the Hickory Hollow residence in Wayne, Michigan. They  moved to their community to be somewhere quiet and safe, but the fact  that HUD doesn't require carbon monoxide detectors on its facilities  put them in grave danger.    On a cold February day this year, Ashley, their daughter, pulled up  to Hickory Hollow with her three kids. She expected to find her parents  waiting for a routine family dinner. When her parents didn't return her  calls or answer the door, she knew that something was wrong and called  the police. Ashley's mother had died of carbon monoxide poisoning.   When the medical examiner arrived, Ashley knew it was time to leave.  ``I didn't want to see them bring my mother's body out in a body bag,''  she said. ``And I didn't want my children to see that either.''   Anthony Fleming, Ashley's father, was found unconscious and was taken  to a hospital. He never regained consciousness.   These deaths--and many others--were preventable.   Since 2003, 13 people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning in  federally subsidized housing. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control  reports that 50,000 individuals per year are sickened by carbon  monoxide poisoning, and over 400 die per year.   It is unconscionable that the very people our government seeks to  provide shelter for are dying in their homes. All it takes is a  detector, just like smoke detectors we already require in every  building.   Secretary Carson said it himself: ``A simple, inexpensive, widely  available device can be the difference between life and death. Given  the unevenness of State and local law, we intend to make certain that  carbon monoxide detectors  [[Page H7583]]  are required in all our housing programs, just as we require smoke  detectors, no matter where our HUD-assisted families live.''   In April, HUD proposed a rule to require carbon monoxide detectors on  its housing units. In May, HUD announced $5 million to install  detectors. We know, however, that the rulemaking process can drag on  for months.   Already, almost 25 States already require carbon monoxide monitors in  homes, and it was Secretary Carson who suggested that the patchwork of  State laws be aligned around the principle of expanding public safety  protections.                                time  1415    Testifying before the Financial Services Committee in May, Secretary  Carson said that he was 100 percent in favor of resolving this issue  and said, ``As quickly as we can get it done, it is going to get  done.'' The quickest possible solution is for the House to pass the  bill before us today.   Secretary Carson's staff at HUD have been engaged in working with  Congress to expedite the rule-making process and make sure that  protections are put in place before the cold winter months arrive. This  bill has already spurred legislative action in the Senate, and the  bipartisan efforts moving through the Senate Banking Committee are now  aligned in this bill.   Let's pass this life-saving legislation and protect those in  Federally assisted housing.   I would like to thank the staff of the House Financial Services  Committee, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and in the  Senate those who have worked to ensure that our efforts will  effectively prevent needless deaths as quickly as possible.   I would also especially like to thank Senator Kamala Harris for  working with me to introduce this legislation and to Senators Menendez  and Scott for helping us make technical changes to improve the bill.   I also want to thank Chair Maxine Waters, ranking members Pat McHenry  and Mr. Stivers of Ohio and members of their staff for all their work  on this bill, which received unanimous support from the Financial  Services Committee.   Numerous housing, public health, and home security groups support  this legislation.    The supporters of this bill include the  National Association of Realtors, the National Low Income Housing  Coalition, the American Public Health Association, the National Housing  Law Project, the National Housing Trust, the Public Housing Authorities  Directors Association, the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities,  the Latin United Community Housing Association, Justice Innovations,  Safe Kids Illinois, and the Security Industry Association.   Colleagues, let's seize the rare opportunity to advance  straightforward life-saving legislation that has already won bipartisan  support in this House. Saving lives in our housing facilities with a  simple, inexpensive solution is not a partisan issue. It is exactly  what our constituents sent us here to do, work together to find  solutions for the American people. I urge you to support H.R. 1690, the  CO ALERTS Act.
