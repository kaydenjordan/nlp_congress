 Mr. President, I rise to recognize the extraordinary  service of my friend Representative Jane Margaret Lakes Harman, who  will be leaving her position as president and CEO of the Woodrow Wilson  International Center for Scholars after nearly a decade of  distinguished leadership.   Born in New York City, Representative Harman grew up in Los Angeles  and received her bachelor's degree magna cum laude from Smith College  and her law degree from Harvard Law School. Like many young people who  believe in the unmatched power of public service, Jane moved to  Washington, DC, where she served as a staffer to Senator John Tunney  and with the Senate Judiciary Committee. She would go on to serve her  country in the Department of Defense and as President Carter's  Secretary of the Cabinet.   From 1993 until 2011, Representative Harman served the people of  Southern California's 36th District. Throughout her tenure,  Representative Harman fundamentally improved the national security of  the United States through her work on the Armed Services, Intelligence,  and Homeland Security Committees. Not content with leading just from  the halls of Congress, she sought to find the truth for herself. Her  work in pursuit of the facts relevant to protecting our democracy and  our allies took her to Guantanamo Bay, Syria, and North Korea. Her  oversight and leadership on national security was especially critical  throughout this time period, as the United States sought to understand  and push back from threats both new and old, including foreign  terrorism. While Representative Harman's contributions speak for  themselves, her receipt of the Defense Department Medal for  Distinguished Service, the CIA Seal Medal, the CIA Director's Award,  and the National Intelligence Distinguished Public Service Medal  highlight an extraordinary career serving the American people.   At the Wilson Center, Representative Harman continued her diligent  work keeping our policymakers and the public informed on the ongoing  security challenges the United States and her allies face. As we  prepare and steel ourselves for the next era of security challenges,  knowledge produced under her leadership and the relentless efforts of  her colleague and staff will continue to be an invaluable resource.   Like many extraordinary Americans, Representative Harman carried out  this work while also caring for her family, including her four  children, her four grandchildren, and her late husband Sidney, an  enormous personality in his own right. After a lifetime of public  service, from staffer to elected official to thought leader in the  policy-making community, Representative Jane Harman has left an  indelible mark that has deeply strengthened the safety of our Nation. I  am forever grateful for her service, her friendship, and wish her all  the best in her next adventures.                            ____________________
