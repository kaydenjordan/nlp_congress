 Mr. Speaker, the American people hate the # inhuman  liberal media more and more every day. The last example? A Washington  Post op-ed, titled, ``I Would Have Aborted a Fetus With Down  Syndrome.'' My entire hometown of Sugar Land, Texas, was disgusted by  those nine words.   I sent the hurtful article to Ammie, Massey, and Kristin, three  friends with gorgeous Down kids. Ammie was stunned, because The Post  basically said:         If you knew your child would have cancer, cerebral palsy,       diabetes, be deaf, blind, mute, or autistic, they should be       aborted.    Ammie's Sadie has Down. Ammie says about her daughter:         Even on my hardest days, her smile can take all the       difficulties away from my day. I will forget them. Through my       tears, I typed this note.    Mr. Speaker, none of us is perfect and none of us should be aborted  because we are not perfect.                            ____________________
