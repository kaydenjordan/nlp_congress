 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the  confirmation of now Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson as a Justice on the  Supreme Court of the United States of America.   It is an important moment for our country but also a special moment  for me because Angela, my wife, and two of our sons are here visiting  the Capitol this week. They witnessed history in the making when we  voted to confirm, just a few minutes ago, Justice Jackson. Angela and I  take great joy in knowing that not just our three sons but young people  across the country will see Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson as an example  of the great heights that they, too, can achieve.   For the very first time in our Nation's history, the Senate has  confirmed a Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States. For  only the sixth time, we have confirmed a woman to the Supreme Court,  and for the fourth time, we have confirmed a working mother. It is also  the first time in 50 years that the Senate has confirmed a Justice with  public defense experience.   This nomination represents progress, and I am heartened that it was a  bipartisan majority of Senators who came together to make history  today. I also know that this progress would not have been possible  without someone who was brave enough to step ahead on her own; without  someone willing to work twice as hard in order to be the first; without  someone able to persevere no matter how challenging, how difficult, or  how full of doubt her path ahead may sometimes be.   It shouldn't have been this hard. As you know, I am a member of the  Judiciary Committee, so I can attest that, when then-Judge Jackson came  before the committee with an outstanding judicial record, with  bipartisan acclaim, and historic qualifications, she came prepared. She  did answer a whole range of important questions, and she was  forthcoming. She was clear and gracious.   Many Senators took the opportunity to engage deeply on issues that  will shape the future of our Nation--issues like the role of technology  and innovation, voting rights, Tribal sovereignty, and much, much more;  but, sadly, as has been referenced, some of our colleagues chose to  fill their time with hostility, bad faith, and misleading smears.   They chose to hold Judge Jackson to a different standard than other  Supreme Court nominees whom they themselves had previously supported.  In the same breath as they tried to praise Judge Jackson's character  and qualifications, they denigrated her motives; they questioned her  impartiality and made up excuse after excuse for why they couldn't  support her nomination. It was painful to watch, not just for me but  for people across the country.   Judge Jackson was in the spotlight for days, but she continually met  disrespect with calm composure. It is an experience that is all too  common for those with the audacity to break new ground. Judge Jackson  was unfairly tested, but she persevered.   I believe that Judge Jackson deserved better than the treatment she  received during the confirmation process. When you see Senators cast  aside their good faith in questioning nominees, the threat to the  integrity of our justice system is very real, and the cynicism it  breeds for our institutions is real. These are the issues that this  Senate and that each Senator must confront.   But, today, I want to--and I choose to--celebrate the historic  achievement of this confirmation.   Over the last few weeks, I have received thousands of letters and  emails and other messages, including on social media, from Californians  who support Justice Jackson's confirmation. The messages have come from  people of all backgrounds and from every corner of my home State. I  have heard from Californians who admire the tenacity, the grace, and  the integrity that Justice Jackson showed in committee. I have also  gotten messages from so many Californians, young Californians, who see  themselves in Justice Jackson's story and from Californians who say  that the Court and our country will be better because of her service.    So, as we cast our historic votes, I celebrate the better America  that we are building, wherein our courts better reflect and understand  the diverse country that they serve. I celebrate the joy that Justice  Jackson has brought to people across not just California but across the  Nation. I celebrate the commitment to equal rights and equal justice  that she will bring to the Supreme Court; and I celebrate the  inspiration that she provides to young people, especially young people  of color, who will write the next chapter of our American story.   When Judge Jackson introduced herself to the American people in the  course of the confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, she said  that she stood on the shoulders of the civil rights icon and her  personal hero, Judge Constance Baker Motley. For many in the next  generation, their hero will be Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.   I have shared with others and want to share again today that this  confirmation represents one more step toward making our institutions  and our courts more inclusive for all Americans.  [[Page S2076]]    So it is in that spirit that I ask unanimous consent to make a few  additional remarks in Spanish.      (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         Today, we are celebrating a historic moment. We are       celebrating the progress that we made to ensure that the       Supreme Court better reflects our country.        Judge Jackson is more than qualified and is going to bring       important and necessary perspectives to the Supreme Court.       Unfortunately, she was attacked by Republicans during her       confirmation process; but to every attack, Judge Jackson       responded with grace and patience. She showed the country       that she will be an exceptional Supreme Court Justice, and       she will keep being an inspiration for the next generation.    Madam President, Judge--now Justice--Jackson has earned her place on  the Supreme Court.   I will end by acknowledging that, while one person alone, sitting on  a Court of nine equals, can't single-handedly create faith in the  institution, I have every confidence that Justice Jackson will  strengthen the Supreme Court and help our country progress forward.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Hispanic Educational Resources and Empowerment Act of 2022, which I  introduced today.   Hispanic-serving institutions provide incredible opportunities for  millions of low-income and first-generation students. I am proud that  my State of California is home to 174 HSls and 51 emerging HSls, the  most in the country. That is why I launched the first-ever Senate HSI  Caucus with my colleague, Senator Menendez--to spotlight and advocate  for the 559 HSIs across our country. These critical institutions  educate our future leaders and help to build a more diverse and  inclusive workforce.   Over the last 2 years, the number of HSls in our country declined for  the first time in two decades. A decrease in higher education  enrollment among Latino students during the COVID-19 pandemic has led  to the decrease in the number of HSls, illustrating the need to invest  in Latino youth. That is why I am introducing the HERE Act.   If enacted, this bill would support Latino students throughout  secondary and postsecondary education. Specifically, the HERE Act would  provide $150 million for grants to create partnerships between HSls and  K-12 school districts that serve large populations of Latino students.   Schools could use this funding to provide academic support that  better prepares students for postsecondary education. They could create  new programs to foster a college-going culture by exposing students and  their families to postsecondary opportunities. And they could better  support students through the college application and transition  process. Additionally, schools could use grants to address non-academic  needs that serve as barriers to college enrollment and completion--such  as childcare, food insecurity, financial hardship, and more.   Latinos are the largest, youngest, and second fastest growing  minority population in the United States. While making up 18 percent of  our country's population, Latinos comprise 26 percent of  prekindergarten through grade 12 enrollment. Latino students are going  to college more than ever before,  [[Page S2097]]  but they still face lower educational outcomes, including lower grades,  lower scores on standardized tests, and higher dropout rates.   As a Senator representing one of the most diverse States in the  country, I am proud to work with my leagues to ensure the American  dream is a reality for every student.   I want to thank Congressman Joaquin Castro for introducing this bill  with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this  effort to empower Latino youth.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Hispanic Educational Resources and Empowerment Act of 2022, which I  introduced today.
