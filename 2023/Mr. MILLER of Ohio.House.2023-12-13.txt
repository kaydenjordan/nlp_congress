 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Bill Overton, a  Vietnam veteran from Ohio who served his country and continues to serve  his fellow veterans.   Bill has been the loudest spokesperson for veterans and veterans  programs in northeast Ohio. He has assisted over 300 veterans with  their compensation and benefits.   Bill has been able to ensure hospice veterans receive care, injured  veterans receive compensation, and disabled veterans obtain vehicles  and adaptive housing. His work has brought approximately $5 million to  veterans in our community alone.   When the Battlefield Cross was removed from the Ohio Western Reserve  in 2017, Bill was instrumental in applying public pressure on the  National Cemetery Administration to return it.   Ohio's Seventh District is thankful to have Bill Overton and is  grateful for his years of service, and for his service that will still  continue.   Mr. Speaker, Bill is loved. We thank him for everything he does.                            ____________________
