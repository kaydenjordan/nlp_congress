 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under rule  XIV, I object to further proceeding.    Madam President, on today's, tomorrow's, and this week's  business, the Senate will soon vote on two more nominees to join  President Biden's administration: Christopher Fonzone to serve as  general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  and Kiran Ahuja to be Director of the Office of Personnel Management.  Those votes will happen tonight and tomorrow.   The discussions on the bipartisan infrastructure bill and a budget  reconciliation bill are both moving forward and will continue  throughout the week.   But tomorrow--tomorrow--the Senate will also take a crucial vote on  whether to start debate on major voting rights legislation.   I want to say that again. Tomorrow, the Senate will take a vote on  whether to start debate on legislation to protect Americans' voting  rights. It is not a vote on any particular policy. It is not a vote on  this bill or that bill. It is a vote on whether the Senate should  simply debate the issue about voting rights--the crucial issue of  voting rights in this country.   Now, by all rights, we shouldn't have to debate voting rights on the  floor of the U.S. Senate. These rights should be sacrosanct, but the  events of the last few months compel us to have this debate now.   Why is there such urgency? Because of what has been happening in  Republican legislature after legislature in the last several months.  Voting rights--the most fundamental right of a democracy, the right  that men and women have died for in wartime and in peacetime, the right  by which all other rights are secured--are under assault--under assault  from one end of the country to the other.   In the wake of the 2020 election, Donald Trump told a lie--a Big  Lie--that the election was stolen from him by voter fraud. There was no  evidence for this. His own administration concluded that the 2020  election was one of the safest in history. His lawyers were laughed out  of courts, many by Republican judges--some by judges he appointed, that  Trump appointed. But he kept saying it anyway. He lied over and over  and over again. Donald Trump lied over and over and over again,  poisoning our democracy, lighting a fire beneath Republican State  legislatures, which immediately launched the most sweeping voter  suppression effort in years.   Just a note, how despicable a man is Donald Trump. He lost an  election legitimately. He can't face that--that it was his failure. And  he creates a lie--a Big Lie--and wins so many people over to that lie  with the help of news media and other news commentators who are lying,  as well, and they know it.   Again, Donald Trump, with his despicable lies, has lit a fire beneath  Republican State legislatures, and they  [[Page S4638]]  have launched the most sweeping voter suppression efforts in at least  80 years.   More than 250 bills in 43 States were introduced just between the  months of January and February that would restrict the right to vote.  Do you want to know how many were introduced during a similar period of  time last year, the year before Donald Trump was telling the Big Lie?  Thirty-five. Thirty-five in 2020 and more than 250 in 2021.   Today, in June, there have been nearly 400 bills introduced. The only  thing that changed between 2020 and 2021 was Donald Trump's Big Lie  about massive fraud.   And now in States like Georgia and Iowa and Florida and Montana,  these proposals are becoming law under the vicious guise of election  integrity. The words ``election integrity'' aren't a guise. There is  nothing vicious about them. The way Republican legislatures are using  those words is vicious and a guise, a falsehood, fake.   I want my Republican colleagues--maybe, we can awaken their  conscience, maybe, on something as sacred as voting rights. I want my  Republican colleagues to listen to some of the policies that have been  proposed by Republican State legislatures and tell me how they are  about election integrity, how they are about suppressing fraud:   Reducing polling hours in polling places. How is that about election  integrity? How does that reduce voter fraud?   Mandating that every precinct, no matter how large or small, have the  same number of ballot drop boxes--a county of a million or a county of  1,000, the same number. How does that reduce fraud? What does that have  to do with election integrity?   No after-hours voting, no 24-hour voting, no drive-through voting.  What does that have to do with election fraud?   It certainly has everything to do with reducing people's right to  vote and the ability to vote, but nothing to do with election fraud.   My Republican colleagues, how does making it a crime to give food or  water to voters waiting in long lines at the polls deter voter fraud,  which, really, we have found no evidence exists, to begin with--very  little evidence?   By the way, in so many States, if you are African American, if you  are inner city, if you are poor, if you are Brown, you have to wait a  lot longer than if you are White and in the suburbs. Don't give them  water. Don't allow them to have a drink as they are waiting in the hot  Sun in line to vote. Yeah. What does that have to do with voter fraud?  It has to do with cruelty, it has to do with nastiness, and it has to  do with suppressing the vote.   Allowing a judge to overturn an election; allowing a partisan State  election board to replace a duly elected county election board member  if they are underperforming--what does that have to do with fraud? What  does that have to do with fraud?   Removing student IDs from the list of valid forms of identification-- that is election integrity? Bunk. We know what you are doing. You don't  want students to vote. Yeah. Don't let students vote. Turn them off to  the whole process, and make America even more alienated.   Delaying the hours of Sunday voting until the evening, which,  coincidentally or not so coincidentally, by these Republican  legislatures makes it harder for Black churchgoers to participate in  voter drives after Sunday services--how despicable. Does that sound  like Jim Crow, my Republican colleagues? It sure does to a lot of us.   I challenge my Republican colleagues. I challenge you, Republican  Senators: Come to the floor. Defend these policies. Tell us how they  secure the vote. Tell us how they prevent nearly nonexistent voter  fraud. How does removing student IDs as a valid form of identification  secure our elections? Do you have any evidence that 40-year-olds are  showing up at the polls with fake student IDs? Come on, show us. How is  criminalizing giving water or food to voters in a line a fraud  prevention measure? You got any evidence of that? What arguments do  Republicans have for restrictions on Sunday voting? That is what Texas  Senators--Texas Republicans want to do. Do any of my colleagues  actually have evidence that voter fraud is especially prevalent on the  Lord's Day? Please. We know what you are up to. America knows what you  are up to. And not to debate this? Are you afraid to debate it? Do you  not have any good arguments?   Let's dispense with this nonsense. There is no real principle behind  these policies. They are not about election integrity, and they are not  about voter fraud. These policies have one purpose and one purpose  only: making it harder for younger, poorer, non-White, and typically  Democratic voters to access the ballot and to give Republicans a  partisan advantage at the polls by making it harder for Democratic- leaning voters to vote.   You lose an election, you are not supposed to stop people from  voting, even if they didn't vote for you. That is not democracy, my  Republican friends. You lose an election, you are supposed to try  harder to win over the voters you lost.   Republicans across the country are trying to stop the other side from  voting. That tears and rips apart the very fabric of our democracy.   Disenfranchising millions of Americans is bad enough, but there is  actually another sinister component of these voter suppression laws. In  States like Arizona, Kansas, Arkansas, and Georgia, Republican  legislatures are trying to give more power to themselves and other  partisan bodies to undermine, override, and neuter bipartisan election  boards and county-elected officials.   It has always been bipartisan. They didn't like the result. They lost  fair and square. Get rid of the election board official when there is  no evidence they did anything wrong. The cumulative effect will make it  easier for followers of Trump's Big Lie, for partisan Republicans to  rig the rules and try to overturn election results.   I read this article in the New York Times this weekend. You could  weep from reading it. They reported that at least 10 members of county  election boards in Georgia have been removed or are about to be removed  in the wake of the new law passed by the GOP legislature. These are the  folks who are in charge of selecting ballot drop box locations. They  pointed out an African-American woman who made sure that a poor area  had a drop box every year to allow people to vote. They want to kick  her off the board. No one knows why. We do know why. There is no real,  legitimate reason why. According to the Times, who are they kicking  off? At least five are people of color, most are Democrats, and they  are all most likely to be replaced by Republicans.   Please, my colleagues, read this article. Read this article on how  Republican States are expanding their power over elections, by Nick  Corasaniti and Reid J. Epstein, June 19, 2021. Read it. Can you read  this article and still believe what Republican legislatures are doing  is on the level? Can you read this article and believe they are not  trying to jaundice and bias voting from what has traditionally been a  process that is free and open and fair in many places--in most places?  Read it. Just read it. It makes you want to weep what they are doing.   This nice lady, who just wanted to help her people vote in a fair and  honest way, gets kicked off the board or is getting kicked off the  board.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record this full article from the New York Times dated June 19, 2021                  [From the New York Times, June 19, 2021]       How Republican States Are Expanding Their Power Over Elections                  (By Nick Corasaniti and Reid J. Epstein)         In Georgia, Republicans are removing Democrats of color       from local boards. In Arkansas, they have stripped election       control from county authorities. And they are expanding their       election power in many other states.        Lonnie Hollis has been a member of the Troup County       election board in West Georgia since 2013. A Democrat and one       of two Black women on the board, she has advocated Sunday       voting, helped voters on Election Days and pushed for a new       precinct location at a Black church in a nearby town.        But this year, Ms. Hollis will be removed from the board,       the result of a local election law signed by Gov. Brian Kemp,       a Republican. Previously, election board members were       selected by both political parties, county commissioners and       the three biggest municipalities in Troup County. Now, the       G.O.P.-controlled county commission has the sole authority to       restructure the board and appoint all the new members.        ``I speak out and I know the laws,'' Ms. Hollis said in an       interview. ``The bottom line is they don't like people that       have some type  [[Page S4639]]       of intelligence and know what they're doing, because they       know they can't influence them.''        Ms. Hollis is not alone. Across Georgia, members of at       least 10 county election boards have been removed, had their       position eliminated or are likely to be kicked off through       local ordinances or new laws passed by the state legislature.       At least five are people of color and most are Democrats--      though some are Republicans--and they will most likely all be       replaced by Republicans.        Ms. Hollis and local officials like her have been some of       the earliest casualties as Republican-led legislatures mount       an expansive takeover of election administration in a raft of       new voting bills this year.        G.O.P. lawmakers have also stripped secretaries of state of       their power, asserted more control over state election       boards, made it easier to overturn election results, and       pursued several partisan audits and inspections of 2020       results.        Republican state lawmakers have introduced at least 216       bills in 41 states to give legislatures more power over       elections officials, according to the States United Democracy       Center, a new bipartisan organization that aims to protect       democratic norms. Of those, 24 have been enacted into law       across 14 states.        G.O.P. lawmakers in Georgia say the new measures are meant       to improve the performance of local boards, and reduce the       influence of the political parties. But the laws allow       Republicans to remove local officials they don't like, and       because several of them have been Black Democrats, voting       rights groups fear that these are further attempts to       disenfranchise voters of color.        The maneuvers risk eroding some of the core checks that       stood as a bulwark against former President Donald J. Trump       as he sought to subvert the 2020 election results. Had these       bills been in place during the aftermath of the election,       Democrats say, they would have significantly added to the       turmoil Mr. Trump and his allies wrought by trying to       overturn the outcome. They worry that proponents of Mr.       Trump's conspiracy theories will soon have much greater       control over the levers of the American elections system.        ``It's a thinly veiled attempt to wrest control from       officials who oversaw one of the most secure elections in our       history and put it in the hands of bad actors,'' said Jena       Griswold, the chairwoman of the Democratic Association of       Secretaries of State and the current Colorado secretary of       state. ``The risk is the destruction of democracy.''        Officials like Ms. Hollis are responsible for decisions       like selecting drop box and precinct locations, sending out       voter notices, establishing early voting hours and certifying       elections. But the new laws are targeting high-level state       officials as well, in particular secretaries of state--both       Republican and Democratic--who stood up to Mr. Trump and his       allies last year.        Republicans in Arizona have introduced a bill that would       largely strip Katie Hobbs, the Democratic secretary of state,       of her authority over election lawsuits, and then expire when       she leaves office. And they have introduced another bill that       would give the Legislature more power over setting the       guidelines for election administration, a major task       currently carried out by the secretary of state.        Under Georgia's new voting law, Republicans significantly       weakened the secretary of state's office after Brad       Raffensperger, a Republican who is the current secretary,       rebuffed Mr. Trump's demands to ``find'' votes. They removed       the secretary of state as the chair of the state election       board and relieved the office of its voting authority on the       board.        Kansas Republicans in May overrode a veto from Gov. Laura       Kelly, a Democrat, to enact laws stripping the governor of       the power to modify election laws and prohibiting the       secretary of state, a Republican who repeatedly vouched for       the security of voting by mail, from settling election-      related lawsuits without the Legislature's consent.        And more Republicans who cling to Mr. Trump's election lies       are running for secretary of state, putting a critical office       within reach of conspiracy theorists. In Georgia,       Representative Jody Hice, a Republican who voted against       certifying President Biden's victory, is running against Mr.       Raffensperger. Republican candidates with similar views are       running for secretary of state in Nevada, Arizona and       Michigan.        ``In virtually every state, every election administrator is       going to feel like they're under the magnifying glass,'' said       Victoria Bassetti, a senior adviser to the States United       Democracy Center.        More immediately, it is local election officials at the       county and municipal level who are being either removed or       stripped of their power.        In Arkansas, Republicans were stung last year when Jim       Sorvillo, a three-term state representative from Little Rock,       lost re-election by 24 votes to Ashley Hudson, a Democrat and       local lawyer. Elections officials in Pulaski County, which       includes Little Rock, were later found to have accidentally       tabulated 327 absentee ballots during the vote-counting       process, 27 of which came from the district.        Mr. Sorvillo filed multiple lawsuits aiming to stop Ms.       Hudson from being seated, and all were rejected. The       Republican caucus considered refusing to seat Ms. Hudson,       then ultimately voted to accept her.        But last month, Arkansas Republicans wrote new legislation       that allows a state board of election commissioners--composed       of six Republicans and one Democrat--to investigate and       ``institute corrective action'' on a wide variety of issues       at every stage of the voting process, from registration to       the casting and counting of ballots to the certification of       elections. The law applies to all counties, but it is widely       believed to be aimed at Pulaski, one of the few in the state       that favor Democrats.        The author of the legislation, State Representative Mark       Lowery, a Republican from a suburb of Little Rock, said it       was necessary to remove election power from the local       authorities, who in Pulaski County are Democrats, because       otherwise Republicans could not get a fair shake.        ``Without this legislation, the only entity you could have       referred impropriety to is the prosecuting attorney, who is a       Democrat, and possibly not had anything done,'' Mr. Lowery       said in an interview. ``This gives another level of       investigative authority to a board that is commissioned by       the state to oversee elections.''        Asked about last year's election, Mr. Lowery said, ``I do       believe Donald Trump was elected president.''        A separate new Arkansas law allows a state board to ``take       over and conduct elections'' in a county if a committee of       the legislature determines that there are questions about the       ``appearance of an equal, free and impartial election.''        In Georgia, the legislature passed a unique law for some       counties. For Troup County, State Representative Randy Nix, a       Republican, said he had introduced the bill that restructured       the county election board--and will remove Ms. Hollis--only       after it was requested by county commissioners. He said he       was not worried that the commission, a partisan body with       four Republicans and one Democrat, could exert influence over       elections.        ``The commissioners are all elected officials and will face       the voters to answer for their actions,'' Mr. Nix said in an       email.        Eric Mosley, the county manager for Troup County, which Mr.       Trump carried by 22 points, said that the decision to ask Mr.       Nix for the bill was meant to make the board more bipartisan.       It was unanimously supported by the commission.        ``We felt that removing both the Republican and Democratic       representation and just truly choose members of the community       that invest hard to serve those community members was the       true intent of the board,'' Mr. Mosley said. ``Our goal is to       create both political and racial diversity on the board.''        In Morgan County, east of Atlanta, Helen Butler has been       one of the state's most prominent Democratic voices on voting       rights and election administration. A member of the county       board of elections in a rural, Republican county, she also       runs the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, a group       dedicated to protecting the voting rights of Black Americans       and increasing their civic engagement.        But Ms. Butler will be removed from the county board at the       end of the month, after Mr. Kemp signed a local bill that       ended the ability of political parties to appoint members.        ``I think it's all a part of the ploy for the takeover of       local boards of elections that the state legislature has put       in place,'' Ms. Butler said. ``It is them saying that they       have the right to say whether an election official is doing       it right, when in fact they don't work in the day to day and       don't understand the process themselves.''        It's not just Democrats who are being removed. In DeKalb       County, the state's fourth-largest, Republicans chose not to       renominate Baoky Vu to the election board after more than 12       years in the position. Mr. Vu, a Republican, had joined with       Democrats in a letter opposing an election-related bill that       eventually failed to pass.        To replace Mr. Vu, Republicans nominated Paul Maner, a       well-known local conservative with a history of false       statements, including an insinuation that the son of a       Georgia congresswoman was killed in ``a drug deal gone bad.''        Back in LaGrange, Ms. Hollis is trying to do as much as she       can in the time she has left on the board. The extra precinct       in nearby Hogansville, where the population is roughly 50       percent Black, is a top priority. While its population is       only about 3,000, the town is bifurcated by a rail line, and       Ms. Hollis said that sometimes it can take an exceedingly       long time for a line of freight cars to clear, which is       problematic on Election Days.        ``We've been working on this for over a year,'' Ms. Hollis       said, saying Republicans had thrown up procedural hurdles to       block the process. But she was undeterred.        ``I'm not going to sit there and wait for you to tell me       what it is that I should do for the voters there,'' she said.       ``I'm going to do the right thing.''    Madam President, my Republican friends are fond of  saying that they just want to make it easier to vote and harder to  cheat in an election. But when you look at what they are actually  doing, it is spectacularly obvious that Republicans are making it  harder to vote and easier to steal an election. The Big Lie that  started with Donald Trump is infecting them--infecting them. Lies don't  matter, and they don't matter when it comes to the sacred process of  elections--free, open, fair elections where everyone has an opportunity  to vote.  [[Page S4640]]    Do my colleagues forget? Remember what Donald Trump did? Was he  interested in a free, open, fair election? Donald Trump tried to  pressure local officials to overturn a democratic election in America.  It was a stress test on our democracy unlike any in recent history, but  our institutions held. So now what do Republicans want to do? Change  the results. Change the election officials.   Again, Trump tried to pressure local officials to overturn democratic  elections in a huge stress test on our democracy. Our institutions  held. Local officials certified election results. The courts rejected  spurious claims of fraud. Vice President Pence, no less, opened the  proper envelopes. The House and Senate came together to count the  results of the electoral college in the immediate aftermath of an armed  insurrection.   Now--now--because they couldn't win the election and our  institutions, our democratic--small ``d,'' democratic--institutions  held, they want to change who is running the elections to be partisan  and biased. Republican State legislatures are actively removing many of  the barriers that prevented Donald Trump from subverting our elections.  Shame. Shame. Shame.   I lay all this information at the feet of my Republican colleagues: a  sweeping effort to disenfranchise millions of voters, mostly Black and  Brown students, the working poor; an attack on the checks that held our  democracy together in the face of Donald Trump's assaults. Many of us  wondered: Will these institutions hold? Would Trump-appointed judges  tell the Trump lawyers that they were full of bunk and there wasn't  fraud? They did. It was a glorious moment for our democracy, and the  Republican majority here in the Senate wants to undo it and doesn't  even want to debate it.   We can argue what should be done to protect voting rights and  safeguard our democracy, but don't you think we should be able to  debate the issue? The vote tomorrow is on, to my people watching. It is  called a motion to proceed. It is how we get bills on the floor of the  Senate. It needs 60 votes to be able to be debated. Will our  Republicans let us debate it? That is the only question on the table  for the U.S. Senate tomorrow, and we are about to find out how my  Republican colleagues will answer that question.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
