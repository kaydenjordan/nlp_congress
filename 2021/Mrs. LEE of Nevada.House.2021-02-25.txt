 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my  hometown, Las Vegas.   What comes to mind when I say Las Vegas? Bright lights, slot  machines, big shows, massive conventions, showgirls with the big iconic  feather headpieces. It is a magical place.   But the glitz and glamour doesn't happen on its own. Even though it  feels that way, it is not magic.   It is the result of the work of thousands of Nevadans working in the  entertainment, tourism, and hospitality industry. I am talking about  the Vegas performers, ticket takers, stage managers, convention  workers, and bartenders. To them, Vegas isn't a weekend getaway or a  drunken cliche, it is their livelihood, which sadly has been gutted by  the COVID pandemic.   Many of them don't have jobs to go back to because the industry can't  thrive when people aren't traveling. They are stuck until the pandemic  is over. And because of that we need to help get them through this  moment.   The American Rescue Plan includes hundreds of billions of dollars for  small businesses, laid off workers, and direct aid to families and  communities like those in Las Vegas, including the $23 billion to  support the travel and tourism industry, and the $1.25 billion in  targeted relief for live venues.   We need to support the venues and the workers that make our magical  town the number one destination in the country, and we can do that by  passing the American Rescue Plan.
