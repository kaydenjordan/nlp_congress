 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Wichita  State University men's basketball team and their head coach, Isaac  Brown, for winning the America Athletic Conference regular-season  championship. This is the Shockers' first AAC championship after  joining the conference in the 2017-2018 season.   The Shockers ended their regular season with an overall 15-4 record  after ranking seventh in the AAC preseason poll. WSU now enters  postseason play as the No. 1 seed.   I am so proud of these men who have displayed perseverance on the  court during this challenging year, and I know they will continue to  make Wichita and Kansas proud.   I wish them the best of luck as they compete this weekend in Texas  during the AAC men's basketball tournament. Go Shox.                            ____________________
