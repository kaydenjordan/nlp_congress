 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I had planned to speak first today  about the NDAA. I had planned to discuss our work to ensure American  servicemembers can protect our Nation and secure peace for the United  States.   Unfortunately, the inexplicable passivity and weakness of local  leaders in our own country has denied some citizens peace and security  right here at home.   Here we are in Congress, equipping our Armed Forces to protect the  homeland. Yet some local leaders have apparently felt it would be too  politically incorrect to do their jobs and keep the peace.   It has now been 22 days since radical demonstrators seized control of  several blocks of downtown Seattle, drove the police out of a precinct,  and declared an autonomous zone, which the mob itself would rule.   It is worth pausing to consider how the mainstream media and leading  Democrats might have reacted if tea party protesters in 2009 had  forcibly created a breakaway zone within a major city and barred the  actual authorities from entering. Somehow I am skeptical the press  would have bent over backward to find a sympathetic light. Somehow I  doubt these same politicians would have felt compelled to curry favor  with the occupiers or flirt with their demands.   But we are talking about the American left in 2020. So, instead, what  we get is a major newspaper lavishing praise--praise--on the  ``liberated streets'' and a mayor and local government that have  expressly declined to restore order and the equal protection of the  law.   The mob has gotten its way.  [[Page S4084]]    There have been numerous shootings in this lawless place. About a  week ago, a 19-year-old was shot and killed. Last weekend, after yet  another shooting, a 16-year-old is dead and a 14-year-old was injured.  Some reports suggest these two boys were shot by a self-appointed  security squad. These are miscellaneous citizens who roam the area with  guns drawn after the occupiers drove the real police out.   We are talking about Seattle, WA, in the United States of America?   The rule of law cannot fade in and out with the fashions of the  radical left. No leaders should have sacrificed small businesses to  riots and mobs a few weeks back, and no leader should let threats or  leftwing jargon persuade them to tolerate occupations for weeks on end.   I understand that, just this morning, Seattle's mayor finally-- finally--released a new order that at last empowered police to bring an  end to this. So let's hope the rule of law finally--finally--prevails.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter, the  Senate has indeed turned to what will be the 60th annual National  Defense Authorization Act. If you look at the world news, it would  appear we have done so not a moment too soon.   After months of threats, President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party  finally delivered the punch in the mouth to the city of Hong Kong that  they are calling a ``national security law.'' As I and others have  warned for months, it tramples all over the freedoms and autonomy that  have set Hong Kong apart.   Today marks the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from the  United Kingdom. Normally this anniversary would have occasioned  peaceful demonstration. Instead, the new law has brought scores of  arrests and boasts from local authorities about how many peaceful  demonstrators they have jailed, new harsh penalties for Hongkongers for  new and vague offenses, and new authority from Beijing to intervene at  will.   It appears to directly--directly--violate China's international  promises and effectively end the ``one country, two systems'' policy.   I have discussed at some length the specific consequences China will  face for this. I will continue to discuss them in the future.   This same week, we received new confirmation that China's ethnic  cleansing campaign against the Uighur people in Xinjiang includes  forced abortions, forced birth control, and State-enforced  sterilizations on a systematic scale.   All of this is in addition to the international provocation that  China has only stepped up during this pandemic--which they helped  worsen--against Taiwan, against India, against the Philippines, and so  on.   China is not our only adversary occupying the spotlight. Recent days  have intensified questions about Russia's negative role in the Middle  East.   I have long warned that Russia and other adversaries will exploit any  American passivity or retreat from this important region. Whether in  Syria or Afghanistan, the question is whether we will stand our ground  and exert our influence or allow Iran, Russia, and terrorists to  literally push us out of the region.   Sadly, as the Senate turns to the NDAA, the need to continue making  swift progress on our national defense strategy is staring us plain in  the face. Fortunately, Chairman Inhofe, Ranking Member Reed, and our  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have put forward a bill that  rises to the challenge.   The bill establishes the Pacific Deterrence Initiative. It lays out a  clear vision for making our Pacific joint force more adaptable and our  commitments to regional partners more feasible, smarter basing for  forward-deployed Americans, more supplies and equipment prepositioned.   It will encourage more streamlined technology so that, from weapons  platforms to information security, America and its allies in China's  backyard stand ready to counter aggression together.   This NDAA authorizes full funding for the European Deterrence  Initiative, doubling down on our NATO alliances as we check the worst  impulses of Putin's Russia. The bill will further limit the information  Putin gets pertaining to missile defense, bring more focus on tracking  Russian support for terrorist proxies and despotic regimes, and renew  our commitment to have U.S. forces support, train, and keep watch  alongside our partners.   But it isn't enough to check our adversaries today. We also need to  outrun them toward the future. So this legislation will also support  critical reserves to help us secure a decisive edge in everything from  hypersonic weapons to 5G communications.   Threats to our Nation are pulling American servicemembers in all  directions. Fortunately, this NDAA has all of their backs.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, while the Senate  maintains the serious approach that builds bipartisan successes like  the CARES Act and the Great American Outdoors Act, the House Democrats  appear addicted to pointless political theater.   Well, our absentee neighbors have finally arrived back in the  Capitol, and they have wasted no time resuming old tricks. The Speaker  has chosen to spend the House's time this week on a multithousand-page  cousin of the Green New Deal masquerading as a highway bill.   You don't have to take my word for it; the chair of the House  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said so. He said: ``This is  the application of the principles of the Green New Deal.'' And he is  right, because here are the four pillars of the Green New Deal: No. 1,  spend an insane amount of money; No. 2, check every far-left  ideological box; No. 3, propose bad policies; and No. 4, forget about  making law from the very beginning so you can legislate in a world of  pure fantasy--pure fantasy. Check, check, check, and check.   This so-called infrastructure bill would siphon billions in funding  from actual infrastructure to funnel into climate change policy. By  putting a huge thumb on the scale for mass transit and electric  vehicles, it revises the old Obama-Biden focus on disproportionately  helping major metro areas, leaving less for the rest of our country. No  wonder it came out of committee in the House on a purely bipartisan  vote. No wonder the White House declared it not a serious proposal and  made it clear this will never become law.   Naturally, this nonsense is not going anywhere in the Senate. It will  just join the list of absurd House proposals that were only drawn up to  show fealty to the radical left. Here in the Senate, we will keep at  the serious work of our Nation.                            ____________________
