 Mr. President, in 2008, Congress responded to rising  reports of child sexual abuse material--CSAM--online by passing the  PROTECT Act to direct the Department of Justice to combat these heinous  crimes. However, in the decade that followed, DOJ failed to request the  manpower, funding, and resources to combat this scourge, leaving both  the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children--NCMEC--and law  enforcement agencies uncoordinated, understaffed, and underfunded. As a  result, though tech companies reported more than 45 million instances  of CSAM to NCMEC in the last year alone, just a fraction were  investigated, and even fewer were prosecuted and convicted.   Yet, rather than confronting this failure by Congress and the  executive branch, my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee have  put forth the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive  Technologies--EARN IT--Act, a deeply flawed piece of legislation that  would revoke online platforms' intermediary liability protections with  regard to not only Federal civil Jaw, but also any State law broadly  related to CSAM.   The EARN IT Act will not protect children. It will not stop the  spread of child sexual abuse material, nor target the monsters who  produce and share it, and it will not help the victims of these evil  crimes. What it will do is threaten the free speech, privacy, and  security of every single American. This is because, at its core, the  amended EARN IT Act magnifies the failures of the Stop Enabling Sex  Traffickers Act--SESTA--and its House companion, the Fight Online Sex  Trafficking Act--FOSTA. Experts believe that SESTA/FOSTA has done  nothing to help victims or stop sex trafficking, while creating  collateral damage for marginalized communities and the speech of all  Americans. A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of FOSTA on  First Amendment grounds is proceeding through the courts, and there is  bicameral Federal legislation to study the widespread negative impacts  of the bill on marginalized groups.   Yet, the authors of the EARN IT Act decided to take this kind of  carveout and expand it further to State civil and criminal statutes. By  allowing any individual State to set laws for internet content, this  bill would create massive uncertainty, both for strong encryption and  constitutionally protected speech online. What is worse, the flood of  State laws that could potentially arise under the EARN IT Act raises  strong Fourth Amendment concerns, meaning that any CSAM evidence  collected could be rendered inadmissible in court and accused CSAM  offenders could get off scot-free. This is not a risk that I am willing  to take.   Let me be clear: The proliferation of these heinous crimes against  children is a serious problem. However, for these reasons and more, the  EARN IT Act is not the solution. Moreover, it ignores what Congress can  and should be doing to combat this heinous crime. The U.S. has a number  of important evidence-based programs in existence that are proven to  keep kids safe, and they are in desperate need of funding to do their  good work. Yet the EARN IT Act doesn't include a single dollar of  funding for these important programs. It is time for the U.S.  Government to spend the funds necessary to save children's lives now.   In May of 2020, I introduced the Invest in Child Safety Act to do  exactly that. My bill would drastically increase the number of  prosecutors and agents hunting down child predators, require a single  person to be personally responsible for these efforts, and direct more  than $5 billion in mandatory funding to the folks who can actually make  a difference in this fight.   I believe this historic, mandatory investment in personnel and  funding is necessary to truly take on the scourge of child  exploitation, and I urge my colleagues to support my approach.  Meanwhile, I intend to object to any unanimous consent agreement  regarding the EARN IT Act.                            ____________________
