 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the  realities of the climate crisis as seen in my district and across the  State of California.   Earlier this year, Los Angeles County issued its first blizzard  warning since February 4, 1989.   Unfamiliar wintry conditions resulting in up to a foot of snow with  80-miles-per-hour winds overtook many parts of Los Angeles County,  leaving Californians with flooded homes and no power.   In my district, the Baldwin Hills neighborhood was hit with a local  state of emergency as a disastrous rainstorm demolished daily rain  records from over 100 years ago causing fatal mudslides. Today in Los  Angeles, we suffered a tornado.   This is not normal.   Madam Speaker, I cannot stand idly by while Republicans continue to  deny the validity of the crisis before us, seen firsthand by my  district experiencing disastrous weather patterns not seen for over  three decades.   I have fought for the protection of our environment my entire life  and will do everything in my power to work against the actions taken in  this very room by my colleagues across the aisle to propagate the  climate crisis that, if not addressed, will destroy Mother Earth and  her inhabitants.   We must take the lessons we are learning in California to heart  because this is only the beginning.   Madam Speaker, if this isn't a wake-up call, I don't know what is.                            ____________________
