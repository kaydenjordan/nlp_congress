 Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the  nomination of Notre Dame Law Professor Amy Barrett to serve on the  Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. She is an eminently qualified and  exceptionally bright nominee who has received praise and support across  the legal profession. She clerked for Judge Silberman on the DC Circuit  Court of Appeals and for Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. She has  experience in private practice and many years as a law professor  teaching classes on constitutional Law, Federal courts, statutory  interpretation, among others. She was appointed by Chief Justice John  Roberts to sit on the Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Appellate  Procedure, where she served for 6 years.   Her nomination has also received wide support. For example, in a  letter to the Judiciary Committee, a bipartisan group of law professors  encouraged the committee to confirm her nomination, saying that  Professor Barrett ``enjoys wide respect for her careful work, fair- minded disposition, and personal integrity.'' Her colleagues at Notre  Dame described her ``as a model of the fair, impartial, and sympathetic  judge.''   Despite this, all the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee  voted against her nomination in committee, and I suspect most of the  minority will vote against her confirmation later today. This, of  course, is a shame, and it does not speak well of our institution, the  U.S. Senate, and I would like to explain why.   When the Judiciary Committee voted on Professor Barrett's nomination,  I listened to the reasons my colleagues gave for voting against her.  Some said that she didn't have enough experience to be a circuit court  judge. Well, the American Bar Association rated Professor Barrett as  ``well qualified.''   The Democrats have said that the ABA's ratings are very important to  them when considering a nominee, once even calling it the ``gold  standard.'' Their votes certainly don't reflect that. I suspect the  ratings don't actually matter to them since they have voted against  most of the ``well qualified'' nominees this Congress. The minority has  even requested that I not hold hearings on nominees when the committee  hasn't received the ABA ratings for that nominee, as if the ABA--an  outside group--can and should dictate the committee's schedule. But  even when we have ``well qualified'' or ``qualified'' ratings from the  ABA, the minority still votes against these nominees, so the actual  significance of the rating to the minority doesn't make a lot of sense.   Furthermore, lack of appellate experience hasn't mattered before.  When President Clinton nominated Justice Kagan to the DC Circuit Court  of Appeals, she had no appellate experience. But I remember my friend  from Vermont saying that the Senate should vote on her nomination  because she was an ``outstanding woman.'' Her lack of appellate  experience didn't appear to be of concern to my friends in the minority  at the time of Kagan's nomination coming before the committee, so I  don't understand why the standard is different now.   Another reason some of my colleagues gave when voting against her is  that they say she will disregard judicial precedent. Of course, if that  is true, that would be a very serious consideration, but looking at all  of Professor Barrett's writings and listening to the testimony she  gave, not once did she say that circuit or district court judges could  disregard precedent. In fact, during her hearing, she told the  committee that she understood ``circuit judges to be absolutely bound  by the precedent of the Supreme Court'' and that ``circuit courts are  bound to follow the precedent of their own circuit.'' That doesn't  sound like a nominee who will not respect precedent. In fact, she  understands exactly the role of precedent and the limitations and  restrictions placed on lower court judges.   Another Senator argued that she has written provocative things like  ``A judge will often entertain an ideological bias that makes him lean  one way or the other. In fact, we might safely say that every judge has  such an inclination.'' I am not sure why this statement is provocative.  I think everyone here knows that every person has their own biases and  policy preferences, whether or not they are a judge. In writing this,  Professor Barrett shows the awareness to recognize that every person  comes to their job with personal biasses and views. This is especially  important for judges to recognize about themselves. In fact, she is so  self-aware that this is a potential problem for judges that she cowrote  an article arguing that if a judge cannot set aside a personal  preference in a particular matter before that judge, she shouldn't hear  the case in the first place.   These comments come from an article about potential issues Catholic  judges may face that Professor Barrett wrote in law school. The article  was about Catholic judges but could have been written about the biasses  of judges of any religion or of no religion at all. My friends in the  minority have looked at a few of her comments from this article and  seem to have concluded that she will base her judicial decisions off of  what her religion teaches.   During her hearing, one Senator even implied that Professor Barrett  could not separate her religion from her judicial decision making, but  Professor Barrett had said and argued quite the opposite and had done  it several times. She believes that it is highly inappropriate for a  judge to use his own religious beliefs in legal reasoning. In fact, she  concludes the very article the Democrats are concerned with this way:  ``Judges cannot--nor should they try to--align our legal system with  the church's moral teachings whenever the two diverge.''   I think opposition to her nomination ultimately comes down to the  fact that her personal views about abortion do not line up with the  minority's views about abortion. I knew the minority would ask her  about her views on abortion, so during her nomination hearing, I took  advantage of being the first to ask her if she would allow her  religious views to dictate her legal decisions. She said that she would  not. I also asked her if she would follow Supreme Court precedent  involving abortion, and she simply and succinctly answered:  ``Absolutely, I would.''   At her hearing, the statement was made--now, can you believe this?-- ``You are controversial because many of us that have lived our lives as  women really recognize the value of finally being able to control our  reproductive systems.''   This statement alone is stunning to me for two reasons--first, that a  nominee is controversial because she might share the views of over half  the country, which is that abortion is wrong; second, that this  statement amounts to a religious test. In response, Professor Barrett  said over and over that she has no power to overrule Roe or any other  abortion-related Supreme Court case nor does she have interest in  challenging that specific precedent.   A further statement was made:         [R]eligion . . . has its own dogma. The law is totally       different. And I think in your case, professor, when you read       your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma       lives loudly within you, and that's of concern when you come       to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for       years in this country.    So the Democrats are saying that women who have personal beliefs that  are consistent with their religions are not eligible to be Federal  judges even  [[Page S6901]]  when they have assured the committee, as she did over and over again,  that they strongly believe in following binding Supreme Court  precedent. If that is the case--if the minority is enforcing a  religious litmus test on our nominees--this is an unfortunate day for  the Senate and for the country.   Others have spoken on the issue of a religious test, but I will  remind my colleagues that the Constitution specifically provides that  ``no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any  office under the United States.'' It is one of the most important  founding principles. I do not think an evaluation of how religious a  person is or how religious she might not be should ever be a part of  that evaluation.   We have received many letters on this topic, including one from  Princeton University's president, who is a former law clerk to Justice  Stevens and happens to be a constitutional scholar. He writes that the  questions the Democrats posed to Professor Barrett about her faith were  ``not consistent with the principle set forth in the Constitution's `no  religious test' clause'' and that the views expressed in her law review  article on Catholic judges are ``fully consistent with a judge's  obligation to uphold the law and the Constitution.''   Finally, this morning, my friend from Illinois justified the  Democrats' questions to Professor Barrett in committee by noting that I  also asked questions in the committee about her article, but there is a  difference in simply asking a nominee if her religious views will  influence her judicial decision making and trying to ascertain just how  religious a nominee is by asking, ``Do you consider yourself an  orthodox Catholic?'' or by saying, ``The dogma lives within you.''   My questions gave Professor Barrett a chance to explain her law  review article, which was an article I knew the Democrats would  question her over. The other side's questions and comments went to  figure out just how strongly she would hold to her faith, which was the  inappropriate line of questioning.   I will make one more related comment. I mentioned this in the  Judiciary Committee, but I think that it bears repeating on the floor  because the issue will continue to come up.   Professor Barrett and a few other nominees have a relationship with  or ties to the Alliance Defending Freedom group, which, as several  Senators have recently pointed out, has been labeled as a hate group by  the Southern Poverty Law Center. When the nominees have been asked  about this, they have pointed out that the Southern Poverty Law  Center's designation is, in itself, highly controversial. I would say  that it is completely unfounded. The ADF, Alliance Defending Freedom,  is an advocacy organization that litigates religious liberty cases. It  has won six cases in front of the Supreme Court in the past 6 years,  including cases that are related to free speech and children's  playgrounds. They are not outside the mainstream.   Any difference in viewpoint that folks may have with them boils down  to, simply, policy differences, but dissent and a difference of opinion  do not equal hate, and it is wrong to compare an organization like the  ADF to that of the Ku Klux Klan or the Nazi Party and, by extension,  imply that the nominees before us sympathize with such actual hate  groups.   Finally, I would note that the Southern Poverty Law Center designates  the American College of Pediatricians and the Jewish Defense League as  hate groups. So some of the Southern Poverty Law Center's designations  appear to be discriminatory in and of themselves.   Professor Barrett is a very accomplished, impressive nominee, and we  know that her personal story is compelling. She has seven children,  several who were adopted from Haiti and one who has special needs. She  is an accomplished attorney and a well-respected law professor. I will  be strongly supporting her nomination today, and I urge every one of my  colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2039         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

If       the transcript is not signed by the witness within 30 days       after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine it,       the officer or the investigator shall sign it and state on       the record the fact of the waiver, illness, absence of the       witness, or the refusal to sign, together with the reason, if       any, given therefor.        ``(5) Certification and delivery to custodian.--The officer       before whom the testimony is taken shall certify on the       transcript that the witness was duly sworn by the officer and       that the transcript is a true record of the testimony given       by the witness, and the officer or investigator shall       promptly deliver it or send it by registered or certified       mail to the custodian.        ``(6) Furnishing or inspection of transcript by witness.--      Upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the investigator       shall furnish a copy of the transcript to the witness only,       except that the Attorney General, or the Attorney General's       designee in accordance with this Act, may for good cause       limit such witness to inspection of the official transcript       of the witness's testimony.        ``(7) Conduct of oral testimony.--        ``(A) In general.--Any person compelled to appear for oral       testimony under a civil investigative demand issued under       subsection (a) may be accompanied, represented, and advised       by counsel.

Such       person or counsel may object on the record to any question,       in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record       the reason for the objection. An objection may be made,       received, and entered upon the record when it is claimed that       such person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on       the grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or       privilege, including the privilege against self-      incrimination. Such person may not otherwise object to or       refuse to answer any question, and may not directly or       through counsel otherwise interrupt the oral examination. If       such person refuses to answer any question, a petition may be       filed in the district court of the United States under       subsection (k)(1) for an order compelling such person to       answer such question.        ``(B) Compelled testimony.--If such person refuses to       answer any question on the grounds of the privilege against       self-incrimination, the testimony of such person may be       compelled in accordance with the provisions of part V of       title 18, United States Code.        ``(8) Witness fees and allowances.--Any person appearing       for oral testimony under a civil investigative demand issued       under subsection (a) shall be entitled to the same fees and       allowances which are paid to witnesses in the district courts       of the United States.        ``(j) Custodians of Documents, Answers, and Transcripts.--        ``(1) Designation.--The Attorney General, or designee in       accordance with this Act, shall designate an investigator to       serve as custodian of documentary material, answers to       interrogatories, and transcripts of oral testimony received       under this section, and shall designate such additional       investigators as the Attorney General determines from time to       time to be necessary to serve as deputies of the custodian.        ``(2) Responsibility for materials; disclosure.--        ``(A) In general.--An investigator who receives any       documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or       transcripts of oral testimony under this section shall       transmit them to the custodian.

Such       material, answers, and transcripts may be used by any such       authorized investigator or other officer or employee in       connection with the taking of oral testimony under this       section.        ``(C) No examination.--Except as otherwise provided in this       subsection, no documentary material, answers to       interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony, or copies       thereof, while in the possession of the custodian, shall be       available for examination by any individual other than an       investigator or other officer or employee of the Department       of Justice authorized under subparagraph (B). The prohibition       in the preceding sentence on the availability of material,       answers, or transcripts shall not apply if consent is given       by the person who produced such material, answers, or       transcripts, or, in the case of any product of discovery       produced pursuant to an express demand for  [[Page S6928]]       such material, consent is given by the person from whom the       discovery was obtained. Nothing in this subparagraph is       intended to prevent disclosure to the Congress, including any       committee or subcommittee of the Congress, or to any other       agency of the United States for use by such agency in       furtherance of its statutory responsibilities.        ``(D) Examination by certain persons.--While in the       possession of the custodian and under such reasonable terms       and conditions as the Attorney General shall prescribe--        ``(i) documentary material and answers to interrogatories       shall be available for examination by the person who produced       such material or answers, or by a representative of that       person authorized by that person to examine such material and       answers; and        ``(ii) transcripts of oral testimony shall be available for       examination by the person who produced such testimony, or by       a representative of that person authorized by that person to       examine such transcripts.        ``(3) Use of material, answers, or transcripts in other       proceedings.--Whenever any attorney of the Department of       Justice has been designated to appear before any court, grand       jury, or Federal agency in any case or proceeding, the       custodian of any documentary material, answers to       interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony received       under this section may deliver to such attorney such       material, answers, or transcripts for official use in       connection with any such case or proceeding as such attorney       determines to be required. Upon the completion of any such       case or proceeding, such attorney shall return to the       custodian any such material, answers, or transcripts so       delivered which have not passed into the control of such       court, grand jury, or agency through the introduction thereof       into the record of such case or proceeding.        ``(4) Conditions for return of material.--If any       documentary material has been produced by any person in the       course of any investigation pursuant to a civil investigative       demand under this section, and--        ``(A) any case or proceeding before the court or grand jury       arising out of such investigation, or any proceeding before       any Federal agency involving such material, has been       completed, or        ``(B) no case or proceeding in which such material may be       used has been commenced within a reasonable time after       completion of the examination and analysis of all documentary       material and other information assembled in the course of       such investigation,      the custodian shall, upon written request of the person who       produced such material, return to such person any such       material (other than copies furnished to the investigator       under subsection (g)(2) or made for the Department of Justice       under paragraph (2)(B)) which has not passed into the control       of any court, grand jury, or agency through introduction into       the record of such case or proceeding.        ``(5) Appointment of successor custodians.--        ``(A) In general.--In the event of the death, disability,       or separation from service in the Department of Justice of       the custodian of any documentary material, answers to       interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony produced       pursuant to a civil investigative demand under this section,       or in the event of the official relief of such custodian from       responsibility for the custody and control of such material,       answers, or transcripts, the Attorney General or the Attorney       General's designee in accordance with this Act shall       promptly--        ``(i) designate another investigator to serve as custodian       of such material, answers, or transcripts; and        ``(ii) transmit in writing to the person who produced such       material, answers, or testimony notice of the identity and       address of the successor so designated.        ``(B) Successor.--Any person who is designated to be a       successor under this paragraph shall have, with regard to       such material, answers, or transcripts, the same duties and       responsibilities as were imposed by this section upon that       person's predecessor in office, except that the successor       shall not be held responsible for any default or dereliction       which occurred before that designation.        ``(k) Judicial Proceedings.--        ``(1) Petition for enforcement.--Whenever any person fails       to comply with any civil investigative demand issued under       subsection (a), or whenever satisfactory copying or       reproduction of any material requested in such demand cannot       be done and such person refuses to surrender such material,       the Attorney General may file, in the district court of the       United States for any judicial district in which such person       resides, is found, or transacts business, and serve upon such       person a petition for an order of such court for the       enforcement of the civil investigative demand.        ``(2) Petition to modify or set aside demand.--        ``(A) In general.--Any person who has received a civil       investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may file, in       the district court of the United States for the judicial       district within which such person resides, is found, or       transacts business, and serve upon the investigator       identified in such demand a petition for an order of the       court to modify or set aside such demand.

Such       person or counsel may object on the record to any question,       in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record       the reason for the objection. An objection may be made,       received, and entered upon the record when it is claimed that       such person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on       the grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or       privilege, including the privilege against self-      incrimination. Such person may not otherwise object to or       refuse to answer any question, and may not directly or       through counsel otherwise interrupt the oral examination. If       such person refuses to answer any question, a petition may be       filed in the district court of the United States under       subsection (k)(1) for an order compelling such person to       answer such question.        ``(B) Compelled testimony.--If such person refuses to       answer any question on the grounds of the privilege against       self-incrimination, the testimony of such person may be       compelled in accordance with the provisions of part V of       title 18, United States Code.        ``(8) Witness fees and allowances.--Any person appearing       for oral testimony under a civil investigative demand issued       under subsection (a) shall be entitled to the same fees and       allowances which are paid to witnesses in the district courts       of the United States.        ``(j) Custodians of Documents, Answers, and Transcripts.--        ``(1) Designation.--The Attorney General, or designee in       accordance with this Act, shall designate an investigator to       serve as custodian of documentary material, answers to       interrogatories, and transcripts of oral testimony received       under this section, and shall designate such additional       investigators as the Attorney General determines from time to       time to be necessary to serve as deputies of the custodian.        ``(2) Responsibility for materials; disclosure.--        ``(A) In general.--An investigator who receives any       documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or       transcripts of oral testimony under this section shall       transmit them to the custodian.
