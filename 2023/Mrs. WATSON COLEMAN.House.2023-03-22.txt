 Mr. Speaker, on World Water Day, I rise on  behalf of every American who lacks access to the most basic necessity  of human survival.   Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, 15,000 households in Newark, New Jersey,  were forced to rely on bottled water due to the lead in the city's  supply. As lead contamination levels approached record highs, residents  of my State's largest city were forced to reckon with the reality that  access to safe drinking water would not be and could not be taken for  granted.   I am grateful that Newark has since replaced nearly all of its lead  pipes, and their residents can once again trust that their tap water is  safe to drink.   In fact, had this emergency been unique to one city at one time, I  probably wouldn't have been compelled to speak here today.   However, the year after Newark put an end to its emergency,  infrastructure failures in Jackson, Mississippi, cut off residents'  access to safe water. Mississippi's capital city still lacks the  resources to support residents in need.   Let me be clear. This is not a Newark crisis or a Jackson crisis, or  for that matter, even a Flint, Michigan, crisis. It is an American  crisis.   Due to climate change, outdated infrastructure, and systemic  disinvestment in our most vulnerable communities, millions of Americans  risk losing access to water.   As the wealthiest Nation on Earth, we have the resources--not to  mention the moral imperative--to change that situation. Safe, clean  water is a human right. If we continue to ignore the water crisis,  communities across the country will face dire consequences for their  health, safety, and well-being.   Mr. Speaker, I am introducing the WATER Act because the time to act  is now. In addressing water scarcity, we must revitalize our failing  infrastructure, remove dangerous contaminants from our water supplies,  and reinvest in the communities that have been hit hardest by decades  of privatization and austerity. The WATER Act tackles the crisis on all  three fronts.   My legislation would provide $35 billion annually to modernize our  Nation's water and sewer infrastructure. Cities like Newark are not  outliers. Lead pipes are used in every single State. By overhauling our  infrastructure, we can remove these dangerous components and eliminate  the threat of lead contamination.    My legislation would also clean up other contaminants, as well,  including PFAS, ``forever chemicals.'' New Jersey has some of the  highest PFAS levels in the country and Black, Brown, and low-income  communities suffer disproportionately from this contamination.   Everyone, regardless of their race, their income, or their ZIP Code  deserves reliable water access. That is why, in addition to cleaning up  contamination, my legislation will provide grants to low-income  communities to stop water shutoffs due to unaffordable bills.   With these long-overdue investments, we can prevent further water  shortages, protect our current supply, and make emergencies like those  in Flint, Jackson, and Newark a thing of the past.   Water is the essence of human life, and as public servants, we must  ensure that every family in every community has reliable access to it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this Chamber to take up the WATER Act and pass it  without delay.                            ____________________
