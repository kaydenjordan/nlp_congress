 Madam Speaker, millions of Americans are in the  quicksand of student loan debt, and we ought to do something about it.   Student loan debt is the second highest form of consumer debt  impacting one-fifth of U.S. households, to the tune of $1.6 trillion.  At this rate, it would take a college graduate with a bachelor's degree  nearly 20 years to pay off their loans. That is why I have introduced  bills to attack this crisis and put more money in the pockets of young  Americans.   With bills like my No Student Loan Interest Act, all interest on new  and existing Federal loans would be eliminated. Zero percent interest  going forward. And for graduates who devote their careers to public  service, we ensure they receive loan forgiveness in proportion to their  years of public service.   Making college affordable is not a Republican or Democratic issue, it  is an American issue, so that young Americans can start families, start  new jobs, and start to build a business, if that is what they desire to  do. It is one that benefits every living generation from the students  of yesterday to the students of tomorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bipartisan  amendment to Division E of H.R. 4502, offered with Congressmen Guy  Reschenthaler and Vincente Gonzalez, number 183 and part of en bloc  package number five, which would increase funds for the United States  Geological Survey (USGS) by $2,000,000 and decrease funding for the  Secretary of the Interior, Departmental Operations, by the same amount.   Since my first term in Congress I have worked diligently to decrease  our reliance on foreign sources of elements and minerals critical for  certain energy applications. These materials are especially important  for our clean energy future, used in products like electric vehicles  and wind turbines among many others. Legislation I introduced on this  subject, the Securing Energy Critical Elements and American Jobs Act,  was the basis for a robust domestic research and development program on  energy critical materials signed into law as Sections 7001 and 7002 of  the Energy Act of 2020 (Division Z of the Consolidated Appropriations  Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260)).   Sections 7001 and 7002 authorize a total of $208 million for this  program in fiscal year 2022. Of that, $158 million is for Department of  Energy (DOE) work. I want to thank the Energy and Water and Related  Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee for providing the needed funds and  for citing to Sections 7001 and 7002 of the Energy Act of 2020 in its  committee report when describing what DOE is to do in this area.   The remainder, $50 million, essentially is for activities to be  undertaken by or with the Department of Interior or USGS, and those  activities are the subject of my amendment. I appreciate that the  report from the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Subcommittee references and directs funds to some work  on critical minerals. However, it does not refer to specifically to  Section 7002 of the Energy Act of 2020 or mention all aspects of the  program that section of law creates.   My amendment thus serves two purposes. First, its passage is intended  to reinforce congressional intent that the Department of Interior and  USGS should use funds the bill gives to carry out all aspects Section  7002 of the Energy Act of 2020 that are applicable to each and as  directed by that law. This includes developing and publishing a list of  critical minerals, coordinating with the Department of Energy to  establish and operate a Critical Materials Information Portal, and  working with the Department of Labor on a relevant workforce  challenges.   Second, my amendment adds $2,000,000 to the money USGS is already  provided for efforts on critical minerals to improve its ability to do  this vitally important work. This is the most that its budget could be  increased in this area above what is already provided in the underlying  bill within the confines of this appropriations legislation.   I urge all Members to support my amendment.
