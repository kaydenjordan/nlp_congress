 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  body for 1 minute.    Madam President, I make the case that this amendment we  are about to vote on is the simple question of whether we think we  ought to be accountable, that we ought to take responsibility for the  legislative authority we delegate.   Rulemaking is a legislative function. In this bill--the CFIUS reform  bill that is in the NDAA--and on many other occasions, we delegate a  portion of that authority--we delegate the rulemaking--to the executive  branch, which is fine. Yet we have a responsibility to make sure it  gets it right, this administration and future administrations.   This amendment has a mechanism that requires a simple up-or-down  vote--it can't be filibustered; it can't be delayed; it is a simple  majority vote--to affirm that the rulemaking will actually achieve the  legislative attempt. A ``no'' vote is really a vote to shirk our own  responsibility, our constitutional responsibility, since all  legislative authority is vested in the Congress of the United States.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.                                Cloture Motion
