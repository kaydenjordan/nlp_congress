 Madam Speaker, as a new mom expecting a child this  fall, I will never forget my husband and I hearing our child's  heartbeat for the first time, truly the greatest miracle of life. But  sadly, that culture and value of life are under attack.   The Hyde amendment has historically been supported by both  Republicans and Democrats for more than 40 years.   American taxpayers should never be forced to pay for abortions, and  since 1976, this Chamber has agreed and passed the Hyde amendment with  bipartisan support. But now, President Biden and House Democrats caving  to the far left are trying to reverse course and strip the Hyde  amendment from the budget.   It is unacceptable that President Biden is destroying a policy that  has saved over 2.4 million innocent American lives.   Every President since Carter has signed the Hyde amendment into law.  It is a critical lifesaving protection that goes beyond party-line  politics. It is about human life and protecting the most innocent among  us.   The majority of Americans agree that taxpayer dollars should never be  used to fund abortions. Democrats should listen.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
