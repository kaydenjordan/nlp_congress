 Mr. Speaker, you may have heard of Colin  Kaepernick, the football quarterback who started ``the kneel'' to  protest the national anthem at NFL games. He was the originator of the  resistance movement in the NFL against police officers. But you likely  haven't heard that he donated $25,000 to a group that was named after a  convicted cop killer.   Neither national broadcast stations nor major daily newspapers  reported the donation to an organization honoring Assata Shakur, who  escaped prison and fled to Cuba after being found guilty in the 1973  murder of police officer Werner Foerster. Assata is currently on the  FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list.   Why did the liberal national media think this story was not  newsworthy? Do they agree with Kaepernick? Do they approve of  contributions to organizations named after cop killers?   The liberal national media seems to have a grudge against law  enforcement and patriotism, as well as religion and traditional values,  based on their lack of fair coverage of those subjects. This might  explain why the media's credibility is at a record low.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Webster) for yielding me time and for introducing H.R. 2105, the  NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act.   This important and timely bipartisan bill, cosponsored by 17 Members  of Congress and approved by the Science Committee by voice vote,  directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide  small businesses with cybersecurity guidelines, tools, best practices,  standards, and methodologies necessary to better protect themselves  from cyber attacks.   Small businesses help produce a thriving economy that benefits our  entire country. They bring innovative ideas, cutting-edge products and  services, and jobs to the marketplace. In my home State, for example,  there are more than 2.4 million small businesses that employ almost 4.5  million Texans.   Major cyber attacks dominate news coverage, such as the Equifax or  Yahoo hacks that impacted millions and billions of people. But small  businesses, which often do not have sufficient information to  adequately monitor and protect their computer systems, are frequently  the target of cyber attacks, as well.   A 2016 Symantec report notes that cyber attacks against businesses  with fewer than 250 employees have grown from 18 percent in 2011 to 43  percent in 2015. This bill can help those businesses.   October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, so it is  appropriate that we consider a bill designed to help protect small  businesses from cybersecurity attacks. Today's legislation provides  small businesses with NIST expertise to reduce their cybersecurity  risk.   NIST experts developed a cybersecurity framework through  collaboration between the government and the private sector. This  framework is accepted and used by many private organizations to address  and manage their information technology vulnerabilities in a cost- effective way.  [[Page H7939]]    The guidance described in this bill to help small businesses is based  on the NIST cybersecurity framework. H.R. 2105 prioritizes  dissemination of this guidance by NIST within its almost $1 billion  budget.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to show their support for small  business by approving Mr. Webster's fiscally responsible, innovation  protection bill today.    Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2763, the Small  Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer  Improvements Act of 2017.   And I thank the gentleman from California, Mr. Knight, for  introducing this important legislation. He serves on the two Committees  that share jurisdiction over the SBIR and STTR programs: the Small  Business Committee, chaired by my good friend, Mr. Chabot, and the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee, which I chair.   Mr. Knight took the lead on last year's timely reauthorization of the  SBIR and STTR programs, and he is the sponsor of H.R. 2763, which makes  a number of needed policy changes to increase the programs' efficiency  and effectiveness.   The SBIR program was signed into law by President Reagan in 1982,  followed by the STTR program in 1992. These programs help spur economic  innovation and competitiveness, and increase small business  participation in federal research and development activity.   SBIR and STTR award winners convert the results of taxpayer-supported  pioneering research into products that are critical to our economic  competitiveness and national security. Recent examples include parts  for NASA's Mars Rover and a unique cockpit airbag system to protect  Army helicopter pilots.   Today 11 federal agencies provide funding to small businesses through  SBIR, and five agencies provide funding through STTR--a total of nearly  $3 billion this fiscal year. That's more than 66 times greater than the  $45 million spent under the original program in 1983.   Recipients of SBIR and STTR funding have boosted scientific and  technological innovation and created hundreds of thousands of American  jobs.   Several large, international companies like Qualcomm, Sonicare and  Symantec can trace their initial growth to when they were small  businesses that received SBIR and STTR support.   I want to call attention to two provisions of H.R. 2763 that were  added by Members of the Science Committee.   A provision authored by Mr. Hultgren requires participating federal  agencies to give priority to SBIR and STTR projects that will  strengthen American manufacturing innovation and increase manufacturing  jobs in our country.   A provision authored by Mr. Higgins requires federal agencies engaged  in cyber security research to give priority to SBIR and STTR projects  that will spur advances in cyber security to protect the American  people from increasingly aggressive and malicious cyber-attacks.   The legislation before us addresses a number of red flags raised by  the Government Accountability Office (GAO) about lax administration of  the SBIR and STTR programs.   Several participating agencies do not produce accurate, timely  information that Congress requires to evaluate program performance.   The U.S. Small Business Administration has not submitted its  required, comprehensive annual report to Congress since 2013.   The last administration provided virtually no information to Congress  and taxpayers about the SBIR and STTR programs.   It's reassuring that SBA associate administrator Joseph Shepard  promised during a joint hearing of our Committee and the Small Business  Committee that annual reports will be submitted on time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2763 was unanimously approved by both the House  Small Business Committee and the House Science Committee. I urge all of  my colleagues to support it.
