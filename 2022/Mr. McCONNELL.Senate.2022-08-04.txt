 Mr. President, Kentucky officials are working  literally overtime to deliver supplies to those affected by ongoing  flooding. Heat and humidity are rising to dangerous levels in the areas  that still lack power.   My team is helping coordinate relief efforts in any way we can. With  the Senate still in session, my State director joined the Kentucky  National  [[Page S4004]]  Guard yesterday as they distributed food and water to displaced  residents.   Many of the roads in Eastern Kentucky are still impassable, so the  Kentucky National Guard is flying dozens of helicopter missions daily  to drop water, MREs, and vital supplies to Kentuckians in remote areas  of our State. My State director was on board as they flew over flooded  roadways and homes to visit the community centers operating as supply  hubs in areas isolated by rising water. The landings are difficult,  sometimes nearly impossible, but the heroes of the Kentucky National  Guard will do whatever it takes to reach those stranded by the floods.   And that is just one part of the flurry of activity. Emergency  responders have deployed boats and trucks across the affected region.  In Buckhorn, residents are even loading up horses to take supplies to  areas where the roads are literally washed out. It is truly, truly  heroic work.   This emergency is far from over, but when their neighbors are in  need, Kentuckians will always help other Kentuckians. I will visit the  region myself soon to survey the damage and help with relief efforts.  While here in Washington, I remain in close contact with those who are  out on the ground.   I am grateful to everyone for taking on the colossal task of  providing for Kentucky amid this disaster.         Remembering Jackie Walorski, Emma Thomson, and Zachery Potts    Mr. President, now on another sad note, yesterday, Congress was  shaken by the news that a tragic automobile accident had killed  Congresswoman Jackie Walorski and three others, including Emma Thomson  and Zachery Potts, members of her staff.   Our former colleague here in the Capitol was back home among her  fellow Hoosiers in Indiana's Second District, in circumstances that are  familiar to each of us: long days on the road with trusted aides,  meeting with the people we represent.   By all accounts, Congresswoman Walorski had two stellar young people  by her side.   At 27, Zach was already a 7-year veteran of her team, having served  as both campaign manager and district director.   Emma, her 28-year-old communications director, was already a Capitol  Hill veteran, whose ``intelligence'' and ``drive,'' one former boss  described as ``second-to-none.''   The last day's outpourings of grief and admiration demonstrate just  how great a hole Jackie Walorski is leaving behind among her friends  here in the Capitol. They marveled at both her tremendous personal  kindness and her fierce advocacy for the families she represented.   I had the personal pleasure of breaking bread with Congresswoman  Walorski several years ago and looked forward to every time that our  paths would actually cross.   According to those who knew Jackie best, her infectious passion and  boundless energy for service were rooted in the faith that guided her  entire life. That faith also led her and her beloved husband Dean to  found a charity and to spend years living and serving needy people in  Romania.   Today, we trust that this faith has reunited our colleague with her  eternal Father, and we pray that He will comfort Dean, all her family  and friends, and those who mourn Zach and Emma, in these terrible days.                                 S.J. Res. 55    Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on a resolution to  peel back a significant layer of regulatory redtape that has been  causing headaches all across our country.   Thanks to the leadership of the junior Senator from Alaska, this  resolution would overturn a Biden administration action that aims to  give the Federal Government even more authority to slow and stall  critical infrastructure projects.   For years, our Republican government made headway in rolling back  some of the countless roadblocks liberal bureaucrats have put in the  path of new highways, bridges, and pipelines. We took big bites out of  the bloated permitting process, and, just last year, Republicans  ensured that bipartisan infrastructure legislation included clear  limits designed to speed up Federal permitting reviews.   But earlier this year, the President fired off a far-left Executive  action that directly contradicted some of that bipartisan headway.  Catering to radical environmentalists, the new Biden rule reinstates  sweeping jurisdiction for Federal bureaucrats to slow down all sorts of  critical infrastructure. This Democratic action is taking a process  that is already known for years-long waiting periods and multihundred- page Federal reports and actually making it worse.   Every single Senate Republican is proud to cosponsor Senator  Sullivan's resolution. The future of our infrastructure needs at least  one Democrat to see the light as well.                                  Inflation    Mr. President, now on one final matter, a year and a half ago, every  Senate Democrat cast the deciding vote for a $1.9 trillion disaster  that caused the worst inflation in 40 years.   Democrats have crushed working families with runaway prices. More  than 80 percent of the country says our economy is in bad shape.  President Biden's approval on the economy is down to 30 percent and  falling. By the traditional rule of thumb, our country is now in a  recession, and a supermajority of Americans are aware of it.   American families are crying out for relief, but Democrats have  decided to spend hundreds of billions of dollars of the people's money  on a bill that laughs at the people's priorities.   Americans say their No. 1 concern is inflation and the cost of  living. So here is what the Democrats' taxing-and-spending spree would  accomplish on that issue: It would make inflation worse over the next  few years and then do nothing to cut inflation in the long term.   Even the Democrats' favorite estimates say that their bill would take  9 years--9 years--to subtract the amount of inflation we have been  adding every single week.    I will say that again. Even the Democrats' favorite estimates say  their bill would take 9 years--9--to subtract the amount of inflation  we have been adding every single week.   After inflation, in particular, another huge group of Americans say  that their biggest issue is the overall state of the economy in  general, and here is what Democrats want to accomplish on that subject.  They want to ram through giant new tax hikes in the middle of the  recession--new multihundred-billion-dollar tax hikes on American jobs  that specifically target the manufacturing sector, leaving Americans  with fewer jobs and lower wages; new tax hikes on American natural gas  and crude oil, higher fees for producing energy on Federal land-- leaving Americans with higher electric bills, higher utility bills,  higher gas prices, and more dependence on foreign countries that don't  like us.   In a time of inflation, Democrats also want to spend $80 billion to  roughly double the size of the IRS so they can shake more money out of  the American people through harassment and audits--using taxpayer money  to make taxpayers' lives worse.   So what do Democrats want to do with all the money they want to drain  out of Americans' pockets in the midst of this recession? They want to  lavish hundreds of billions of dollars on an issue that exactly 3  percent of the country says is our biggest problem: far-left  environmental and climate spending.   American families have been hemorrhaging financially for a year and a  half. Working people can barely tread water. And the Democrats' focus  is Green New Deal nonsense that only 3 percent of the country wants  prioritized, big subsidies to help rich people to buy luxury cars and  new stoves, taxpayer funding for environmental protesters--a huge  catalog of nonsense that would not put a dent in global emissions,  while countries like China continue to emit more and more.   So I dare any of our Democratic colleagues to walk up to a working- class American on the street and ask them what the government ought to  spend hundreds of billions of dollars on.   Well, first off, in a time of inflation, they would probably tell  them not to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in the first place.  But I doubt a single American worker or middle-class parent would say:  You know what? My top priorities are doubling the size of the IRS and  giving my boss a government kickback if he buys an $80,000 electric  car.   Do you know a single normal American family that is clamoring for  this  [[Page S4005]]  nonsense? Americans want lower prices. They want border security. They  want more police and public safety. Americans don't want tens of  thousands more IRS agents. They want more Border Patrol and ICE agents.  Americans don't want Democrats to regulate us into an even deeper  recession. They want liberals to let police officers bring law and  order back to our streets.   Democrats want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on a 3- percent issue while they completely neglect crime and border security  and make inflation and the recession even worse.   Democrats are catastrophically out of touch with what American  families actually do care about. Their approval ratings show it, and  their reckless taxing-and-spending spree proves it as well.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
