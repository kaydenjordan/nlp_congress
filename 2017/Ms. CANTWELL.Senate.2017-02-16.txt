 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the last 47 years, the EPA has  enforced science-based environmental policies that have resulted in  cleaner air and water, the cleanup of some of our Nation's most  contaminated lands and waters, and has improved our understanding of  our changing climate. All of this has led to a healthier America.   Bipartisan Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency-- everybody from the great Washingtonian Bill Ruckelshaus to most  recently Gina McCarthy--took on the role and responsibility as EPA  Administrator, knowing that it was their responsibility to protect  existing environmental law and to let science be the guide on research  and new policies. They took the EPA mission to heart, and they fought  to protect human health and the environment.   I have questions about whether the nominee, Mr. Pruitt, follows those  same values, and I come to the floor to oppose his nomination to be the  Administrator of the EPA.   Mr. Pruitt has repeatedly attacked needed EPA regulations, and he  supports polluters at the expense of the environment and health laws.  He doesn't believe the scientifically proven causes of climate change  are real.  [[Page S1241]]    Less than a year ago, then-Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt,  working in their State, wrote: ``Scientists continue to disagree about  the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the  actions of mankind.'' That was written in the Tulsa World.   When questioned by my colleagues during the hearing process, he said:  ``The climate is changing, and human activity contributes to that in  some manner'' but the degree of that contribution is ``subject to more  debate.''   The reason I raised these issues is that this issue of climate and  climate impact is so real in the State of Washington. It is already  happening, and it is already affecting our industries.   As EPA Administrator, Mr. Pruitt would have the responsibility for  setting the Agency's agenda, including how to respond to climate  change, yet the fact that he doesn't support the existing climate  change science puts him in a role where I think he would not protect  the economic interests of our State.   We cannot have a lackadaisical attitude about these issues. It is not  a hypothesis. It is here. It is happening.   In the Pacific Northwest, it is altering our region's water cycle,  putting Washington's farming jobs and our $51 billion agriculture  economy at risk. Wildfire seasons are longer and more severe than ever  before. It is costing our Nation billions of dollars.   Warmer water temperatures in our streams and rivers have degraded  salmon spawning habitat, led to massive die-offs, and certainly our  shellfish industry has been very challenged.   With 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions being absorbed by our  oceans, it is raising the acidity level, and that is impacting the  chemistry of Puget Sound. Oceans and their absorption of carbon dioxide  emissions and these acidic conditions are making it hard for our  shellfish industry to do the type of seeding that needs to take place.  It is severely impacting the Pacific Northwest's $278 million shellfish  industry. Ocean acidification has been found to dissolve the shells of  important prey species, and the ocean acidification effects then carry  up the food chain, if they are not addressed.   If we have an EPA Administrator who isn't going to work to cut down  on carbon emissions and thinks that it is only part of the impact,  aren't there a lot of Northwest jobs at stake? For example, our  maritime economy alone is worth $30 billion, so I would say there is a  lot at stake.   In looking at the record of Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt,  he fought EPA regulations that protect public health, including the  cross-state air pollution rule, the regional haze rule, the clean air  standards for oil and gas production sites, and the clean water rule.   Despite this issue of repeatedly suing the EPA, he recently told  Congress: ``I do not expect any previous lawsuits to adversely affect  my performance as EPA Administrator.''   Well, I have serious concerns about how Mr. Pruitt's past lawsuits  will influence his aggressive attitude as EPA Administrator in not  fighting for the things that are going to protect the jobs and economy  in Washington State that count so much on a pristine environment.   A letter was sent by 773 former EPA employees who served under  Democratic and Republican administrations, stating: ``Mr. Pruitt's  record and public statements strongly suggest that he does not share  the vision or agree with the underlying principles of our environmental  statutes.''   His record does not give me the confidence that he is the right  person to lead this Agency at this point in time.   But there are other issues. During his time as Oklahoma attorney  general, Scott Pruitt planned the Summit on Federalism and the Future  of Fossil Fuels. This summit brought together energy industry  executives with attorneys general to strategize against EPA, and they  specifically discussed EPA's overreach, as they put it, regarding a  very important issue called the Pebble Mine.   The Pebble Mine is an attempt by some who want to actually establish  a gold mine in the very place of one of the most successful salmon  habitats in the entire world: Bristol Bay, AK.   The EPA followed the letter of the law in their multiyear, science- based assessment of Bristol Bay. They basically made sure that  everybody understood what was at risk: that Pebble Mine would destroy  up to 94 miles of salmon spawning streams; it would devastate anywhere  from 1,300 to 5,350 acres of wetlands; and it would create 10 billion  tons of toxic mine waste, which is nearly enough to bury Seattle. And  all of this would occur in the headwaters of the greatest salmon  fishery on Earth, where half of the sockeye salmon on the planet spawn.   So the notion that this is how this nominee would spend his time--as  I said, the mine itself is a direct threat to the $1.5 billion salmon  industry in Bristol Bay. That is 14,000 jobs just in the Pacific  Northwest. The importance of making sure that the mine is not located  there is of the utmost importance, I say, to the salmon fisheries of  the entire Pacific Northwest.   I want to make sure we are putting someone in place who is going to  fight for the laws that are on the books and to show leadership, not  spend time trying to undermine the Agency, the organization, and its  existing authority.   If Scott Pruitt allowed Bristol Bay to go forward, it would be  devastating to our State. It would be voting in favor of these  polluters instead of making sure that we are protecting science and  environmental law.   I have very serious concerns, and that is why I am opposing this  nominee. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will  realize that these economies--the ones that depend on clean air and  clean water, safe salmon spawning grounds--are dependent on our doing  the right thing to protect what is really our stewardship of this  planet that we are on only for a very short period of time. I hope my  colleagues will consider all of this and oppose this nominee.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to join  my colleagues to speak on the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be  Administrator of the EPA. Like my colleagues who have been out here  tonight, the great Senator from Illinois, Senator Duckworth, and my  colleague from Hawaii who preceded her, we are here to talk about the  importance of our environment and what a critical asset it is to each  of our regions of the United States.   Certainly, you can say for the State of Washington that the  environment is our economy--the beautiful aspects of our clean water,  the resources of our beautiful mountains and wonderful streams, Puget  Sound itself, our mountains that so many of my colleagues ask me about.  These are all assets that make Washington State a great place to live,  work, and recreate in.   Our companies would tell you that one of the great things they have  in recruiting people to the State of Washington is that it is a  competitive advantage to say their business is located in Washington.  People understand what that means to the quality of life and to the  opportunities for those workers. It is with that in mind that I rise in  strong opposition to this nomination.   I had a chance yesterday to discuss Mr. Pruitt and to discuss some of  the concerns that I have with his role as Administrator, and in  Oklahoma in the attorney general slot, and also his nomination process.  Many of my colleagues this morning have brought up his record, what  that record represents, and their concerns about his answers to very  important questions.   This is about stewardship. Stewardship is about how we are going to  manage our resources and apply the laws of clean air and clean water to  protect not just this generation of Americans, but future generations  of Americans.   Mr. Pruitt's poor environmental record--in my opinion, he is choosing  to side with those companies that have been polluters of clean water  and failed to protect in an aggressive way the important public health  issues that were before people in his State.   Obviously, there is a big discussion tonight. My colleagues have been  out here discussing whether there is transparency in Oklahoma regarding  his ability to discuss with them his failures or his successes, if you  will, in a public process. That is why people have been demanding these  emails. These important documents are things that, not only the people  of Oklahoma, but people in the U.S. Senate have a right to have answers  to as we consider his nomination.   I join my colleague from Hawaii in saying, What is the rush? What is  the rush to push forward somebody as an administrator for something  that is about the stewardship of our air and water--something that is  going to be important, not just to our generation but future  generations? We want an EPA Administrator who is going to protect that.  That is what we want to know: Are you going to be an aggressive steward  for future generations?   I had an opportunity a couple of years ago to hear one of the great  authors who has written all these books about economics. He was talking  about the great implosion of the economy in 2008, 2009. His point was  that was going to cost future generations--not just this generation,  but maybe three generations of Americans were going to be affected by  that big great recession of our economy. It is the same issue tonight.   Our future environment is going to be impacted, not just for today,  but for future generations by what the next EPA Administrator does. It  is critical that we recognize the important need for clean air and  clean water now and take steps to be aggressive about it.   This is something that is important to our State because it is  affecting us economically. It is affecting us with water and ocean  acidification, challenging our seafood industry and our food chain, and  challenging us with wildfires. We want to make sure that we have an EPA  Administrator who is going to do their job.   In my opinion, Mr. Pruitt has ignored big polluters and discharge in  drinking water in Oklahoma. In my opinion, he has not been strong  enough with regards to the big oil and big mining companies who have  attempted to undermine what is EPA law. As attorney general, he tried  to undermine the laws that are already on the Federal books. It leaves  my colleagues and I questioning, How could he ever stand up for those  laws if he has spent so much time trying to undermine them?   He has helped organize strategies and discussions about how to  aggressively stop the EPA from doing its job. Some of these discussions  used the example of the Pebble Mine. The Pebble Mine is a mine that  companies are proposing in Alaska at the headwaters of the largest  sockeye salmon run in the world, one of the most important sockeye  salmon runs in the world. So as EPA Administrator, when he is supposed  to be protecting clean water, is he going to side with those mining  companies? He spent a whole strategy session with them trying to figure  out how to overrun EPA. Is he going to be the kind of person who is  going to help us stand up for clean water so we can have salmon on the  west coast? Or is he going to join with those who think that you can  degrade the environment and still preserve these incredible resources?   I know that people think Mr. Pruitt and his statements about climate  change are important. I agree because part of that stewardship on clean  air is basically implementing and carrying forward strategies to make  sure that polluters reduce pollution in our air and that we come up  with a plan to diversify energy sources to reduce that pollution. I  should say his job is not that, but it is clearly to call out what the  Supreme Court has said is implementation of the Clean Air Act.   My colleagues, I think, are failing to recognize that Mr. Pruitt's  hesitancy on this issue is really going to cause problems or challenges  for us here in the Senate. It is going to cause challenges for us to  move ahead when we are seeing so much impact.    I know my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and I have asked the  GAO for an analysis of what climate change is costing us. What is the  impact of climate change costing us? Why did we ask for that letter  over a year ago? Because we are seeing devastating impacts in the  shellfish industry, in the timber industry, in various aspects of our  economy as it relates to that.  [[Page S1329]]    In the Tulsa World Mr. Pruitt said: ``Scientists continue to disagree  about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the  actions of mankind.''   That is what he said in the newspaper in Oklahoma.   I know several of my colleagues and I have further discussed exactly  this issue, but the United States has made great strides to reduce  carbon dioxide, and we need to have someone who is going to be  aggressive about doing more work on this. The consequences of increased  carbon dioxide have been everything from extreme weather patterns to  impacts on water quality, which causes impacts to our salmon, to  drought conditions, which a lot of legislation--various committees have  been discussing exactly what to do about the drought situation in  Washington, Oregon and California. I am sure it is going to continue  into many other States. It is impacting even the chemistry of Puget  Sound--something I will get into in a minute with ocean acidification.   To have somebody who doesn't get how aggressive we have to be on  addressing these issues is very problematic. It is an economic issue.   I would like to say, as I mentioned earlier, it is about good  stewardship because it is about future generations and whether someone  did their job in leaving this place to the next generation, but it is  also about economic issues.   Mr. Pruitt failed to be accountable as attorney general in releasing  emails, and that is so much of the discussion today about his  nomination. During his confirmation hearing, he repeatedly failed to  answer questions. And he told Senators: Submit an open records request  to the attorney general's office--his own office. It is as if Mr.  Pruitt is taunting our colleagues, not answering the questions about  his policy, hoping that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  and this side of the aisle will support him, even though he will not  give us answers on his policies. And then he says: Well, if you want to  know, you can submit an open records request. We have; people have. We  want the answers, and a court today has said: Let's give people those  answers.   We don't have those answers today, yet my colleagues want to rush to  have his nomination pushed through when something as important as the  environment is at stake.   On average, Oklahoma State government agencies complied with their  open records request within 68 days. That was the average, yet Mr.  Pruitt, as attorney general, has taken over 2 years. A few weeks ago  when a lawsuit was filed against Mr. Pruitt on this very issue, the  suit requested that he respond to 9 open records requests, asking for  as many as 3,000 emails.   As I just said, yesterday, a judge said that he has to turn over  those records, those documents, and he has to do so by Tuesday. It is  not a long time to wait. It is not a long time to discuss the concerns  that our colleagues have with this position. In fact, I would be happy  to come back on Wednesday and make sure we have consideration then,  giving people time until Tuesday. But people are pushing us to vote for  this nomination tomorrow or, I should say today.   What do my colleagues not want to see in the Pruitt emails? What is  it that they don't want to know? Attorney General Pruitt has been part  of close to 30 anti-environmental legal actions. Is that what they  don't want to see?   I know one of my colleagues has said he is going to make polluters  pay. He is going to assure that these issues are implemented.   Scott Pruitt has sued the EPA 14 times. He fought the cross-state air  pollution rule. He fought the regional haze rule. He fought the clean  air standards for oil and gas production sites. He fought the clean  water rule. He fought the mercury rule twice, and he fought the Clean  Power Plan four times.   So are my colleagues interested in giving this job to someone who has  fought the EPA and tried to stop them from making sure that polluters  pay? This is what the responsibility of the Environmental Protection  Agency is, to make sure that we have good stewardship.   In one case, Attorney General Pruitt failed to pursue a Phillips 66  refinery in an Oklahoma City, which the EPA found was one of the worst  polluting refineries in the entire country. Phillips 66, in this case,  impacted groundwater. That was the pollution in this case. Yet Scott  Pruitt failed to enforce the environmental laws there.   As attorney general, Scott Pruitt has been absent in other cases.  There was a groundwater case and pollution by Halliburton. Where was  the attorney general in that case?   In another case, in Bethany, the city's water wells were impacted by  a toxic plume of chemicals that impacted access to safe drinking water.   This case is still going on. But the attorney general failed to step  in and protect those citizens.   So this is what we want to understand, given what Attorney General  Pruitt said in his testimony: Ask for requests. Get the emails. See the  positions.   That is what we have done. As we can see from his record, he knew  very well it took a long time, that he had every tool to make this a  very hard process for people to get the answers. Yet we are now within  days of having those answers. My colleagues want to go ahead and vote.   During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Pruitt was asked to identify  lawsuits he filed against private companies in Oklahoma for violation  of pollution laws. Despite these examples I just mentioned, Mr. Pruitt  could think of only one specific instance in which he filed a  settlement after his predecessor completed an investigation into how a  dozen or so poultry producers illegally disposed of animal waste. So  let's take a closer look at that case.   The poultry companies in the northeast corner of Oklahoma were not  properly disposing of 300,000 tons of animal waste per year. Attorney  General Pruitt's predecessor had sued the companies for damages caused  by pollution and forced the companies to change disposal practices. But  Mr. Pruitt in this case, rather than advocating for the judge to make a  ruling, negotiated an agreement with the company to do a study on the  appropriate levels of phosphorus in the Illinois River.   So while some might say ``Well, isn't that a good step?'' he let the  agreement expire that was already in place to reduce that waste and did  not seek a formal extension. He shut down the environmental unit that  helped start the lawsuit against those companies. This unit was in  charge of making sure that agricultural waste cleanup and millions of  dollars to clean up those toxic sites were in place. Yet he let that  expire.   So I have grave concerns about whether he is going to be aggressive  about these issues all across the United States. Is he going to work to  make sure these laws that are on the books already continue to be  enforced? Is he going to fight to make sure that clean air and clean  water--the rights of the citizens here in our country--are preserved  and preserved for future generations?   I noticed that in Oklahoma there was question 777, a ballot measure.  On that ballot measure was Oklahoma's right-to-farm statute that was  proposed by the Oklahoma Legislature. If the voters in Oklahoma  approved it, it would have created an amendment to the Oklahoma  Constitution prohibiting the legislature from enacting laws restricting  agricultural production unless laws were needed to advance a  ``compelling State interest.''   I think this is a very interesting demonstration of how people are  trying to use a process, just like the House colleagues are sending  over regulatory reform bills. They are going to hide behind regulatory  reform when in reality they are trying to curtail clean water and clean  air rules.   Well, the people of Oklahoma were a little smarter than that. Right- to-farm laws are not uncommon, and there are currently variations in  all 50 States. But many such statutes, including Oklahoma's current  law, protect farmers and ranchers from nuisance claims as long as they  operate in acceptable practices.   This question that was put on the ballot to Oklahomans went further  than the typical right-to-farm law; it would have amended their State  constitution. The State constitution holds a higher authority than  these State statutes. So if that initiative was enacted, it would have  guaranteed that  [[Page S1330]]  agriculture can engage in farming practices without interference from  the legislature, and it would even have prohibited the public from  suits. Can you imagine that? I know that that is what some of the  proponents of these issues want; they want to do whatever they want on  the land whether it impacts the neighbors or impacts clean air or clean  water. They just want to keep moving it forward.   So Mr. Pruitt was in support of question 777. He talked about the  ``intrusive rules from government regulators'' that often ``fail to  achieve the stated health, safety and environmental goals.'' Well, we  know we want to have a balance. We can have jobs, we can have  agriculture, and we can have environmental stewardship. I think we, in  Washington, work very hard to achieve that.   Drought issues like we are experiencing in the Yakima Basin got  everybody to the table--farmers, Native Americans, fishermen,  everybody. Instead of trying to pass initiatives like this--which, by  the way, failed in Oklahoma--people said: We need to work together in  these challenging times of a changing climate and work on preserving  what is most important to all of us. They have done a good job in doing  that.   So what we are looking for is an Administrator who is going to help  in that process, who is going to continue to make sure we live up to  these laws that are on the books and help in the challenging times of  drought and environmental impact.    Of Attorney General Pruitt's 14 cases against EPA, 13 of those suits  were joined by the fossil fuel industry. The attorney general has been  known to send letters to Federal agencies that basically were identical  to the fossil fuel industry letters; that is, as attorney general, he  wasn't making his case, he was just making the case for the fossil fuel  industry.   The CEO of Continental Resources, a top oil producer in the United  States--their organizations basically were trying to push Mr. Pruitt  during his time as attorney general, instead of standing up for clean  air and clean water. And we want to know what he is going to do in this  new job--work with Members here in the Senate on continuing to  implement the law.   One of the best examples of what I would expect him to do is to  continue the good work of the Federal Government in protecting salmon.  Of particular importance, as I mentioned earlier, is the issue of  Pebble Mine. During his time as attorney general, Scott Pruitt, as I  said, planned the Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil Fuels.  That is a pretty interesting task to take if you are the attorney  general of a State, the Summit on Federalism and the Future of Fossil  Fuels. That summit brought together energy executives with attorneys  general to strategize against what they thought was so-called EPA  overreach and how to defeat it.   One of the key examples they brought up was the Environmental  Protection Agency's efforts to protect Bristol Bay, AK, from a proposed  mine that is called Pebble Mine. Pebble Mine is a proposed large hard  rock mine, as I mentioned earlier, in the headwaters of Bristol Bay.  Each year nearly 40 million sockeye salmon return to Bristol Bay. In  total, Bristol Bay supports 29 species of fish, including all 5 North  American salmon species. That is why Bristol Bay is called one of the  greatest fisheries on Earth. Bristol Bay supports a $1.5 billion  sockeye salmon fishery, which provides 14,000 jobs throughout the  Pacific Northwest.   Even my colleague, the late Ted Stevens, was opposed to the Pebble  Mine. I think he knew the great resource and the importance of Bristol  Bay.   This fishery, and the people in that fishery, and the tribes of  Bristol Bay, petitioned the EPA to evaluate the impact of the proposed  Pebble Mine and what it could do to salmon.   In 2014, after years of research, EPA finalized a science-based  assessment of the Pebble Mine called the Bristol Bay Watershed  Assessment. This assessment found that Pebble Mine posed a direct  threat to Bristol Bay salmon.   I am not sure this is a picture of Bristol Bay salmon, but this is  definitely an iconic symbol of what we are talking about here tonight,  that thousands of jobs in our State rely on salmon, and the subsistence  culture of many Native Americans also rely on Bristol Bay salmon. That  is why so many people weighed in at meetings with EPA and agencies in  various parts of the Northwest to talk about this issue, because so  many jobs would be impacted. That mine would destroy up to 94 miles of  salmon spawning streams, devastate up to 5,350 acres of wetlands, and  create 10 billion tons of toxic mine waste.   So you can imagine my concern when the attorney general out of  Oklahoma decided he was going to take a very lenient attitude on animal  waste and hold the summit trying to basically figure out ways to  disrupt EPA's questioning and assertions about Bristol Bay. How far he  is going to go as EPA Administrator to basically have a negative impact  on our salmon economy?   He could have said: It was just a session, and I support EPA's  actions. But that is not the message we are receiving. The toxic mine  waste that would exist at Bristol Bay would contaminate massive amounts  of areas behind the second largest dam in the world, and that mine  waste would be there in perpetuity in Bristol Bay.   So the science was very clear. The Pebble Mine was in the wrong  place, and it was the wrong idea. Large mining companies have come to  that same conclusion. Just a few weeks ago, an analyst issued a report  that said Pebble Mine is ``not commercially viable.'' That is because  of the tremendous costs that are associated with it and the risks  associated with it.   After the EPA assessment found that salmon were at risk from the  Pebble Mine, I definitely want to make sure that Bristol Bay salmon are  protected forever. The EPA had the authority to basically use a section  of the Clean Water Act to make sure those Bristol Bay salmon were  protected. That is what I expect. That is what I expect after public  hearings, an open process, using the authority. Why would it be a good  idea to let a mine be located at the headwaters of one of the most  important salmon runs in the world? Why would we do that? Yet Mr.  Pruitt took time to join an effort to say: How can we overturn EPA's  efforts here?   I need an EPA Administrator who is going to stand up for our  environment in the Pacific Northwest and protect us on clean air and  clean water. It is critical that those individuals who were proposing  this mine continue to be thwarted.    While the EPA has been close to making sure there are permanent  protections for Bristol Bay, I am very concerned that this EPA  Administrator could start this process all over again. That is  something we can't afford. We cannot have an EPA Administrator who is  on the wrong side of the Pebble mine issue. They need to protect  Northwest salmon.   I would also like to talk about another threat to our environment, to  our fishing economy that is certainly happening today and why we need  an EPA Administrator not to be spending their time joining forces with  polluters, figuring out ways to avoid law, but figuring out ways to  implement the Clean Air Act that the Supreme Court says we must follow  through on.   Last year, Attorney General Pruitt stated that there is a  disagreement about whether human activity has had an impact on climate.  When he was pressed on this issue during his hearing, he continued to  question scientific facts. He said he believed climate change is  irrelevant to his role as EPA Administrator. Well, I disagree. Climate  change is not a future hypothetical issue. We are seeing it today, and  we are seeing it in our State.   Our fishermen want to continue the great legacy that we have in our  fishing traditions, and we are going to get to why this picture is  affected by what I am going to talk about next, but we want to continue  to have thriving Northwest fisheries. We want to continue to have a  healthy environment and food chain that is going to allow us to have a  robust fishery in the Northwest.   I think our fisheries can be cited as some of the best managed  fisheries in the entire world. That is how good we are at it. That is  how scientific we are at it. That is how collaborative we are at it.  That is how much hard work has been put into stewardship and managing  the resources and making sure the jobs still exists. I would match that  with any other part of the United States or this planet. The Northwest  [[Page S1331]]  fisheries are managed well, but they are being challenged. They are  being challenged by the fact that our climate is changing and that the  oceans absorb 25 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions, which  resulted basically in a changing of the chemistry in our waterways.  That is right; the oceans absorb 25 percent of carbon emissions. So  basically they become this sink for the emissions.   We have scientists who are out on the Olympic Peninsula studying this  very issue, not for us in the Northwest; they are studying it for the  entire United States. It is part of our National Laboratory system.  They are looking at this very important issue and the challenges we  face from it.   The fact that the oceans have been the sinks for that carbon has made  the rate of ocean acidification 10 times faster than anything we have  seen on Earth in the last 50 million years. In Puget Sound, that means  that ocean acidification has resulted in massive die-offs of young  oysters. Juvenile shellfish cannot survive in these corrosive waters,  and their shells actually dissolve.   So this economy for us is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the  shellfish industry. A few years ago, we were successful in getting some  very minor--I think it was in the definitely thousands of dollars--to  help that industry figure out what was happening because the shells  weren't forming. We were able to see that ocean acidification was  having such a corrosive impact, we helped the industry figure out when  a better time for seeding was and to get to a point where those extreme  conditions weren't having their most devastating impact.   This die-off in 2005 caused a major plummeting of the shellfish  industry. An industry that employs over 3,000 people in the State of  Washington. I have met shellfish growers who are fourth-generation  shellfish growers in our State. So this way of life around Puget Sound  is important to us. You can go to probably a dozen restaurants here. I  am sure you could have gone across the street to Johnny's Half Shell  and ordered a product from Washington State. It would be one of the  premier products on the menu.   We have to fight to keep this industry. We have to make smart  decisions about our environment. We have to make good stewardship  decisions or those four generations of shellfish growers are not going  to be here anymore.   The pollution that is coming from carbon into our water is a big  deal. How big a deal is it? Well, it is a big enough deal to put on the  front page of the Seattle Times above the fold--and probably not just  once, probably several times. Why? Because we live and have a huge  population around the shores of something called Puget Sound.   Almost everyone, everyone there understands the importance of clean  water and a healthy environment to protect this maritime economy and to  make the right decisions moving forward.    We don't want to see what happened in 2005 and in 2006. We don't want  to see that. We want to see more of our shellfish actually able to  survive the seeding process, and we want to continue to be smart about  this. This is where the science question comes in.   If we have an EPA Administrator who doesn't believe this impact is  happening, if he is going to thwart the efforts to do the research and  the science, if he is going to spend more time trying to thwart these  laws than implement strategies to mitigate the impact of climate  change, we are not going to be successful economically. We need  technology like ocean acidification sensors.   Why were we successful at turning that situation around with the  shellfish industry and making sure? It is because we were able to  locate buoys in the water to give us data and information about these  warming temperatures, what problems it was causing, and come up with a  strategy to lessen the impact of acidification. They measured our  waters and how to modify growing practices. That is basically what they  did. If you are denying that climate change is even happening or that  it is having this impact and you are not planning for it, you are not  going to go out and help our growers strategize for the future.   They use that real-time information to increase the production from  the 20 percent of historical levels that it was to 70 percent, but  without that data in collaboration with places like NOAA, our shellfish  industry would have continued to just decline.   I need an EPA Administrator who is going to support monitoring; that  is going to understand this impact and do something about it.   Now why did I have the other picture of the salmon fisherman? Because  ocean acidification, as I mentioned, basically dissolves the shells of  important prey species we call pteropods, and they are the base of the  food chain. So not only am I just talking about the thousands of jobs  and millions of dollars associated with the shellfish industry, if you  have so much carbon sinking into our waters that you are destroying  this part of the food chain, it impacts the rest of the food chain. It  impacts all the way up the species, including salmon, herring,  mackerel, and other species. So this is why we have to have an EPA  Administrator who is going to follow science and be aggressive at  protecting these issues.   Last month, a new study published by scientists at the University of  Washington and NOAA found that even Dungeness crabs are at risk because  of these pteropods. I think that is what it says right there:  ``Scientists fear ocean acidification will drive the collapse of  Alaska's iconic crab fishery.'' Thank you, thank you, Seattle Times.   That is what this is about, are we going to leave it up to the  newspapers of America to describe the scientific impact of what is  happening so we can force people whose job it is to be the stewards  here to do their jobs?   They should be the leaders, the people we put in this position. They  should be the ones who lead our Nation in protecting our most valuable  natural resources and making sure these pristine areas that we need for  our economy, for our quality of life, for our recreation are there, and  we need an EPA Administrator who is going to be aggressive about that.   So that is a little preview of this issue and what it looks like in  the State of Washington, but on this climate issue, as I mentioned, my  colleague from Maine and I actually joined forces probably 6 or 7 years  ago on this issue when the Senator from Maine was aggressive about  pushing legislation, asking Federal agencies to make sure they had a  response to climate change. I think the Senator from Maine probably saw  then how important this issue was, and it was legislation we actually  passed out of the Commerce Committee. I don't think it was actually  implemented into law, but it was a very good directive at saying to  agencies: This is going to impact us, and what is your mitigation plan.   We, in the Commerce Committee, held a hearing about this because what  we were finding was that a huge part of the U.S. economy--it was  definitely a high number, maybe as much as 50 percent--was driven by  States with coastal economies. A report was issued about how all of  these changes impacted sea level rising, impact in ocean acidification,  all of these things were going to impact these coastal economies and  thereby have a dramatic effect on the U.S. economy.   For example, just because it might not be front and center for  somebody from Oklahoma, it was going to become very front and center  for the U.S. economy if we didn't have a mitigation plan and did  something about it, and this report was a heralding call for the United  States to wake up to this issue.   I will never forget that hearing because the actress Sigourney Weaver  was there to testify. She was there to testify because she really  wanted to make the point about how important these issues were, as it  related to our waters and the impact.   You would think a brilliant actress like Sigourney Weaver would steal  the show. You would think her testimony before the Commerce Committee  would be it. That would be the news of the day, and that is what would  be written about, but it was actually a fisherman from a Southern  coastal State who stole the show because he spoke about how his job was  threatened, how fisheries were threatened, how, if we don't protect our  oceans and our air, we are going to have devastating effects on our  fisheries. This gentleman, whose family and livelihood was dependent  [[Page S1332]]  upon it, spoke in such an unbelievably meaningful way, he upstaged her.   So this isn't something we are coming at just because President Trump  has nominated Scott Pruitt; this is something we are going to fight for  every single day because it is important that our Nation have a  response to it.   My colleague from Maine was on it a long time ago. She said: Let's  make sure that every agency is going to have a plan for what we are  going to do about mitigation and impact as a result of climate.   As I mentioned just recently, in the last year or so, she and I  joined and sent a letter to GAO asking them to actually give us an  estimate across the whole Federal Government. What is going to be the  cost and impact of these changes to climate on our economy and the  Federal Government? This is a very important answer to have from the  GAO because my guess is that they are going to show that it costs a lot  of money. It is not surprising to me because I have seen it in my own  State, with catastrophic wildfires that have burned up hundreds of  thousands of acres of land at an unbelievable cost to the Federal  Government.   We are trying to come up with a better strategy for combatting these  wildfires. We can't get our House colleagues to engage in a serious  Energy bill process. Hopefully someday we will get them to understand  that the Senate in a bipartisan fashion did its homework and had  approval.   But these issues are not going away. Next summer there will be  another part of the United States that will be in the hot spot again,  and instead of making sure we are addressing that, some of our  colleagues just want to ignore it, just like they are ignoring Mr.  Pruitt's emails and his answers to these important questions.   That is the Northwest. Let's look at other parts of the country on  ocean acidification. Here is an example of a coral reef in the State of  Florida. In 2016, the University of Miami published a study which found  that Biscayne Bay coral reefs are already suffering the impacts of  ocean acidification. I would expect that coral reefs in Florida are  probably as important to their economy as salmon is to our economy. I  say that because I know people go to visit those coral reefs. Actually,  their reefs, according to economic analysis, are worth over $7.6  billion. That is what coral reefs are worth, apparently, due to their  importance in recreational and commercial fisheries and tourism.   Everybody wants to stand up for the fossil fuel industry because they  have jobs, but they forget the jobs that are related because of our  environment and how important it is to our economy.   In this particular picture, we are seeing the devastating impact and  changes of this coral reef in just a very short period of time.   This upper picture taken in 1976 shows a very vibrant coral reef. I  think this is an area where there has been a lot of discussion. I am  not exactly sure where Carysfort Reef is, but I think there has been a  lot of discussion here in the Senate about making sure people have  access to it or what ways the public can enjoy this particular site.  But when I look at this picture and I look at the devastating impact we  see on this coral reef, I question what our strategy is to preserve  what is an important recreational and commercial asset to Florida. What  is our strategy?   When I think about an EPA Administrator, are they going to act now in  balancing this issue and making sure that things like the Clean Power  Plan, which is saying to polluters: You must reduce pollution--are they  going to do that for the fishermen and recreationists and those who  believe in the beauty of these coral reefs in Florida? Just like the  Washingtonians in my State who go out and recreate on Puget Sound and  want to fish salmon and want to make sure our fishing economy stays  strong--are they going to have an Administrator who is going to do  this?   I can tell you that next summer I guarantee you there are going to be  unbelievable discussions about fishing in the Northwest. Why? Because  there is going to be an impact on salmon, and everybody is going to  want to fish--commercial fishermen, sports fishermen--everybody is  going to want to fish, and unless we have an EPA Administrator and a  NOAA Administrator and people who are implementing great conservation  strategies, we are not going to be successful because this pollution is  impacting our natural areas.   I can see here that it is impacting Florida's economy the same way.   During an interview, Scott Pruitt's predecessor, former Attorney  General Drew Edmondson, who served as Oklahoma attorney general from  1995 to 2001, stated:         ``Under his tenure as attorney general, I don't think       environmental crimes have disappeared. It is just the filing       of cases alleging environmental crimes that has largely       disappeared.''    So I think that somebody knows something about this.   I have constituents who are also writing and communicating to me  about these issues, about whether they think Mr. Pruitt is the right  person to be EPA Administrator. It is not surprising that we have a  quote here from one of my constituents from Poulsbo, WA. I just talked  about the Puget Sound economy. I just talked about this economy. Puget  Sound is town after town of communities with fishermen who go out and  take advantage of that economy within our waters and also go as far  away as Alaska to fish. So I am not surprised that somebody from Kitsap  County has written to the Kitsap Sun and said: ``I voted for Trump, but  I certainly did not vote for a government takedown of my State's most  important asset, our water and our economy.''   It doesn't surprise me that that is what somebody in Kitsap County  said--not somebody in Poulsbo. You should just go look it up, people  who are listening. People listening, anybody listening tonight from  other parts of the United States, go look up Poulsbo, WA. It is a  beautiful community that is all about what Puget Sound can deliver for  us, and they will be the first part of our State to tell you what ocean  acidification is doing in Hood Canal to impact our fishermen. They will  be the first people. They know because this has been part of their  livelihood.   So I want to close tonight--this morning, I should say--by saying  that I hope our colleagues will at least consider the fact that we are  raising concerns, because we have great concerns about the economy of  the future, and that economy of the future depends on clean air and  clean water and an Administrator who is going to fight to implement the  law.   We need an Administrator who is going to be there not on the side of  the polluters but on the side of the people in dealing with some of the  thorniest environmental problems because of the change in climate this  country has seen. We want someone who is going to use that science and  information to help provide the stewardship for future generations. I  don't think that is Mr. Pruitt.   I ask my colleagues to help turn down his nomination and to move  forward--at least give us the chance to look at his emails so we know  exactly what we are dealing with and to make sure that our country is  going to continue to be committed to these men and women who work in  this resource economy that depends so much on clean water and air.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
