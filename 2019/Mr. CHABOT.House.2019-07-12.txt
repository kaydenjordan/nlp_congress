 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of a  Cincinnati legend and civil rights icon, Marian Spencer.   Ms. Spencer passed away Tuesday at the age of 99. She dedicated her  life to shaping the community that she loved, Cincinnati, for the  better.   Among her many accomplishments, in 1961, she successfully led the  effort to integrate Coney Island, Cincinnati's premier amusement park  at the time. She was also a pioneer in Cincinnati politics, becoming  the first woman to lead the local NAACP and the first African American  woman elected to the Cincinnati City Council.   Over the years, I had the good fortune to get to know Marian Spencer  and learn from her experiences. We both served on the city council back  in the 1980s, and she was never shy about sharing her opinions with me.  I grew to respect her toughness, her honesty, and her conviction.   Madam Speaker, Cincinnati lost an exceptional leader on Tuesday, but  Marian Spencer's legacy will endure for generations to come.                            ____________________
