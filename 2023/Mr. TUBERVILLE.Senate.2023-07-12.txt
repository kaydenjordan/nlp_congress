 Madam President, I join my colleagues on the floor to  talk about Joe Biden's economy.   Over the past few weeks, the President has traveled across our great  country. He has been giving speeches on what he calls Bidenomics. He is  bragging about how good our economy is.   I have got news for the President: The American people aren't buying  what you are selling.   Two-thirds of the American people disapprove of him on the economy-- two-thirds. Three out of four Americans say our country is on the wrong  track. Most economists think we are going to have a recession within  the next year. We all hope that doesn't happen.   Nevertheless, I agree with the American people. Bidenomics has been a  disaster, a complete disaster, for the people of this country.   When Joe Biden took office, this economy was ready to take off. We  were opening back up after the pandemic, but obviously Joe Biden took  credit for that too.   The Congressional Budget Office said the economy didn't need any  stimulus--no more money. We were expected to fully recover within just  a few months. Guess what. Our President didn't listen. He signed the  biggest stimulus bill in history. Joe Biden spent $2 trillion that we  didn't need. It wasn't paid for. We didn't have the money, but we  approved it anyway, in this room. That $2 trillion is going straight to  the national debt--$32 trillion. Embarrassing.   Even the Democrats' own experts warned them not to do this. President  Obama's economic adviser, Jason Furman, said:         I don't know any economist who is advocating for a spending       bill that size.    Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, said it would cause  inflation. Well, sure enough, a month after the Democrats passed their  spending bill, inflation started going up, and now prices are 14  percent higher than they were when President Biden took office--14  percent. Gas prices are still up by more than a dollar a gallon since  this President took office. The price of diesel is raising costs for  farmers in my State of Alabama and across America, and they are  struggling. In total, inflation has cost the typical American family  more than $8,000 annually since Joe Biden took office.   Last summer, Joe Biden and the Democrats started spending trillions  in taxpayer money again. Didn't learn a lesson. It was an election  year, and they must have thought it was going to help them in the  election.   As of today, Joe Biden has authorized more than 4 trillion--that is  not billion; that is trillion--dollars in spending. That is more money  than we spent in World War II. Again, this is after the Congressional  Budget Office said we didn't need any stimulus, and again, it was money  that we didn't have. We didn't have it. It is no wonder we have had the  highest inflation in 40 years, and it is no wonder Joe Biden is the  least popular President since Jimmy Carter.   Record inflation has caused the fastest increase in interest rates in  40 years, and it is self-inflicted. The American people didn't do that;  this city did that. The interest rate on a mortgage has doubled since  Joe Biden took office--doubled. More and more young people are giving  up on the goal of owning their own home because they can't afford it.   Last summer, Joe Biden also raised taxes on nearly every person in  this country. He wants 85,000 more IRS agents to shake people down  because they need the money. They need the money to help pay this debt  down, but they are going to take it away from the American people. That  should never happen.   So now we are paying the price for inflation, and we are paying more  because of higher taxes.   Last fall, there was a Gallup poll that showed that a record number  of people have given up on the American dream--given up. That is what  everybody wants to come to this country for, is the American dream.    Folks, it ain't here anymore. It is gone.   According to the poll, the majority of Americans do not think their  kids will have a better standard of living than they had when they were  growing up.   Joe Biden shouldn't be bragging right now. Joe Biden ought to be on  an apology tour across this country because it is embarrassing what we  have done to the debt and what we have done to inflation and prices all  over the country. He ought to apologize to the American people for  robbing them of thousands of dollars that they worked for, that they  shouldn't have to send to this place to spend when they don't need it  to be spent. He ought to apologize to the people who are giving up on  the American dream.   Two-thirds of the American people disapprove of the handling of Joe  Biden's economy. And I agree with the American people. Bidenomics has  been a total disaster, and it will go down in history. It will go down  in history. It will be remembered, and it will be studied--how not to  run an economy. Totally wrong.   I yield the floor.
