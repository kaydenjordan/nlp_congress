 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  North Carolina for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Texas, the gentlewoman  from Missouri, and everybody working on this.   We have had one of the most intense periods of disasters in American  history in recent years: Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Michael, and  Florence pounding Texas, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin  Islands. We have seen impacts in South Carolina and Georgia, as well.   But there is not another State that has been as disaster-impacted as  south Louisiana, there is not another State: Hurricanes Katrina, Rita,  Gustav, Ike, Isaac. We have had record-high water in the Mississippi  River 2011, 2016, 2018, and, this year, 2019. There is not a more  impacted State, which means there is not a more experienced State in  terms of dealing with disasters.   Number one, Mr. Speaker, the committee in this Congress that has  jurisdiction over disasters is the Transportation Committee, and the  Transportation Committee had no consideration of this bill whatsoever-- none.   We made some major reforms just last year in the Disaster Recovery  Reform Act that made major changes in how we handle disasters.   You see people out there advocating this legislation who do not  represent disaster victims, and I don't mean that in a mean way. I am  just telling you that the folks who have actually dealt with disasters  understand this is flawed, and let me explain why.  [[Page H8921]]    In the immediate aftermath of disasters, what happens is the only  funds that are available are FEMA funds. You have FEMA funds that are  available for disaster response and direct assistance to individuals.   So you may be able to get some immediate money, you may be able to  get some immediate housing assistance, hotels, or other things, just an  immediate small downpayment, then you get a loan from the SBA, a second  agency we are bringing into it.   Maybe then you pursue your FEMA claim through flood insurance with a  different division of FEMA. And, at some point in the future, you may  get these funds, maybe--maybe--appropriated by Congress, and this is  for the long-term recovery.   Now, let me give you the timeline under this bill.   They have 60 days to actually allocate the funds, whatever that  means. The funds that Congress appropriated is based upon an  allocation.   You have 90 days to file a plan. You have another 60 days, I believe  it is, for consideration of the plan after it is submitted, for plan  approval, and then another 60 days for the grants.   And then you still have the certification of the State's program. You  still have the actual hiring of a contractor. You have accepting  applications, approving applications, and actually giving the grants.   Mr. Speaker, you are talking about a year after a disaster, at least,  under this bill.   Further, in my home State of Louisiana, where we have received $1.7  billion from a 1,000-year storm in 2017, we ended up having to give a  contractor $350 million to hand out $1.2 billion. That is, roughly, a  22 percent administrative cost, money that should be going to disaster  victims. This doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make sense.    One of the reasons I am so frustrated is because we had a bipartisan  agreement with leadership that this bill was going to move in tandem  with another bill, voted out of the Transportation Committee  unanimously in March.    It passed out of the Transportation  Committee--I will say it again, the committee with disaster experience,  with disaster jurisdiction--passed out of that committee unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, what we all need to be focused on  is the disaster victims. That is what we need to be doing. We need to  be focused on the disaster victims and focused on getting assistance to  them, not revictimizing the disaster victims through our own government  inefficiency--and I am concerned that that is exactly what this bill  does.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, let me give you a statistic to prove my point.   We had a hearing a few months ago where we had the Economic  Development Administration, through the Department of Commerce, come  testify. They told us in the meeting that, within 1 year, the disaster  funds that were given to them for disaster recovery activities, within  1 year, 79 percent of the money was out the door.   Comparatively--to look at how HUD has handled this program, and this  bill does nothing to fix it--comparatively, HUD has only given out 79  percent of the program after 6 years for 50 percent of the grants that  were issued. They still have money sitting around for Hurricane Sandy.   This is not helping disaster victims. I urge opposition.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, let me just say, at the end of  the day, what we need to be doing is we need to be looking at this  through the eyes of the disaster victims. We need to be looking at this  through their eyes.   Having a bill that codifies under law, locks in that you are talking  about 270 days, not from the aftermath of a disaster, but 270 days from  when the funds are actually appropriated by the Congress, which could  be a year later. It could be 2 years later. That doesn't make sense.   There is no connectivity between a FEMA hotel program or mobile home  program and getting money in the bank to actually help disaster  victims. The bill says that the funds have to be spent in 6 years.   Mr. Speaker, how about if we subject Members of Congress to being  homeless for 6 years? How about if we make them be homeless for 270  days? How about we make them homeless for 27 hours or 270 minutes. I  don't care. This doesn't make sense. It is an inefficient use of  taxpayer dollars. The program has proven to be inefficient.   The agency has proven that they cannot administer this, and it just  doesn't make sense. We need to continue to look at this through the  eyes of the disaster victims. Look at the Government Accountability  Office report that found all sorts of flaws in here, and let's actually  fix the real problems. I urge opposition to this legislation.
