 Madam Speaker, disability should not keep any American  from fully participating in public life.   This week marks the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with  Disabilities Act. The ADA provides critical protections for jobseekers  powering our workforce. It helps students thrive in our schools, and it  empowers citizens to participate in our democracy.   But like any law, the ADA is only as good as our ability to enforce  it. For too many, the ADA does not deliver accommodations that people  with disabilities need.   I am working to strengthen the ADA, including for individuals with  mental health needs. My Student Mental Health Rights Act will help  universities adhere to ADA requirements, empowering disabled students  to succeed.   As we celebrate the ADA, we recommit ourselves to fulfilling its  promise of equal protection for all.                            ____________________
