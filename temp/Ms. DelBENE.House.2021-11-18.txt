 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Build Back  Better Act. This transformational legislation will help grow our  economy, get families back to work, and set our next generation up for  long-term success.   The bill includes a 1-year extension of the child tax credit, a  historic middle-class tax cut for families. It has already lifted 3.5  million children out of poverty. The bill also will help build or  preserve over 800,000 affordable housing units over the next decade  through an expansion of the low-income housing tax credit, ensuring  millions more Americans will have a safe place to call home.   There is so much more in this legislation that will deliver direct  support to our families, like making childcare and healthcare more  affordable and accessible and making historic investments in fighting  the climate crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to build back better and  support this legislation.
