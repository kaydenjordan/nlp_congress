 Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has cast a dark  cloud over the world. Many have lost family members, friends, and other  loved ones to the virus. And after many dark months, hope is here.   With the help of public health experts and science, we have vaccines  to protect us and save lives. Democrats fought hard for a robust $20  billion national vaccination program in the American Rescue Plan. With  these funds, we can ensure that everyone has access to a vaccine.   In my district, everyone 16 and older is eligible to get vaccinated.  And as of this week, Riverside County reported that at least 1.3  million doses have been administered and over 400,000 residents are  fully vaccinated, but to reach herd immunity, everyone must get  vaccinated. We are all in this together and we can beat this virus  together.                            ____________________
