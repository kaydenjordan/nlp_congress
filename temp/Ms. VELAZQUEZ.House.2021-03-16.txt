 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1799) to amend the Small Business Act and the CARES Act  to extend the covered period for the paycheck protection program, and  for other purposes, as amended.

Res. 71 (115th       Congress).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  1799, the PPP Extension Act of 2021.   Let me begin by saying that, throughout my tenure on the committee,  we have been able to set aside our differences and work together on  behalf of small businesses. I am committed to doing that again this  Congress. Our small firms deserve nothing less.   I want to welcome our new ranking member, Mr. Luetkemeyer, back to  the committee. I look forward to working with him this Congress to  provide our Nation's entrepreneurs with meaningful assistance. I would  also like to thank the ranking member for working with me in a  bipartisan manner to further extend the Paycheck Protection Program for  small businesses that are still struggling.   Over the past year, the PPP helped millions of small business owners  retain employees and meet business expenses as economic activity slowed  down during the pandemic.   Seeing that value and impact, Congress, on a bipartisan basis,  extended the program multiple times, including a brief extension last  summer and, most recently, through March 31 under the Economic Aid Act.   We heard last week that some participating lenders have begun to wind  down their PPP operations in advance of this deadline, limiting the  relief options available to entrepreneurs at a time when many still  need help.   I understand why this is. Lenders want to be able to focus their  efforts on processing existing applications and work through thousands  of holds, which remain outstanding on these applications.   But I must stress that far too many small businesses, especially the  smallest of the small, remain in desperate need for relief. This is  simply not the time to let this valuable program expire, especially as  thousands of timely loan applications are still sitting in SBA's queue.   That is why I am pleased the bill before us today takes into account  the arguments we have heard from all sides, both the lending community  and the small business owners in communities like mine, who are still  searching for help.   Specifically, today's bill extends the application deadline to May  31, giving employers an additional 2 months to apply for PPP loans. It  gives the SBA an additional 30 days to review, process, and approve  loan applications submitted by the May 31 deadline.   This approach is supported by a coalition of over 90 groups,  representing virtually all sides of the small business economy,  including local chambers of commerce, retail and other businessowner  associations, and the lending community.   I would like to reiterate my thanks to Mr. Luetkemeyer and his team  for their cooperation on securing this important achievement for  America's small businesses. I also want to thank two first-term  Congresswomen on our committee, Ms. Bourdeaux and Mrs. Kim of  California, for leading the way at the committee level on these  discussions and for introducing this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Bourdeaux).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, with over 95 million COVID-19 vaccine  doses administered as of last week, the country is finally starting to  see the light at the end of the tunnel.   Entrepreneurs are feeling more hopeful that if they can just get  through the rest of 2021, that 2022 can be a year of growth for them.   But, put simply, the small business economy is not there yet, and  many of the smaller firms continue to report a need for economic  relief.   Today's 2-month extension of the PPP application deadline, from March  31 to May 31, will help small firms access much-needed relief to meet  their expenses and put them in a position to fully reopen as soon as it  is safe to do so. The additional 30-day period will give the SBA the  flexibility it needs to process and approve the loans submitted by the  new May 31 deadline.   Once again, I thank Ms. Bourdeaux of Georgia and Mrs. Kim of  California for their leadership on this important issue.   I also thank the ranking member, Mr. Luetkemeyer, for his unwavering  commitment to our Nation's 30 million small businesses and his  bipartisan cooperation on this bill. I look forward to working with him  on legislation that will provide a retroactive fix for Schedule C  borrowers and also allow farmers and ranchers to use gross income to  maximize PPP assistance.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I  yield back the balance of my time.
