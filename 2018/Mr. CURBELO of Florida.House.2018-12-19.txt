 Mr. Speaker, politics is the art of what is  possible, what is achievable--not the measure of our differences.   We come to this Chamber--we should--to seek common ground, to solve  problems, to address challenges. That is what I have done over the  course of the last 4 years: work with my colleagues from both sides of  the aisle to improve quality of life in our country, in our  communities, and to show the American public that this institution is  capable of responding to its concerns and its aspirations.   In Congress, progress is measured in small units, the way our  Founding Fathers intended.   On climate and the environment, we broke the ice, bringing  Republicans and Democrats together in the Climate Solutions Caucus, the  first meaningful bipartisan dialogue and collaboration effort on this  subject in a generation. We also filed landmark legislation that would  make massive investments in American infrastructure while reducing  carbon emissions and creating clean energy jobs.   Climate change and transportation infrastructure--twin challenges  threatening the future of my home, Miami-Dade County. The Market Choice  Act would make it more likely that our children and grandchildren can  live out their years in our paradise, an area marked and blessed with  countless natural treasures.   On immigration, we forced the House to process and debate  comprehensive reform for the first time in nearly a decade. While for  many, using this subject and the many victims of a broken immigration  system for political gain is the preference, ours was a solution that  would secure the border, reform our asylum laws to prevent abuse, keep  families together, and secure a future for 2 million American  Dreamers--the young immigrants who went to school with our own children  and today are contributing to our economy and to our communities.   While the forces of obstruction and cowardice prevailed, this  institution grew from the debate, and dividends will be reaped in the  future, I have no doubt. This issue is also a special one for Miami- Dade and south Florida. It is personal for us. We are a community of  immigrants. We believe immigration should be legal and orderly, and we  know immigrants made America great and will continue making it greater  still.   Guns--another issue that deeply divides our country. We proposed  solutions modeled after what was achieved in Florida in the wake of the  tragic massacre at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It  is possible to protect gun rights for law-abiding citizens while  keeping deadly weapons out of the hands of those who seek to harm  others or themselves. We are reforming our criminal justice system in  order to truly give people a second chance.   We secured funding for Everglades restoration, for water quality  improvements in the Florida Keys, for important infrastructure projects  in south Florida. We honored our troops by guaranteeing them the  resources they need and granting them the raises they have earned. We  also invested in American children, making it easier for immigrant  students to learn English and protecting the accountability framework  that put all students at the center of the public education system. And  we delivered historic tax relief for Florida workers and families while  making American businesses more competitive.   In our hemisphere, I have advocated for the oppressed people of Cuba,  Venezuela, and Nicaragua, and encouraged the administration to forge  strong relationships with leaders committed to human rights, the rule  of law, and economic growth and prosperity in countries like Brazil,  Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Panama, and others.   In the Middle East, I have worked to support and bolster the critical  U.S.-Israel alliance while holding the terrorist mullah regime in Iran  accountable for its countless transgressions. And further east, I have  advocated for closer relations with important allies like Japan and  Taiwan in the face of China's growing hostility.   Most importantly, every day I have put my south Florida community and  the country above any partisan or personal interest. My goal has always  been to serve with sincerity and decency, to call it honest no matter  who might get upset. And even if political consequences would follow,  to focus on ideas instead of petty politics, to speak in truth instead  of talking points, to be both direct and decorous.   While I have learned much from this institution, it never changed me.  I have served to the fullest every day, and I now begin a new chapter  in my life overflowing with gratitude for this wonderful opportunity to  serve, for the many colleagues I have come to know, for my team, for my  family, my God, and for the community that trusted this child of  political refugees with the privilege of representing it here in the  Congress of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Illinois, who indeed is a wonderful friend. Sometimes his jokes aren't  as good, but his advice has been very good here since I started running  for the House for the first time in 2013.   The people of southern Illinois are blessed to be represented by Mr.  Davis. He is a wonderful family man. He is a great friend, and even  though I am moving on, I am very happy to know that people like Rodney  Davis will remain a part of this institution working for his community  and for our wonderful country.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Costello), another wonderful friend. We have shared many great  experiences together. We have worked hard on the issues that are  important to our communities, to our districts.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague,  Mr. Costello, for his kind words, and I also want to commend him for  his great service to our country. The people of Philadelphia's suburbs  have been blessed to have been represented over the last 4 years by a  thoughtful, honest, decent man, someone whom I worked with very closely  on issues like the environment, like immigration, the difficult issues,  the controversial issues, the issues where legislators are required to  take risks if they are going to have a positive impact.   My final message is just extreme gratitude to this wonderful  institution, to my community for this privilege, this opportunity. To  my parents, Teresita and Carlos Curbelo, when they arrived in this  country with nothing except the desire to be free and to work and  contribute, I don't think they could have ever imagined that their son  would be able to serve in this fine institution. Only in this wonderful  country can we tell stories like that. Only in this wonderful country  do these miracles happen.   I also want to thank my wife and my two daughters--Cecilia, my wife,  and Sylvie and Carolina, my daughters--because public service is  difficult, especially on young families, and my wife and my daughters  have sacrificed a lot. Of course, we have done it with the support of  our family, my in-laws, my parents, my friends, and everyone.   Again, to all my colleagues, I wish you the best. I will be rooting  for you. Please continue trying to help strengthen this country,  continue trying to do the right thing every day and serve with a  servant's heart.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
