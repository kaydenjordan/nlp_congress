 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member McMorris  Rodgers for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope  for Mental Health and Well-Being Act.   This bill takes serious action to address mental health and substance  use disorder, especially as we are coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.  I am pleased that the House was able to come together to create a  bipartisan solution to deliver real results to the American people,  both adults and children.   I also thank Ms. Schrier for partnering with me as we introduced the  Supporting Children's Mental Health Care Access Act, which is included  in this bipartisan package. This bill reauthorizes two grant programs  that support pediatric mental and behavioral health services and  interventions. Reauthorizing the pediatric mental health care access  grant program is an important step in ensuring that our students have  equal access to quality mental health care.   I would also like to thank Representatives Axne, Bucshon, and Pappas  for joining me to introduce the Timely Treatment for Opioid Use  Disorder Act which is also included in H.R. 7666. This bill increases  access to treatment for individuals suffering from opioid use disorder.  Opioid addiction does not have a timeline and does not discriminate.  Patients should be able to begin treatment for opioid addiction as soon  as possible.   I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 7666, the bipartisan, results driven, and commonsense Restoring  Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act.
