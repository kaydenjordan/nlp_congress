 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I want to speak about our immigration  debate and my amendment in particular, but first let me say we are  going to find out just how serious our colleagues are about granting  not just legal status to the Dreamers--people who came to this country  or were brought here illegally when they were children and couldn't and  shouldn't be held accountable for that action. The proposal that will  be available for a vote later this week will not just grant legal  status but will actually grant a path to citizenship.   It goes well beyond the illegal Executive order President Obama  issued, and it will be available to far more people than those who took  up President Obama's illegal Executive order. It is really going to be  an extraordinary moment. I hope we are able to reach an agreement on  this because I think this needs to get done.   Mr. President, I want to first address an amendment I have offered  that is now up and pending--and I think we will be voting on it at some  point this week--which is all about keeping our communities safer by  addressing the terrible problem of sanctuary cities. This is a problem  that one father in particular knows all too well.   On July 1 of 2015, Jim Steinle was walking arm in arm with his  daughter Kate on a pier in San Francisco. Suddenly, a gunman sprang out  and opened fire, hitting Kate. She pleaded, ``Help me, Dad,'' as she  bled to death in her father's arms.   Now, any murder is appalling, but one of the things that makes this  even more appalling is that the shooter should never have been on the  pier that day. The fact is, he was an illegal immigrant who had been  convicted of seven felonies and had been deported five times, but even  more galling is, 3 months before the day he murdered Kate Steinle, this  murderer was in the custody of the San Francisco Police Department.  They had him. He was in custody. They had him on an old warrant for a  previous crime.   When the Department of Homeland Security found out that the San  Francisco Police Department had this guy in custody, they immediately  reached out and said: Hold this guy until we can get someone there to  take him into custody. We know he is dangerous, we know he is here  illegally, and we want to get him out of this country, but the San  Francisco Police couldn't provide that minimal cooperation. Instead,  they released this man back onto the streets from which, 3 months  later, he murdered young Kate Steinle.   Why would the police of San Francisco do a thing like that? Why in  the world would they refuse to provide this minimal cooperation with  immigration authorities with respect to a dangerous individual? The  reason is because San Francisco is a sanctuary city. That means it has  as its explicit legal policy a prohibition that forbids their police  from cooperating with Federal immigration officials, even if the police  want to. It extends to other law enforcement, like sheriffs and deputy  sheriffs.   This is the case even when local law enforcement authorities believe  the person is dangerous, and the local law enforcement folks wish to  cooperate with the Federal authorities because they know this person is  a threat to the security of their community, but local politicians  override the police and decide this will be a sanctuary city.   Such is the case with San Francisco, and so the San Francisco Police  had no choice. They were required by local laws to release this man  onto the streets.   One of the many ironies about sanctuary cities is if Federal  officials had called the San Francisco Police about any number of other  crimes--robbery, car theft, violating a trademark, counterfeiting--any  number of other Federal crimes, then the San Francisco Police would  have been allowed to cooperate. They would have been happy  [[Page S953]]  to cooperate. They would have been able to cooperate, but because the  crime was committed by an illegal immigrant, the police's hands were  tied. The police were forced to release Kate Steinle's killer.   It is just unbelievable to me that we have communities across the  country that wish to provide this special privilege--this special  protection--for even dangerous criminals because they are here  illegally. It is unbelievable, but that is the case.   Sadly, the Steinles are not alone. They are not the only family who  has been affected this way because, of course, San Francisco is not our  Nation's only sanctuary city. Philadelphia--the fifth largest city in  America, the largest city in my home State--has an extreme sanctuary  city policy, and it has had appalling consequences already.   Maybe the most heartbreaking of these is the case of Ramon Aguirre- Ochoa. Ochoa was a Honduran national in the United States illegally. He  was deported in 2009, but he illegally reentered the United States,  which is itself a felony. He found his way to Philadelphia, and in 2015  the Philadelphia Police arrested him on charges of aggravated assault  and various other crimes. When the background check went through, the  Department of Homeland Security saw that the Philadelphia Police had  this guy. They knew who this guy was. They knew he was here illegally,  they knew he had been deported, and they believed him to be the  dangerous criminal that he was. So they asked the Philadelphia Police:  Could you hold this guy for 24, 48 hours, until we can get an agent  there to take him into custody and begin deportation proceedings? We  know he is a bad guy. We want him out of the country.    Unfortunately, Philadelphia Police had to refuse. Instead, they  released him onto the city streets in January 2015. The Philadelphia  D.A. didn't feel like he had enough evidence to prosecute the case. He  dropped the charges, and rather than cooperate with the Department of  Homeland Security, they released Ochoa back onto the streets of  Philadelphia.   That was January of 2015. In July of 2016, Ochoa was arrested for  raping a child under the age of 13. This brutal attack on the child was  only possible because Philadelphia is a sanctuary city. It is these  appalling cases--like the Steinle case or this case in Philadelphia-- that make it so important that we end these sanctuary cities if it is  at all possible to do so.   My amendment is a bipartisan amendment. It is identical to a bill I  introduced and the Senate voted to consider in 2016. I reintroduced it  in 2017. It does two things: It tackles a legal liability for  localities that wish to cooperate with the Department of Homeland  Security, and, with that legal liability problem solved, it imposes  penalties on communities that choose nevertheless to be sanctuary  cities.   We don't have the authority as a Federal Government to dictate the  policy that a local community must follow. There is a constitutional  separation that gives them the power to do what they will, but we don't  have to subsidize their behavior when it endangers all of us, and that  is what my legislation goes after. So let me discuss first the legal  liability issue.   There are now at least two court decisions that have put pressure on  municipalities, localities, to be sanctuary cities. Over a dozen  Pennsylvania counties have done so. One is a Third Circuit decision;  the second is a Federal district court in Oregon. They have held that  if the Department of Homeland Security makes a mistake and they make a  detainer request--let's say it is a case of wrongful identity. They ask  a local police force to hold someone who, in fact, is an American  citizen, should be here and is here legally, and so it is therefore an  erroneous detention. If that happens and the local law enforcement  folks comply with that request, under these court decisions, the local  municipality can be held liable for the ensuing litigation on the part  of the person who is wrongly detained.   My bill addresses this problem by simply saying that when a local law  enforcement officer complies with an immigration detainer request from  DHS that is a duly issued and bona fide request, then the local officer  has the same authority as a DHS official. In a way, the officer would  be considered an agent of the Department of Homeland Security for this  purpose, and the entity the person would then sue in the event that a  person is wrongly detained and their civil rights are violated would be  the Federal Government. The responsibility should be on the Federal  Government, since it was, after all, a request that initiated with the  Federal Government.   My legislation does not in any way curb an individual's ability to  file a suit if their civil or constitutional rights are violated,  whether it is intentional or accidental. There is no curb on an  individual's ability to redress that if they were wrongfully detained.  It simply transfers the liability from the municipality to the  origination of the detainer request, which is the Department of  Homeland Security.   So that is the first part: solve the legal liability problem which  has some municipalities across America--certainly in my State of  Pennsylvania--choosing to be sanctuary cities, even though they would  rather not be.   Now, having addressed that, if our legislation is adopted, and we  have thereby solved this legal liability problem, if a community  nevertheless decides it is going to endanger all the rest of us by  conferring this special protection on somebody just because they came  here illegally--despite the fact that they may well be a dangerous  criminal--in that case, under my amendment, that community will be  deemed a sanctuary city, and under my amendment several types of  Federal funding would be withheld from it. Specifically, we would  withhold from the sanctuary cities community development block grants  and certain grants from the Economic Development Administration.    I think this is eminently reasonable. Sanctuary cities impose costs  on all of us. They raise the cost to the Federal Government of  enforcing immigration law, but by far outweighing that is the cost to  the American people of more crime and the unbelievable, staggering cost  to families like Jim Steinle and his family, who lost their daughter. I  think it is extremely reasonable to have as a policy that if a  community chooses to impose those costs on the rest of us, the Federal  Government will not be subsidizing it.   Let me debunk some of the misinformation that is occasionally  disseminated about my amendment. One is that it is somehow anti- immigrant. This is not anti-immigrant at all; this is pro-immigrant.   The fact is, the vast, overwhelming majority of immigrants in  America, legal and illegal, would never commit these terrible crimes;  there is no question about that. It is also obviously the case that any  very large number of people will include some criminals among them.   There are roughly 11 million people who are here illegally--11  million illegal immigrants in the United States. Some of them are  certainly violent criminals. It makes no sense to insulate those  violent criminals, however few they may be, from capture by law  enforcement. It would be absurd to allege that this is somehow anti- immigrant when quite likely some of their victims will be other  immigrants. Immigrants want to live in safe communities too. I am  positive of that. They don't want dangerous criminals to be able to  walk the streets just because they came here illegally.   The second point I want to stress is that this amendment does not  discourage or punish illegal immigrants for coming forward to report a  crime. This is important because folks who want to keep sanctuary  cities sometimes charge that if my legislation were passed, victims and  witnesses to crimes, if they are here illegally, wouldn't come forward.  That is not so. My amendment in this underlying law explicitly states  that a locality will not be labeled a sanctuary jurisdiction for this  purpose, and therefore will not lose any Federal funds, if it has a  policy stating that if a person comes forward as a victim or a witness  to a crime, local law enforcement will not share information with DHS.   Let me be clear and explicit about this. We have an explicit carve- out in the legislation. If a locality chooses to provide sanctuary  status to a victim of a crime or a witness to a crime, such a community  would not lose any Federal funds whatsoever. We think that  [[Page S954]]  makes sense because we do want to encourage victims and witnesses of  crimes to come forward. We get it. We don't want to create a worry that  there would be deportation consequences for them.   A third point which some have alleged and which I want to be very  clear about is that the penalties my amendment has for a community that  chooses to be a sanctuary city do not include the loss of any funds  whatsoever related to law enforcement or security. That is simply not  the case. The list of categories that we include in lost funding is  economic development in its nature. It is not at all law enforcement.   Another point that some on the other side have made is that somehow  this legislation, my amendment, would impose an unmanageable burden on  law enforcement. One simple fact to consider is, if that is the case,  then why has it been endorsed by law enforcement groups? The National  Association of Police Organizations has endorsed my amendment. The  International Union of Police Associations, a division of AFL-CIO, has  endorsed my amendment. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association  has endorsed my amendment. Would these groups endorse a bill that  imposed an unworkable burden on their own members? I rather doubt it. I  think they understand that this amendment encourages local law  enforcement to share information with the Department of Homeland  Security and in some cases to temporarily and briefly hold people in  custody until the Department of Homeland Security can get there.   This is a bipartisan amendment. In 2016, when the Senate voted on  this very same amendment in the form of a freestanding bill, it  received a majority, and it had bipartisan support. Unfortunately, a  minority filibustered it and blocked it. But the fact is, it is a  bipartisan piece of legislation with majority support. I don't think it  should even be controversial.   I think we will have a vote on this relatively soon, in the coming  days. I hope it will have very broad support. This is common sense. It  stands for the principle that the safety of the American people  matters, that the lives of Kate Steinle and other victims of violent  crime matter, and that all of our communities should be as safe as they  can be.
