 HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  highlight the visionary and unwavering leadership of civil rights icon  and notable Oklahoman Ms. Clara Luper.   Six months ago, I got to witness history as Oklahoma City  commemorated the 60th anniversary of the sit-ins she organized. I rise  today because, even as a fifth-generation Oklahoman, I realized how  little I knew.   Clara Luper and her students sparked a movement, the sit-ins that led  into our Nation's civil rights movement. They deserve to be a household  name.   Clara Luper made her mark in a time when people of color couldn't  even walk into the front door of Oklahoma City businesses. They were  relegated to hidden back rooms.   But she had a vision for equality, a heart for service, and a  commitment to justice. She, in her words, ``believed in a sun when it  didn't shine and the rain when it didn't fall.'' She knew that Oklahoma  and this country could be a place where everyone is treated with  respect, dignity, and humanity.   Even as a history teacher at Dunjee High School in Spencer, Oklahoma,  Ms. Luper instilled those principles in her students. Her steadfast  commitment to ending racism and systemic discrimination inspired her to  organize America's first sit-in.   In August 1958, she and 14 of her NAACP Youth Council students walked  up to a lunch counter they knew would refuse them, and they ordered a  hamburger and a Coke. They were denied, but they did not waver. They  knew what was on the line because, in Ms. Luper's words, ``within that  hamburger was the whole essence of democracy.''   At their own personal peril, they returned each day with more people  until they broke the barrier. It was never easy. The protesters were  verbally and physically assaulted, and Ms. Luper received death  threats.   Because of Ms. Luper and her students' fearlessness and  determination, the Katz Drug Stores integrated their lunch counters,  not just in Oklahoma City but also in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa.   When the 1958 sit-in happened in Oklahoma City, a group of college  students in North Carolina were inspired by what had taken place in  Oklahoma City, and they took note. In 1961, those students launched the  Greensboro, North Carolina, sit-in at the Woolworth lunch counter,  which fueled momentum within the civil rights movement.   It didn't end there. For years, Ms. Luper and others continued their  fight. The sacrifices continued, too.   Authorities arrested Ms. Luper 26 times during her fight for freedom.  Clara Luper empowered young people to imagine a future brighter than  their present and taught them how to make that future a reality.   She changed lives and planted seeds of ethical leadership into those  who were lucky enough to be mentored by her. Each of her former  students talks about the pivotal role Ms. Luper played in instilling  confidence, character, and dignity in them.   Generations reap the benefit of her sacrifice and efforts to  integrate not only businesses in Oklahoma City but educational spaces.   Ms. Luper integrated the history department at the University of  Oklahoma, becoming the first Black graduate of that master's program.  Her contributions are reflected across our  [[Page H2240]]  own State, in a namesake scholarship program at Oklahoma City  University, a corridor on the northeast side of Oklahoma City, a  classroom at the University of Central Oklahoma, by the designation of  the Oklahoma City Public Schools District building as The Clara Luper  Center, and naming the African American studies department at the  University of Oklahoma after her.   As a lifelong Oklahoman and representative of the Fifth Congressional  District, and as an American, I recognize how we are beneficiaries of  Clara Luper's efforts to create a more just and equitable place to  live. I cannot and will not take that history and impact for granted.   Although we have come so far because of her sacrifices and the  sacrifices of other heroes during the civil rights era, there is so  much work to be done. Even with the number of accolades given to her,  the best way we can honor Ms. Luper is to uphold her legacy through  commitment to justice and equality in the policies that we propose.   She knew that democracy is not a spectator sport. It is our duty as a  Congress and as Americans to make good on the constitutional promise of  establishing justice and ensuring domestic tranquility, so we must  continue to work for an inclusive, equitable place for everyone to live  and feel safe, as well as to build an economy where every American has  the opportunity to thrive.   Thank you to the sit-inners, and thank you to Clara Luper for your  resilience and for giving us the torch to carry.                            ____________________     HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   H.R. 8 is a critical piece of legislation that I am proud to support.  Congress needs to act to cut down on our Nation's widespread gun  violence. We must close loopholes that give buyers and sellers a way  around background checks. There is no reason vendors at gun shows or  online should be exempt from the safety measures other merchants must  obey. We should also vet sales between two people.   That is not to say that there should be no exceptions. My amendment  carves out protections for people who face risk of domestic violence,  dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse.   The underlying bill, H.R. 8, already creates an exception to the  background check requirement when there is a temporary weapon transfer,  if the transferee is at imminent risk of death or great bodily harm.  Our amendment is meant to make it crystal clear and explicit that this  exception applies when the transferees are protecting themselves from  an abuser. It does not expand the underlying exception; it offers one  critical example of where it might apply.                                time  1415    When I talked to Oklahomans across my district last year, they  confided in me their concerns about gun violence. I promised to work  towards policies that would protect them.   We need to protect our Second Amendment right, but there is no  credible reason why we as a state and nation can't acknowledge there  are steps we can take to save lives and find a path forward to do so.   H.R. 8 does just that. It increases safety without limiting our  Second Amendment rights by implementing commonsense policy.   But when we take these commonsense steps, we need to acknowledge our  power to create unintended consequences, and to prevent them.   That is why I am offering this amendment. In addition to my  commitment to gun safety, I have talked about my devotion to helping  protect women and families.   Between 1998 and 2017, the Oklahoma Domestic Violence Fatality Review  Board found nearly 1,700 people were killed in our State because of  domestic violence. In 2017 alone, 91 Oklahomans were murdered.   The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that  nearly two in five Oklahoma women will face some form of domestic abuse  or sexual violence during their lifetimes.   Oklahoma is consistently ranked in the top five States for women  killed by men in one-on-one homicides.   Oklahoma domestic violence programs serve an average of 18,000 people  annually, according to the YWCA.   Oklahoma is not an exception. These problems persist. One in four  women and one in nine men experience intimate partner physical  violence; these people deserve to be protected.   For us, that means many things, including strengthening and  reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and investing in support  services and family justice centers. But it also means we need to  empower people to protect themselves.   That is why Congress should pass laws to strengthen background checks  and create exceptions for those who truly need them.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as  she  [[Page H2258]]  may consume to the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Davids).    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I yield 15 seconds to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).     HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I would like to simply  close by reiterating the importance of H.R. 8 and my support for it in  this amendment, and clarifying and protecting individuals who are at  risk from domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault.   Mr. Chair, I would like to thank Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, who  cosponsored this amendment, as well as Congresswoman Davids and  Congressman Nadler for their remarks.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
