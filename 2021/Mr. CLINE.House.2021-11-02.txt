 Mr. Speaker, time and again I come to the House floor to  highlight the out-of-control spending schemes of the House majority.  But sadly, this falls on deaf ears as they continue their efforts to  push leftist government-dependency bills through this Chamber.   When will the majority leader realize that there is a real-world  impact to their fiscal irresponsibility?   Just this past quarter, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product slowed to a  disappointing 2 percent, and real disposable income decreased 5.6  percent, that is after already having decreased 30.2 percent in the  second quarter.   On top of all this, inflation has increased every month since Joe  Biden was sworn in and prices are at a 13-year high. Gas alone is now  averaging $3.39 a gallon--a 7-year high. With prices rising across the  board, the average family is spending $175 dollars more a month on  food, fuel, and housing in Biden's America. That is more than $2,000 a  year.  [[Page H6082]]    Job growth has slowed dramatically, and the September jobs report  fell 300,000 jobs short of what economists are predicting. This is in  addition to massive shortages that have wrought havoc on our supply  chain and left a record number of container ships waiting to enter our  ports.                            ____________________
