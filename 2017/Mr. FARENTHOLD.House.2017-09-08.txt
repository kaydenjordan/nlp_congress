 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Sessions for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as I was walking up to the Capitol from the Metro  station just a few minutes ago, I remembered just a couple weeks ago I  was boarding up my house and preparing for Hurricane Harvey. Those  intervening weeks have just altered my life immeasurably, seeing the  devastation that has been wrought on south Texas.   The district I represent, Corpus Christi, Port Aransas, Aransas Pass,  Ingleside, Refugio, those southern coastal areas were damaged severely  by wind. But then you move up the Texas coast into towns like Victoria,  Wharton, Houston, and then there was just unimaginable damage by water.   I was touched by how the entire Nation reached out to help, sending  food, water, help, and volunteers. And as I was walking up today, it is  a beautiful, crisp beginning to be a fall day here in Washington, D.C.,  but I am imagining what those folks in Florida are going through, very  similar to what I was going through, searching for the elusive D cell  battery for a flashlight, trying to find a gasoline station that is  open, and preparing for possibly the worst.   We are here today to tell those folks in Florida, those folks in  Texas, and those who face disasters all over this country that this  Congress has your back.   President Trump and Vice President Pence both visited the district I  represent and areas north in Houston, showing that the Federal  Government is there; but it is this Congress' constitutional  responsibility to control the purse strings of the country, and we have  got to make sure that there is money for these essential disaster  relief services.   There is only so much our volunteers can do, there is only so much  our State and local governments can do, because this is just so  massive, it is beyond the ability of individuals to comprehend. The  amount of debris, the amount of damage, the potential for disease all  make it a Federal problem. It is a problem for our country.   The storm shut down some of the refineries along Texas, and I think  we have all seen the higher gasoline prices that have resulted from  that.   Florida is threatened, their impact on our national economy. We are  one national economy. What hurts one of us hurts us all.   So I am here to say thank you to the American people, who opened  their hearts with their donations and their volunteering, but I am also  here to thank the American people, who are going to allocate a few of  their tax dollars to help those in need in Texas and, I am afraid,  those who are going to be in need very soon in Florida.   I am encouraging my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this. Set the  politics aside. Unfortunately, this has turned a little political, and  it doesn't need to be. This is about people helping people, Americans  helping Americans.   There is a T-shirt going around that says, ``Houston Strong.'' There  are T-shirts going around that are saying, ``Texas Strong.'' Well, you  know what? It is ``America Strong.''                                time  0930    This is all of us together, and I want to thank my colleagues who are  supporting this. And for those who are waffling, remember, this is what  makes our country great: coming together in times of need and setting  politics aside.   So I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  legislation and to keep those suffering in Texas in their prayers, and  to keep those in Florida and the Caribbean also in their  [[Page H7189]]  prayers. This has been a trying summer, weatherwise, but we are  Americans, and we will survive and we will thrive.
