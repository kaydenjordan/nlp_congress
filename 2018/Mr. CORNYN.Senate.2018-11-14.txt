 Mr. President, as I return to the Nation's Capital from  home, back in Austin, TX, so we can finish our work out before the end  of the year, I want to relay some of the wisdom that I heard from  working families and Texans back home about their verdict on what we  have done so far this year and actually even last year.   I stopped by a couple of food banks--one in North Texas and one in El  Paso--ahead of this year's upcoming holiday season. This is when they  have the greatest demand for food by people who need either to  supplement their diets or who rely on food banks to provide them with  their basic sustenance.   I also had a chance to visit with a Nobel Prize winner at the MD  Anderson Cancer Center, Dr. Jim Allison, to discuss his groundbreaking  work in cancer treatment, much of which was funded by money we have  appropriated to the National Institutes of Health, which, in turn,  provides grants for basic science and other research that come up with  lifesaving cures, such as Dr. Allison has come up with.   Then I met with the local leadership in the Corpus Christi area, down  in the gulf coast, to discuss their Hurricane Harvey recovery process.  It has been a little over a year since Hurricane Harvey hit. Of course,  many of those communities and many families are continuing to recover  from that devastation.   I also held a roundtable with local leaders and the drug-free  communities councils to discuss how local, State, and Federal leaders  can work together to fight the supply of illegal drugs coming into the  country and to support those who are in recovery from addiction. It  won't surprise you that people had a lot to say. Yet their stories  remind me that while being back here in Washington--although Texas is a  long way away, about 3 hours or so by jet--folks back home are paying  attention to what we are doing here, and I know some of that gets lost  in the back-and-forth of the political campaigns that have just passed.   There is one thing that we have done that I think has been well  received, and that is, since the voters gave us a Republican in the  White House and gave us Republican majorities in the House and the  Senate, we have put our foot on the gas pedal and haven't let off  since. We have delivered concrete results for the American people, and  they have continued to see gains under this administration--promises  made and promises kept.   I will start with the transformation of the Federal judiciary. One of  the most important jobs the U.S. Senate has under the Constitution is  to provide advice and consent on executive branch nominations--in this  case, to our article III courts. A historic number of judges who will  interpret the law as written have been confirmed under the  administration. That number is 84, and it includes the most ever  appellate judges--the midlevel Federal courts--to have ever been  confirmed during a President's first 2 years in office. These are  principled, experienced, highly skilled lawyers and judges who respect  precedent and understand their critical but limited role under our  system of government. Their job is to interpret the law; they shouldn't  rewrite it. That is one of the principal battles we end up fighting  when Supreme Court nominations come across the well of the Senate  floor. There are those who think that judges should be able to impose  their views on the American people even though they don't run for  election and have lifetime tenures, but that is simply not our system.  In my view, that is an impermissible role to be played by a judge.   When it comes to judges, perhaps our two greatest achievements have  been Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom were confirmed to  the U.S. Supreme Court. Yet, as I say, we have confirmed a total of 84  other Federal judges, including 3 on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals  from Texas. All of these nominees and now judges have brought great  intellect, legal expertise, impartiality, and good will to bear as they  make decisions with their very distinguished colleagues.   We saw the first major overhaul in the Tax Code in 31 years. It  lowered rates for every tax bracket, doubled the child tax credit to  help working families, and made our business tax scheme more  competitive globally. All of this has allowed many of those employers  to pass along benefits through bonuses and higher wages. We have also  incentivized investment in economically distressed communities in every  State through the Opportunity Zone Program.   Some like to shrug off the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by  calling the savings crumbs, which is what Ms. Pelosi has called them,  but they are certainly not taking into account what I am hearing from  my constituents back home in Texas. The effects of tax reform are real,  and they are extremely significant to every American. All employers  have been able to provide additional benefits--as I said, some in the  form of bonuses or in increased pay. Those who have seen their pay  remain the same have seen more take-home pay because their tax  obligations have been reduced.   One of the taxpayers I heard from in Texas was a gentleman by the  name of David Tong from Arlington, TX, which is halfway between Fort  Worth and Dallas. Dave wrote to me to say that the company at which he  is employed has increased the number of hours people are able to work.  He said Christmas bonuses have been promised, too, and that the company  has hired more people, has bought more new machinery based on the  accelerated depreciation provided for under the bill, and has made long  overdue repairs to their working place. Now, with the tax law changes  in place, David says the guys down on the shop floor are taking home a  little more in their paychecks each week. He said all of this adds up  and makes a huge difference in the lives of the guys on the shop floor.   We have heard similar stories from around the country because more  than 700 companies, including many that are based in Texas, have used  the tax savings to benefit their employees and their customers. They  have announced pay raises, as I said, and 401(k) match increases.   We have actually seen seniors and people on fixed incomes have a  decrease in their utility bills, when their electricity is provided by  investor-owned utilities, because of the reduction in taxes to be paid  by those investor-owned utilities. So there are lower utility rates for  seniors and those on fixed incomes.   These developments are part of the reason the economy is thriving.  Since tax reform was signed into law, the economy has added more than 2  million jobs, and unemployment has been at its lowest rate since 1969.  My State has a population that is roughly 38 to 40 percent Hispanic;  yet Hispanic unemployment sits at the record low of 4.4 percent. That  is a big deal to my constituents back home. Joblessness for African  Americans has fallen to its lowest level ever--the lowest level ever-- under this administration.    Then, of course, with more demand--with more money in people's  pockets, more money to spend--there is more demand for goods and  services. So in October alone, the economy has added another 250,000  jobs, exceeding all expectations. As a matter of fact, the biggest  concern I hear from employers now is that they are looking for  qualified employees who are able to perform the jobs that are now  available, and many of these are very well-paying jobs.   So people are back to work. They are earning more. They are  investing, and the economy is moving at full throttle.   But it wasn't just the work of the tax bill. That was just part of  it. Part of it has to do with the increased confidence and optimism  that people feel about their future as a result of the improvement of  their economic circumstances. We saw that with the passage of the  bipartisan Dodd-Frank reform. We have also provided additional relief  to our community banks and credit unions so they are able to spend less  money on redtape and have more money invested  [[Page S6942]]  in their local communities and in their small businesses.   We also know that regulation is important, but overregulation is a  job killer. We have rolled back overregulation that was stifling job  creation, and we are creating an environment that fosters job growth.  Our reforms have created a savings of at least $50 billion for small  businesses and entrepreneurs. That is why the economy is on fire.   We have also done important things to help improve access to  healthcare. We have repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board  provisions of ObamaCare and repealed the costly individual mandate,  which essentially was a tax on poor people and middle-income people  when they couldn't afford to buy the ObamaCare policies with all of the  coverage that they didn't necessarily even want or need, but it added  to the cost of the policy. When they couldn't afford the policy, they  were taxed by their own government and punished through the individual  mandate.   What we have done is to try to restore the authority and the power of  citizens themselves to make healthcare decisions for themselves and  their families that they want and that they can afford by starting to  recreate an individual market. To me, that is the best way for us to  offer choice and to keep prices down--to create an individual market,  not for government to mandate a one-size-fits-all approach, which is  what ObamaCare did. It forced many young people to pay a lot more for  their insurance to subsidize others who were covered by ObamaCare.   We also addressed the public health challenges we face in this  country in another significant way. The Nation's drug addiction  epidemic killed roughly 72,000 Americans last year. Some 72,000  Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses. Nearly 50,000 of those  were related to opioids, whether a prescription drug or heroin or  fentanyl. It has left many families in disarray and overwhelmed medical  professionals and emergency personnel in many communities.   Through the collaboration of about 70 bipartisan proposals--people  say nothing bipartisan happens here, but thanks to 70 bipartisan  proposals--that were included in this landmark opioids bill, we are not  only addressing stemming the tide of drugs coming across our border but  also supporting those who are trying to recover from a drug addiction.   Among other reforms, the law requires screening of packages being  mailed from overseas for substances like fentanyl. It increases access  to treatment for people with substance disorders. It expands research  into nonaddictive painkillers, and it provides more money for  enforcement and interdiction.   But healthy communities are also safe communities. In addition to the  opioids bill, we took further steps to enhance the safety of our  communities and to help victims. With three new laws, we aimed to  reduce the backlog of untested rape kits in forensic labs so that  perpetrators of sexual assault can be identified with near certainty  and those wrongly charged can be exonerated.   We also have assisted our law enforcement in prosecuting cold cases  and eradicating the scourge of online sex trafficking. We didn't stop  there, though. We kept communities' needs in mind and turned toward  fixing our Nation's outdated infrastructure.   In October, we passed a major water infrastructure bill that helps to  keep our communities safe by providing dams and levees and addressing  the need for drinking water--clean, safe drinking water--and addressing  the underdevelopment of wastewater systems across the country.   But our work on infrastructure extended far beyond public water  systems. It also included passing the Federal Aviation Administration  Reauthorization Act, which modernizes airport infrastructure, increases  safety, and boosts industry innovation.   We also helped to support our men and women in uniform, past and  present. By passing a Defense authorization bill, we gave our troops  the largest pay raise in nearly 10 years and began to restore military  readiness in an increasingly dangerous world.   The National Defense Authorization Act, named after our former  chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John McCain, ensures that our  troops have the resources, the equipment, and the training they need to  defend our country and keep Americans safe.   For our veterans, we passed the VA Mission Act--again, a bipartisan  piece of legislation. Access to healthcare had become a nightmare for  many who sacrificed so much for our country. We saw them being met with  difficulty getting appointments because they were backlogged so much,  or they had to drive great distances to get access to basic healthcare.  So we passed the VA Mission Act with an eye toward providing more  efficient access to care in local communities.   Beyond that, we did the basic work of funding the Federal Government  on time and through regular order. We haven't finished that job yet. We  have until December 7 to finish the job, and I hope we do. It is not a  particularly flashy topic, but it is one of the most fundamental duties  of the Congress.   So our record is clear, and the voters responded by rewarding the  majority with an even greater Senate majority in the next Congress. But  we need to finish out the rest of this year strong. We are adding to  our list of accomplishments this week by passing a bipartisan bill to  provide critical funding for the Coast Guard. Our Coast Guard is made  up of men and women who risk their lives to save others and to protect  our ports and to stop illegal drugs from reaching our country. This  bill ensures that they can continue that work with the predictability  they deserve.   Moving forward, we have a significant to-do list before we break for  Christmas. We need to finalize the farm bill. We need to reauthorize a  number of other bills, and despite the large number of nominations we  were able to get done before we recessed, there is still a huge backlog  of many executive branch nominations. For some reason, after the 2016  election, our Democratic colleagues decided they were going to obstruct  or delay as many Trump nominations to executive agencies on the bench  as they could. Unfortunately, they have been too successful in doing  so, but I am confident that the Senate Majority Leader, Senator  McConnell, will use the leverage of people wanting to get home at  Christmastime and Thanksgiving to ensure that we get a maximum number  of these noncontroversial nominees supported. These are people who will  enjoy broad bipartisan support if we can just get our Democratic  colleagues to quit the obstruction.   We have just a short time left to finish this Congress strong, but  the past 2 years have been an unmitigated success for the country. We  have delivered on promises we have made. We have put money back in the  pockets of hard-working families. We enhanced community safety and  fought for victims. We have modernized infrastructure and supported our  men and women in uniform. I hope we can continue this momentum into the  116th Congress that begins in January.   I yield the floor.
