 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize our  men and women in uniform who dedicate their lives to keeping  communities across our Nation safe.   This past year was the deadliest year for police officers in decades;  264 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty.   As mayor or Irving, I was a proud advocate of our local police  department. And as the Representative of the 24th District in Texas, I  will continue to stand with our law enforcement.   Rather than defunding and devaluing those in uniform, I know from  experience that community policing works and community policing only  exists with the support of our officers, higher retention, and improved  recruitment.   I thank our police officers, first responders, and their families.  Getting up every morning and putting on the badge is a level of courage  few will ever understand.   We join you in respecting, honoring, and remembering your fallen  brothers and sisters in blue.                            ____________________
