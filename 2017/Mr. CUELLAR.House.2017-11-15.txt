 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for  yielding and for her kind words about the Tilden Veterans Post Office.  I also want to thank my friend from Corpus Christi, Texas, for his kind  words on the naming of this post office.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to support and present H.R. 1207, which  will name the post office facility in my district as the Tilden  Veterans Post Office.   Across my district, there are many examples of fine men and women who  have honorably served our country. It is imperative that we honor their  service and dedication to our Nation.   Dedicating this post office to our veterans will serve as a constant  reminder of the sacrifices that our friends, neighbors, and families  made while serving their country. These are individuals who put country  ahead of self and for whom I am proud to recognize with the dedicating  of the post office facility.   For example, as the gentlewoman from New Jersey said, Anselmo  Villarreal of Tilden, Texas, was drafted in the Army in 1968. He served  in Vietnam. After his service, Mr. Villarreal  [[Page H9293]]  returned to Tilden and worked in a local plant for 28 years before  retiring.   This veteran also continues to serve his community by volunteering  for local veterans service organizations. We owe our freedom to  veterans like Mr. Villarreal and others, which is why I am recognizing  him and the other veterans with the dedication of this post office. He  is one example of many veterans who have made countless sacrifices for  our country in the face of danger.   The courage and dedication of our veterans toward our Nation  demonstrates what it really means to be an American--the essence of  being an American.   I also thank the veterans from Tilden and McMullen County for their  service and sacrifice for our country. I also thank the veterans  organizations throughout my district for their tireless work in  providing the care our veterans need. There are many local  organizations like the veterans service offices in McMullen County that  provide essential care to those who have returned home from service.   Let us remember and express gratitude to these brave people: the  veterans, their families, as well as the care providers.   In the words of President John F. Kennedy: ``As we express our  gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to  utter words, but to live by them.''                                time  1515    Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
