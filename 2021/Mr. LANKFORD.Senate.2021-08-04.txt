 Madam President, I have an amendment that we are  calling up. It is a very straightforward amendment.   This deals simply with how we handle E-Verify. The E-Verify system is  very simple and straightforward. It has been used all over the country.  It is a nonpartisan issue that we have used for decades now.   It verifies whether the people that we are actually hiring, and all  this purchasing that we are doing, this massive billions of dollars  will actually be--the simple, straightforward piece of it is, we are  putting billions of dollars into our economy right now. We are doing a  lot of infrastructure with this bill.   The promise should be that we are not just buying American, but we  are actually hiring Americans as well. This is a bipartisan issue,  quite frankly.   President Biden, just today, released a statement that this is a  once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure and will create  good-paying union jobs, repairing our roads and bridges, replacing lead  pipes, building energy transmission lines.   It invests in clean energy, manufacturing, and zero-emission  vehicles, ensuring that the jobs in the clean energy industry are good- paying, quality American jobs. That is a great promise to be able to  make, and it is a great statement to make.   What this amendment does is to make sure it actually is American  jobs. We know there is a tremendous pull factor with the American good- paying jobs that are out there. This E-Verify requirement puts in  place, both for the contractors and subcontractors, they will actually  be American citizens.   So, with that, I ask support for this bill.    Madam President, are there any of my 2 minutes left?    Madam President, this is not just a mandate; this is  just a statement, if we are going to put American tax dollars in place,  that we are actually hiring Americans to do it.   If we are going to build America, let's also hire Americans in the  process. That shouldn't be inconsistent with our basic values.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2233     I ask for the yeas and nays.
