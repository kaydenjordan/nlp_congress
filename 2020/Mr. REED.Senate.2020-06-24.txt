 Madam President, I rise to join my colleague and chairman,  Senator Inhofe, to discuss the fiscal year 2021 national defense  authorization bill.   I begin by thanking Senator Inhofe for his leadership in ensuring  that we had a bill to consider this year. This was an extraordinary  year. Social distancing just began as the Armed Services Committee was  finishing our hearings and getting ready to go into  [[Page S3194]]  the markup for the national defense authorization bill. Despite the  uncertainty, the unusual challenges--the logistical challenges  particularly--Senator Inhofe ensured that the bill was written and that  the markup was held on schedule. He should be commended for this  accomplishment. It is a tribute to his leadership, to his wisdom, to  his common sense, and to his common decency.   So thank you for that, Mr. Chairman.   I also want to take a moment to thank the staff. Both the chairman  and I operate under the same rubric: They do the work, and we get the  credit. It works for us--their work for us. They do a superb job. They  found ways to draft the legislation. Yet they, too, were disrupted.  Their work spaces were separated, and many had to work from home. So  this has been an extraordinary achievement, and it is a tribute to  their commitment, to their professionalism, to their skill, and to  their collaborative, bipartisan effort. I thank them for that.   As the Senator, the chairman, has said and emphasized several times  ``bipartisanship.'' This has been the hallmark of this legislation for  many, many years. We recall colleagues, going back to John Warner and  Sam Nunn and others, who had the attitude that ``we have to work  together.'' Again, let me give the chairman credit for preserving that  attitude, for insisting upon that attitude, and for really getting, I  think, the best out of the committee because of his example and of his  setting a tone.   We have differences in the bill, but we are strongly behind this  effort. One of the things that I think we have been able to do is to  figure out what might be a point of difference and that, if it comes to  down to it, we take a vote, and we move on, and we get the bill done.  That is what we did this time. We look forward to being on the floor  and to doing the same thing--taking amendment proposals from our  colleagues and trying to deal with them. If we can include them in the  bill unanimously, that will be great. If we need a vote, I hope we can  have debate and get a vote.   We all understand that the bill provides the Defense Department with  the resources it needs, particularly to ensure that the men and women  who defend us have the resources they need not only to fight the fight  but, when they return, to have a quality of life with their families  themselves that is in keeping with their sacrifice and their service.  This bill does that. It also funds at the caps set under the recently  enacted Budget Control Act of about 2 years ago, so we are providing  the much needed stability the Department needs. It will include many  items that benefit the families and military members, and I will go  into those details later in our discussion.   Now, 2 weeks ago, the committee took up the bill in the markup.  Again, under the leadership of the chairman, we had a very good day of  discussion and debate, and the bill was adopted by the committee with a  strong bipartisan vote of 25 to 2. This legislation is coming to the  floor with overwhelming bipartisan support, and as the chairman  indicated, one reason is that he solicited the input of all of the  members. We and our staff tried very vigorously to incorporate those  proposals and ideas of all members, and at the end of the day, it was a  strong, overwhelming vote.   But even though we did consider, as the chairman said, hundreds of  different proposals by members of the committee and Members of the  Senate, there are still issues that will come before us. That is why,  on the floor, I hope we will have, as the chairman indicated, an open  debate, that we will consider amendments--hopefully do so under  reasonable time constraints so that we can get a lot done--and then, at  the end of a vigorous debate, be able to vote for a bill that will  advance the welfare of the men and women who serve and advance the  common defense, which is our constitutional responsibility.   Again, I thank Senator Inhofe and look forward to the consideration  of this bill.    Mr. President, today I introduce, along with Senator  Inhofe, Senator Jones, Senator Moran, and Senator Hyde-Smith, the DOE  EPSCoR Modernization Act of 2020.   As many of our colleagues are aware, the Department of Energy  Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (DOE EPSCoR) was  established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486). This  critical initiative seeks to improve the capacity of eligible states to  conduct nationally competitive energy research and connect eligible  states with the National Laboratory System.   The purpose of the bill we are introducing is to broaden the scope of  the  [[Page S3208]]  research funded by the DOE EPSCoR program beyond basic science, to  encompass the full range of research supported by DOE. This includes  cutting-edge research in applied energy technologies, energy  efficiency, energy storage, and environmental management, to name a few  key areas. Yet, because of the program's narrow focus on basic science,  EPSCoR States are only able to support a small fraction of DOE's  research mission.   Our bill would continue to support investments in research  infrastructure and expand opportunities for EPSCoR institutions to  partner with National Laboratories to conduct their research. Our bill  would also increase support for graduate students and early career  faculty.   When the National Academy of Sciences evaluated EPSCoR programs, it  concluded that EPSCoR programs are critical to the nation's scientific  and technology leadership, because EPSCoR helps ensure that talented  researchers and scientists from all 50 states are partners in science  and technology research. This is even truer in the context of energy  issues, where each state and region faces different energy  opportunities and infrastructure challenges.   By modernizing the program and bringing it into alignment with EPSCoR  programs operated by other agencies, DOE EPSCoR will be better  positioned to meet today's energy challenges and align with the  interests and strengths of EPSCoR states. I am pleased to have the  support of the Coalition of EPSCoR/IDeA States in this effort, and I  urge our colleagues to join us in pressing for passage of this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Rubio):   S. 4055. A bill to address health workforce shortages and disparities  highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic through additional funding for the  National Health Service Corps and the Nurse Corps, and to establish a  National Health Service Corps Emergency Service demonstration project;  to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
