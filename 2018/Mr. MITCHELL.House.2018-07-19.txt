 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 82-year-old  United States Navy veteran Monroe Murphy of Dryden, who recently  graduated with his high school diploma, 68 years after he put his  education on hold and bravely enlisted in the Navy at the age of 16.   Monroe served in Korea as an engineman. He received an honorable  discharge, returned home, and married his high school sweetheart, Ann,  and raised their seven children on the family farm in Michigan.   Monroe worked at Selfridge Air Field, General Motors, and at his own  service station in Romeo.   With the help of his daughter, he enrolled in adult education and  began a 3-year journey of attending classes to receive his high school  diploma. He graduated in June of this year, at the top of his class,  and gave the commencement address to his family and friends present.   Monroe's impressive journey will continue, as he plans on enrolling  in college classes.   Congratulations, Monroe, and keep up the great work.                            ____________________
