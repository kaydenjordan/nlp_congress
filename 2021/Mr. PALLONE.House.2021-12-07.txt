 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  bipartisan legislation that will continue to guarantee access to  healthcare providers as we confront the COVID-19 pandemic.   Nothing could be more important to our seniors than making sure that  they have access to doctors during this time.   I heard what my colleague on the Republican side said, but I just  want to assure everyone that what we are really talking about here is  making sure that our seniors can access a doctor, that there are  doctors available to help them during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Since the beginning of the pandemic, Congress has provided relief to  Medicare providers by waiving a 2 percent cut in payments that was  created as part of sequestration. This legislation will continue  waiving those cuts. It also protects Medicare and other  Federal programs by preventing any cuts from occurring as a result of  paygo rules.    The legislation provides additional relief to healthcare providers by  increasing payments under Medicare's physician fee schedule next year  and preventing cuts to Medicare payments for lab and oncology services.   We have to understand that providers have to keep their doors open.  Labs have to be open. During these difficult times, when providers are  being stretched to the limit, and labs, oncology services, and  everything is being stretched to the limit, if Congress does not take  action now and pass this bill, then some healthcare providers will face  significant reductions in payments, and that has an impact on our  seniors and their ability to get services.   This legislation is important for the seniors, and it is important  for our constituents. It has bipartisan and bicameral support, and I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it tonight.
