 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, my neighbor from just  down I-64, for organizing this Special Order honoring the life of  Senator Bunning this evening.   This is the first time in my 11 years serving in Congress that I have  spoken from this side of the aisle, and it is a fitting occasion that I  do that. I am proud to join my Republican colleagues and friends this  evening.   During his baseball career, Jim Bunning was once asked what his  proudest accomplishment was, and he recalled the fact that he went  nearly 11 years without ever missing a start. ``They wrote my name  down, and I went to the post,'' he said.   I can't help but think that is a fitting way of also describing his  political career and his love of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Kentuckians wrote his name down time after time again, and he went to  work for them, no questions asked.   Jim and I obviously didn't see eye to eye politically all the time,  and as amazed as I was by the curve balls that he threw on the field, I  sometimes found myself equally amazed by some of the curve balls he  threw off the field, but that was Jim. When so much of what happens in  Congress is political theater, you can't deny that he was always real  and that every word he spoke, he genuinely believed.   I am sure Jim's family takes great pride in that fact. I join with my  colleagues in offering them my thoughts and prayers as they continue to  grieve their loss. I hope they find comfort in the lifetime of memories  they share together.   It is reported that Daniel Boone once said: ``Heaven must be a  Kentucky kind of place.''   I sure hope that is true.   As I said at the time of his passing, Jim Bunning can now throw no- hitters forever on his field of dreams.
