 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding this  time.   I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters and all  the members of the Financial Services Committee for working with me to  pass this important legislation. It is something I began work on early  in my tenure here in Congress, and it is important to me and to my  fellow New Yorkers and, I think, our fellow Americans, as well, to see  this legislation pass today.   Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2001, our Nation was rocked by the most  vicious terrorist attack in our Nation's history. The devastation and  the loss of life shook the American people to their core. It shook the  entire world.   But that morning, we also witnessed the bright light of heroism. The  world saw and heard inspiring tales of rescue by public safety  officers: our police officers, our firefighters, and our EMTs. They  heard heartbreaking stories of many of those heroes, their injuries and  their tragic deaths, people who risked their lives to save others.   There is something incredible about our public safety officers. Day  in and day out, they put their lives on the line.   Growing up, most of us were taught to run out of burning buildings,  but they do exactly the opposite. They are trained and they are devoted  to responding to just that type of situation. They run into those  buildings not to protect themselves or even the property, but primarily  to save lives.   That is exactly what hundreds of first responders did on that fateful  day in America. They ran in without pause. They climbed flights and  flights of stairs, while an inferno raged above them. And as we  remember all too well--the images are burned in our minds forever-- those towers eventually fell, taking just about all who were living  inside those towers with them.   This experience affected all of us, and it still affects us all  today. It personally impacted thousands of people in New York and in  the New York region, I would say the quad-State region and beyond. It  affected people right here in our capital region and our Pentagon. It  certainly affected the people in Pennsylvania and in Boston, and  wherever those flights were heading that day.   It was a national attack against America. Every soul in America  experienced that attack. And it impacted me, personally, as well,  because my dear, good friend and first cousin, Battalion Chief John  Moran, was one of those brave public safety officers inside the towers  that morning. His last known words were as his truck pulled up to Tower  2. He said: ``Let me off here. I'm going to try to make a difference.''    That is what all those who served that day tried to do: they tried to  make a difference.   So, for me, as for thousands of Americans, the effort to honor these  men and women is personal. After the attacks took place, I began  working on legislation to do just that.   Earlier in 2001, just a few months before the attacks, Congress had  created a Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor for those who went above  and beyond the call of duty. But there wasn't a way to give that award  posthumously to the many who displayed extraordinary courage and who  perished on September 11. But we needed to change that, and we did.   In 2004, Congress finally passed our legislation, the 9/11 Heroes  Medal of Valor Act, which established a decoration, posthumously  awarded by the President of the United States, to the public safety  officers who died rescuing individuals at the World Trade Center, the  Pentagon, and elsewhere on 9/11.   The following year, I attended the ceremony at the White House with  [[Page H9068]]  many of the victims' families, where then-President George W. Bush  bestowed this honor on 442 heroes and their families. They all deserved  this important recognition.   But as the years went on, the Nation began to learn of the longer  lasting effects of the attacks because, as we all know, the story of  this tragedy did not end simply on September 11. For weeks and for  months after the attacks, officers continued to work day and night,  first on search and rescue missions, and then on the cleanup of the  wreckage itself.   The toxic dust spewing into the air, when inhaled, proved to have  enduring deadly effects, particularly for our first responders. For  example, according to the Uniformed Firefighters Association, more than  170 firefighters have died as a result of 9/11-related injuries.                                time  1845    Eighteen officers died in 2017 alone. Hundreds of other public safety  officers have met similar fates.   At the time that we passed the original 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor  bill, we did not yet know that more brave public safety officers would  fall ill and pass away because of their dedicated service to their  country. They, too, were heroes, and they deserve to be honored as  such.   That is why I have worked to introduce this new 9/11 Heroes Medal of  Valor Act. This bill will grant the medal to public safety officers who  worked at the sites of the attacks and have since died from a 9/11- connected illness as defined in the Zadroga Act. It will also allow  those who continue to succumb to 9/11-related illnesses to receive this  award.   I am proud to say the legislation has the support of a wide array of  public safety organizations, including the International Association of  Fire Fighters, International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National  Association of Police Organizations, the National Volunteer Fire  Council, the National Sheriffs' Association, Major County Sheriffs of  America, the FealGood Foundation, and, of course, the Sergeants  Benevolent Association, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the  New York City Police Department, and that of the Port Authority of New  York and New Jersey, as well.   Without the tireless advocacy efforts of these organizations, we  would not be here today. So I am extremely grateful for the work that  they have done and are committed to continue to do to make this bill  law. I look forward to the day when we finally honor the hundreds of  heroes who have died since 9/11 for the outstanding work they did and  what they continue to do to help our Nation recover.   I want to thank, again, the chairman, Mr. Hensarling, Ranking Member  Waters, all of my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee who  cosponsored this bill from New York and around the country as well, and  all of those who have helped get this long-overdue bill passed here  today.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to its passage by the Senate and being  signed into law by the President. I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, in case the gentleman was going to yield  back, I just want to thank my staff as well, both those who worked back  in 2004 to help pass the original legislation, and my staff today.   In particular, I want to thank my chief of staff back home in Queens,  AnneMarie Anzalone, whose husband at the time was a member of the New  York City Police Department, and was a part of the cleanup on the  restoration after the attack in Manhattan. It was because of her  thoughtfulness in terms of moving me and pushing me to pass this  legislation that this bill has come to the floor today. So I want to  thank her in particular for her efforts.   I thank the gentleman again for yielding.
