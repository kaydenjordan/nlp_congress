 Mr. Speaker, I want to join my colleagues in  congratulating Steve Stivers on his promotion to brigadier general. I  served for 26\1/2\ years in the United States Air Force, and I can tell  you that every officer who puts on the uniform, in the quiet moments of  their own minds, they dream of the day that maybe someday they might  aspire to become a flag officer or to attain the rank of general  officer.   I can tell you that, from my perspective, it is a lot easier to get  elected to the House of Representatives than it is to earn the rank of  general--at least that is what my experience shows. I can tell you, I  never served under Steve Stivers and his command, but if his military  leadership and performance is anything like his performance here in the  House, he is going to represent the State of Ohio and our Nation very  well.   Congratulations to my colleague, Steve Stivers. God bless you, and  thank you for your service to our country.                            ____________________
