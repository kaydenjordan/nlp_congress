 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President on this date a century ago, an extraordinary  life began that would change the lives of millions of others. One  hundred years ago today, Nelson Mandela was born in the village of  Mvezo in a countryside of grass-covered rolling hills in the Eastern  Cape of South Africa. That day began a 95-year journey of one man who  led the South African people to liberation and whose legacy continues  to reverberate through time.   Over the course of his life, Nelson Mandela, known by his nickname  ``Madiba,'' became venerated as a global advocate for justice and  equality by millions--arguably, more than any other political figure of  our time. Through political activism and resistance, Madiba led a  revolution by shepherding his people from racial division, hate, and  subjugation to freedom, tolerance, and democracy.   One of the most striking aspects of Nelson Mandela's leadership as  the first President of a truly free, nonracial, nonsexist South Africa  was his enormous capacity for forgiveness and his ability to open his  heart to those who were once his brutal oppressors.   Twenty years after he was released from a lifetime in prison, Nelson  Mandela invited to dinner at his own home one of his former jailers, a  man with whom he had become close friends, saying that their friendship  reinforced his belief in the essential humanity of even those who had  kept him for so long behind bars. How long? Twenty-six years, 6 months,  and 1 week.   Despite all of those years, months, and days of continuous  imprisonment, Nelson Mandela never himself became a prisoner to hate.  Madiba set the example of healing, forgiveness, and reconciliation that  ultimately allowed South Africa's rainbow nation to emerge from the  ashes of brutal racial oppression.   His example is particularly timely and powerful in light of the  polarization, distrust, and division in our world and even in our own  Nation today. History reminds us, though, that this reconciliation,  this openness, is not a new phenomenon.   Fifty-two years ago this summer, in June of 1966, then-U.S. Senator  Robert F. Kennedy delivered a memorable speech at the University of  Cape Town in South Africa. Speaking to a nation then deep in the throes  of the cruel injustices of apartheid, Senator Bobby Kennedy began his  speech by describing ``a land in which the native inhabitants were at  first subdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a  land which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which was once  the importer of slaves, and must now struggle to wipe out the last  traces of that former bondage.'' Kennedy then paused before famously  concluding: ``I refer, of course, to the United States of America.''  [[Page S5075]]    Then, as now, the differences between the United States and South  Africa are significant. Yet Americans and South Africans share more  than we might recognize or want to acknowledge. On the positive side,  we share remarkable constitutions and inspiring foundational documents  in South Africa's Freedom Charter and our own Declaration of  Independence, whose fundamental principles are profound and inspiring  but whose lived experiences have so far fallen short. We also share a  deep commitment to democracy, societies grounded in the rule of law, a  vibrant and free press, and capable and independent judiciaries. We are  also multilingual, multifaith democracies, Federal republics that have  incredible human histories and deep and rich natural resources. Both  South Africa and the United States have demonstrated how important  civic institutions are to sustaining democracy and preserving the  progress of humanity.   Today, on what would have been Nelson Mandela's 100th birthday, the  United States is itself facing serious challenges to the very  institutions that underpin and preserve our hard-won democracy. As we  weather these challenges together as a nation, let us find inspiration  in Mandela's life and legacy. Let us remember that on his long walk to  freedom, Nelson Mandela taught the need to study not only those with  whom we agree but also those with whom we disagree and to be willing to  compromise and find common ground.   In Madiba's words:         It is easy to break down and destroy. The real heroes are       those who make peace and build.    In the years to come, it is my hope that the United States and South  Africa will look to each other as both nations continue to struggle  against the legacy of racial injustice, reverse our growing economic  inequality, and protect our evolving experiments in democracy.   Nelson Mandela ventured to shape the world as it should be. He showed  us that values such as forgiveness, respect, and tolerance are not just  words but concrete actions we can all take.   I am inspired by Madiba's example to keep fighting for a better, more  just world here in the U.S. Senate, as I was first inspired in the fall  of 1986 when I traveled to South Africa to volunteer for the South  African Council of Churches during the anti-apartheid struggle.   Just 2 years ago, I had a chance as a now Senator to revisit  Johannesburg and Cape Town with a delegation that included Senator  Kennedy's daughter, Kerry Kennedy, and a whole host of the Kennedy  clan. Our own Congressman  John Lewis, a leader in America's civil  rights struggle; my friend and colleague Congressman Steny Hoyer; and  two survivors of the racially motivated shooting in a church in  downtown Charleston, Polly Sheppard and Felicia Sanders, were there to  serve as a living example of the challenges and the difficulties of  reconciliation, of forgiveness, and of grace.   We had remarkable experiences. We met with Desmond Tutu, my former  supervisor at the Council of Churches decades ago, a winner of the  Nobel Peace Prize and someone who helped lead the peace and  reconciliation process in South Africa. We also heard from today's  chancellor of the University of Cape Town, Nelson Mandela's widow,  Graca Machel.   Our reflections were interrupted by student protesters demanding a  more just dispensation in today's South Africa--a jarring reminder that  even the greatness of the remembrance of Bobby Kennedy and Nelson  Mandela is not enough to still the relentless yearning for more--more  justice and more equality--by the youngest among us.   I still today believe in Nelson Mandela's vision for the world--a  world governed by justice and equality and peace and cooperation for  the common good. But it is important to remember just how much we have  to do together as a global community to hear each other, forgive each  other, and get there.   Nelson Mandela once famously said: ``I am not a saint, unless you  think of a saint as a sinner who just keeps trying.'' So today let us  remember Nelson Mandela's relentless trying, his historic contribution  to South Africa and the world, and the example of his struggle to  promote human rights and justice for all. Madiba's service is an  enduring reminder of what it means to place the good of a nation's  people above one's own narrow self-interests--a lesson from which we  can all benefit.   I am pleased to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of a  giant of history and to honor Nelson Mandela's lifetime of  extraordinary service with a bipartisan resolution submitted today.  Today, let us rededicate ourselves to his vision for our world and  together work tirelessly to make it a reality.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
