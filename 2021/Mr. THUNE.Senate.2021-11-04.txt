 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded and that I be allowed to speak for up  to 15 minutes and that Senator Carper be allowed to speak for up to 2  minutes at the conclusion of my remarks prior to the vote.    Madam President, just in the last day or so, the ever- evolving reckless tax-and-spending spree bill proposed by the  Democrats--it continues to change because they can't seem to figure out  how to put together something that might pass in the House and the  Senate, and finding it increasingly difficult, I think, to try and  contain the cost of all the things they want to do, which is why they  continue to build in gimmicks and phony math to try to accommodate all  the crazy spending in this bill, and then also the massive run-up in  the taxes.   This bill is the largest spending increase we have seen in history,  largest tax increase in history, and we are finding out now it is also  going to add significantly to the Federal debt because there is a  recent study by Penn Wharton which suggests that the overall cost of  the bill, when fully implemented, would be $3.9 trillion and that the  revenues that are proposed to be raised to pay for it only generate  about $1.5 trillion. So that leaves you with a $2.4 trillion delta  that, obviously, would be added to the deficit and put on the debt.   So not only does this spend enormous amounts of money, unprecedented  amounts of money, it raises an unprecedented amount of revenue. But  even at that level, the revenue is totally inadequate and insufficient  to cover that spending; therefore, it will add massively to the Federal  debt--that is according to an economic analysis done by Penn Wharton  here just in the last couple days.   But this is the most recent addition to that bill in the House of  Representatives. They would raise the SALT cap--  [[Page S7768]]  the state and local tax deduction cap--from $10,000 to $72,500. And it  would also extend that higher cap through 2031, beyond its scheduled  expiration after 2025.   So they are still trying to come up with a way--if you can believe  this. The massive amount of spending, massive amount of taxing, is now  added to that a tax cut--a huge tax cut for rich people.   According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, if you  look at how this distributes proportionately across income ranges,  those making less than $100,000 would receive 2.5 percent of that tax  cut--a tax cut that would cost $300 billion just through 2025. So if it  is fully implemented for the full 10-year window, you are talking about  hundreds of billions of dollars more in tax cuts to rich people.    So just think about that. From the side that always says that our  side is looking out for rich people, trying to cut taxes for the rich,  they are proposing and have included now in the House version of the  reckless tax-and-spending spree bill a provision that would provide tax  cuts to rich people. In fact, 80 percent of that tax cut--80 percent-- would go to people who are making more than $200,000 a year; 2.5  percent would go to people making less than $100,000 a year.   So much for looking out for the little guy in this bill.   This is a huge part of the bill. In fact, this is the most expensive  provision in the bill, and that is up against all the other spending  that the Democrats want to do on new government programs and expanding  government--the biggest expansion in government in decades.   But included now in the bill not only is that massive expansion  spending on lots of crazy new ideas and trillions of dollars in new  taxes that will be imposed upon the economy, but now there is a  provision in there that will cut taxes with 80 percent of that benefit  going to people making more than $200,000 a year, and cutting taxes on  a scale that makes this the largest, most expensive provision in the  entire reckless tax-and-spending spree bill. That is what we are  talking about with this particular provision.   So I just want to point that out because this is an evolving bill. We  are seeing new language every day, new ideas every day. And, again,  some really horrible ideas have come out in the last few weeks, some of  which have gone away simply because there aren't even any Democrats who  will vote for them; but this one, obviously, that is going to benefit  rich people across this country on a level unlike anything else in the  bill, as is suggested by the overall cost of the provision and the way  it distributes among income categories.   Let me repeat: 80 percent of the benefit of this tax cut in the tax- and-spending spree is going to go to people making more than $200,000 a  year, and 2.5 percent of this tax cut will go to people making less  than $100,000 a year.                              Childcare Benefit    Mr. President, I think a lot of times when people think about the  government paying for healthcare, childcare, college, or the like, they  tend just to assume that they are going to be able to continue on with  or get their preferred healthcare or childcare and the only difference  would be the fact that the government is now picking up the tab.   If you listen to the Democrats talk about it, that is certainly what  you would think. But the reality is a lot different, because with  government money comes government control. Government money rarely  comes without strings attached, and no more is that more obvious than  with the childcare provisions of the so-called Build Back Better tax- and-spending spree Democrats are contemplating.   To hear Democrats talk about it, you might think that the childcare  provisions amounted to nothing more than government cutting you a check  to help with your daycare costs. The reality is a lot different.   Mr. President, a 2020 Bipartisan Policy Center survey found that 53  percent of working families who used center-based childcare used a  faith-based childcare center--53 percent. Parents select faith-based  childcare for a variety of reasons. Some choose it because they share  the faith of the provider, but many choose it for other reasons, as the  Bipartisan Policy Center study made clear.   Some opt for the faith-based center because they like the quality of  the facilities and the quality of the instruction; others because they  feel that the faith-based facility will provide a safe setting, and  though they just don't share the belief system of the providers, they  do like the values that the belief system represents.   Well, for many of those families, their days of choosing faith-based  childcare may be numbered because Democrats' new childcare provisions  are deliberately set up to put faith-based childcare providers at a  disadvantage.   For starters, the language of the legislation would likely exclude  many faith-based childcare providers from participating in the program.  That means that even if you as a parent prefer to choose your local  faith-based childcare center, you may not be able to do so.   On top of that, the bill provides funding to assist with renovation  or remodeling at daycare facilities, but it specifically prevents these  funds from going to childcare centers that share space with facilities  for worship or religious instruction.   That means that the childcare program at your local Catholic church  or local Lutheran church or your local mosque will most likely not be  allowed to take advantage of the government assistance for renovations,  although the secular provider down the street will.   These policies are likely to have profound consequences. Obviously,  many parents are likely to find themselves prevented from choosing  their preferred faith-based childcare provider.   But beyond that, this legislation can start crowding faith-based  childcare providers out of the childcare market entirely. Childcare  providers unable to participate in the government childcare program may  find themselves struggling to stay in business or being forced to raise  their fees to the point that only the most well-off families can afford  faith-based care.   The result: a shrinking number of faith-based providers, which, I am  afraid, is probably some Democrats' goal.   It is hard to imagine why else they would restrict parents' ability  to choose a faith-based provider for their children or exclude  religious childcare providers from receiving government renovation  assistance.   The Democrats' legislation is representative of a growing tendency in  the Democratic Party to treat religious people as second-class  citizens--something that is completely out of step with the robust idea  of religious freedom we traditionally have in this country.   The First Amendment is not intended to keep religion out of the  public square, as many Democrats seem to think, nor was it intended to  favor secular belief systems over religious ones, no. Its purpose was  to prevent the government from establishing a national religion or  infringing on the rights of religious individuals to live out their  faith.   Today, however, it has become apparent that many Democrats think at  least some forms of government discrimination against religious people  are perfectly acceptable, and there is no question that their childcare  program would place faith-based childcare providers at a disadvantage.   Steering parents away from faith-based childcare is not the only  choice Democrats are going to be making for parents under this new  childcare benefit. Democrats' childcare program will not only make it  more difficult for parents to choose faith-based care, it will make it  more difficult for parents to choose any private childcare provider.    Under the Democrats' legislation, only public--in other words,  government-run--childcare providers will be guaranteed sufficient  reimbursement to cover their operating costs. This is a deliberate  choice that will make it much more difficult for private providers to  stay in business, serving the Democrats' goal of pushing children into  government-run childcare programs.   That is not the end of the childcare decisions Democrats will be  making. The Democrats' legislation also gives the Federal Government  full control over approving childcare curricula and performance  standards. Providers will be measured not by how well parents  [[Page S7769]]  are satisfied with the childcare they are providing, but by whatever  Washington bureaucrats determine to be appropriate measures of  performance.   I am not sure why Washington bureaucrats are better suited than  parents to identify quality childcare providers, but as the Democrat  candidate for the Governor of Virginia recently made clear, Democrats  do not seem to think that parents are best suited to make decisions for  their children.   Mr. President, I can go on. I can talk about the confusing government  bureaucracy parents will have to navigate under the Democrats' new  childcare program, or I can talk about the fact that this new childcare  benefit could drive up childcare costs for middle-class families over  the next 3 years by a staggering $13,000 a year, according to one  estimate. Yeah, $13,000 a year.   But, today, what I really want to emphasize is something Democrats  conveniently omit from discussions of their new government programs,  and that is, as I said, that with government money comes government  control. Democrats are setting the stage for a government takeover of  childcare, where you can choose your provider only as long as Democrats  agree with your choice.                                   Abortion    Mr. President, before I close, I want to mention one other aspect of  the Democratic bill, and that is the bill's commitment to taxpayer  funding of abortion.   While the Democratic Party has long supported an abortion agenda,  there has at least been bipartisan agreement when it comes to  appropriations bills that we are not going to use taxpayer dollars to  fund abortion.   For decades--decades, going back to the 1980s--the Hyde amendment and  other riders have helped prevent taxpayer dollars from paying for  abortions. No longer, if Democrats have their way.   In the Democrats' tax-and-spending spree, taxpayer funding of  abortions is the order of the day. Restrictions on the use of taxpayer  dollars for abortion funding are omitted, and in at least one case,  Democrats actively require funding of abortion and would override State  laws on insurance coverage of abortion.   Let's be very clear. This bill is a slap in the face to every  American who believes in the sanctity of human life and doesn't want  his or her tax dollars going to pay for killing unborn human beings.   You would think that if we can't agree that the human rights of  unborn children should be protected, we could at least agree that  taxpayers shouldn't be forced to pay for killing unborn children.   Well, apparently, even that is too much to ask for Democrats, even  though nearly 60 percent of Americans oppose having their tax dollars  go to abortion. That's right, almost 60 percent of Americans do not  want their tax dollars going to pay for abortions.   But that doesn't seem to matter to the Democratic Party, which is  squarely in the pocket of the radical abortion lobby. The Democrats'  legislation contains a radical commitment to government funding of  abortions against the wishes of the majority of the American people.   It is just one more reason why the Build Back Better plan is a bad  deal for the American people.   I yield the floor.

Mr. President, today I recognize my friend, Carolyn  Hofer, as she enters retirement after more than 50 years impacting the  great State of South Dakota and many of its citizens. Carolyn has  worked as an insurance agent, association program administrator, and  most recently as the executive vice president of the Independent  Insurance Agents of South Dakota, IIASD. In that capacity, she has  represented hundreds of Main Street small businesses, their employees,  and the communities that they serve. She has done a remarkable job of  piloting the association as a strong and thoughtful leader.   Carolyn grew up on a family dairy farm near Worthing, graduated from  Lennox High School, and went on to  [[Page S7787]]  graduate from Nettleton Commercial College. She entered the insurance  industry shortly thereafter and never looked back. Carolyn started with  Underwriter's Adjusting Company before moving to Pierre and working for  Dave Johnson Insurance. Following her time there, the IIASD opportunity  presented itself, and Carolyn subsequently rose through the ranks to  become the association's top employee.   Despite the many hours that Carolyn has spent serving her agent  membership and their customers, she will be the first to tell you that  she has received so much more than she has given over the years. That  is truly the heart of a servant leader.   I would also like to recognize Carolyn's husband, Doug, who also  served our great State for many years as director of the South Dakota  State Parks. Together, Carolyn and Doug have positively impacted so  many South Dakotans.   The State of South Dakota is truly proud of Carolyn Hofer and wishes  her all the best.                            ____________________
