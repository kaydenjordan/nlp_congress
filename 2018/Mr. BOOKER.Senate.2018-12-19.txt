 Thank you, Madam President.   I want to thank Senator Harris for her incredible partnership and  leadership on this bill, and I want to thank Senator Tim Scott of South  Carolina for his leadership and for the consistent examples of  character and integrity they both have shown as my partners on this  legislation in this body.   As my colleague has said, it has been a very long time coming. For  over a century, Members of Congress have attempted to pass some version  of a bill that would recognize lynching for what it is--a biased,  motivated act of terror.   Today, Senator Harris and I have requested that after a century-- after 100 years and over 200 bills introduced in this body--we finally  make lynching a Federal crime in the United States of America.   Thanks to the work of incredible people around this country--truth  tellers such as Brian Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative-- today, we have a more comprehensive understanding of just how  widespread and purposefully lynching was used as a tool of racial  terror and oppression in our history.   We know that the Equal Justice Initiative was able to document  thousands of cases--over 4,000 documented cases of racially motivated  lynchings between 1877 and 1950. During that time, lynchings were used  to terrorize communities. They weren't only vicious acts of murder  against individuals, but in many cases bodies were hung trying to drive  fear into communities to make them submit to second-class citizenship  and inconsistent justice.   The use of lynching as a larger part of terrorism is disturbing. It  is a dark chapter of our past and part of our history. Its legacy  doesn't just live in our history books. Despite activists and  organizations that have dedicated themselves to studying and addressing  the racial terror in our history, we have failed to correct for many of  those past sins.   We know that the passage of this bill will not undo the damage, the  terror, and the violence that have been done and the lives that were  brutally taken in our past. We do know that the passage of this bill,  even though it cannot reverse the irrevocable harm caused by lynching  used as terrorist oppression, is a recognition of that dark past. We  know that when wrongs are ignored they fester underneath the skin of  the body politic, and we know that justice delayed is justice denied.  Today, this is a moment of potential justice in this body, a reckoning  to the victims of lynching that for too long have been denied.   I want to go back to a point in history in this body. The very first  bill introduced by Congress to address the terror of lynching was by a  man on the other side of the Capitol, Congressman George Henry White,  in 1900. The year after it was introduced, in 1901, was the last year  he would serve in Congress. That is because Congressman White was the  very last Black Congressman of the group who had been elected to  Congress during Reconstruction.   Congressman White's departure in 1901 would be the last time an  African-American Black southerner would serve in Congress for over 70  years. Congressman White must have had an understanding of what was to  come with the long dearth of time and the lack of diversity. He knew  the terror of  [[Page S7843]]  Jim Crow laws and voter disenfranchisement that would stop the election  of African-Americans.   In his last speech in this body on January 29, 1901, 1 year after he  introduced the bill to criminalize lynching, he delivered a farewell  address he called ``The Negro's Temporary Farewell to the American  Congress.''   In that address to Congress over one century ago, he made the same  request that Senator Harris and I are making right now--for the United  States to officially criminalize lynching.   Congressman White said:         Mr. Chairman, permit me to digress for a few moments for       the purpose of calling the attention of the House to a bill       which I regard as important, introduced by me in the early       part of the first session of this Congress.        [It was intended] to give the United States control and       entire jurisdiction over all cases of lynching and death by       mob violence.        During the last session of this Congress I took occasion to       address myself in detail to this particular measure, but with       all my efforts, the bill still sweetly sleeps in the room of       the committee to which it was referred. The necessity of       legislation along this line is daily being demonstrated. The       arena of the lyncher no longer is confined to Southern       climes, but is stretching its hydra head over all parts of       the Union.    Referring to the terror of lynching, Congressman White knew that  ``the evil peculiar to America, yes, to the United States, must be met,  somehow, some day . . . ''   Well, now in this moment in America, we have a chance to make some  day today. We have the opportunity to recognize the wrongs of our  history, to honor the memories of those brutally killed, and to leave a  legacy that future generations can look back on, knowing that after 200  attempts over the course of 100 years of trying, on this day in  American history this body will do the right thing.   So I would recognize my colleague from California for the historic  calling up of this piece of legislation.    Madam President, my friend, the Senator from Oregon, just  came over. This is a very meaningful moment for this body.   There was a speech by a man that I revere. His picture hangs in my  office. His name is Martin Luther King. For many people who endured the  pain and agony of our past, with lynchings that went on up to the 1970s  in this country, and for those people who yearned for justice they  would never experience, for those people who know the pain, agony, and  hurt in their family's history and the trauma that is still felt by  many people today, who remember lynching in this country that was so  pervasive--Dr. King once spoke to those people who were hurting and  seeking justice, and he asked at the end of his speech:         How long? Not long, because ``the truth crushed to the       earth will rise again.''    He asked:         How long? Not long, because ``no lie can live forever.''    He asked:         How long? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe       is long, but it bends toward justice.    This has been a long arc, a painful history and shameful history in  this body--that at the height of lynchings across this country  affecting thousands of people, this body did not act to make it a  Federal crime. At least now, the U.S. Senate has acted--100 Senators,  no objections.   I just want to give gratitude to this body for what we have just  done. Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to give a lot of gratitude to my  colleague, Senator Coons of Delaware. He is not only with us today on  this call for a vote on a bill that was voted out of this Judiciary  Committee in a bipartisan manner, but he is also a cosponsor of this  legislation and somebody I have been proud to work with.   I want to thank my colleague Jeff Flake for putting himself so far  out there in pushing for this legislation. It is a consistent pattern  with Jeff Flake. If you know him, you might know that he and I might  disagree on a lot of policy, but he is one of the people I have looked  up to in the U.S. Senate as someone who understands the role of  Congress, the article I branch of government--that the powers of  Congress articulated by the Constitution should be seen as sacrosanct,  and that the erosion of these powers or the surrendering of these  powers to the executive undermines the very ideals of our Constitution  that our government should be one of checks and balances on power.   I have seen him step forward and lead in the manner he is showing  today. I have seen him step forward when it came to war powers and  talking about the authorization of the use of military force and speak  forcefully in a bipartisan manner with another of my colleagues, Tim  Kaine, in saying: Hey, we have to have a system of checks and balances  or the very foundations of this Republic begin to be undermined.  [[Page S7851]]    If you know his character, you know he is on the Senate floor because  of his deep belief in this Nation, not just today but for the tomorrows  to come, and that we must maintain healthy checks and balances on  Executive power and within our system of government.   I am grateful for him to come in his final hours as a U.S. Senator  still pushing this idea that there should be checks and balances,  pushing this idea that there is a bipartisan space to try to preserve  the ideals of this Republic, pushing this idea that no one--not a U.S.  Senator, not a Congressperson, not even a President--is above the laws  of this land because in the United States of America, we believe in the  rule of law.   More than this, we talk about the Framers, but every generation of  people who are in these seats in many ways are stewards of this  Republic. What I respect about my colleague from Arizona is that he  takes that seriously. Something from past Members in history who have  understood that is that you need to not only make decisions for today  but you need to plan for tomorrow. It is an axiom that I know all of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle believe: It is better to be  prepared for a crisis and not have one than have a crisis and not be  prepared.   I am one to believe that we are coming perilously close to the  precipice of our Nation having a constitutional crisis. There is an  investigation going on that is not a political attack. It is not a  witch hunt--whatever may be seen. We already have seen this  investigation through a consensus of our intelligence community that is  investigating an attack on our Nation. It is something that people from  both parties have spoken about--the importance of having an independent  investigation. It is something that an appointee of the President, Jeff  Sessions, has said we need to make sure the investigation is  independent and beyond reproach.   That investigation has already yielded many indictments. It has  yielded guilty pleas, and that investigation should be able to  continue. There are some people who say: Hey, there is no threat to  that investigation, but I am a big believer that if someone shows you  who they are or tells you who they are, believe them.   We have a President right now who is attacking this investigation-- the very legitimacy of this investigation--and he is acting like  someone who believes this investigation shouldn't be going on at all. I  believe that it may not happen, and we may not end up with a  constitutional crisis, but if one comes, we should be prepared.   How are we to be prepared? Not by some partisan radical idea, but by  a very sobered measured step that is embodied in the legislation that  we are calling for right now--to have a modest check and balance on a  President's power to end an investigation and dismiss the special  counsel. That is what this is all about. It is a modest step of  judicial review that could prevent not just a crisis that might happen  next month or next year but 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 50  years from now. It is in line with what this body has done in the past  of providing a check and balance on Executive power.   We have called yet again, for the third time, for a vote, and a third  time we have not been granted a vote on the Senate floor or granted  unanimous consent.   I am grateful to be standing with my colleagues for the third time.  My hope is that in the fashion we have seen on this floor of recent,  that we can work together to ensure we have a check and balance on  Presidential power, to ensure the ideal of this Nation of equal justice  for all, and to ensure that we can have a country where no one is above  the law.   I yield the floor.
