Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1230                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   House Resolution 495 provides for a structured rule for consideration  of H.R. 277, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act  of 2023 and provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary.   House Resolution 495 further provides for a structured rule for  consideration of H.R. 288, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act of  2023. It also provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary.   House Resolution 495 further provides for a structured rule for the  consideration of H.R. 1615, the Gas Stove Protection and Freedom Act,  and provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   This resolution further provides for a structured rule for the  consideration of H.R. 1640 and provides 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce.   Furthermore, House Resolution 495 provides for a closed rule for  consideration of H.J. Res. 44 and provides 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee  on the Judiciary.   These are five bills that may seem unrelated, but they are very  related, and they have to do with the power of Congress and the fact  that our power has atrophied considerably since the beginning of this  country. In fact, we are almost a vestigial organ of this Republic at  this point, we have ceded so much power to the executive branch, and  that is how all of these bills are related.   Three of the bills seek to repeal laws or regulations that the  administrative branch is unconstitutionally, I would argue,  promulgating.   Two of these bills get at the heart of the matter, the problem that  we have. One of them specifically is the REINS Act, which is very  important. This would rein in our power to legislate.   I don't think our Founders would recognize our form of government at  this point. They never intended for the administrators to be the  lawmakers; yet here we are.   The Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act would send  every major regulation that is suggested--and I say suggested--by the  administration back to Congress where there would have to be a positive  vote of the House and the Senate in order for that to go to the  President and then, with his signature, become law, as all laws should  do.   The other bill in this package that seeks to address the sort of  chronic problem that we have here in Congress is the Separation of  Powers Restoration Act.   It is basically a repeal of a horrible Supreme Court precedent called  the Chevron deference that says, basically, any way the administration  wants to construe one of our laws, they can get away with it.   The Supreme Court will give deference to the interpretation, no  matter how far afield from the original interpretation the law was  given from Congress.   Finally, the three bills today that deal with individual regulations,  two of them deal with gas stoves. This administration has a war on gas  stoves, depending on which person from the administration you listen  to, a rule that is being promulgated by the Consumer Product Safety  Commission and also by the Department of Energy.   There are two rules here. They would ban between 50 to 95 percent of  the gas stoves on the market for arbitrary reasons. It is not clear  that there would be any consumer benefit from banning these. In fact,  consumers would suffer from this ban.   These are the types of rules that we need the REINS Act for. They  would have a significant impact on our economy, and that is why they  should be here in front of Congress, and that is why we are seeking to  countermand them here today.   Finally, I think this is the most important rule that we are  countermanding in legislation this week, and that is the pistol brace  rule from the ATF.   We are not talking about an interpretation of a law where the EPA  says, we think we should allow this much sulfur dioxide instead of that  amount of sulfur dioxide and create a civil infraction where  corporations could be sued or punished. We are talking about criminal  penalties.   The ATF has twisted the existing statute, a law that was passed by  Congress in 1934, and has magically reinterpreted it to create tens of  millions of felons beginning on June 1.   We have a bad situation in this country right now where millions of  people have been turned into felons, law-abiding individuals who are  following the rules that were set forth by the ATF. That is why urgent  action is required on the pistol brace rule repeal here today, and that  is H.J. Res. 44.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I find it ironic that the gentleman on the other side of  the aisle is demanding to know what the power-sharing structure is here  in the House, when, in fact, he will spend the rest of his time arguing  that we should give our power to the White House, that the  administrative branch should be making law, in fact, major regulations  that have more than $100 million of impact.   I would say to the gentleman on the other side of the aisle that if  he is wondering about the power-sharing arrangement, then he should  seek to put some power here in the House, restore the power that the  Founders gave us in Article I of the Constitution.   With respect to the solution to the tragic school shootings, some  States have taken it upon themselves to allow qualified teachers and  staff to carry  [[Page H2825]]  firearms. Imagine that, the children are protected by firearms the same  way we are protected here. Why do we sit here and say, oh, we have got  to do something, when we sit behind protection and the children aren't?   I would encourage the other side of the aisle to cosponsor my bill to  change the default setting here in this country. The default setting  was set by the Gun-Free School Zone Act, which makes it illegal to even  be near a school and have a firearm, which makes it harder for States  to set policies that would save our children. All it does is make  felons of law-abiding gun owners.   I would encourage them to look at a real solution. You can ban a  pistol brace, but you are not going to stop a single mass public  shooting. Most of these mass public shootings occur with a pistol, not  a pistol with a brace on it or with a short-barreled rifle, as they  would say, or with a rifle, an assault rifle they might call it.    They can start banning these pieces of plastic, like the Biden  administration is doing, and then they can move on to banning  magazines. As the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee admitted to  me last night, he would like to ban all of the AR-15s. They could ban  handguns. Then they will get down to shotguns. The reality is you can't  stop these tragedies with a ban. You have to change the way we protect  our children.   This pistol brace rule that has been promulgated by the  administrative branch will cause--they just haven't been arrested--will  cause and has already caused tens of millions of Americans to be  felons. That happened on June 1. Time is up. You are done. You are now  a felon if you own one of these braces on your firearm.   Whether you own one or not, most Americans understand what is  happening here. Our system of lawmaking has been turned on its head.  Even more fundamental than that, people were told it was legal by the  ATF. The technical division of the ATF reviewed the prototypes of these  pistol braces in 2012 when Obama was the President.   What did Obama's ATF say to Mr. Bosco, the inventor of the pistol  brace? ``You are asking if the addition of this sample, a buffer tube  forearm brace, would convert a firearm in a manner that would cause it  to be classified as a `rifle' and thus a `firearm' regulated by the  National Firearms Act. . . . `'   ``Based on our evaluation,'' our technical department ``finds that  the submitted forearm brace, when attached to a firearm, does not  convert that weapon to be fired from the shoulder and would not alter  the classification of a pistol or other firearm.'' ``. . . Such a  firearm would not be subject to NFA controls.''   This is a letter on ATF letterhead, in fact, the Department of  Justice letterhead, dated November 26, 2012, that millions of Americans  relied on, that many entrepreneurs relied on.   Now what happens? The rug is getting pulled out from under them, but  not by the legislative branch. By the way, we could have repealed this.  The Democrats controlled both chambers. They could have passed a  legislative ban on these braces. They didn't do it. Why didn't they do  it? Maybe it is because they are accountable. They are accountable to  the people, unlike these bureaucrats. Nobody is going to lose an  election at the ATF for promulgating this rule.   The people here are scared. The people here in this Chamber are  scared to do their jobs, and the people in the Senate are scared to do  their jobs, so they would much prefer the administration do our jobs.   What have they done? What is the penalty for owning this piece of  plastic on a firearm that is connected to a pistol? I asked the ranking  member of Judiciary Committee last night in the Rules Committee  meeting. He did not know. It turns out it is a quarter of a million  dollars and 10 years in prison. Is that the appropriate sentence for  somebody who followed the law for 10 years, followed ATF guidance that  was given during the Obama administration and now doesn't even know  they are violating the law? Is 10 years and a quarter million dollars  appropriate? I don't think so. They relied on this letter.   Now, to another part of the pistol brace rule. The ranking member of  the Judiciary Committee and the ATF Director Dettelbach have both  testified incorrectly that you can comply with this pistol brace rule  from the ATF by merely separating the firearm from the brace. That is  wrong. That is not what the ATF rule says.   Why did they say this in testimony? Why did the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee say this? Why did the ATF Director say this?  Because they wanted to sound reasonable. That may seem like a  reasonable solution, but it is not the solution that the ATF has put  into law.   Again, this isn't a fine. This isn't like saying the EPA decided that  we have too much sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere so we are going to  reduce emissions and set the sulfur dioxide emissions at a different  level and you can be fined if you don't comply and you are a  corporation.   This is not a civil infraction. This is a criminal infraction that  will put millions of Americans in jeopardy of going to jail. For what,  a piece of plastic? Does it make the firearm more dangerous? No. Does  it make the firearm more concealable? No. Does it make the firearm more  deadly? No.   Then I hear from the other side of the aisle: Oh, well, we are not  banning them. Oh, we wouldn't ban them. Really? You are telling people  in the United States you have to register them as short-barreled  rifles. Guess what? That is illegal in 13 States. Thirty-six percent of  Americans live in those 13 States where you can't even comply. You  cannot legally comply with the ATF directive to register that pistol  with that brace on it as a short-barreled rifle. Compliance is  impossible if you want to keep that accessory. It is a ban. It is a de  facto ban, especially on people in those 13 States.   Here is what it is really about. They can't ban guns. They would love  to, but they can't ban them. They can't do it legislatively. The  President came into office and looked at all of the regulations and how  could he ban some guns. Well, he found this one here. How can he get  more guns registered.   By the way, it is illegal for the administrative branch to create a  registry of firearms that are in common circulation here in the United  States. That is illegal. They are not allowed to do it in the  administrative branch. What have they done with this pistol brace rule  over there that we seek to countermand? They are going to create a  registry of millions of Americans who own pistols who happen to have  this brace.   I would argue this wasn't just a way to ban guns with certain  accessories. It was a way to do something else that is not legal, not  authorized by Congress, and that is to require millions of Americans to  register.   To close out this pistol brace rule, I thank Mr. Clyde for  introducing this resolution. It is absolutely necessary. It is very  timely. I wish we had gotten it done before June 1 because now we have  got millions of felons in the United States just waiting to be  arrested; don't even know they are not in compliance. This ATF rule  will do nothing to increase safety.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as a father and a grandfather, my heart  breaks when I see the victims of these deranged killers at schools and  elsewhere. We need serious solutions.   I think it is an insult to the victims and families that banning a  piece of plastic is going to save a life--it won't--or telling them  that putting up a sign that says gun-free zone will save a life. It  won't. It will cost lives.   When one of my former staffers was married for less than a year, she  and her husband had a karaoke business, and she had a stalker who  followed them to each of their events. She got a concealed carry  license in Tennessee and carried her gun to protect herself from the  stalker. This was Nikki who worked for me.   One night, they set up their business in a bar, and the sign said  ``No Guns Inside'' because they served alcohol. Nikki left her firearm  to protect herself in the car, but her stalker did not leave his.   He came into the bar and shot her husband viciously in front of her.  She has to live with that. That is why she wants serious solutions. She  knows that gun-free zones are unserious. She knows that banning pieces  of plastic is not serious. She knows that children deserve the  protection that we have here.   We all know, if you are willing to look at the data, that in every  school that has allowed qualified teachers and staff to carry a  firearm, there has never been a school shooting. It is a fact.   We need to work on serious solutions, not unserious solutions like  banning a piece of plastic.   Mr. Speaker, going to the stove ban, which is also unserious, it is  going to cost consumers. It is going to make the products less safe,  not more safe. It is going to make them less available. It is not about  safety or efficiency or consumer benefit. It is about banning fossil  fuels. That is why this administration has declared a war on gas  stoves.   Two of the bills in this package would repeal those rules from this  administration.   Natural gas, when it is used in appliances, is 3.4 times more  affordable than electricity. Why is that? Let's think about where that  electricity comes from. A natural gas plant can burn electricity, spin  a turbine, create electricity at maybe 50 percent efficiency and then  put it on wires that are hundreds of miles long to go to a household.  Those wires may be 70 percent, 80 percent efficient.    When it gets to the household, what do you do with that energy that  came from the natural gas that is now electricity? You turn it back  into heat if you have an electric stove, which is how this  administration would want you to live.   Guess what? That is less than half as efficient. It costs 3.4 times  more to do it that way than to create electricity with natural gas and  then use the electricity at your house than if you just brought the  natural gas to the household. In fact, consumers who use natural gas in  their house save over $1,000 a year.   This is a war on the middle class and the poor. The war on gas stoves  is a war on affordable heating and cooking.   When the electricity goes out in natural disasters, whose stoves  work? The ones who have gas stoves.   Who can boil water to drink when the water is unsafe because of a  natural disaster? Those who have gas stoves.   This administration should quit gaslighting consumers by telling them  they are acting in their best interest. The Federal Interagency  Committee on Indoor Air Quality has never identified gas stoves as  contributing to asthma or respiratory illness. The Consumer Product  Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency have never  identified gas stoves as a significant contributor to adverse air  quality or as a health hazard.   Why are they doing this? It is a war on gas stoves. These two bills  would seek to reverse that. It is just common sense.   In fact, the other side of the aisle said these are messaging bills.  Guess what? Some Democrats liked the message because they voted for  these bills in the Energy and Commerce Committee. It must be a great  message. It must be a message the American people want to hear. It must  be a message that they like to hear because they know if we had the  Senate and the White House, this kind of ridiculousness would not go  on. That is why it is important to pass these two bills to protect our  gas stoves.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I wonder, since we are proposing that  children would be saved by banning a piece of plastic, has anyone on  the other side of the aisle proposed that Congressmen are safer now  that this piece of plastic is banned?   I don't think so.   Has anyone proposed that gun-free zone signs would keep us safe?   I don't think so.   What I see surrounding me here and right outside the door are people  with firearms protecting us. Our children deserve the same respect and  the same serious solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy),  who is my good friend and colleague on the Rules Committee, to speak in  favor of the rule as he did in the committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time each side  has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the other side of the aisle for pointing out  that all the ATF rule does is change the legal status, that you can  still get the brace and you can still get the pistol.   The last thing that is on a criminally deranged person's mind is:  What is the legal status of my firearm? Is this a pistol? Is this a  rifle? Is it a short-barreled rifle? How much time will I get when I go  on this suicide mission for doing this because of the legal status?   However, what changing legal status does is it creates millions of  felons out of legal firearm owners who presumed they were operating  legally.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 6,000 veterans signed a petition opposing the ATF rule,  so I hope that is enough to convince the other side.   However, I now switch to two other bills that are in this rules  package because this is Groundhog Day. We will be here again. The  administration does something which has the effect of law, and then we  are feckless to change it.   There have been over 90,000 rules promulgated since the Congressional  Review Act was put into place. Only 20 rules have ever been  countermanded because it is such a high bar to get a majority of the  House and a majority of the Senate and the President to sign something  to undo a law.   How did it become law? Just because the administrative branch willed  it into existence.   Our Constitution says: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall  be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a  Senate and a House of Representatives.''   Does it say, and also an ATF or also an EPA? No, it does not. It says  House and Senate.   Does it say, some legislative powers? No. It says, all legislative  powers are vested in Congress.   The REINS Act would do quite a bit to restore our power. Not enough,  though, because the Chevron deference still exists.   The other bill in this package is the Separation of Powers  Restoration Act, which is a legislative repeal of the tragic Chevron  deference that has plagued this country for so many years, where the  Supreme Court gives full latitude, broad authority to the  administrative branch to twist and contort the laws that we make in  creating new laws.   I urge people to vote for this rule because it includes these two  packages, which put our Republic back into a structure that our  Founding Fathers envisioned, where the legislators make the laws, and  the administration enforces the laws.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the  Record a letter to Speaker McCarthy, Ranking Member Hakeem Jeffries,  and others signed by 11 veterans and military organizations in support  of H.J. Res. 44.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   The REINS Act, which I would argue is the most important part of  these five bills, is here, and we are debating it today because my  constituent, Lloyd Rogers--who grew up in an orphanage in Kentucky,  where he met his future wife in that same orphanage--sent this idea for  this bill to his Congressman who preceded me.   Lloyd Rogers served in the Army during the Korean war. Then he came  home, and he served as a county judge executive. He was shocked when he  was trying to serve the people in his community at how many of the  rules and regulations that tied his hands were never passed by  Congress. He wrote this bill, and he sent it to his Congressman.   By the way, he and his wife were married for 65 years, and Lloyd  turned 90 on Saturday. He is watching this debate.   This is how our Republic is supposed to work. Laws aren't supposed to  come from unelected bureaucrats with no accountability. They are  supposed to be ideas that people in our communities have that would  make their lives better, and then we are accountable to them, so when  they talk to us, we have to listen. They can throw us out every 2  years. Maybe they should throw more of us out every 2 years.   Lloyd came to his Congressman and said, please, put this bill on the  floor. It went to legislative counsel. The Congressman introduced this  bill, and it has been very popular. It is one of the most popular bills  among the American people because they know the structure of our  government intended by our Founding Fathers was for us to write the  laws and for the administrative branch to execute the laws, not to  write them themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this rule, which contains five bills  that I urge the passage of.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An amendment to H. Res. 495 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 277.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Even before America declared its independence, John Adams emphasized  that a republic is a government of laws and not of men. That is what we  are here to debate tonight.   Are we a government of laws or a government of the executive branch?  Are we going to allow the executive branch to write the laws? Are we  going to turn our Constitution on its head? Have we gone too far  already? I would argue we have, and that is why we need the REINS Act,  Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny. It provides that  every major regulation that the administration seeks to promulgate has  to come to Congress first, has to be passed by concurrent majorities in  the House and the Senate and signed by the President. This is exactly  what our Founders prescribed. This is a bill about who makes the laws  in our country, and it is about reclaiming our legislative power from  the administrative state.   I think it is appropriate to read from our Constitution at this  point. Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution says: ``All legislative  powers . . . `' not some legislative powers.   ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress  of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of  Representatives.''   Does it say it shall consist of a bureaucracy? It does not. All  legislative powers are vested here and in the Senate. That is why we  need to stop letting the executive branch make law.   Are they merely tweaking regulations? Are they determining the amount  of sulfur dioxide that is acceptable to release from a power plant with  civil infractions imposed if a company doesn't comply? No, they are  making laws that put people in prison over in the administrative  branch, and we are doing nothing about it.   We have atrophied. The power of Congress has atrophied. We are almost  like ombudsmen to the executive branch now. This needs to change.   In the words of James Madison: ``The accumulation of all powers,  legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands . . . may  justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''   I am afraid that is what we have come to. Too many of our laws, civil  and criminal, are now being written by the executive branch.   Here is what the REINS Act does, and here is why it is important. If  a regulation that is passed by the executive branch or suggested by the  executive branch has more than $100 million of impact--that is a pretty  high threshold. I would argue if it has any impact, we should be  legislating it, but this is a compromise. If it has more than $100  million of impact, it has to come here if it is going to become a law.   They do not get to write the laws, and so that is why we need the  REINS Act.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

Jodey Arrington,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Arrington: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 277, the Regulations from the       Executive In Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023, so that the       measure may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.  [[Page H2866]]         I will include the exchange of these letters in the       Judiciary Committee's report to accompany this legislation       and in the Congressional Record during consideration of this       legislation on the House floor. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to       work together on matters of shared jurisdiction during this       Congress. Thank you for your attention to this matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Jim Jordan,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                         Committee on the Budget,                                       Washington, DC, May 30, 2023.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: I am writing regarding H.R. 277, the       Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS)       Act, which was ordered reported by the Committee on the       Judiciary on May 24, 2023.        The bill contains provisions that fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget. In order to       expedite House consideration of H.R. 277, the Committee on       the Budget will forgo action on this bill. This is being done       with the understanding that it does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in H.R. 277 or       similar legislation and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that the Committee may address       any remaining issues that fall within its jurisdiction. The       Committee on the Budget also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation       and requests your support of any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 277 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in your committee report and in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of H.R. 277.            Sincerely,                                             Jodey C. Arrington,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on the Budget.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                              Committee on Rules,                                       Washington, DC, May 25, 2023.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: On May 25, 2023, the Committee on the       Judiciary ordered H.R. 277, the Regulations from the       Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act of 2023, reported       to the House. As you know, the Committee on Rules was granted       an additional referral upon the bill's introduction pursuant       to the Committee's jurisdiction under rule X of the Rules of       the House of Representatives over the rules of the House and       special orders of business. The Committee has exclusive       jurisdiction over several provisions related to expedited       procedures for consideration of legislation in the House.        Because of your willingness to consult with my committee       regarding this matter, I will waive consideration of the bill       by the Committee on Rules. By agreeing to waive its       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Rules does not       waive its jurisdiction over H.R. 277. In addition, the       Committee reserves its authority to seek conferees on any       provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction       during any House-Senate conference that may be convened on       this legislation. I ask your commitment to support any       request by the Committee on Rules for conferees on H.R. 277       or related legislation.        I also request that you include our exchange of letters on       this matter in the committee report to accompany H.R. 277 and       in the Congressional Record during consideration of this       legislation on the House floor. Thank you for your attention       to these matters.            Sincerely,                                                          Tom Cole,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                       Washington, DC, May 25, 2023.      Hon. Tom Cole,      Chairman, Committee on Rules,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Cole: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 277, the Regulations from the       Executive In Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023, so that the       measure may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will include the exchange of these letters in the       Judiciary Committee's report to accompany this legislation       and in the Congressional Record during consideration of this       legislation on the House floor. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to       work together on matters of shared jurisdiction during this       Congress. Thank you for your attention to this matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Jim Jordan,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We now have had a sneak preview of what the next hour of debate is  going  [[Page H2867]]  to look like. The other side is going to argue that we need to give up  more power to the executive branch.   I think our constituents would be appalled. They sent us here and  they say we are not effective enough, yet the other side of the aisle  is going to say, oh, we need to give the power to the executive branch.   We have also heard here already tonight that this bill, which would  restore our Constitution, they say may be unconstitutional. They are  referring to a Supreme Court case that has nothing to do with this  bill, INS v. Chadha, which said you can't have a legislative veto. That  bill that they were ruling on ran afoul of the Constitution because it  didn't require passage in both Chambers and a signature by the  President.   The REINS Act requires passage in both Chambers and a signature by  the President, so their claim that it is unconstitutional is absurd  because this is what is required to restore the Constitution.   Their claim that the REINS Act is redundant because we already have  the Congressional Review Act is equally as absurd. There have been over  90,000 rules passed by the executive branch since the Congressional  Review Act was passed. Only 20 of those have been able to be repealed  by this Chamber and the Senate.   This is not a substitute for the Congressional Review Act. It is not  redundant. This is what is required. It is what is missing right now in  our constitutional structure from what our Founders intended.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming  (Ms. Hageman), who is also a member of the Subcommittee on Regulatory  Reform.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a cost estimate for  H.R. 277 prepared by the Congressional Budget Office.    AT A GLANCE, H.R. 277, REINS ACT OF 2023, AS ORDERED REPORTED BY THE             HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY ON MAY 24, 2023 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           By fiscal year, millions of                                                    dollars--                                      -----------------------------------                                          2023      2023-2028   2023-2033 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...........          a           a           a Revenues............................          a           a           a Increase or Decrease (-) in the               a           a           a  Deficit............................ Spending Subject to Appropriation             a           a           a  (Outlays).......................... ------------------------------------------------------------------------ a. CBO has no basis to estimate the budgetary effects of enacting H.R.   277.         Increases net direct spending in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2034? a.        Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2034? a.        Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? Yes.        Mandate Effects:        Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.        Contains private-sector mandate? No.        The bill would:         Require the Congress to affirmatively approve any       major rule issued by a federal agency for it to take effect         Establish special Congressional procedures and       timelines for enacting a joint resolution of approval for       major rules         Require the Government Accountability Office to       study how many rules are in effect across the federal       government and to estimate the economic cost imposed by those       rules        Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:         Changes in the number and content of major rules       that federal agencies would issue in the future        Areas of significant uncertainty include:         The number and content of major rules that federal       agencies would issue in the future, including the economic       costs and benefits of those rules         Decisions made by the Congress about whether to       approve those rules                                 Bill Summary         Under current law, a final federal rule can take effect       unless the Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval.       In contrast, H.R. 277 would require the Congress to enact a       joint resolution of approval before any major rule could take       effect. Thus, under H.R. 277, new major regulations issued by       federal agencies would depend on future legislation.                            Estimated Federal Cost         CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)       cannot determine the budgetary effect of making all future       major rules subject to Congressional approval, but we expect       that, in the absence of subsequent legislative action       affecting those rules, enacting H.R. 277 would have       significant effects on direct spending, revenues, and       spending subject to appropriation.                              Basis of Estimate         For this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will be       enacted in August 2023.                                  Background         The Congressional Review Act (CRA) of 1996 requires federal       agencies to submit final rules to the Congress and the       Comptroller General before they may take effect. Final rules       may be annulled by the Congress if a joint resolution of       disapproval is enacted into law. H.R. 277 would amend current       law to require instead that the Congress enact a joint       resolution of approval before any major rule may take effect,       thereby making implementation of major rules contingent on       future Congressional action.        The CRA defines a major rule as one that the Office of       Management and Budget finds has resulted in or is likely to       result in:         An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or       more;         A major increase in costs or prices for consumers,       individual industries, federal, state, or local government       agencies, or geographic regions; or         Significant adverse effects on competition,       employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the       ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-      based enterprises in domestic and export markets.        H.R. 277 would establish special Congressional procedures       and explicit timelines for enacting a joint resolution of       approval for major rules. Under the bill, if a joint       resolution of approval is not enacted within 70 legislative       (or session) days of the Congress receiving the major rule       and an accompanying report from a federal agency, the rule       would  [[Page H2868]]       not take effect. Further, the Congress could not reconsider a       joint resolution of approval relating to that rule in the       same Congress. However, a major rule could take effect for       one 90-calendar-day period without Congressional approval if       the President determines, via an executive order, that it was       necessary for one of four reasons: (1) to respond to an       imminent threat to health or safety, (2) to enforce criminal       laws, (3) to protect national security, or (4) to implement       an international trade agreement.        Historical data show that federal agencies published 78       major rules in 2022, and 93 major rules, on average, over the       past five fiscal years. Major rules published in recent years       include ones that established emissions standards for motor       vehicles, set Medicare payment rates, and increased the       minimum wage for federal contractors. However, looking to       recent major rules as a way to estimate the number or scope       of future major rules that would be affected by H.R. 277 may       not be a good guide to what would happen under the bill       because agencies might change the number of major rules they       issue or implement policies differently if the bill was       enacted.        Because major rules are issued to implement current law,       the budgetary effects of anticipated rules are reflected in       CBO's baseline projections. For example, annual rules       establish new payment rates for a variety of Medicare       services that reflect changes in the price indices used for       those services under current law. Those rules often result in       an increase in payment rates and thus an increase in       spending, which are incorporated in the baseline.        Under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act       of 1985 (Deficit Control Act), which governs the contents of       the baseline, actions that are contingent on future       Congressional action are generally not included in CBO's       projections. H.R. 277 would amend that Act to require that       CBO continue to assume that any planned major rule will go       into effect, unless the rule has already been issued and the       Congress has not enacted a resolution of approval within the       specified 70-day period. (Without that provision amending the       Deficit Control Act, H.R. 277 would result in baseline       projections that did not reflect the budgetary effects of       major rules.)        Under H.R. 277, CBO's baseline projections would continue       to include the budgetary effects of major rules even though       future Congressional action would be necessary to approve       them. For example, if H.R. 277 is enacted, baseline       projections would continue to reflect the assumption that       payment rates and related federal spending for Medicare       providers would rise over time, even though raising those       rates would require future Congressional action. Accordingly,       a Congressional resolution of approval for a major rule       raising such rates would be estimated as having no cost       relative to CBO's baseline projections. (CBO's subsequent       baseline projections would be updated to exclude the       budgetary effects of a proposed rule if is the Congress does       not approve it.)                               Direct Spending         To assess the budgetary effects of H.R. 277, CBO considered       the costs and savings that would be realized if anticipated       major rules do not take effect. The consequences would vary       tremendously because the budgetary effects of different rules       vary considerably.        Preventing some major rules from taking effect would result       in costs to the federal government, while preventing others       would result in savings. On net, CBO estimates that enacting       H.R. 277 would probably have a significant effect on direct       spending (more than $500,000), but we cannot determine the       magnitude or direction of those changes for any year or over       time.        Many major rules that occur routinely under current law are       related to the government's health care programs, in       particular Medicare. For example, some rules establish annual       updates to payment rates for services provided by hospitals,       skilled nursing facilities, and other Medicare providers.       Enacting H.R. 277 would freeze payment structures for those       providers at current levels pending future Congressional       actions. Similarly, payment rates (such as the annual benefit       amount for each person) under some other federal programs       might also be frozen under the bill in the absence of future       Congressional actions. CBO cannot estimate the net effect of       all such changes.                                   Revenues         Enacting H.R. 277 also would affect tax revenues, and JCT       expects that preventing regulations from going into effect       could reduce collections of revenues in some cases and       increase collections in other cases. JCT cannot determine the       sign or magnitude of the possible effects on revenues.                      Spending Subject to Appropriation         H.R. 277 also would affect programs funded through the       annual appropriation process. However, CBO cannot determine       the magnitude of such effects. For example, if major rules       issued by the Environmental Protection Agency could not take       effect, spending by the agency would decline, assuming future       appropriations were reduced accordingly.        The legislation also would require the Government       Accountability Office (GAO) to quantify the number of major       and nonmajor rules in effect as of the date of enactment, and       to estimate their total economic cost. Using information from       GAO about the cost of similar studies, CBO estimates that       completing that requirement would cost less than $500,000.                                 Uncertainty         On net, CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 277 would likely       have a significant effect on direct spending and revenues,       but we cannot determine the magnitude or direction of those       changes for any year or over time.        The budgetary effects of enacting the legislation are       highly uncertain principally because CBO cannot predict:        The number and content of major rules that federal agencies       would issue in the future,        Decisions made by the Congress about whether to approve       those rules, or        The economic costs and benefits of those rules, including       their effects on the federal budget.                         Pay-As-You-Go Considerations         The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-      reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation       affecting direct spending or revenues. Pay-as-you-go       procedures apply to H.R. 277 because enacting the legislation       would affect direct spending and revenues. However, CBO and       JCT cannot determine the magnitude or direction of those       effects.            Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits         CBO cannot determine the magnitude or direction of the       budgetary effects of H.R. 277. As a result, CBO cannot       determine whether the legislation would increase net direct       spending by more than $2.5 billion or on-budget deficits by       more than $5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-year       periods beginning in 2034.                                   Mandates         H.R. 277 would impose no intergovernmental or private-      sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform       Act. However, by requiring major rules to be approved by a       joint resolution of the Congress the bill could affect public       and private entities. Those joint resolutions could delay or       halt the implementation of major rules that could slow       reimbursements to public and private entities or change       regulatory requirements followed by those entities. CBO has       no basis for estimating the magnitude of those effects       because of the uncertainty about the number and content of       regulations affected, but the costs and savings to public and       private entities could be significant.                             Estimate Approved By                                                  Phillip L. Swagel,                             Director, Congressional Budget Office.     Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock), my good friend who serves on the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack), the sponsor of the REINS Act.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Posey), my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for  his comments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, reasonable minds may differ about certain  policies, but under the Constitution, we should all be on the same page  about who should make law. Congress should make law.   Think about some of the laws that have been promulgated by the  administrative branch, things that should have come to Congress. I got  on an airplane a few years ago, and they said that Federal law requires  that you wear a mask.   Do you know what I thought to myself? We never voted on that law. We  should have voted on whether that should be a law or not. I would have  voted ``no.''   It probably would not have passed, and if it had and our constituents  decided it was too onerous, they could appeal to us, not some  bureaucrat.   What are some other examples? The vaccine mandates that cost people  their jobs. These were not laws passed by Congress. These were from the  executive branch.   Then, tonight, we have just had two bipartisan votes to repeal  executive branch rules, one on the pistol brace and one on stoves-- bipartisan.   What does that mean? That means if they had tried to bring those as  laws through Congress as the Founders had intended, they would have  failed because there would have been bipartisan opposition to that.   We should be making the laws here. It is very simple. When unelected,  unaccountable, unrecallable bureaucrats write the laws, then the laws  become more numerous and more onerous. We should pass the REINS Act and  bring the constitutional authority back to Congress to pass  legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Van  Orden) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rose, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 277) to  amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide that major  rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect unless a  joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
