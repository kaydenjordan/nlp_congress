 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my continued support  for this legislation. A lot of hard work has gone into this legislation  over the years, and the result is an unprecedented level of consensus  from a broad coalition of stakeholders in the music industry who don't  always agree.                                time  1445    This legislation, I think, will prove to be a great benefit to music  consumers, creators, and producers alike.   The way we listen to and experience music is much different today  than it was when the Copyright Act was enacted back in 1976. As a  result, our copyright laws have become outdated and are, in many ways,  insufficient for the music industry in the 21st century. This  legislation provides much-needed updates to bring music licensing into  the digital age, particularly improving market efficiencies and  transparency to reflect the modern music marketplace.   So again, I thank the chairman, ranking member, and various sponsors  of the underlying pieces of legislation included in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for  yielding.   It is Genocide Awareness and Prevention Month, and the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) has been a leader in speaking out on this  critical issue for many years now, and we appreciate her leadership on  that.   As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have had  the opportunity to advocate for global human rights issues for many  years. Tonight, I want to condemn a genocide that has been happening  before our eyes: the genocide against the Rohingya in Rakhine State,  Burma.   Last September, the Burmese military began a so-called clearing  operation, allegedly in response to some insurgent attacks. In reality,  this was just an excuse for a massive and barbaric campaign to forcibly  remove the Rohingya from Burma altogether and erase their memory from  the Rakhine State once and for all, resulting in over 700,000 Rohingya,  many of whom are children, fleeing Burma for Bangladesh. This has  needlessly left Bangladesh and the world with one of the worst  humanitarian crises that the world faces today.   While these numbers are truly shocking, as we learn more about the  crimes committed by the Burmese military, there can be no doubt that  this is, in fact, genocide.   When the Rohingya arrived in Bangladesh, they told story after story  of the crimes that they had witnessed and that they had personally  suffered: widespread killings, mass graves, rapes, and other  unspeakable horrors and injuries. These atrocities have been confirmed  by many people who had no ax to grind here or anything, So this is  something that the world must see and must believe.   In addition, hundreds of villages have been burned and others have  been simply bulldozed in a clear attempt to prevent the Rohingya from  ever returning. Together, these heinous acts are a deliberate attempt  to irreparably harm the Rohingya. This is absolutely genocide.   Together with Mr. Engel and Mr. Crowley, our colleagues here in the  House, I have helped to lead the House's efforts to address this  crisis. With our passage of H. Con. Res 90, the House unequivocally  condemned the Burmese military's atrocious actions, but more serious  action is still needed.   Burma's constitution allows the Burmese military to control much of  the government, and civilian leadership has taken virtually no real  steps to address this violence. That is why I joined again with Mr.  Engel and Mr. Crowley to introduce the BURMA Act, which applies tough,  targeted sanctions on the individuals involved in leading this  genocide. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and then,  ultimately, of course, to vote for it when the time comes.   As we remember the victims of all genocides this month, we must work  to adequately address one which is unfolding right before our eyes,  right before the world's eyes right now. So, again, I want to thank the  gentlewoman from Missouri for calling this particular action to the  attention of our colleagues and the attention of the world, but also  other genocides and other atrocities that have occurred across the  globe. She is truly a leader, and we are lucky to have her doing that  in Congress on an everyday basis, but also, in particular, this  evening.
