 Mr. President, today it is with great pleasure that I  honor a dedicated Army noncommissioned officer, legislative liaison,  and public servant. I wish to recognize SGM Tyrone C. Marshall for 2  years of exemplary service with the Senate Liaison Division and  congratulate him on his selection to serve in the Pentagon as an  operations sergeant major with the Office of the Chief of Public  Affairs.   On this occasion, I recognize Sergeant Major Marshall's distinguished  25-year career spent serving the American people, whether here in the  Halls of Congress or with his boots on the ground. A native of Ashbury  Park, NJ, and a fourth-generation soldier, he enlisted in the Army in  1998, serving first as an administrative specialist for 7 years before  transitioning to public affairs in 2005. Sergeant Major Marshall  deployed to Iraq twice, serving first in 2005 with the 25th Infantry  Division public affairs, Task Force Lightning, and later with Task  Force Wings as Brigade PAO for 25th Combat Aviation Brigade in 2008.   In 2011, Sergeant Major Marshall began his first tour at the Pentagon  as the senior public affairs NCO for the Defense Media Activity's Armed  Forces Press Service, Pentagon Bureau, later designated DoD News. In  this role, he served as the sole military adviser to a 20-person  civilian news team supporting the Office of the Secretary of Defense  and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His service in this capacity  demonstrates his steadfast commitment to the defense of the United  States, whether on the ground or over the airwaves.   In 2015, Sergeant Major Marshall returned to the line as a platoon  sergeant at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, CA. He then  returned to the Pentagon as Public Affairs and media adviser to the  15th and 16th Sergeants Major of the Army and as an operations NCO.   In 2020, Sergeant Major Marshall arrived on Capitol Hill to serve as  a defense fellow for Representative Elise  [[Page S5895]]  Stefanik of New York before his selection as a legislative liaison in  the Senate Liaison Division. In each of these positions, his primary  responsibility was to help continue and strengthen Army relationships  across both Chambers of Congress. Over the past 2 years, Sergeant Major  Marshall has done just that: He has been an indispensable resource and  representative of the Army and traveled all over the world facilitating  congressional and staff delegations.   He will now continue his distinguished Army career, once again  returning to the Pentagon as an operations sergeant major. He will  assume responsibility for his new position later this December.   I am personally thankful for his shared wisdom, service, and  sacrifice. I am grateful to him for the help he provided my staff and  me to better serve our Georgia Army families and communities. And on  behalf of the U.S. Senate, I thank SGM Tyrone C. Marshall for his time  here in the Senate as a legislative liaison and wish him, his wife  Tammy, and his children Kya, Kaden, Tre'Yon, Elijah, and Tyrone all the  best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to commend an extraordinary  Georgian for her lifetime of service to the State of Georgia and to our  entire country.   This month, Ms. Kim Riggins will retire as a congressional liaison in  the Atlanta VA Regional Office's Congressional Unit, where she works to  ensure Georgia's veterans and their families can access the benefits  they have earned, and to coordinate that work with Georgia's  congressional offices.   In 1979, Ms. Riggins enlisted in U.S. Navy, and she served on Active  Duty from October 1979 until October 1983. While stationed at Fort  Myers, VA, she met and married Charles Riggins, a soldier, in 1983. The  couple had two sons, Charles Jr., an educator, and Terron, Active-Duty  Army. Both are married and captains in the National Guard and Active  Army, respectively.   Upon her discharge from Active Duty, Ms. Riggins joined the Navy  Reserves and remained in the Reserves until 1994. In June 1994, Charles  and Kim Riggins moved to Georgia. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, she  was recalled to Active Duty and served from February 2002 until October  2003.   Ms. Riggins retired from the U.S. Naval Reserves in 2005, and in May  2008, she graduated magna cum laude from Clayton State University,  earning a bachelor's degree in accounting with a minor in finance.   She began working at the Atlanta VA in August 2009 and was hired  under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--ARRA--of 2009 as a  veterans service representative, VSR. Ms. Riggins was part of the pre- development team from 2009 to 2012, where she was selected by the  veterans service center Manager--VSCM--to be detailed to congressionals  on the public contact team, where she has been serving Georgia's  veterans for the past 11 years.   For her lifetime of service to our Nation in the U.S. Navy, the U.S.  Navy Reserves, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, I commend  Kim Riggins and congratulate her and her entire family on her  retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to commend a Savannah, GA,  nonprofit organization working to support our children and schools.  Founded in 2008 by Molly Lieberman, Loop it Up Savannah is a nonprofit  community art program that began as a children's knitting and crochet  class at the West Broad Street YMCA. Since then, it has grown into a  community-wide program, helping bring art forms to children and adults  across Chatham County and the Savannah area.   Partnering with schools, community centers, museums, and local  businesses, Ms. Lieberman and Loop It Up Savannah work to provide  creative art experiences and connect resources to children and families  throughout Savannah. Loop It Up Savannah's programming includes visual  and performing arts, early literacy programming, school garden  projects, yoga and mindfulness-based practice, and STEAM Programming  throughout Savannah and Chatham County. These events, programs, and  workshops help build strong relationships, greater academic successes,  and a more connected community.   I commend Molly Lieberman and the entire Loop it Up Savannah team for  their work in the Savannah community and their commitment to our  children.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to commend Sun Park, the  26th president of the Korean American Chamber of Commerce GA-ATL, for  his exceptional leadership and commitment to the Korean American  business community in Georgia.   This weekend, the Korean American Chamber of Commerce GA-ATL  inaugurated its 27th president and celebrated Mr. Park's service. Mr.  Park immigrated to the United States from the Republic of Korea in 2004  and started a small business in Duluth, GA. In January 2022, Mr. Park  was sworn in as the 26th president of the Korean American Chamber of  Commerce GA-ATL. Under Mr. Park's leadership, the chamber has  flourished and continues to be a beacon of innovation and  collaboration.   Mr. Park has been instrumental in supporting Korean American small  business owners, and he has worked to deepen cooperation and ties with  other  [[Page S5896]]  communities in metro Atlanta. Under Mr. Park's presidency, the chamber  has successfully hosted expos every March and October, which have been  vital in serving Korean companies, providing essential resources, and  connecting them to U.S.-based buyers. This initiative has played a  crucial role in helping Korean companies establish and thrive in the  U.S. market.   I commend Mr. Sun Park for his leadership and service to Georgia's  Korean American community as the 26th president of the Korean American  Chamber of Commerce GA-ATL.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to commend Marine Corps  Logistics Base Albany for receiving the Commander in Chief's Annual  Award for Installation Excellence in June 2023.
