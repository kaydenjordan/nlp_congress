 Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the comments  made by my colleague from North Carolina. It is even more meaningful to  me because all during the time the regulations were coming on, I  happened to be the one who was chairing the Environment and Public  Works Committee, and we knew what was going to happen.   I am almost speechless when I think about the success. We went 20  years only taking up 1 CRA, and then we end up passing 14 of them--all  but 1. That is a huge, successful record. My colleagues understand,  this gives us the opportunity for people who are answerable to the  public--people who are elected and have to stand for elections--to have  a part in what is sometimes considered to be the action of an unelected  bureaucrat.   We have had great opportunities here. I think the ``midnight''  regulations--a term that is used quite often--so that a party going out  of office, such as President Obama, being very liberal--a very proud  liberal, I might add--wanted to get as many of his rules in at the last  minute. We were able to come in and pass these in the time required. We  were able to pass 14 of these, in addition to the other regulations and  other methods of doing regulations, which I want to address a little  bit. It is just not something that we really anticipated would happen.   Now, I am particularly proud because mine was the first CRA to be  passed in 20 years, and that was the very first one that came from what  President Obama wanted having to do with the oil and gas industry, but  the fact that nothing passed in that long period of time just shows now  that people are recognizing that we who stand for election should be  involved in this process of doing away with these regulations.   Now, the rule that I brought to the floor, which was the first one  the President signed--we had a great signing ceremony and I enjoyed it  very much--was the one that affected the oil and gas industry. It was  an SEC ruling of the Obama administration that said that if you are a  domestic producer of oil and gas--of course, that is the private  sector--you have to release all of the information you are using in  producing a bid against maybe another country. To use an example, in  China, it is not in the private sector like it is in the United States.  Their oil and gas business is in the public sector so they would have a  distinct advantage. Quite frankly, it is consistent with what the  previous President--President Obama--was doing in his war on fossil  fuels. Fossil fuels are coal, oil, and gas, and he was very proud to be  opposed to coal, oil, and gas, and frankly nuclear too.   I have often wondered--I go back to Oklahoma virtually every weekend  that I don't have to be in one of the war zones or someplace like that.  I go there really for my therapy because they ask questions that make  sense. We don't get these questions in Washington. One of them I  remember was in Shattuck, OK. When I was there, somebody said: Explain  this to me. We have a President who wants to do away with fossil fuels  and he wants to do away with nuclear energy. Now, we are dependent upon  fossil fuels, coal, oil and gas, and nuclear energy for 89 percent of  the power it takes to run this machine called America. If he is  successful in doing away with it, how do we run this machine called  America?   Well, I am proud to say that the war against fossil fuels is over.  The particular CRA I sponsored came out of the Dodd-Frank Act.   By the way, overregulation is overregulation. When I talk to people  back in my State of Oklahoma, if they are in  [[Page S2896]]  the banking business or the financial services business, they are  concerned about the overregulation that comes from Dodd-Frank. If they  are farmers, they are concerned about the regulation that would take  the jurisdiction of regulating our water resources out of the States  and putting it in the Federal Government. So that is what this is all  about.   So I will tell you how serious this was. The CRA that I had was so  significant that the Federal courts came in, in July of 2013, and said  that the SEC made several errors in rushing this regulation through.  They actually vacated the rule. That was a major accomplishment. I was  very proud that I had the courts on my side, for a change.   Anyway, the SEC finalized the second rule under the authority of  Dodd-Frank, section 1504, by making some--without any really  substantial changes. Nonetheless, this is the one that he first signed.   So thanks to the Congressional Review Act, oil and gas companies are  not at a disadvantage when they are competing with State-owned oil and  gas companies such as we have in China.   We passed other critical CRAs because regulations tied the hands of  our businesses and took local control away from the States. A lot of  people in America--and I think a higher percentage of my people in  Oklahoma--are really concerned about Second Amendment rights. Of  course, we had one of the regulations that went through--in fact,  Second Amendment rights, when we talk about the farmers and the  ranchers and not just from my State of Oklahoma--we are a farm State-- but throughout America, they will tell you that there are problems.  Their No. 1 concern was--and I asked the Farm Bureau representative. He  said the greatest problem facing farmers is not anything that is found  in the ag bill, it is the overregulation by the EPA and specifically  what they call the WOTUS bill. The WOTUS bill, which is the one I just  mentioned, would take the jurisdiction away from the State and give it  to the Federal Government.   I have to say this. When you talk about ``liberals,'' that is not a  negative term. It is a reality. It is how much power should be in the  hands of the Federal bureaucrats as opposed to individuals and the  States. So we have a lot of these regulations. One of the things the  CRA has done is, it has taken away an excuse that people will use--I am  talking about people in this Chamber who are legitimately liberals and  believe we should have more control in Washington--it takes the power  away from the Federal bureaucrats because what they can do is go ahead  and pass the regulations. Then you go back home and when people are  yelling and screaming about being overregulated back in their home  States, they say: Don't blame me, blame the unelected bureaucrats. A  CRA takes away that excuse because it forces them to actually get on  record.   So as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public  Works, we were involved with more of these regulations than any other  committee because that is what we do for a living there. So I was very  happy to see all of the successes we had.   Let me just mention because I don't think it has been mentioned  before--and I will submit this for the Record. There are two ways of  doing away with these regulations, and one is through Executive orders.  I think everybody knows that. But they don't realize what has already  been done. I think we have had a total of 30, 31 regulations that have  been done away with either through Executive orders or through the  Congressional Review Act. Some of the Executive orders, for example,  are the WOTUS, the one we have been talking about; clean energy,  something which repeals the Clean Power Plan and something which  officially ended the war on fossil fuels, I might add; the Executive  order on rebuilding the military; the Executive order on the Keystone  and Dakota Access Pipelines--we are all familiar with that and the  ongoing debate.    Some of the CRAs really aren't talked about too much, and we are  talking about regulations that came from the Obama administration that  now have been done away with through use of CRAs--the educational rule  mandating Federal standards for evaluating teacher performance; the  educational rule establishing a national school board, with an effort  to get away from local control of the schools; the Interior rule that  blocked Alaska from controlling their own hunting and fishing in that  beautiful State; the Social Security rule that put seniors on a gun ban  list--Second Amendment rights.   All of these things are very significant, and I am very proud, quite  frankly, of this body. With the exception of one, we passed all 14 of  the CRAs, and I can't think of any time that has been done in the past.  So it is a great thing. It did put the power back in the hands of the  people who are elected here, and I am very glad to have been a  participant in that.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete list of the  Congressional Review Act resolutions passed and the Trump Executive  actions be printed in the Record.
