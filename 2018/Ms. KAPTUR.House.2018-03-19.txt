 Mr. Speaker, our law enforcement and intelligence  community--most notably, the FBI--is sustaining an unprecedented,  coordinated attack led by the President of the United States. No one is  above the law in our country, including the President.   FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a 20-year veteran of the FBI, is the  latest to fall to this concentrated effort to undermine Special Counsel  Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's entanglements  with Russia during the 2016 Presidential election.   Incidentally, former FBI Director Mueller has served our Nation for  36 years: as a soldier in the U.S. Navy with a Purple Heart; as a U.S.  attorney; and also as FBI Director, including after 9/11 when he  oversaw the transformation of the FBI from a domestic law enforcement  agency into a global counterterrorism and counterintelligence agency.  Wow.   This administration is making every effort to degrade our Federal law  enforcement institutions and, even more insidiously, by a negative  media campaign to erode public faith in these institutions. Let truth  will out.
