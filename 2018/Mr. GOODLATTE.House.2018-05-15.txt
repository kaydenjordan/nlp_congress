 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 613) to amend title 18, United States Code, to require that  the Director of the Bureau of Prisons ensure that each chief executive  officer of a Federal penal or correctional institution provides a  secure storage area located outside of the secure perimeter of the  Federal penal or correctional institution for firearms carried by  certain employees of the Bureau of Prisons, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 613         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati       Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 (Public       Law 108-277; 118 Stat. 865) gives certain law enforcement       officers, including certain correctional officers of the       Bureau of Prisons, the right to carry a concealed firearm in       all 50 States for self-protection;        (2) the purpose of that Act is to allow certain law       enforcement officers to protect themselves while off duty;        (3) correctional officers of the Bureau of Prisons have       been the targets of assaults and murders while off duty; and        (4) while that Act allows certain law enforcement officers       to protect themselves off duty, the Director of the Bureau of       Prisons allows correctional officers of the Bureau of Prisons       to securely store personal firearms at only 31 Federal penal       and correctional institutions while at work.       SEC. 3. SECURE FIREARMS STORAGE.         (a) In General.--Chapter 303 of title 18, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``Sec. 4050. Secure firearms storage         ``(a) Definitions.--In this section--        ``(1) the term `employee' means a qualified law enforcement       officer employed by the Bureau of Prisons; and        ``(2) the terms `firearm' and `qualified law enforcement       officer' have the meanings given those terms under section       926B.        ``(b) Secure Firearms Storage.--The Director of the Bureau       of Prisons shall ensure that each chief executive officer of       a Federal penal or correctional institution--        ``(1)(A) provides a secure storage area located outside of       the secure perimeter of the institution for employees to       store firearms; or        ``(B) allows employees to store firearms in a vehicle       lockbox approved by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons;       and        ``(2) notwithstanding any other provision of law (including       regulations), allows employees to carry concealed firearms on       the premises outside of the secure perimeter of the       institution.''.        (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of       sections for chapter 303 of title 18, United States Code, is       amended by adding at the end the following:  ``4050. Secure firearms storage.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 613, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in 2004 Congress passed and President Bush signed into  law the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, LEOSA. LEOSA allows  certain law enforcement officers, including correctional officers of  the Bureau of Prisons, the right to carry a concealed firearm  throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and all other U.S. territories for self- defense and the defense of others. LEOSA also allows law enforcement  officers to carry their firearms while off duty.   These laws help keep citizens safe, but there is still room for  improvement. For example, the Bureau of Prisons does not permit its  correctional officers to safely store their personal firearms in a  secure locker at its facilities, and employees are otherwise prohibited  from storing them in their personal vehicles while parked on Bureau of  Prisons property. This leaves correctional workers vulnerable to attack  during their commutes to and from work.   Sadly, an attack on a correctional officer while commuting to or from  a prison is not a hypothetical situation. On the evening of February  26, 2013, Bureau of Prisons Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati was ambushed  and murdered while on his way home from work.   According to court documents, the shooting was a hit ordered by  Federal inmates housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Guaynabo,  Puerto Rico. Authorities believe that Lieutenant Albarati's murder was  a direct result of his work at the prison; specifically, in retaliation  for his investigations into cell phone smuggling at the MDC and the  seizure of contraband.   Lieutenant Albarati was ambushed during his drive home, shot 16  times, and died at the scene. He was 39 years old.   On January 28, 2015, a Federal grand jury in the District of Puerto  Rico returned a six-count indictment charging nine individuals for the  murder of Lieutenant Albarati. In January of 2016, Federal prosecutors  notified the district court of their intention to seek the death  penalty. Trial preparation is ongoing in that case.   Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Albarati's family has yet to receive justice  for this senseless, despicable act, but we, as a legislative body, can  do our best to ensure this never happens again. To that end, H.R. 613  makes a commonsense amendment to Federal law to address the problem  highlighted by this tragedy.   This bipartisan bill, cosponsored by 54 of our colleagues, would  direct the Bureau of Prisons to provide a secure storage area located  outside the secure perimeter of each Bureau of Prisons facility where  correctional officers will be able to store their personal firearms and  allow employees to store firearms  [[Page H3941]]  in a vehicle lockbox approved by the Bureau of Prisons.   This is important, reasonable legislation. With its passage, the  House honors the life of a brave man who served his community  faithfully and one day made the ultimate sacrifice.   I want to thank the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) for  introducing this legislation. I also want to thank Lieutenant  Albarati's widow, Helen, who is here with us today in the gallery, for  her tireless efforts to ensure her husband's death was not in vain.   We salute you and we thank you.   Mr. Speaker, as we begin the 2018 Police Week, I urge my colleagues  to support this bill. Let us do our best to protect those who protect  us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), the chief sponsor of  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, the chairman does not have any additional  speakers. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is very fitting, as we begin Police Week,  that we pass this important piece of legislation that makes it very  clear that our sworn officers, who keep people safe but risk their own  lives and work in our Bureau of Prisons, have the opportunity to have a  firearm when they are traveling to and from work.   It is not practical the way the current rules work. This law is  vitally needed to help save lives. I know that Mrs. Albarati is here to  see that that happens, and I commend her. I admire her courage, and we  should not allow her husband's life to be lost in vain. Let's pass this  legislation and make sure it doesn't happen to others in the future. I  urge my colleagues to vote for the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 285) expressing the sense of the United States  House of Representatives that Congress and the President should empower  the creation of police and community alliances designed to enhance and  improve communication and collaboration between members of the law  enforcement community and the public they serve.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 285         Whereas the United States of America was founded upon the       principles of republican governance which include, but are       not limited to, an adherence to the rule of law;        Whereas the American law enforcement community embodies       society's most salient defenders of the rule of law;        Whereas the ability of the American law enforcement       community to effectively preserve the rights of American       citizens and uphold the rule of law is predicated upon a       healthy and collaborative relationship between police       officers and the communities they serve;        Whereas police and community relations have recently       experienced periods of strain, where mistrust and suspicion       have come to dominate police and community interactions in       many communities and undermine effective policing strategies       and public safety;        Whereas the legitimate concerns of citizens as well as       those of the law enforcement community are not always well       understood by each respective constituency; and        Whereas an open, constructive, and mutually respectful       dialogue meant to address  [[Page H3943]]       these legitimate concerns can dramatically improve police and       community relations, improve public safety, and engage all of       society's stakeholders: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that Congress and the President should       empower the creation of police and community alliances       designed to enhance and improve communication and       collaboration between members of the law enforcement       community and the public they serve.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H. Res. 285, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am pleased the House is considering this resolution today, which  highlights the critical need to strengthen relationships between police  departments and the communities they serve.   This resolution, cosponsored by the gentleman from the great  Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. Taylor), expresses the sense of the  United States House of Representatives that Congress and the President  should empower the creation of police and community alliances designed  to enhance and improve communication and collaboration between members  of the law enforcement community and the public.   Over the past several years, our country has witnessed the tension  between certain police departments and communities come to a head. We  have seen communities grieve over the loss of young men killed in  police shootings.   At the same time, we have seen a concerning spike in ambush attacks  on police officers. We have heard complaints from communities about not  being able to trust the police. We have also heard complaints from  police that certain communities will not help the police in  investigating the violent crimes that plague those very communities.                                time  1615    To address this strain and divide, in July 2016, the Judiciary  Committee established the bipartisan Policing Strategies Working Group.  This group has held several roundtables and traveled around the country  to speak to police departments and community leaders. Our objective is  to examine police accountability, aggregation towards law enforcement,  and public safety concerns. Our work to highlight and address these  issues is ongoing.   H. Res. 285 continues this progress by publicly supporting the  creation of community-police alliances so that perhaps one day we can  come to a point where there is no divide between the police and the  communities they serve, no longer a sense of profound mistrust, no  longer any sort of us versus them mentality.   When it comes to protecting and serving the community, there  shouldn't be sides. We hope for a day when everyone can realize that  police departments and community leaders seek the same goals: peace,  prosperity, and safety. We hope that this resolution and our continued  work on the Policing Strategies Working Group and the Judiciary  Committee helps to continue the progress the country is making.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Taylor for introducing this resolution, and  I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Taylor), the chief  sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I do not have any additional speakers and  am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good resolution. I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4854) to amend the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of  2000 to provide additional resources to State and local prosecutors,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4854         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Served Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. PROSECUTION OF DNA COLD CASES.         (a) Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program.--Section 2 of       the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (34 U.S.C.       40701) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by adding at the end the following:        ``(9) To increase the capacity of State and local       prosecution offices to address the backlog of violent crime       cases in which suspects have been identified through DNA       evidence.''; and        (2) in subsection (c), by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) Allocation of grant awards for prosecutors.--For each       fiscal year, not less than 5 percent, but not more than 7       percent, of the grant amounts distributed under paragraph (1)       shall, if sufficient applications to justify such amounts are       received by the Attorney General, be awarded for purposes       described in subsection (a)(9), provided that none of the       funds required to be distributed under this paragraph shall       decrease or otherwise limit the availability of funds       required to be awarded to States or units of local government       under paragraph (3).''.        (b) Prosecution of Cold Cases.--Of the amounts made       available to the Attorney General for a DNA Analysis and       capacity enhancement program and for other local, State, and       Federal forensic activities for the purpose described in       section 2 of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000       (34 U.S.C. 40701) under the heading ``state and local law       enforcement assistance'' under the heading ``Office of       Justice Programs'' under the heading ``DEPARTMENT OF       JUSTICE'' in fiscal years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, not       less than 5 percent, but not more than 7 percent, of such       amounts shall be provided for grants for prosecutors to       increase the capacity of State and local prosecution offices       to address cold cases involving violent crime, where suspects       have been identified through DNA evidence.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4854, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4854, the Justice  Served Act of 2018, introduced by the gentleman from Texas, Judge  Carter.   All of us in this body are familiar with Debbie Smith and the tragedy  of her attack and the triumph of the law that bears her name. Many of  us have had the pleasure of meeting Debbie and her husband, Rob, and  hearing her story firsthand.   The Debbie Smith Act was the Nation's first piece of legislation  aimed at ending the DNA backlog that plagued our State crime labs.   The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program was created in 2004, and  [[Page H3946]]  since then it has enabled States to process more than 725,000 cases and  upload more than 327,000 DNA profiles into the FBI's Combined DNA Index  System, or CODIS. I had the honor to be the chief sponsor of the Debbie  Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014.   When Judge Carter reached out to me about this bill, I was  encouraged, but I also wanted to know how Debbie Smith felt about it. I  learned that not only did she support it, she and others helped craft  it.   When we reached out to Debbie and Rob to get their thoughts on the  bill, they stated, ``getting hits doesn't mean as much if we cannot  prosecute.'' I agree with Debbie and Judge Carter on this very  important point.   The bill in front of us today makes a very small but important change  to the Debbie Smith Act. That small change will increase the capacity  of prosecutors to address the backlog of violent crime cases involving  suspects identified through DNA evidence. This bill will allow victims  of crime and their families to receive justice by giving prosecutors  the tools they need to investigate, solve, and close cold cases.   That small, but vitally important, change is why the Justice Served  Act of 2018 is endorsed by the National District Attorneys Association;  Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network; Debbie Smith; Major County  Sheriffs of America; Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;  Sergeants Benevolent Association; the Fraternal Order of Police; the  National Association of Police Organizations; Consortium of Forensic  Science Organizations; Joyful Heart Association; the National Alliance  to End Sexual Violence; the Major Cities Chiefs; and the National  Criminal Justice Association.   We in this body should join these organizations in supporting this  very important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Texas, Judge  Carter, for introducing this legislation and all of his hard work in  supporting it.   To paraphrase Debbie and Rob, getting a hit is nice, but ensuring  justice is served is better.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in supporting the Justice Served Act of  2018.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, to paraphrase what Debbie and Rob Smith said, getting a  hit is nice, but ensuring justice is served is even better. And it is,  I think, a good amendment to the Debbie Smith Act that we allow these  funds to be used for this purpose and close more of these cases that  are solved by the DNA testing that was the original purpose of the  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, I thank Judge  Carter for his fine work on it, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
