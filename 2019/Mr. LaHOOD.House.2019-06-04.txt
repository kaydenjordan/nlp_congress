 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This legislation will  help the most vulnerable human beings in our society, and I ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if this unanimous consent cannot be  entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to immediately  schedule the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, so we can  stand up and protect the sanctity of human life, and I would ask all  others to join in that request.
