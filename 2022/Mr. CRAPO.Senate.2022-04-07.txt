 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Reserving my right to object, let me begin by saying my  friends and colleagues across the aisle are right about one thing: Gas  prices are incredibly higher right now in this country.   The effort to blame this on what has happened in Ukraine, however,  overlooks the real cause of the phenomenal rise in gas prices that we  have seen for a year before Putin even invaded. Definitely, the  invasion did increase pressure on gas prices, but the problem is that  this administration's policies have dramatically reduced the supply in  the United States and Americans across this country know how supply and  demand impacts price.   The gas tax holiday that is now being proposed is not a solution; it  is a political gimmick that would not stop skyrocketing gas prices or  inflation. In fact, Larry Summers said in a Wall Street Journal  podcast:         I think a gas tax idea is saved only by its triviality from       being one of the worst public policy ideas of the decade. It       will have little effect over any reasonable horizon on gas       prices. It will be counterproductive from an environmental       point of view. It is the ultimate policy gimmick.    Rather than accept responsibility for 14 months of reckless spending  or the more than 40-percent increase in gas prices that had already  occurred before the Russian invasion, Democrats want to blame higher  gas prices on the Russian invasion or corporate greed. They also want  to ignore the consequences of their relentless attacks on the American  oil and gas industry, the administration's overly bureaucratic permit  and regulatory process for domestic energy production, and the  misguided policy decisions like canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline.   The solution to rising gas prices is not a tax holiday, which would  offer little relief but threaten infrastructure investments and worsen  our national debt situation; nor is the solution a tax on American  companies who increase their production of oil and gas to try to help  us become more energy independent; nor is it stimulus checks, which  have the potential, as the past ones have, to increase gas prices even  further and push inflation even higher; nor is it to encourage other  hostile regimes to produce more oil.   The only lasting solution to our current problems is to bolster  American oil and gas production to replace not only Russian imports but  to facilitate exports to support our allies and end their dependence on  Russia. Indeed, I, along with a number of my Republican colleagues,  have sponsored proposals to enhance energy independence and undo many  of President Biden's misguided energy policies.   Republicans believe we can and should be doing more to unleash  America's domestic energy potential, reduce reliance on volatile  foreign actors like Russia, and deliver cost savings to middle-class  families across the country. Hard-working American families need real  relief, not political gimmicks, and that is why I oppose this gas tax  holiday.   I urge my Democratic colleagues to abandon the reckless spending-and- tax policies that have already failed but which seem to be contemplated  in the President's newly reintroduced budget and support proposals that  will actually lower prices for everyday Americans. For those reasons, I  object.    Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim  Risch and Representative  Mike Simpson, we congratulate Idaho-connected  athletes Jake Adicoff, Dani Aravich, Jesse Keefe, and Josh Sweeney for  their hard work and dedication in representing the United States at the  2022 Winter Paralympic Games. We also congratulate Sam Wood, Jake  Adicoff's friend and guide, on his important role in helping to earn  three medals.   Jake Adicoff, of Sun Valley, with Sam Wood, earned three medals in  Nordic skiing. They were instrumental in earning a gold medal in cross- country skiing for the U.S. 4x2.5-kilometer mixed relay team. They also  earned two silver medals: one in long-distance cross-country skiing and  one in sprint cross-country skiing. These were the third Paralympic  games for Jake Adicoff, who also won a silver medal in the 2018 Winter  Paralympic Games. Jake, now a four-time Paralympic medalist, graduated  from Wood River High School before Bowdoin College and earned three  medals in cross-country skiing in the 2021 World Championships: gold in  middle-distance, silver in sprint, and bronze in long-distance.   Boise native Dani Aravich competed in Nordic skiing in her second  Paralympics. She finished eighth in the sprint cross-country, ninth in  the middle-distance cross-country, 11th in the middle-distance  biathlon, and 13th in the sprint biathlon. Dani graduated from Bishop  Kelly High School in Boise, where she competed in cross-country running  and track and field, and later she competed in these events at Butler  University.   In his Paralympics debut, Jesse Keefe, of Bellevue, competed in  multiple Alpine skiing events. He placed ninth in the slalom, 15th in  the super combined and giant slalom, and 22nd in downhill. Jesse, an  avid outdoorsman who started skiing at age 2 and won his first race at  age 3, placed first in the 2021 U.S. National Championships in the  giant slalom and slalom and placed third in the super-g.   Retired U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Josh Sweeney, who received a Purple  Heart for his service in Afghanistan, competed in Nordic skiing in his  second Paralympics. He earned 16th in the long-distance cross-country,  19th in the sprint cross-country, and 24th in the middle-distance  cross-country. Josh Sweeney is originally from Arizona and currently a  Boise resident. He also earned a gold medal in the Paralympic Winter  Games Sochi 2014 on the U.S. sled hockey team. From 2010-2013, he  played on the San Antonio Rampage, a club sled hockey team made up  entirely of injured military athletes, and he played on the Dallas  Stars club team in 2012, helping the Stars earn the 2012 USA Hockey  Sled Classic title.   These athletes have pushed themselves remarkably far to compete in  their respective events. Their examples of strength and triumph serve  to inspire fellow Americans and people around the world. As we share in  congratulating them on their achievements, we are reminded of the  remarkable work it has taken each of them to reach their goals.                            ____________________
