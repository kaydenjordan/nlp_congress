 Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Johnson amendment.  This measure would force continued payment of government contractors to  build an ill-conceived border wall.   Most of these funds were never intended for this purpose. More than  $10 billion was redirected from the Department of Defense, and these  funds were intended for military installations and functions such as  schools for military  [[Page S5800]]  children and National Guard equipment.   The Biden administration is conducting a comprehensive review of  these contracts, led by the Department of Defense and Homeland  Security. DHS has recently announced that they will continue work on  certain commonsense projects on the southern border to address life,  safety, environmental, and operational considerations. These decisions  will be guided by what is best for our national security, not well- connected government contractors profiting off of hard-earned taxpayer  dollars.   We need to move forward with smart, bipartisan investments that  secure both our southern and our northern borders, and we must not look  backward at the former administration's boondoggle.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Johnson amendment.    Madam President, we all agree that responding to natural  disasters is a core Federal responsibility. But, unfortunately, this  unprecedented amendment would take funds from the Federal  Communications Commission's spectrum auction revenues to pay for  disaster relief.   The spectrum auction revenues my colleagues seeks to reallocate are  intended to help expand high-speed internet in the United States. All  Americans, no matter where they live, should have access to the 21st  century economy.   We can't pick winners and losers when it comes to natural disasters.  The process should be set in law, which is something my colleague from  Hawaii, Senator Schatz, has been working on for years.   I support disaster relief, but this is not the way to do it.   My heart goes out to all Americans impacted by natural disasters, not  just those affected by hurricanes but also devastating wildfires and  flooding caused by climate change. I am committed to ensuring they  receive the assistance they need, but we need a comprehensive solution.   I would like to yield time to my colleague from Maine.    Mr. President, I rise to urge adoption of the Peters- Rounds amendment, No. 2464.   I first want to thank Chairman Manchin and Ranking Member Barrasso of  the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for working with me on this  amendment. I would also like to thank Senators Rounds, Portman, and  Warner for joining me in offering this amendment.   It is very straightforward. It simply would align several cyber  security provisions for the Department of Energy in this infrastructure  legislation with existing law. It would require the Department of  Energy, the sector risk management Agency for the energy sector, to  coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security on cyber security  efforts.   DHS is the lead Federal Agency for cyber security, and they have a  central role to play in working across the government to strengthen our  cyber defenses. As we have seen from the damaging SolarWinds and  Microsoft Exchange attacks, a whole-of-government approach is necessary  to protect critical infrastructure.   This amendment will ensure that there is a comprehensive approach  that effectively coordinates our cyber security protections for  critical infrastructure across all sectors. It reduces duplication of  efforts and helps protect our Nation from the persistent threat posed  by cyber attacks.   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this straightforward,  bipartisan amendment.    Mr. President, I yield back all remaining time.    I would ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
