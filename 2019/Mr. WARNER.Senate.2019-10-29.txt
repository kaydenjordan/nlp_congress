 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am going to speak on another matter in  just a moment, but I want to thank my friend the Senator from  Louisiana.   There are a number of subjects that are debated on this floor that I  may know a little bit about, may not know much at all about, but on the  subject he was just addressing, the question of spectrum and the  challenges and the threats around 5G--I can still claim this--I am  proud of the fact that I spent a longer time in business than I have in  politics. My whole career was spent in the business of mobile  communications, wireless communications. I spent the last 3 or 4 years  on the Intelligence Committee in a bipartisan way looking at both the  challenge and the opportunity in 5G, and let me assure you that some of  the items the Senator from Louisiana has raised in terms of the  security threats that will be posed if we end up with the wrong vendor  in 5G are an enormous problem.   I don't always agree with this President. On this item, he is right.  My hope is that he will stick to his guns and not trade that away in a  trade negotiation with China.   I also know that getting spectrum aligned the right way has been one  of our challenges because other nations have been able to, frankly, in  Asia and elsewhere, align spectrum better, so the underpinnings are  better positioned than we are. So how we do this is 100 percent right.   Let me also say that whether it is Louisiana or Virginia, one of the  issues I hear the most--I am not talking far world; I am talking small  towns and midsize cities in Virginia, and I am sure the same is the  case in Louisiana--the issue is--Democrat, Republican, and  Independent--when am I going to get broadband in an accessible way?   If we don't make sure that we think this through on spectrum and  recognize the national security implications and also recognize that if  we roll out 5G and leave, in my State, 18 percent of the population  behind who doesn't even have broadband, their ability to compete in the  21st century is going to be dramatically undermined.   So I hope I will have a chance to visit with my friend the Senator  from Louisiana and see if we might be able to work together on some of  these issues.   For a while, at least before the FCC auctioned off that spectrum, it  was left in other hands, and suffice it to say that I know how much  that spectrum is worth.   I thank my friend the Senator from Louisiana for his comments.                            ____________________     Madam President, I will turn to a different matter.   I move to proceed to Calendar No. 278, S.J. Res. 52.    Madam President, I know of no further debate.    I yield the floor.    Madam President, first of all, I have done this a number  of times. I know you care. I know my colleague from Pennsylvania cares,  but nobody has kept this issue alive more often and more consistently  than Joe Manchin from West Virginia.   I am only going to take a minute or two, then I have to step off. I  appreciate our leader on this issue giving me a little time.   In a few minutes, he will point out that last night, we had another  coal company go bankrupt, Murray Energy. That potentially leaves 70,000  folks without a pension.   In Virginia, we have about 7,000 miners who are dependent upon UMWA  funds for their healthcare retirements. Another company, Westmoreland  Coal, has already gone bankrupt as well, where literally folks are  weeks away from losing their benefits.   The truth is, this issue may not affect everybody across the country,  but the people it does affect, it affects in a way that oftentimes  undermines widows and pensioners--their very ability to maintain their  livelihoods.   Our country made a commitment back in 1947 to honor miners, and we  would stand by that work. We are now going to be put to the test. My  hope would be that this Miners' Act amendment would be included in the  appropriations bill. I will do everything I can in my power to urge my  colleagues to consider it.   Again, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I will turn it back to  the Senator from West Virginia, but I also want to again acknowledge  the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has also been a leader on this.  Let's make sure we commit to get this done.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Craig  Radcliffe, counsel on my staff, be permitted floor privileges for the  remainder of the day.
