 Mr. President, we are in the middle of a historically  important debate here in Washington. Republicans have hatched a  partisan proposal behind closed doors that would shovel a trillion  dollars in tax giveaways to giant corporations and the wealthy while  undermining the healthcare and raising taxes for millions of middle- class families. If it passes, it could affect the lives of every single  American for an entire generation.   Now, last night, the people of Alabama elected a new Senator to  represent them here in Washington. So now Republicans who control the  Senate face a choice. Will they allow Senator-elect Doug Jones to take  his seat among his colleagues before a final vote on their tax plan?   We actually know something about that kind of choice in my home State  of Massachusetts. On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts elected a new  Senator to represent them here in Washington. The result was just as  shocking to Democrats as last night's result was to Republicans. It  also came when we were in the middle of another historically important  policy debate here in Washington--healthcare. A lot of people thought  Democrats should ram through the final version of their bill in  Congress before Brown could be seated.   Now, I could stand here and read you quote after quote after quote  from Republicans, who now control the Senate, talking about how unfair  that would be, how corrupt that would be, and how anti-democratic that  would be. I could go on and on about how today's Senate majority  leader, Mitch McConnell, said this would be gamesmanship, but I am  going to talk about what Democrats actually did.   Democrats rejected the idea of ramming through the bill before Brown  could take his seat in the Senate. Almost immediately, Jim Webb, a  Democratic Senator from Virginia, called for a suspension of any  healthcare vote until after Brown arrived. The day after the  Massachusetts election, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said  publicly: ``We're going to wait until the new Senator arrives until we  do anything more on health care.''   Massachusetts Democratic Senator John Kerry held a joint press  conference with Republican Scott Brown that same week, where he said:         Seating Scott Brown as expeditiously as possible is       important. We want to respect the election results. And       nobody wants to delay this process.    President Obama, whose entire healthcare agenda was on the line, said  this:         Here's one thing I know and I just want to make sure that       this is off the table: The Senate certainly shouldn't try to       jam anything through until Scott Brown is seated. People in       Massachusetts spoke. He's got to be part of that process.    Now, this wasn't an easy decision. Waiting for Brown slowed down the  adoption of healthcare for 2 additional months. More importantly, it  meant Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority and, as a  consequence, the final bill couldn't achieve nearly as much as  Democrats had hoped for, but we did it anyway.   We did it because democracy matters, even when it means it might slow  down a President's agenda. Democracy matters, even when a Senate seat  held for decades by a liberal lion is taken over by a  conservative. Democracy matters, especially when it is inconvenient.    If we are honest, we know that there hasn't been a lot of democracy  around this tax bill. This is a bill that was written and rewritten in  the dead of night, behind closed doors. It is filled with errors and  unintended consequences. It is animated by a rotten  [[Page S7987]]  wealth transfer from millions of hard-working Americans to a handful of  corporations and billionaires.   But up until now, we have at least respected the principle that each  State gets to pick its Senators, and those Senators get to vote for or  against the final product. This afternoon, we are being told that  Republicans have a final tax deal. Nobody has seen it, but we could be  voting on it in the next couple of days. There is no reason to ram  through that kind of massive restructuring of our economic system  before Alabama gets its new Senator unless Republicans are concerned  that their deal won't withstand a couple of more weeks of public  scrutiny.   The election of Doug Jones will not change which party controls the  Senate. The election of Doug Jones will not give him or Democrats the  power to block the tax bill or any other piece of legislation, but it  will respect the people of Alabama and their choice. It should happen  before any more tax votes take place in the Senate.
