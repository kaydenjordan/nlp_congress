 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy  and his leadership on this issue. I agree with his comments earlier.   The notion that somehow this is a wild, Democratic, socialist  spending spree and we need to raise the debt ceiling to deal with it is  patently false. I just note that there was $5 trillion that was spent  recently in the end of the Trump administration and recently here  dealing with the COVID crisis.   Much of that spending was passed on a bipartisan basis. It wasn't  wild socialist spending. These are funds that the American people  desperately needed.   The dismissive comment about cash for kids--give me a break. Being  able to provide 69 million American children with monthly payments has  resulted in lifting almost half of poor children out of poverty, and it  is wildly popular by the American public. This is not reckless. This is  reasonable. It is more necessary now than ever.   I do hope we are able to move forward with the broad outline of  programs moving forward for infrastructure, the environment, and  fighting the climate crisis. In the meantime, we must and we will meet  our obligations to pay for money that the Congress has already spent.   Now, I see my colleague Brendan Boyle here who has an idea to stop  the lunacy of the debt ceiling charade for a long-term solution. But  unless and until we do that, we need to meet our obligations and be  able to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, and I  hope we do that in a more honest basis.
