 Mr. Speaker, June is National Dairy Month, an  opportunity to honor the contributions of dairy farmers throughout the  country.   I am proud to represent our Nation's largest dairy district and the  hardworking men and women in the Central Valley who work tirelessly to  provide our Nation with milk, cheese, ice cream, and all the other  dairy products we enjoy.   There are over 30,000 dairy farms across the United States, and many  of those are farmer-owned and operated. As a lifelong dairy farmer, I  know firsthand the impact that these burdensome government regulations  have on day-to-day operations of these family farms and businesses.   We need to reduce the regulatory burdens on our domestic agriculture  producers and incentivize more production here at home. Supporting  American agriculture and our dairy industry will bring food costs down  and provide stability to our global food supply.   Thank you to our dairy farmers and manufacturers in the Central  Valley and across the country for their contributions to our community.  Happy Dairy Month.                            ____________________
