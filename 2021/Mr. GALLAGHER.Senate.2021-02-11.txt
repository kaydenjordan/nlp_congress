 If we don't think other countries around the       world are watching this happen right now, if we don't think       the Chinese Communist Party is sitting back and laughing,       then we're deluding ourselves. So call it off, Mr. President.       We need you to call this off.    Russia has also seized on this violent attack against our government,  decrying that democracy is ``over.'' The chairman of the Russian upper  house of Parliament's International Affairs Committee said:         The celebration of democracy is over. This is, alas,       actually the bottom. I say this without a hint of gloating.       America is no longer charting the course, and therefore has       lost all its rights to set it. And especially to impose it on       others.    They are using President Trump's incitement of an insurrection to  declare that democracy is over.   In Iran, the Supreme Leader is using President Trump's incitement of  an insurrection to mock America. He said of the situation in the United  States:         This is their democracy and human rights, this is their       election scandal, these are their values. These values are       being mocked by the whole world. Even their friends are       laughing at them.    These statements are serious and pervasive. According to a joint  threat assessment bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security,  the FBI, and eight other law enforcement entities, ``Since the incident  at the U.S. Capitol on 6 January, Russian, Iranian, and Chinese  influence actors have seized the opportunity to amplify narratives in  furtherance of their policy interest amid the presidential  transition.''   We cannot let them use what happened on January 6 to define us, who  we are, and what we stand for. We get to define ourselves by how we  respond to the attack of January 6.   Some might be tempted to say and point out that our adversaries are  always going to be critical of the United States. But following the  insurrection on January 6, even our allies are speaking up. Canadian  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said:         What we witnessed was an assault on democracy by violent       rioters, incited by the current president and other       politicians. As shocking, deeply disturbing and frankly       saddening as that event remains--we have also seen this week       that democracy is resilient in America, our closest ally and       neighbor.    The German Foreign Minister said:         This closing of ranks begins with holding those accountable       who are responsible for such escalations. That includes the       violent rioters and also includes their instigators.    The world is watching and wondering whether we are who we say we are  because when other countries have known chaos, our Constitution has  helped keep order in America. This is why we have a Constitution. We  must stand up for the rule of law because the rule of law doesn't just  stand up by itself.   After the insurrection, my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, the chairman and the ranking member, issued a bipartisan  statement that said:         America has always been a beacon of freedom to the world;       proof that free and fair elections are achievable, and that       democracy works. But what happened at the Capitol today has       scarred our reputation and has damaged our standing in the       world.        Today's violence--an inevitable result when leaders in       positions of power misled the public--will certainly empower       dictators and damage struggling democracies.    And that is true. For generations, the United States has been a North  Star in the world for freedom, democracy, and human rights because  America is not only a nation for many, it is also an idea. It is the  light that gives hope to people struggling for democracy in autocratic  regimes, the light that inspires people fighting across the world for  fundamental human rights, and the light that inspires us to believe in  something larger than ourselves.   This trial is an opportunity to respond and to send a message back to  the world.   I say this as somebody who loves my country, our country, just as all  of you do. There is a lot of courage in this room, a lot of courage  that has been demonstrated in the lives of the people in this room.  Some folks have stood up for the civil rights of fellow Americans and  risked their careers and their reputations, their livelihoods and their  safety in standing up for civil rights. Many Members of Congress have  risked their lives in service to our country, in uniform: in fighting  in the jungles of Vietnam, in patrolling the mountains of Afghanistan.  You served our country because you were willing to sacrifice to defend  our Nation as we know it and as the world knows it. Although most of  you have traded in your uniforms for public service, your country needs  you one more time.   The world watched President Trump tell his big lie. The world watched  his supporters come to Washington at his invitation, and the world  watched as he told his supporters to march here to the Capitol.  President Trump, our Commander in Chief at the time, failed to take any  action to defend us as he utterly failed in his duty to preserve,  protect, and defend. Now the world is watching us, wondering whether  our constitutional Republic is going to respond the way it should, the  way it is supposed to--whether the rule of law will prevail over mob  rule. The answer to that question has consequences far beyond our own  borders. Think of the consequences to our diplomats and negotiators as  they sit at tables around the world to enforce our agenda on trade, the  economy, and human rights.   To fail to convict a President of the United States who incited a  deadly insurrection, who acted in concert with a violent mob, who  interfered with the certification of the electoral college votes, who  abdicated his duty as Commander in Chief, would be to forfeit the power  of our example as a North Star for freedom, democracy, human rights,  and most of all, the rule of law. To convict Donald Trump would mean  that America stands for the rule of law no matter who violates it. Let  us show the world that January 6 was not America, and let us remind the  world that we are truly their North Star.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Representative Neguse and I will now address the  First Amendment argument that is being offered by President Trump's  lawyers to try to excuse his incitement to this insurrection. Mr.  Neguse will begin.   Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, good  afternoon.   You have heard over the course of the last several days that  President Trump incited an insurrection, but, as Lead Manager Raskin  mentioned, as we prepare to close, we would be remiss if we didn't just  briefly address, apparently, the principal defense the President will  offer to excuse his conduct, and that is this notion that he can't be  held accountable for what happened on January 6 because his actions are  somehow protected by the First Amendment.   Now, let's stop for a moment and try to really understand the  argument they are making. According to President Trump, everything he  did--everything we showed you that he did--was perfectly OK for him to  do and for a future President to do again, and the Constitution,  apparently, in their view, forbids you from doing anything to stop it.  That can't be right. It can't be, and it isn't right.   Their argument is meant as a distraction. They are concerned not with  the facts that actually occurred, the facts that we have proven, but  with an alternative set of facts where President Trump did nothing but  deliver a controversial speech at a rally. Of course, that is not what  we have charged in the Article of Impeachment, and it is not what  happened.  [[Page S659]]    You will hear from my colleague Lead Manager Raskin of the many  myriad reasons why this argument that they make is wrong on the law  completely, not just around the edges. They make major, fundamental  mistakes of constitutional law, the kind that Lead Manager Raskin tells  me wouldn't cut it in his first-year law course, which, of course, he  certainly would know, as he has taught this subject for decades.   That explains why so many lawyers who have dedicated their lives to  protecting free speech, including many of the Nation's most prominent  conservative free speech lawyers, have described President Trump's  First Amendment claims as ``legally frivolous.'' Here is another quote  from a recent letter from prominent free speech lawyers:         The First Amendment is no bar to the Senate convicting       former President Trump and disqualifying him from holding       future office.    Their argument is wrong on the facts, wrong on the law, and would  flip the Constitution upside down.   Let's start with the facts because, as you will see, his free speech  claim depends on an account of what he did, of why we are here, that  has no basis in the evidence. To hear his lawyers tell it, he was just  some guy at a rally, expressing unpopular opinions. They would have you  believe that this whole impeachment is because he said things that one  may disagree with. Really?   Make no mistake, they will do anything to avoid talking about the  facts of this case. That, I can assure you. Instead, we expect they  will talk about a lot of other speeches, including some given by  Democratic officials, and they will insist, with indignation, that the  First Amendment protects all of this as though it were exactly the  same.   We trust you to know the difference because you have seen the  evidence that we have seen. You have seen, as we have proven over the  last 3 days, that his arguments completely misdescribe the reality of  what happened on January 6. They leave out everything that matters  about why we are here and what he did.   President Trump wasn't just some guy with political opinions who  showed up at a rally on January 6 and delivered controversial remarks.  He was th President of the United States, and he had spent months-- months--using the unique power of that office, of his bully pulpit, to  spread that big lie that the election had been stolen; to convince his  followers to stop the steal; to assemble just blocks away from here on  January 6 at the very moment that we were meeting to count the  electoral college votes, where he knew--where it had been widely  reported--that they were primed and eager and ready for violence at his  signal. Then, standing in the middle of that explosive situation, in  that powder keg that he had created over the course of months, before a  crowd filled with people who were poised for violence at his signal, he  struck a match, and he aimed it straight at this building, at us.    You have seen all of that evidence. There is no denying it. That is  why the House impeached him. That is why he is on trial. No President,  no matter the politics or the politics of the followers--conservative,  liberal, or anything else--can do what President Trump did because this  isn't about politics; it is about his refusal to accept the outcome of  the election and his decision to incite an insurrection. There is no  serious argument that the First Amendment protects that, and it would  be extraordinarily dangerous for the United States Senate to conclude  otherwise, to tell future Presidents that they can do exactly what  President Trump did and get away with it, to set the precedent that  this is acceptable, that now this is a constitutionally protected way  to respond to losing an election.   You will notice something that Lead Manager Raskin and I noticed,  which is that, by all accounts, it doesn't appear that President  Trump's lawyers disagree. I mean, they don't insist that if the facts  we have charged, the facts that we have proven, the facts supported by  overwhelming evidence are true, as, of course, you now know they are,  that there is nothing you can do. They are not arguing that it is OK  for a person to incite a mob to violence--at least I don't think they  are arguing that. Instead, what they are doing is offering a radically  different version of what happened that day, totally inconsistent with  the evidence. Then they insist that if that fictional version of  events, if that alternate reality were true, well then he may be  protected by the First Amendment.   That is their argument, but you are here to adjudicate real evidence,  real facts, not hypothetical ones, and for that reason alone, you  should reject their argument because it has been advanced to defend a  situation that bears no resemblance to the actual facts of this case.   With that, I want to turn it over to my colleague Lead Manager Raskin  to address the many legal flaws, as I mentioned, in President Trump's  position.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. Neguse has explained why President Trump's  last-ditch First Amendment argument has got nothing to do with the  actual facts of the case. He has been impeached for inciting a violent  insurrection against the government. Inciting a violent insurrection is  not protected by free speech. There is no First Amendment defense to  impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors. The idea itself is  absurd.   The whole First Amendment smokescreen is a completely irrelevant  distraction from the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors governing  a President who has violated his oath of office. Yet President Trump,  we know, has a good way of treating up as down and wrong as right. He  tried to pull off the biggest election fraud in American history by  overturning the results of the 2020 election even as he insisted that  his own fraud was, in fact, an effort to stop the steal, to stop a  fraud--a vast conspiracy that he blamed on local and State officials of  both political parties, the media, election officials, the judiciary-- Federal, State--and Members of Congress. Anybody who wouldn't go along  with him was part of the conspiracy.   He violated his oath of office by inciting mob violence to prevent  Congress from counting electoral college votes as we were assigned to  do by the 12th Amendment and the Electoral Count Act. He even attacked  Vice President Pence at a rally for violating his oath of office and  going along with an egregious assault on democracy.   Now he argues that the Congress is violating his free speech rights  when it was Donald Trump who incited an insurrection as an attack  against us, that halted speech and debate on the floor of the House and  Senate during the peaceful transfer of power, and that imperiled the  very constitutional order that protects freedom of speech in the first  place along with all of our other fundamental rights.   As a matter of law, it is a matter of logic. President Trump's brazen  attempt to invoke the First Amendment now won't hold up in any way.   The basic flaw, of course, is that it completely ignores the fact  that he was the President of the United States--a public official. He  swears an oath as President that nobody else swears. In exchange, he is  given greater powers than anyone else in the entire country--maybe on  Earth. He or she promises to preserve, protect, and defend the  Constitution of the United States and our government institutions and  our people.   And, as we all know, the power we entrust to people in public office,  in government office--especially, our Presidents--comes with special  obligations to uphold the laws and the integrity of our Republic, and  we all support that.   Now, what if a President publicly--say a President publicly and on a  daily basis advocated replacing the Constitution with a totalitarian  form of government and urged States to secede from the Union and swore  an oath of loyalty to a foreign leader or a foreign government.   Well, as a private citizen, you couldn't do anything about people  using those words to advocate totalitarianism, to advocate secession  from the Union, to swear an oath of personal loyalty to a foreign  leader or foreign government or country. You couldn't. That is totally  protected. If you tried to prosecute somebody for that, as a  prosecutor, you would lose.   But it is simply inconceivable, unthinkable that a President could do  any of these things--get up and swear an oath to foreign governments or  leaders, advocate totalitarianism, advocate secession, and not be  impeached  [[Page S660]]  for it. It is just unthinkable that that could happen.   Would that violate their First Amendment rights?   The opposite view pressed here by President Trump's counsel would  leave the Nation powerless to respond to a President who would use his  unmatched power, privilege, and prestige of his or her office--the  famous bully pulpit--in ways that risk the ruin of the Republic, all  for his or her own ambition and corruption and lust for power.   Everyone should be clear: There is nothing remotely exotic about what  we are saying. It should be common sense to everybody--common sense-- about this understanding of the First Amendment as it applies to public  servants--cops, firefighters, teachers, everybody across the land.   My daughter, who I mentioned early in the trial, she is a teacher in  a public school. The courts have said teachers teach, but if they go  off script and they start advocating totalitarianism, treason, or what  have you, they are not living up to the duties of their office as  teacher. They can be fired.   Everybody knows that, and it happens all the time, by the way,  including to cops and firefighters and people on the frontlines. It  happens all the time. In fact, it happened countless times to people  fired by President Trump for their statements or ideas about things,  including on election fraud, not long ago. There are people in the  government who lost their jobs because the President didn't like what  they said or what they wrote.   Now, as I mentioned yesterday--and I can't help but repeat it-- Justice Scalia got it exactly right on this. He wrote on these cases  about how the First Amendment affects people who take on a public  office, who take on public employment, and he summed it up like this.  He said:         You can't ride with the cops but root for the robbers.        You can't ride with the cops but root for the robbers.    That is what Justice Scalia said, and when it comes to the peaceful  transfer of power, to the rule of law, to respecting election outcomes,  our President, whoever he or she is, must choose the side of the  Constitution--must--and not the side of the insurrection or the coup or  anybody who is coming against us.   And if he or she chooses the wrong side, I am sorry, there is nothing  in this First Amendment or anywhere else in the Constitution that can  excuse your betrayal of your oath of office. It is not a free speech  question.   But there is more. Let's play make-believe and pretend that President  Trump was just a run-of-the-mill private citizen--as my colleague Mr.  Neguse said, just another guy at the rally--who is just expressing a  deeply unpopular opinion, because we shouldn't overlook the fact that,  while there were thousands of people in that violent mob, they  represent a tiny, tiny, tiny part of less than 1 percent of the  population, and the vast majority of the American people reject the  kind of seditious mob violence that we saw on January 6.   But let's say that he was just another guy in the crowd that day. It  is a bedrock principle that nobody--nobody--can incite a riot. The  First Amendment doesn't protect it.   Key case? Brandenburg v. Ohio. There is no First amendment protection  for speech directed to inciting and producing imminent lawless action  and likely to produce such action.   And for all the reasons you have heard, based on the voluminous,  comprehensive, totally unrefuted--and we think irrefutable, but we are  eager to hear our colleagues--based on all the evidence you have heard,  and for all the reasons you have heard, that definition of proscribable  speech fits President Trump's conduct perfectly. This is a classic case  of incitement.   And you don't have to take my word for it. The 144 free speech  lawyers, which Mr. Neguse mentioned, who include many of the Nation's  most dedicated, most uncompromising free speech advocates--unlike Mr.  Trump, of course--but these people agree that there is a powerful case  for conviction under the Brandenburg standard, even if the President of  the United States were just to be treated like some guy in the crowd.  And they add:         The First Amendment is no defense to the article of       impeachment leveled against the former President . . .    And I mention the Brandenburg standard not because it applies here.  Of course, it doesn't. This is an impeachment. It is not a criminal  trial, and there is no risk of jail time. Let's be clear about that.  The President doesn't go to jail for 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour, or 1 minute  based on impeachment and conviction and disqualification from further  office.   Rather, I mention it to emphasize that absolutely nobody in America  would be protected by the First Amendment if they did all the things  that Donald Trump did. Nobody made Donald Trump run for President and  swear an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution on  January 20, 2017. But when he did, by virtue of swearing that oath and  entering this high office, he took upon himself a duty to affirm and  take care that our laws would be faithfully execute under his  leadership--all of the laws, the laws against Federal destruction of  property, all of the laws. We expected him in everything he said and  everything he did to protect and preserve and defend our constitutional  system, including the separation of powers. But, instead, he betrayed  us, and as Representative Cheney said, it was the greatest betrayal of  a Presidential oath in the history of the United States of America--the  greatest.    As I mentioned yesterday, President Trump is not even close to the  proverbial citizen who falsely shouts ``fire'' in a crowded theater. He  is like the now proverbial municipal fire chief who incites a mob to go  set the theater on fire, and not only refuses to put out the fire but  encourages the mob to keep going as the blaze spreads.   We would hold that fire chief accountable. We would forbid him from  that job ever again, and that is exactly what must happen here.   There are hundreds of millions of citizens who can be President.  Donald Trump has disqualified himself, and you must disqualify him too.   Just like the fire chief who sends the mob, President Trump perverted  his office by attacking the very Constitution he was sworn to uphold.  In fact, that is one reason why this free speech rhetoric at this trial  is so insidious. His conduct represented the most devastating and  dangerous assault by a government official on our Constitution,  including the First Amendment, in living memory. We wouldn't have free  speech or any of the rights if we didn't have the rule of law and  peaceful transfer of power and a democracy where the outcome of the  election is accepted by the candidate who lost. We had it all the way  up until 2020.   And the central purposes of the First Amendment are democratic self- government and civic truth seeking--two purposes that President Trump  sought to undermine, not advance, in the course of his conduct as we  have definitively demonstrated at this trial.   The violence he incited threatened all of our freedoms. It threatened  the very constitutional order that protects free speech, due process,  religious free exercise, the right to vote, equal protection, and the  many other fundamental rights that we all treasure and cherish as  citizens of the United States.   The First Amendment does not create some superpower immunity from  impeachment for a President who attacks the Constitution in word, in  deed, while rejecting the outcome of an election he happened to lose.   If anything, President Trump's conduct was an assault on the First  Amendment and equal protection rights that millions of Americans  exercised when they voted last year, often under extraordinarily  difficult and arduous circumstances.   Remember, the First Amendment protects the right of the people to  speak about the great issues of our day, to debate during elections,  and then to participate in politics by selecting the people who will be  our leaders.   And remember, in American democracy those of us who aspire and attain  the public office are nothing but the servants of the people--nothing.  Not the masters of the people--we have no kings here. We have no czars.   Here, the people govern, President Ford said--the people.   The most important words of the Constitution are the first three-- ``We the People.''  [[Page S661]]    But all this--all this--means little if a President who dislikes the  election results can incite violence to try to replace and usurp the  will of the people as expressed in the States, ignore the judicial  branch of government, and then run over the legislative branch of  government with a mob.   President Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors sought to nullify the  political rights and sovereignty of the American people--our right as a  people to deliberate, to form opinions, to persuade each other to vote,  and then to decide who our President will be--the sovereignty of the  people. That is an attack on the First Amendment, I would say.   In addition, President Trump's actions were a direct attack on our  own freedom of speech here in the Capitol.   Members of Congress are sent here to speak for their constituents.  That is why we have our own little ``mini free speech'' clause--the  speech and debate clause. That is literally our job when we come here  and represent the views of our people.   The attack that President Trump incited forced Members of Congress to  stop speaking and to literally flee for our lives and the lives of our  staffs and our families. The man whose statements and actions halted  the speech in Congress--speech related to the peaceful transfer of  power--has no right, no right, to claim that free speech principles  prevent this body from exercising its constitutional power to hold him  accountable for his offense against us.   You know, Voltaire said famously, and our Founders knew it:         I may disagree with everything you say, but I will defend       with my life your right to say it.    President Trump says: Because I disagree with everything you say, I  will overturn your popular election and incite insurrection against the  government.   And we might take a moment to consider another Voltaire insight,  which a high school teacher of mine told me when her student asked:  When was the beginning of the Enlightenment?   And she said: I think it was when Voltaire said:         Anyone who can make you believe absurdities, can make you       commit atrocities.    There is no merit whatsoever to any of the free speech rhetoric--the  empty free speech rhetoric--you may hear from President Trump's  lawyers. He attacked the First Amendment. He attacked the Constitution.  He betrayed his oath of office. Presidents don't have any right to do  that. It is forbidden so that our Republic may survive. The people are  far more important than that.   The precedent he asks you to create, which would allow any future  President to do precisely what he did, is self-evidently dangerous, and  so there can be no doubt--none at all--that the President lacks any  First Amendment excuse or defense or immunity. He incited a violent  insurrection against our government. He must be convicted.   And now I am going to call up Representative Dean, who will explain  why, contrary to the President's claims, the House provided him with  all the process that was due to him.   I am sorry. Mr. Lieu is going to do that.   Mr. Manager LIEU. Thank you for your time and your attention.   We all heard President Trump's attorneys on Tuesday, and as part of  President Trump's efforts to avoid talking about his own conduct, to  avoid talking about anything related to this constitutional crime, we  expect that President Trump will raise due process objections.   His due process claims are without merit. Under the Constitution, the  House has ``the sole Power of Impeachment.'' That provision confirms  that the House functions as a grand jury or a prosecutor. The House  decides whether to bring charges.   Now, on other impeachment cases, the House can provide certain  deliberative and procedural privileges to the person being impeached,  but those are exactly that--privileges. They are discretionary. The  House has the power to decide its own rules, how it wants to pass the  Article of Impeachment, and in this case, the House debated the Article  of Impeachment and passed it on a bipartisan vote.   I am a former prosecutor. I just want to add that I have had  opportunities to decide whether to bring charges, and when you see a  crime committed in plain view, prosecutors don't have to spend months  investigating before they bring charges. I know that in this case, in  fact, hundreds of people have been arrested and charged by prosecutors  for the violence on January 6. There was no reason for the House to  wait to impeach the man at the very top that incited the violence.   I would also like to emphasize that the House had good reason to move  quickly. This was an exigent circumstance. This was not a case where  there was hidden conduct or some conspiracy that required months and  maybe years of investigation.   This case has not raised very complicated legal issues. The gravity  of the President's conduct demanded the clearest of responses from the  legislature, particularly given that the President was still in office  at the time the House approved this Article and rumors of further  violence echoed around the country. They still do.   There must be absolutely no doubt that Congress will act decisively  against a President who incites violence against us. That is why the  House moved quickly here, and President Trump, who created that  emergency, cannot be here to complain that the House impeached him too  quickly for the emergency he caused.   Another point on the due process question: Earlier in this trial,  President Trump's attorneys suggested that the House somehow  deliberately delayed the transmission of this Article of Impeachment.  That is simply not accurate.   When the House adopted this Article of Impeachment on a bipartisan  vote, we were ready to begin trial, but the Senate was not in session  at the time. And when we inquired as to our options, Senate officials  told us, clearly, and in no uncertain terms, that if the Clerk of the  House attempted to deliver the Article of Impeachment to the Secretary  of the Senate before the Senate reconvened, that the Clerk of the House  would have been turned back at the door. That is why the trial did not  begin then--another reason why the President's objections of due  process are meritless.   Finally, let me just conclude that you all are going to see and have  seen a full presentation of evidence by the House, and you are going to  hear a full presentation by the President's attorneys. You are going to  be able to ask questions. The Senate has the sole power to try all  impeachments. President Trump is receiving any and all process that he  is due right here in this Chamber.   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, Senators, in just a moment, my  colleague, Mr. Neguse, will return to show that we have established,  with overwhelming evidence, that President Trump engaged in high crimes  and misdemeanors. Before Mr. Neguse comes up, though, I would like to  emphasize what should be an uncontroversial point but is really key to  understand.   If we have proven to you the conduct that we have alleged in this  Article, then President Trump has indeed committed a high crime and  misdemeanor under the Constitution. Incitement of insurrection under  these circumstances is, undoubtedly, in the words of George Mason from  the Constitutional Convention, a ``great and dangerous'' offense  against the Republic. Indeed, it is hard to think of a greater or more  dangerous offense against the Republic than this one.   So to be very precise about this, I hope we all can agree today that  if a President does incite a violent insurrection against the  government, he can be impeached for it. I hope we all can agree that  that is a constitutional crime.   Another key point: While President Trump's lawyers may be arguing  otherwise, the question here is not whether President Trump committed a  crime under the Federal Code or DC law or the law of any State.  Impeachment does not result in criminal penalties, as we keep  emphasizing. No one spends a day in jail. There are not even criminal  or civil fines. Centuries of history, not to mention the constitutional  text, structure, and original intent and understanding, all confirm the  teaching of James Wilson, another Framer, who wrote ``that impeachments  and offenses come not within the sphere of ordinary jurisprudence.''  Simply put,  [[Page S662]]  impeachment was created for a purpose separate and distinct from  criminal punishment. It was created to prevent and deter elected  officials who swear an oath to represent America but then commit  dangerous offense against our Republic. That is a constitutional crime.    And Senators, what greater offense could one commit than to incite  the violent insurrection at our seat of government during the peaceful  transfer of power--in circumstances where violence is foreseeable,  where a crowd is poised for violence, to provoke a mob of thousands to  attack us with weapons and sticks and poles, to bludgeon and beat our  law enforcement officers and to deface these sacred walls and to trash  the place and to do so while seeking to stop us from fulfilling our own  oaths, our own duties to uphold the Constitution by counting the votes  from our free and fair elections and then to sit back and watch in  delight as insurrectionists attack us, violating a sacred oath and  engaging in a profound dereliction and desertion of duty.   How can we assure that our Commander in Chief will protect, preserve,  and defend our Constitution if we don't hold a President accountable in  a circumstance like this? What is impeachable conduct, if not this? I  challenge you all to think about it. If you think this is not  impeachable, what is? What would be?   If President Trump's lawyers endorse his breathtaking assertion that  his conduct in inciting these events was totally appropriate and the  Senate acquits Donald Trump, then any President could incite and  provoke insurrectionary violence against us again. If you don't find  this a high crime and misdemeanor today, you have set a new, terrible  standard for Presidential misconduct in the United States of America.   The only real question here is the factual one. Did we prove that  Donald Trump, while President of the United States, incite a violent  insurrection against the government?   Incitement, of course, is an inherently fact-based and fact-intensive  judgment, which is why we commend you all for your scrupulous attention  to everything that took place, but we believe that we have shown you  overwhelming evidence in this case that would convince anyone using  their common sense that this was indeed incitement--meaning that Donald  Trump's conduct encouraged violence; the violence was foreseeable; and  he acted willfully in the actions that incurred violence.   Mr. Neguse will take you through that evidence again--not the whole  thing. We are almost done. We are almost done, but we don't want it to  be said that they never proved this or they never proved that because  my magnificent team of managers has stayed up night after night after  night, through weeks, to compile all of the factual evidence, and we  have put it before you and we have put it before all of you in this  public trial because we love our country that much.   Mr. Neguse will show you that we have proven our case and that  President Trump committed this impeachable offense that we impeached  him for on January 13 and that you should convict him. And when he is  finished, I will return and explain why it is dangerous for us to  ignore this and why you must convict, and then we will rest.   Mr. Neguse.   Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. President, distinguished Senators, good  afternoon, again. As my colleague, Lead Manager Raskin, has mentioned,  I know it has been a long few days, and I want to say thank you. We are  very grateful for your patience, for your attention, and the attention  that you have paid to every one of our managers as they presented our  case.   As Lead Manager Raskin mentioned, I hope, I trust, that we could all  agree that if a President incites a violent insurrection against our  government, that that is impeachable conduct.   So what I would like to do as we close our case is just walk you  through why our evidence overwhelmingly establishes that President  Trump committed that offense.   Now, as you consider that question, that question as to whether the  President incited insurrection, there are three questions that  reasonably come to mind: Was violence foreseeable; did he encourage  violence; and did he act willfully?   I am going to show you why the answer to every one of those questions  has to be yes.   First, let's start with foreseeability. Was it foreseeable that  violence would erupt on January 6 if President Trump lit a spark? Was  it predictable that the crowd at the Save America rally was poised on a  hair trigger for violence, that they would fight, literally, if  provoked to do so? Of course, it was.   When President Trump stood up to that podium on January 6, he knew  that many in that crowd were inflamed, were armed, were ready for  violence. It was an explosive situation, and he knew it. We have shown  you the evidence on this point. You have seen it--the images, the  videos, the articles, and the pattern which showed that the violence on  that terrible day was entirely foreseeable.   We have showed you how this all began with the big lie, the claim  that the election was rigged, and that President Trump and his  supporters were the victims of a massive fraud, a massive conspiracy to  rip away their votes.   We have showed you how President Trump spread that lie, and how, over  the course of months, with his support and encouragement, it inflamed  part of his base, resulting in death threats, real-world violence, and  increasingly extreme calls to stop the steal.   We established that after he lost the election, the President was  willing to do just about anything to prevent the peaceful transfer of  power; that he tried everything he could do to stop it.   You will recall the evidence on the screen: him pressuring and  threatening State election officials, attacking them to the point of  literally calling them enemies of the state, threatening at least one  of them with criminal penalties; then, attacking Senators, Members of  Congress, all across the media; pressuring the Justice Department,  prompting outcries from assistant U.S. attorneys, not to mention his  own Attorney General, reportedly telling him that the stolen election  claims were ``BS''--not my phrase, his.   And then, as January 6 approached, he moved on to attacking his own  Vice President openly and savagely.   We have recounted, throughout that entire period, all the ways in  which President Trump inflamed his supporters with lies that the  election was stolen. As every single one of us knows, nothing in this  country is more sacred--nothing--than our right to vote, our voice, and  here you have the President of the United States telling his supporters  that their voice, that their rights as Americans were being stolen from  them, ripped away. That made them angry, angry enough to stop the  steal, to fight like hell to stop the steal.   And we showed you this. You saw the endless tweets, the rallies, and  the statements encouraging and spreading that big lie. You saw that he  did this over and over again with the same message each time: You must  fight to win it back. You must never surrender, no matter what.   And remember, each time, his supporters along the way showed  violence. He endorsed it, encouraged it, and praised it. It was all  part of that same demand to stop the steal and fight like hell.   Remember the video that Manager Plaskett showed you from Texas? Some  of his supporters encircling a bus of campaign workers on a highway?  People easily could have been killed--easily. What did he do? He  tweeted and made a joke about it at a rally, called them patriots and  held them out as an example of what it means to stop the steal.   When he told his supporters to stop the steal, they took up arms to  literally intimidate officials to overturn the election results. You  saw the evidence and so did he, and he welcomed it.   When President Trump attacked Georgia's secretary of state for  certifying the results, his supporters sent death threats. You saw  those in great detail from Manager Dean. What did he do? He attacked  the election officials further.   When his supporters gathered together to have a second Million MAGA  rally--that is the rally that Manager Plaskett showed you, a rally  about the stolen election--he tweeted that the fight had just begun.  What happened next? It is not rocket science.  [[Page S663]]  Fights broke out, stabbings, serious violence.   Now, President Trump, like all of us, he saw what happened at that  rally. He saw all the violence, the burning, and chaos. How did he  respond? He tweeted praise of the event, and then--see it on the  screen--he bought $50 million--$50 million worth of ads to further  promote his message to those exact same people. He immediately joined  forces with that very same group. He joined forces with the same people  who had just erupted into violence.   Was violence predictable? Was it obvious that the crowd on January 6  was poised for violence, prepared for it? Absolutely. And this isn't  just clear looking back in time; it was widely recognized at the time.  In the days leading up to January 6, there were dozens, hundreds of  warnings. And he knew it. He knew the rally would explode if provoked.  He knew all it would take was a slight push.   Remember, you heard from Manager Plaskett the chatter on social media  websites that the Trump administration monitored and were known to the  Trump operation. It showed that the people he invited to the January 6  rally took this as a serious call to arms, that this was not just any  attack, it was to storm the Capitol, if necessary, to stop the steal.   And it wasn't just clear on these websites that the Trump  administration was monitoring; the FBI issued reports about this  credible threat, a threat to target us. Law enforcement made six  arrests the night before. Six arrests. Newspapers across the city  warned of the risk of violence.   There can be no doubt that the risk of violence was foreseeable.   What did he do in the days leading up to the rally? Did he calm the  situation? Ask yourself, I mean, did he call for peace? No. He didn't  do that. He spread his big lie, the most dangerous lie, as I mentioned,  that Americans' votes were being stolen and that the final act of theft  would occur here in the Capitol. Then he assembled all of those  supporters. He invited them to an organized event on a specific day at  a specific time matched perfectly to coincide with the joint session of  Congress, to coincide with the steal that he had told them to stop by  any and all means.   Again, he was told by law enforcement and all over the news that  these people were armed and ready for real violence. He knew it. He  knew it perfectly well, that he had created this powder keg at his  rally. He knew just how combustible that situation was. He knew there  were people before him who had prepared, who were armed and armored. He  knew they would jump to violence at any signal, at any sign from him  that he needed them to fight, that he needed them to stop the steal,  and we all know what happened next.    Second question. Did he encourage the violence? Standing in that  powder keg, did he light a match? Everyone knows the answer to that  question. The hours of video you all have watched leave no doubt. Just  remember what he said on January 6.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         President TRUMP. All of us here today do not want to see       our election victory stolen.        There's never been anything like this. It's a pure theft in       American history. Everybody knows it. Make no mistake, this       election was stolen from you, from me, from the country.    In the opening of--   (Text of video presentation.)         President TRUMP. We will never give up. We will never       concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's       theft involved.        And to use a favorite term that all of you people really       came up with: ``We will stop the steal. We will stop the       steal.''        We will not let them silence your voices. We're not going       to let it happen. Not going to let it happen.        (People chanting: ``Fight for Trump.''        President TRUMP. Thank you.        (People chanting: ``Fight for Trump.'')        President TRUMP. You have to get your people to fight       because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You       have to show strength, and you have to be strong. And we       fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell,       you're not going to have a country anymore.    You may remember at the outset of this trial, I told you would hear  three phrases over and over and over again: The big lie that the  election had been stolen, ``stop the steal and never concede,'' and  ``fight like hell to stop that steal.'' You heard those phrases  throughout the course of this trial, video after video, statement after  statement, telling his supporters that they should be patriots, to  fight hard, stop the steal. On that day, that day, where did he direct  the crowd's ire? He directed them here to Congress. He quite literally  in one part of that speech pointed at us. He told them to ``fight like  hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a  country anymore.''   And here is the thing. That wasn't metaphorical. It wasn't  rhetorical. He already made it perfectly clear that when he said  ``fight,'' he meant it. And when followers, in fact, fought, when they  engaged in violence, he praised and honored them as patriots. He  implied that it was OK to break the law because the election was being  stolen. You heard it. You remember the clip that Manager Dean showed  you earlier in this trial. He told them--the quote is on the screen-- ``When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very  different rules.''   Remember how all of his supporters--some of his supporters across  social media were treating this as a war, talking about bringing in the  cavalry? Well, President Trump made clear what those different rules  were. He had been making it clear for months.   (Text of video presentation.)         Mr. Giuliani. So let's have trial by combat.        President TRUMP. And, Rudy, you did a great job. He's got       guts. You know what? He's got guts, unlike a lot of people in       the Republican Party. He's got guts. He fights.    His message was crystal clear, and it was understood immediately,  instantly by his followers. And we don't have to guess. We don't have  to guess as to how they reacted. We can look at how people reacted to  what he said. You saw them, and you saw the violence. It is pretty  simple: He said it, and they did it. And we know this because they told  us. They told us in real time during the attack. You saw the  affidavits, the interviews on social media and on live TV. They were  doing this for him because he asked them to.   It wasn't just insurrectionists who confirmed this. Many, many  people, including current and former officials, immediately recognized  that the President had incited the crowd, that he alone was capable of  stopping the violence, that he did this, and he had to call it off  because he was the only one who could.   Let's see what Representative McCarthy, Representative Gallagher,  Chris Christie, Representative Kinzinger, and Representative Katko had  to say.   (Text of video presentation.)          Mr. President, you have got to stop this.       You are the only person who can call this off. Call it off.        Mr. Christie. It's pretty simple. The President caused this       protest to occur. He's the only one who could make it stop.        What the President says is not good enough.        The President has to come out and tell his supporters to       leave the Capitol grounds and to allow the Congress to do       their business peacefully, and anything short of that is an       abrogation of his responsibility.
