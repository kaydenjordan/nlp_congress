 Madam President, before I even start, I do want to  compliment the staff--later, I will put all of the names in the  Record--who worked weekends and late at night. I remember times when I  would get off the phone with them at 11 o'clock at night and 12  midnight. I could go to bed, but they were still there working until 3  or 4 in the morning.   Yet, after all of those months of negotiations, the Committee on  Appropriations introduced the $1.5 trillion fiscal year 2022 Omnibus  appropriations bill. As I will explain, this is the consolidation of 12  annual appropriations bills to fund the Federal Government for the  remainder of the fiscal year. Last night, the House passed it on a  bipartisan basis. It is now before us, and we need to act on it  quickly.   Our annual appropriations bills are where we reflect on our national  priorities. In total, this bill includes $730 billion in nondefense  funding. That is a $46 billion increase over fiscal year 2021. This  6.7-percent increase is the largest in 4 years for nondefense programs.  It allows for significant investments in the American people that will  expand the middle class.   The bill also provides urgent funding for the people of Ukraine as  they battle Vladimir Putin's immoral, unprovoked, and brutal invasion-- an invasion which, actually, labels Vladimir Putin as a ``war  criminal.''   It is unquestionably in the interest of the American people that the  Senate act quickly to pass this bill and send it to President Biden. I  will tell you why it is so important.   In the wake of the pandemic, children and schools across the country  have been falling behind in math and reading, and children in low- income and minority communities have been falling even further behind  their peers. One study found that third graders who are attending  school in low-income communities tested 17 points lower in math than  they did just in 2019. We can't allow a global pandemic to set these  children further back on the path to a bright future.   The bill includes $17.5 billion--the largest increase in more than a  decade--for title I-A grants. These grants provide funding for more  than half of our Nation's public schools to help students, particularly  in low-income communities, meet college and career-ready academic  standards.   And to help these children succeed before they even step foot in the  classroom, the bill includes more than $11 billion for Head Start. The  bill also increases the maximum Pell Grant award by $400--also the  largest increase in more than a decade--so that as these students  succeed they can go on to pursue a college education. Pell Grants help  more than 7 million students pursue a postsecondary education every  year.   Now, of course, we are investing in these children, but we are also  investing in their families. Ask any young family and they will tell  you that the pandemic exacerbated the childcare crisis. Parents, and  particularly women, are being forced out of the  [[Page S1090]]  labor market because they cannot afford the high cost of childcare. The  bill provides more than $6 billion for childcare and development block  grants. That is a 4.4-percent increase over last year. These grants  will assist low-income families in gaining quality childcare that fits  their needs to prepare their children to succeed in school.    Across this country--the wealthiest and most powerful Nation on  Earth--more than 38 million people, including 12 million children, are  what can be called food insecure. Many of us in this room cannot even  imagine the heartbreak and pain a parent must feel when they cannot put  enough food on the table for their child. So the bill increases support  for nutrition programs. These programs are a lifeline to these American  families.   It also ensures that over 4 million low-income women and children  will not see their benefits reduced at the end of April by extending  the WIC Cash-Value Voucher Program. It is a special $35 monthly benefit  for purchasing fruits and vegetables. It fully funds $6 billion for the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and  Children--WIC--to help support 6.2 million low-income women, infants  and children younger than 5 years old every month. It also includes  more than $140 billion, which is a 23-percent increase, for SNAP. SNAP  provides assistance to more than 40 million people every year in this  country.   It also keeps families in their homes by providing billions of  dollars to build and support public housing. This includes a 75-percent  increase for Choice Neighborhoods, which helps to transform communities  by revitalizing public and assisted housing. It provides an 11-percent  increase to build new affordable housing through the HOME program. And  it includes $4.8 billion for community and economic development.   We understand that hundreds of thousands of Americans are homeless.  The 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report found that on a single night  more than 580,000 people experienced homelessness. People who are  struggling with homelessness have been robbed of a central pillar of  the American Dream--having a place that they can call their own. The  bill provides $3 billion--a 6.6-percent increase--for homeless  assistance grants.   We know it is a bipartisan priority in Congress to keep our  communities safe so the bill provides a 15-percent increase for  Department of Justice grants to State and local law enforcement and  communities to prevent and respond to crime. It provides COPS Hiring  grant funding to place more than 1,700 officers on the streets to keep  our communities safe. But as a country, we have collectively grieved  the loss of life that inspired the Black Lives Matter movement. So this  bill provides new resources to fund deescalation training, implicit  bias training, training that emphasizes the duty of fellow officers to  intervene, and providing crisis intervention teams.   It is also a commitment to the future of scientific research,  development, and innovation in this country. It provides the largest  increase in 12 years for the National Science Foundation. The NSF funds  a quarter of all federally supported basic research conducted by  colleges and universities in this country. It provides a 6-percent  increase for the Department of Energy Office of Science and a 5.3- percent increase for the National Institutes of Health to speed the  development of new therapies, diagnostics, and preventative measures.   I think it also, importantly, includes $1 billion to launch the  Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, the ARPA-H, as President  Biden's bold and promising proposal to revolutionize how we prevent,  treat, and cure devastating diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and  diabetes.   Marcelle, my wife, and I had the opportunity to listen to then-Vice  President Biden speak about this at the University of Vermont's medical  school a few years ago and then again to hear President Biden, Vice  President Kamala Harris, and Dr. Jill Biden speak about it at the White  House. I was committed to making sure that it would be in the Omnibus  bill, and I am pleased that it was included and that that request was  joined by numerous other Senators.   The bill closes the chapter on 4 years of denying the existence of  the climate crisis by the previous administration. It provides billions  of dollars to support climate research, mitigation, and adaptation.  This includes $900 million in NSF funding to support climate and clean  energy research, $40 million for NOAA climate-related projects, $425  million for clean air programs, and an historic investment in Energy  Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE.   We also provide hundreds of millions of dollars to support  international climate change adaptation and mitigation programs. We  included this funding because the scientific communities are in  agreement that we are running out of time before the damage to our  planet is irreversible. So we are taking a small but long-overdue step  to confront that reality.   The bill also backs up our commitment to our veterans. It provides  $97.5 billion--an 8.7-percent increase--for VA medical care. That  provides essential health services for 9.2 million veterans, those men  and women who have served our country and whom we always promised to  back up, as they did us. Now, we are. This includes funding for rural  health programs, veterans' homelessness prevention, and mental health  resources.   Consistent with long tradition, the bill includes billions of dollars  for food and other humanitarian aid for victims of war and natural  disasters, $700 million to support global health security programs to  prevent and prepare for future pandemics, and it provides the funds to  support PEPFAR's global HIV-AIDS program.   It provides the funds to support our embassies and other foreign  missions around the world. And it supports organizations like the  Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, the National Endowment  for Democracy, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Peace Corps, the  Millennium Challenge Corporation, and the International Development  Finance Corporation.   Anybody who is watching the news knows what is happening with the war  crimes that are being imposed on Ukraine by a much larger neighbor,  Russia, under the unbelievable, irresponsible leadership of Vladimir  Putin.   So we have included a $13.6 billion bipartisan agreement to provide  emergency assistance to Ukraine and our NATO allies--$13.6 billion.  That has the necessary resources to bolster the defense capabilities of  the Ukrainian military but also our regional allies and partners. It  also supports the implementation of economic sanctions and export  restrictions on Russia.   Importantly, it addresses the evolving humanitarian crisis--this  horrible, tragic humanitarian crisis--that has resulted from President  Putin's unprovoked attack on the Ukrainian people, an attack I call a  war crime. The escalating crisis President Putin has inflicted on  Europe poses the greatest threat to democracy and sovereignty in a  generation.   The American people overwhelmingly support the people of Ukraine.  This is not a Democratic or Republican issue; this is a human rights  issue. This is where America stands with the people of Ukraine.   I remember a few years ago when I was chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I joined with my friend Mike Crapo, another  Senator, and we reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act. We  dramatically increased it and improved it. We added Native Americans,  we added the LGBTQ community, and we added the sexual exploitation of  children.   Well, the Violence Against Women Act has been stuck. It hasn't been  reauthorized. This bill reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act.   VAWA continues to be one of the most consequential laws addressing  the scourge of violence against women and domestic violence in our  country. I remember how bad it was when I was a prosecutor, but it has  become far, far worse today. We need the tool of VAWA, and the bill  includes the highest funding level ever of grants to support these  programs. It provides crucial support for programs and initiatives  designed to support survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault,  dating violence, and stalking.   Of note, this bill also reforms and reauthorizes the EB-5 Visa  program, which has been abused by corrupt actors for too long. I have  championed  [[Page S1091]]  these bipartisan reforms for many years, and I am proud that we are  finally going to enact them.   In total, the bill includes $730 billion in nondefense funding, a  6.7-percent increase. The bill includes, $782 billion in defense  funding, a 5.6-percent increase over fiscal year 2021.   This is a product of months of negotiations--sometimes weekends,  sometimes evenings, sometimes days, over and over again--negotiations  between myself and dear friends Vice Chairman Shelby and House Chair  DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger.   I mentioned earlier our staffs who spent countless late nights  working through the details of this bill. Those are not just weekday  nights; those are weekends too, giving up plans they might have had,  personal plans, family plans, whatever. So I think of specifically  Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, and Jay Tilton on my  staff and Bill Duhnke and David Adkins on Vice Chairman Shelby's staff  and so many, many more who worked those nights and days--far too many  names to say right now.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have a list of the staff  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was orderd to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Chairman Leahy List for H.R. 2471 (Consolidated Appropriations Act,                         2022) Staff for the Record         Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Jay       Tilton, Maddie Dunn, Megan Fariel, William Duhnke, David       Adkins, Blair Taylor, Margaret Wiles, Ann Tait Hall, Robin       Juliano, Matt Washington, Jason Gray, Anne Marie Chotvacs,       Johnnie Kaberle, Sara Peters, Dianne Nellor, Rachel       Erlebacher, Hannah Chauvin, Morgan Ulmer, Patrick Carroll,       Elizabeth Dent, Jean Toal Eisen, Jennifer Eskra, Blaise       Sheridan, Michael Bednarczyk, Angela-Gussi Caalim, Brian       Daner, Allen Cutler, Kevin Wheeler, Erik Raven, Mike       Clementi, Katy Hagan, Kate Kaufer, Brigid Kolish, Robert       Leonard, John Lucio, Andy Vanlandingham, Abigail Grace,       Andrew Platt, Hanz Heinrichs, John Forbes, Rachel Littleton,       Todd Phillips, Doug Clapp, Jennifer Becker-Pollet, Aaron       Goldner, Laura Powell, Christopher Crowley, Jen Armstrong,       Nora Khalil, Anna Newton, Sirisha Rayaprolu, Ellen Murray,       Diana Hamilton, Reeves Hart, Andrew Newton, Alexandra Adcock,       William Tutt, Lauren Nunnally, Kamela White, Jennifer Piatt,       Jim Daumit, Frank Reed, Teri Curtin, Jason Yaworske, Chris       Cook, Daniel Mencher, Thompson Moore, LaShawnda Smith,       Melissa Zimmerman, Ryan Hunt, Martha Roberts, Anthony       Sedillo, Emy Lesofski, Lucas Agnew, Nona McCoy, Alex Keenan,       Kelly Brown, Michael Gentile, Mark Laisch, Meghan Mott,       Kathryn Toomajian, Fiona O-Brien, Laura Friedel, Anna Lanier       Fischer, Ashley Palmer, Emily Slack, Michelle Dominguez,       Joanne Hoff, Jason McMahon, Patrick Magnuson, Jennifer       Bastin, Tim Rieser, Kali Farahmand, Sarita Vanka, Madeleine       Granda, Paul Grove, Katherine Jackson, Adam Yezerski, Dabney       Hegg, Kelsey, Daniels, Rajat Mathur, Jessica Sun, Amanda       Wahlig, Alison Graab, Michael Ciamarra, Jason Woolwine,       Courtney Young, Clint Trocchio, Christy Greene, Jenny       Winkler, Valerie Hutton, George Castro, Hong Nguyen, Elmer       Barnes, Penny Myles, Karin Thames, Lynn Cookley.     Madam President, this is a good bill. It is a bill that  reflects American priorities and invests in future prosperity and our  health. It reduces everyday costs for millions of Americans, such as  childcare, a college education, and heating and cooling costs. It is a  bill that invests in us--us--the American people.   We know that a government shutdown on Saturday would be senseless.  Look at the impression it would give the rest of the world when we are  telling everybody to stand up and be strong. We know that a delay would  be senseless, so I strongly urge all Members to vote aye when the bill  comes to the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I know Senators are waiting on movements on  both sides, but I just want to reiterate what I said earlier this  afternoon. We have before us a message from the House--the omnibus. I  would point out that both Republicans and Democrats have had an  enormous amount of input into this for over the past several months. I  know that because the Appropriations Committee staff has worked so hard  on it--again, both sides of the aisle.   Earlier today, I put into the Record the names of members of my staff  who have worked on this. I would just mention to other Senators, there  are many times I would be on phone calls with them and conference calls  at 10 and 11 at night. I can then go to bed. They were still there at 2  or 3 o'clock in the morning. I know that a number of them have given up  time with their families over the weekend. I would be checking in with  them or come down and meet with them, but I could go home. They kept on  working. I think we have to understand, if it were not for such  dedicated staff members, this Senate could not exist.   We have a complex package before us, but in a way, what we have here  is a simple matter. Everybody has had input into it. As chairman of the  Senate Appropriations Committee, I tried to make it open to everybody.  The vice chairman, Senator Shelby, a close friend of mine, has done the  same on his side. People have been heard.   Now comes the time when we have to vote. The government runs out of  money at midnight tomorrow. Look what faces our country. We, as the  leading democracy in the world, are trying to stand up for Ukraine.   I applaud President Biden. He and I sometimes joke that when I came  here, I was accused because I was 34 years old--the Presiding Officer  can understand this feeling--I was accused by very senior Senators of  being too young to be in the U.S. Senate. Fortunately, I was not the  youngest. The youngest was Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware. We formed  a bond over that. We worked together on so many things. I watched him  in the Foreign Relations Committee; I watched him in the Judiciary; and  I watched him as Vice President and now as President.   I have seen him tirelessly, quietly, a lot of it not in the full  light of the press but just doing what he has to do, calling leaders  who respect him around the world, forming a coalition in Ukraine, to  say: Here is how we will stand up against Russia.   I know so many of the Russian people are good people but being led by  a person who has demonstrated activities which make him a war criminal.  What has happened when mothers, fathers, and their children are  machine-gunned to death on the streets of the city they grew up in by  Russian invaders? This is a war crime when Vladimir Putin sends them  there.   In this omnibus, we have support for the Ukrainian people. Let's  stand up. Let's deliver this support. Let's do what we should do. Let  the Senate be the conscience of the Nation. Let's not have a dozen or  more amendments that are designed more for ``Here is how I can get 30  seconds on the news'' or in a Twitter account or somewhere. Let's do  what is best for this country. Let's do what is best for the people in  Ukraine.   Look at the lies--look at the lies that have come out of Russia. I  don't say it lightly after 48 years here to call the leader of a  country a war criminal, but Vladimir Putin has been a war criminal. He  has been a war criminal in having people go in and do the horrible  crimes--blowing up maternity hospitals where women are giving birth,  [[Page S1101]]  killing children, bombing schools, destroying families, innocent  civilians--for what? To return a dream of a Soviet Union that never  existed; to return a dream of being a modern-day czar when that is not  something you really want to be? No.   Let us Senators--Republicans and Democrats--stand up and say: OK. We  are going to do our job. We are going to vote for our legislation. We  are going to vote for appropriations to help the President of the  United States stand up and help the people of Ukraine. We all know what  we are going to do. We all know what the stakes are. We all know what  is here. Let's stop the press releases. Let's stop the grandstanding.  Let's stand up and vote. Vote yes or vote no. Don't stand behind  something where you say: Well, I might be judged this way or I might be  judged that way on a vote.    Just as the Presiding Officer has cast tough votes, we all do. I  voted 17,000 times on this floor. I was proud to do it. Was I right on  every single vote? I am sure I can go back over those and say: What was  I thinking? But I tried to do what is best.   We know what is best now: fund our government, pay for our young  people, pay for our schools, pay for our nutrition, pay for feeding  Americans but also pay for helping Ukrainians who are standing up  against a war criminal.   We all proudly say we stand for democracy and the ideals of  democracy. Let's do it. The people of Ukraine are.   When I think of the malignant lie--terrorist things that come from  Russia against the proud people of Ukraine--I think of the Putin group  calling President Zelenskyy a Nazi. He is Jewish and proud of it. He  couldn't be further away from being a Nazi. He is a man who could have  fled his country as so many others have. He stayed there to protect his  country, to stand with his country. Shouldn't we stand with him too? I  think we should.   I urge my Senate colleagues, come in here. You go home and talk about  how I voted for this; I voted for that. Well, come and vote. Come and  vote. Let's get this bill passed.   I will probably say more as we go forward in this. I know there are  other Senators--like the distinguished senior Senator of Michigan who  is about to speak.   I will yield the floor on this. I have been here and had to vote over  and over. As I said, I voted 17,000 times. I think there is only one  person in history who has voted more than that. These haven't all been  easy votes. I have had to wrestle with my conscience.   I go back to one of the first critical votes I cast as the newest,  most junior Member of the Senate--a 34-year-old Member of the Senate-- the junior-most member of the Armed Services Committee. We were asked  to vote to continue the war in Vietnam. I campaigned against the war in  Vietnam, and, ironically enough, at that time, the majority in Vermont  supported the war. I did not. In my own conscience, I did not. So we  had five votes in committee to continue. Each time, the vote to  continue failed by one vote. I was the newest and youngest member of  that committee, and I voted no. I became the only Vermonter ever to  vote to end the war in Vietnam, and I was told that would end my Senate  career; I was done. I think back 48 years to that time, and I know at  the end of this term, I will leave, but I will leave on my own accord,  not because of a vote I cast.   Every one of us should know, cast what is right in your conscience.  Cast what is right in your conscience. That is worth more than an  election.   Vote for this. Get it done. Show Ukraine that the greatest democracy  and the longest lasting democracy currently in the world--the United  States--stands with you.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, the Senator asked those who love this  institution to speak up. I am the Dean of the U.S. Senate. I have  served here for 48 years. I love this institution.   I know the Constitution vests the power of the purse in the Congress.  Certifications of these earmarks have been available to the public on  our committee website at my request and Senator Shelby's request for 8  months. Everybody knows what is here.   Vote for them or not; but, frankly, if I have to speak of what is  needed for my State of Vermont, I want to be the one speaking for it-- not somebody downtown. I would hope every Senator feels the same way.   I yield back the rest of my time. I oppose the amendment.   (Applause.)                          Vote on Amendment No. 4990     Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Alabama,  Senator Shelby, and I have been friends for decades. I applaud his work  on this. I applaud his staff. I applaud our staff and the  Appropriations Committee.   I thank those Senators of both parties who came together to come  here. We stand up for America. We stand up for the needs of America.  But we also stand up for Ukraine, which is being attacked by a war  criminal, Putin of Russia.   I yield back my time.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I am delighted to see the vote, and I  thank the Senators who voted with us.   I would note that a lot of Senators, along with Senator Shelby and  me, on both sides of the aisle worked so hard on this.   I especially want to say again that I don't know how many times on  weekends and in the evenings I could leave and go home at 10 or 11  o'clock at night, but our staffs were still there at 2, 3, and 4  o'clock in the morning, doing this. They are the ones who deserve so  much credit in doing this.   This is the reality. This is our government. This is how we protect  our country. It is also how we show our responsibility to a country--in  this case, Ukraine--that is being attacked by a war criminal, Vladimir  Putin.   So I thank every Senator who voted this way. I thank the  distinguished majority leader, who worked with us every step of the way  to make sure we had the schedule so we could do this. I thank the  Republicans and Democrats who worked with us.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, the State Opioid Response grant program  has been critically important to communities that have been affected by  the ongoing opioid epidemic.   Rates of substance use disorders have grown exponentially,  particularly during the pandemic, taking lives across the country, and  opioids are the main driver of drug overdose deaths. Congress developed  the State Opioid Response grant program to enhance our response to the  opioid epidemic. As a result of this funding, States have been able to  expand access to lifesaving prevention, treatment, and recovery  services to frontline communities   I know this funding has been important to Vermont in addressing the  opioid crisis, and I ask the senior Senator from Washington if this has  been her experience with the program as well.    Madam President, I would like to ask the junior Senator  from New Hampshire about her experience with this program.    Madam President, I would like to ask, given this context,  if the Senator from New Hampshire agrees that both the House and the  Senate have made clear that funding cliffs for this program will hamper  States' ability to effectively address the opioid epidemic?    Madam President, I thank the Senator for clearly laying  out the Senate's intent for the ongoing administration of this  program--I agree. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington if  she agrees as well?  [[Page S1112]]         Madam President, I thank the senior Senator from  Washington, and I echo the call for HHS and SAMHSA to prevent  significant funding cliffs.   The State Opioid Response grant program must facilitate the ongoing  work States are performing to preserve communities and save lives. Now  is not the time to be cutting funding from communities that are just  barely beginning to heal from the opioid epidemic.   Madam President, I would like to thank the Senators from Washington  and New Hampshire for coming to the floor to discuss this important  program.                            ____________________
