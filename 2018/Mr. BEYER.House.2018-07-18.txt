 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule that would permit a  House vote on the most shortsighted, antimarket sense of the House on a  carbon tax.   For decades, economists across the ideological spectrum have argued  that carbon price is the most efficient way to discourage the use of  fossil fuels and the best way to encourage the growth of energy  efficiency measures, alternative energy sources, and market decisions  on everything from housing to transportation.   Indeed, this is the preferred solution to climate change by those on  the right, by the Republican public intellectuals and think tanks,  which is why it is baffling that a Republican congressional leadership  would want to attack their preferred policy option.   It is axiomatic economics that we tax the things we want to  discourage. The scientific evidence continues to accumulate in  prodigious amounts that carbon pollution is profoundly changing the  climate of our Earth. The costs of inaction are staggering, into the  billions.   Carbon pricing is the most market-oriented policy action we can take  to combat this. Designed well, the economic dividend will put much more  money into the hands of the American people and will grow our economy  more quickly.   History will look back on this House resolution with sadness and  regret. Once again, we will have chosen short-term profits of the  fossil fuel titans over the long-term survival and prosperity of  mankind on our planet.
