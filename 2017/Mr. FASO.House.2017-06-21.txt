 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the Spencertown Fire  Company, which is celebrating 100 years of service to our communities  in Columbia County, New York.   Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year for the past century, this  fire company has served with pride and courage. I express my gratitude  for the past and present volunteers of this organization, who have made  great sacrifices and performed heroic acts to protect their neighbors.   Today, 35 individuals make up the team at Spencertown Fire Company.  Two-thirds of this group are active, highly skilled volunteer firemen.   Their commitment to Spencertown and its neighboring communities does  [[Page H5034]]  not stop at fire safety. Each year, since 1985, they have awarded a  $1,000 scholarship to a college-bound senior, chosen from within their  service area.   I thank Spencertown Fire Company's President Alan Silvernale,  Austerlitz Fire Chief Eric Pilkington, and the entire Spencertown Fire  Company, which, in the great tradition of New York fire companies,  continues to raise the standard in ensuring and furthering the well- being of our local communities.                            ____________________
