 Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to be recognized by  the gentlewoman from Wyoming, and I rise in support of this combined  rule that we have here.   I thought it was important that I speak to some of the provisions  that are in the underlying bill and also the provisions that are not in  the underlying bill.                                time  1315    I would characterize this rule, that is the rule for the  reauthorization of the Department of Homeland Security--it is actually  the authorization. It has never been authorized in that fashion  before--the authorization of Homeland Security after 15 years. I think  that it does a lot of good things in that it lays out a definition and  frames the duties of the Department of Homeland Security broadly and  pretty closely in their entirety.   There are some things that are missing from this that I would like to  have plugged into this reauthorization language. However, I believe the  goal was, all along, to draft a piece of reauthorization language that  would be, I will say, compatible to both sides of the aisle and without  particular dissent.   Therefore, we have a piece of legislation that isn't as impactful as  I would like, and yet it is here on the floor under suspension with the  idea that we can move this along and frame the Department of Homeland  Security's duties in the fashion that is here.   I don't object to the provisions that are in the authorization  language that exists, but I would point out that it sets the stage, and  now there is an agreement that has been reached through a number of  entities, including the White House, the DOJ, the DHS, and I understand  from our leadership and others, that soon there will be the piece of  legislation that we refer to as Davis-Oliver.   In Davis-Oliver, we actually have the enforcement provisions that are  necessary to restore the respect for the rule of law, and especially  the domestic enforcement of our immigration laws.   We are setting the stage for that and clearing the path for that with  this rule on the legislation that will pass, I believe, under  suspension.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    The provisions that are necessary that I would  point out to the body, Mr. Speaker, are this:   The number one most important is this: We only have 5,000 ICE agents  for 50 States and territories. They are spread so thin they can't  possibly enforce immigration law. We need that number tripled. That is  10,000 ICE agents. That is the most important component of this to have  the officers to bring that enforcement.  [[Page H5996]]    Second thing is we need to make sure that the ICE detainer language  is there and in Davis-Oliver. That is something that had been  neutralized by an action of the Obama administration, and they need to  be certain that they have the full authority to carry firearms.   Mr. Speaker, I make these points so that the body can anticipate what  is coming down the pike. I intend to support the rule and the  underlying bills, and I intend to be here on the floor advocating all  of the components of Davis-Oliver, also including the components I have  articulated here today.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address the House.
