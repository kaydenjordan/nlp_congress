 Madam Speaker, undeniably the worst foreign policy  mistake in the history of the United States of America was the invasion  of Iraq based on phonied-up intelligence that was trumpeted by Dick  Cheney, Scooter Libby, and other characters in the Bush administration.   But just this last week, President Trump took us to the verge of an  even worse foreign policy mistake in the Middle East. He recklessly and  impatiently took us to the brink of war that would have been even  worse.   Now, yesterday, I went to the so-called intelligence briefing. They  offered no intelligence regarding immediate imminent threats to the  United States, our troops, or allies in the region.   They did certainly make a case that Soleimani was a rotten guy and he  was responsible for many, many deaths of Americans and others in the  region, but that is all recited past history that didn't talk about any  immediate threats or any intelligence that would lead to it.   They further went on to say that the legal justification was the  Authorization for Use of Military Force in the invasion of Iraq, which,  of course, was based on phony intelligence regarding weapons of mass  destruction he didn't have. So that is even more extraordinary if you  think about that.   Last week, also, the President tweeted what he said was his  compliance with war powers. He then went on to tweet a threat of all- out war against Iran, and then he went further to tweet that he would  order that war crimes be committed during an all-out war against Iran.   That was walked back a little bit by the Secretary of Defense who  said they would follow the law. And then Trump later said: I like laws.  I will follow the laws. So he walked back from saying he was going to  destroy cultural threats a little bit.   Today, on the floor of the House, we will take up a rebuke of the  President for those actions. Hopefully, we will go further and we will  repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force from 2002 based on  fake intelligence.   We will further, hopefully, take up legislation that was adopted as  an amendment to the defense authorization last summer, with bipartisan  support, to say that the President couldn't initiate hostilities  against Iran without first coming to Congress.   Congress has the authority, and only Congress has the authority, to  declare war. Once we are at war, the President, as Commander in Chief,  can utilize the Armed Forces as he sees fit.   But the President does not have the authority. This is  extraconstitutional when it isn't an attack or an imminent attack on  the United States, its troops, or its citizens.   So we need to do those things.   Further, we need to fix the War Powers Act. That was adopted after  the illegal actions of another President, Richard Nixon, the bombing of  Cambodia.   There were two versions. One followed the Constitution, and said, no,  no, any offensive actions into hostilities you first have to come to  Congress. The second version said, well, you can initiate them, but you  have to report within 48 hours, and if Congress doesn't authorize it  within 60 days, you have to withdraw. That was defective and weak and  doesn't reflect at all the congressional duties of this body.   Now, I know a lot of Members love to dodge the issues of war and  peace--it is the toughest vote you can make--and that is essentially  what they did at the time, a wink and a nod: Well, we will let the  President do these things. Hey, if it works out, we will take credit;  if it doesn't work out, oh, well, then we can castigate him later.   So I have introduced, yet again, a bill that comprehensively reforms  the War Powers Act to reflect the constitutional authorities and duties  of the United States Congress. It would say that the President cannot  initiate hostilities without first coming to Congress.   It would define what consultation means. It doesn't mean a tweet to  the Congress. It doesn't mean sending up a letter. It means a  meaningful consultation. It establishes an executive legislative  consultative group.   It also includes, most importantly, a sunset clause for any  authorization by Congress.   I mean, a thousand years from now, the United States, I guess, if we  don't repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force, can  attack whatever Iraq is a thousand years from now. That is absolutely  absurd.   Finally, it does give Congress the authority and standing to go to  the courts should the President violate the Constitution and the War  Powers Act in the future--any President.  [[Page H68]]    I have had problems with both Democratic and Republican Presidents  over this issue over the years: Clinton, Bosnia; Bush, obviously in a  number of cases; and then Obama in Libya and other things that they  did, also based on the fake intelligence in the 2002 authorization.   So let's first vote today. That is just a starting point in  reasserting our constitutional duties.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, President Bush's invasion of Iraq was the  first foreign policy mistake in the history of the United States based  on fake intelligence, and President Trump took us to the brink of war  with Iran with an impulsive act at the end of last week that would be  even more disastrous than the war with Iraq, which is still  reverberating throughout the region.   Some on that side say: Oh, you are not with the troops; you are  apologizing.   No, we are not. We are reasserting the constitutional duty that we  are sworn to in this House of Representatives. Congress and only  Congress can declare war. Once we have declared war, then the President  of the United States as Commander in Chief can conduct it, as much as  this gentleman could.   This is just a step. We need to repeal the Authorization for Use of  Military Force against Iraq based on fake intelligence because that was  his lawyer's rationalization of why they could do this in Iraq, a  sovereign nation, without their permission.   We also have to reform the War Powers Act because the War Powers Act  itself does not reflect our constitutional authority.   Finally, we have to pass an amendment to prohibit a hostile action  against Iran without authority from Congress.
