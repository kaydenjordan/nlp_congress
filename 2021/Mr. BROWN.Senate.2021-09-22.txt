 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is always a thrill to come to the floor  to talk about the child tax credit, especially with three colleagues  who really are the authors and the most important pushers, if you will,  of this bill in the Senate.   I am going to turn it to Senator Bennet--he and I worked on this for  damn close to a decade now--and Senator Booker. And then we will be  joined last by Senator Warnock, who has only been in the Senate for a  year--not even--and has done so much already for the State of Georgia,  and he is one of the best supporters of this in the U.S. Senate.   So I will reserve my comments for a little later. Senator Bennet will  go first.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Booker, and I join my  friend Senator Warnock here to talk about this. Thanks to Senator  Bennet, Senator Booker, and Senator Warnock for their leadership on  what I think is the most important thing I have done in my years in  public office: the child tax credit that Senator Bennet and I began on  years and years and years ago, joined by other colleagues. Senator  Warnock has really taken it over in a big way this year in getting it  across the finish line. Sorry for the sports metaphor, but that is how  important this is.   Senator Bennet said something about--and I guess Senator Booker--that  raising children is work. At least one of my colleagues--a number of my  colleagues on that side of the aisle, and I believe a colleague or two  on this side of the aisle, said something about a work requirement in a  child tax credit. And I don't understand that because I spent a lot of  time, including this weekend, with my grandchildren, and I see how hard  my daughters work raising children and our son works raising children  and the pressures. And this bill, cutting everything else away,  relieves some of the anxiety that parents face, the anxiety of how do I  get the money together to pay the rent this week, before the end of the  month, so I don't get evicted or I don't get behind in my rent--just  the opportunities for these parents.   So I want to talk directly--directly--to Ohio parents. We talk about  parents and about the child tax credit. I want to talk to Ohio parents  for a moment.   Parents, check your bank accounts. A week ago today, we once again  put money directly in the pockets of the families of most Ohio parents.  The families of 92 percent of Ohio children are getting these dollars  either direct deposit in their accounts or in their mailboxes in  checks. It started July 15, then August 15, and then September 15. It  will continue. Our goal on the floor today is to make this permanent;  at least to make sure this goes beyond the end of the year. We are  going to succeed in doing that. It is so important that we do.   Back to talking to parents. We know how hard you work at your jobs  and raising your kids. Any parent knows how much work it is to take  care of children, especially young children. It has only gotten harder  over the last year and a half. The pressures are greater. The anxiety  placed on families is more.   We have not recognized in this country often enough that raising  children is work. If you have a job outside the home, you are probably  not getting paid what you are worth. We have seen what has happened  over the past few decades.   Productivity has gone up. Stock prices have soared. Executive  compensation is stratospheric. The wages have been flat. Wages for most  Americans have barely budged; meanwhile, you all as parents know how  expensive it is to raise kids--childcare, healthcare, school lunches,  diapers, clothes, school supplies, braces, sports fees. The list never  seems to end. That is not to mention trying to put money away--just a  few dollars a month--trying to put money away for college or sending  your kid to camp or maybe--maybe, as I have heard from some parents-- for the first time in 2 or 3 years, they are going to get to take a  little vacation for a few days or maybe, once a month, going out to  dinner at the local diner.   You feel like you can't keep up no matter how hard you work. It is  why we passed the child tax credit. It is why we started, several years  ago, working to get other Senators on board until we had virtually,  literally, every Senator on this side of the aisle. Every single  Democrat has voted for the child tax credit twice already.   Unfortunately, every single Republican voted against it. I don't even  really understand why they are against it when, you know, you could  look out down the aisle here, you can look down the hall, and Senator  McConnell's office is down the hall, and you see the lobbyists lining  up there. They always get their tax cuts.   A train carrying tax cuts leaves the station whenever Republicans are  in power--a tax cut for wealthy people--but this is a tax cut for  working families, and we know how important that is. It is finally-- finally--to America's parents, making your hard work pay off so you can  keep up with those extra expenses that keep coming and coming and  coming when you are raising a family.   Stories have poured into our office from parents across Ohio about  these tax cuts. Let me just give you snippets of several of them.   Katie in Akron: It helps pay for school supplies.   Caitlin: It pays for preschool for my son.   Lindsay: It is back-to-school clothes.   Fern: It will pay for preschool for both of my children, and the rest  is going into a savings account for them.   From Melissa: I used part of it to buy school uniform pieces for my  4-year-old.    Jennifer: Put it away for college tuition.   Maia: Food and school supplies.   And one of the most common stories we hear over and over is that  parents are using this to afford childcare so they can go back to work  or keep working or work a few more hours.   One mother from Minford in Southern Ohio near Portsmouth, wrote to  me, and she said:         My husband and I are middle class, raising two children       [both] under 6. . . . We have been worried about the       financial burden of paying for 2 children in full-time child       care.        The $300, per child, will be placed directly towards child       care so . . . we [don't] have to worry about how my       participation in the workforce affects us, and allow us to       participate more in the economy.    She continued:         I believe these payments will allow more parents,       especially mothers, to participate more fully in the       workforce, [allowing] them more time to pursue training, and       help American families [get] food on the table. From the       bottom of my heart, thank you.    She really tells the story. You know in Connecticut and in Georgia  that not everybody has gone back to work that could find work; in part,  because employers are finally starting to pay more, but so much of the  time because they can't find childcare or they can't afford childcare.  We know that. That is what these tax cuts are all about.   They are about the dignity of work. All work has dignity, whether you  punch a clock or swipe a badge, whether you work on a salary or work  for tips, whether you are raising children, or whether you are caring  for aging parents. Raising children is work. Raising children is work.  It is a hell of a lot more work than moving money from one overseas  bank account to another or checking the balance in your stock  portfolio.   That didn't stop Senator McConnell and the Republican majority 2 or 3  years ago from rewarding the CEOs and hedge fund managers and Swiss  bank account holders. We all remember what happened. Mitch McConnell-- and the lobbyists lining up down the hall--and  [[Page S6613]]  the politicians who always do their bidding passed their tax cut for  the wealthy and corporations that outsource jobs. You know what they  promised? They promised it would all trickle down and have more jobs  and workers in Savannah--the hometown of the Senator from Georgia--that  there will be more jobs and the workers would get more pay and the  companies would invest more in the workforce.   Well, it didn't exactly happen that way. They kept their money for  themselves. They spent that money on stock buybacks. Unsurprisingly,  where did that money go? It goes in the pockets, mostly, of executives.   Now, this year, without a single vote from Republicans in Congress,  we passed tax cuts for everyone else. It is a pretty simple contrast.   Whose side are you on? Do you want tax cuts for billionaires and  corporations--that is what they did 4 years ago; that is what the  President and the Congress did 4 years ago--or do you want tax cuts for  working families? That is what Senator Warnock's and Senator Ossoff's  and President Biden's elections meant in November and January of this  year; that instead of more tax cuts for the richest people in the  country--though that bill, 70 percent of the tax cuts or the benefits  went to the richest 1 percent--now we are seeing our tax cut goes to 90  percent of the families in this country.   Every single month we are showing parents and workers we are on your  side. We will not stop fighting to make sure parents' hard work pays  off for years to come.   I yield the floor.
