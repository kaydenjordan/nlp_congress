 Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), who is the majority leader of the House, for our first official  colloquy.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland. I  appreciate his kind remarks and would return those as well.   The gentleman is well-versed at this process and is a noble battler  in the debate of ideas. I look forward to having continued  conversations about, not only the areas where we may have some  differences, but how we can find common ground. The gentleman is very  good at working with both sides to find common ground, and, obviously,  right now we are in the middle of one of those differences that  hopefully can get resolved.   As we have been in these meetings at the White House with the other  leaders, both House and Senate, Republican and Democrat, the  unfortunate thing is that we have been at an impasse. The President,  through his Department of Homeland Security, has made a formal request  and a detailed request for the amount of money it will take to secure  our border; to properly give our agents--the people who are risking  their lives to keep our country safe--the tools they need. It requires  a lot of things. It might require more border patrol agents, more tools  and technology, but clearly also physical barriers. That seems to be  the area where we have had an impasse.                                time  1230    I know that as the President put a formal offer on the table backed  up by the experts at the Department of Homeland Security for what it  will take to secure the border, up until this point, we haven't seen a  formal proposal response to counter that offer, if, in fact, the  gentleman's side does agree that we need to secure the border. The  President has made a formal request that came from our experts at the  Department of Homeland Security.   The only offer I have seen put on the table is the Speaker's offer,  and I am not even sure if it was serious, when she said she would  support $1. Now, I know the gentleman from Maryland would hopefully  recognize that $1 is not a serious counteroffer.   The President has had multiple meetings at the White House and has  continued to extend an invitation for whenever there is a serious  counteroffer that can be backed up with an explanation of how that can  actually secure our border, if, in fact, that is the objective of the  other side.   Can the gentleman from Maryland share with me when that counteroffer  will be made, when a formal, serious proposal to get our government  back open and secure our border will be put on the table?    Reclaiming my time, those were not our bills. The House  had a negotiation going on with the Senate. The Senate, as the  gentleman knows, passed some bills--not all of the bills that were  brought to the House floor, but brought some bills that were different  from the House bills. As you know, when the Senate passes a bill and  the House has a different version, you go to conference committee. You  don't just say: ``We are going to take the Senate bill.''   Also, as you brought that bill to the floor, the Speaker, the  majority leader brought to the floor as part of that package a bill  that did not pass the Senate floor, a bill that would have reversed the  Mexico City policy. That change was dramatic because that would have  allowed taxpayer money to go to foreign government entities that  provide abortion.   It has been the policy of this country, since Ronald Reagan went to  Mexico to deliver that speech and create the Mexico City policy, that  we don't give taxpayer money to fund abortion. And I know that has gone  back and forth through different administrations.   This President has made it very clear that he will strictly enforce  the Mexico City policy. That bill on the floor would have reversed it.  That is not language that passed the Senate floor.   In addition to that, if you go back throughout these negotiations, at  the very beginning, the President has been talking about a crisis at  the border. The crisis at the border is very real. In our first meeting  with the leaders in the Situation Room at the White House, both the  Speaker and the minority leader of the Senate interrupted the Secretary  of Homeland Security every time she tried to go through this new crisis  that we are seeing.   It is not just the drugs, which are dramatic and we need to stop. It  is not just the human trafficking, which is dramatic and we need to  stop. It is not just the murders that are happening. There are murders  that happened in so many States.   In your State of Maryland, just recently, someone who is in this  country illegally from El Salvador was sentenced to life in prison  without parole in Montgomery County, Maryland, for the murder of  someone, and he had no remorse for his crime.    We just saw a police officer in California who was murdered by  someone who came back and forth through this country illegally multiple  times because we don't have physical barriers to secure our border.   So that presentation was interrupted, and we never got through the  full presentation; but ultimately, the Secretary of Homeland Security  has laid out why we have a crisis at the border, and it needs to be  resolved, and they went into a detailed breakdown of costs to secure  the border.   So at issue right here, now, is a difference in amount. If your side  truly does agree that we have to secure our border, which I have heard  the Speaker, the minority leader, and others say they need to secure  the border, yet they haven't been willing to agree to more than $1 in  the request that has been made by the administration to secure the  border.   So the real question is, at the heart of this debate, if we are all  for border security, we can talk about border security.   In fact, back in 2006, President Obama, when he was a Senator, talked  about the need for securing the border when he voted for the Fence Act.  The minority leader, Mr. Schumer, at the time voted for the Fence Act.  That language, the language--and you can call it whatever you like: a  fence, a wall, cement, steel slats. But ultimately, it is law, language  that allows what can and can't be built.   The language that Minority Leader Schumer at the time voted for in  2006 would have given the Department of Homeland Security many of the  tools they need in language, but not the money. And so now we are at a  point where, if it is all of a sudden he is against that kind of  physical structure that he was for in `06, he ought to explain why, and  so should others who have maybe changed their position.   But if the language in 2006 would give the Secretary of Homeland  Security the tools they need and the authority they need to actually  start securing the ports of the border that are between ports of  entry--we have ports of entry, and everybody knows where those are. And  we, by the way, stopped a lot of really bad people from coming into our  country at ports of entry. What we don't know is how many people come  through the areas where we have no ports of entry, where we have no  borders.   Everybody recognizes that you can't just stop people at the points of  entry and then have no protection in the hundreds of miles--we are  talking about over 500 miles of unprotected area of this country on the  southern border where there is a crisis that is growing every single  day.   And if we acknowledge that--now, I know the minority leader and the  Speaker went on TV the other night and said it is a fabricated crisis.  How could you call this a fabricated crisis when you see deaths, when  you see over 90 percent of the heroin that comes into this country and  kills Americans every single day is coming across our southern border.  That is not a fabricated crisis. Those are real serious things that are  happening, that are bad.   There are good people who come to this country. America is the  greatest country in the world for letting people in legally. We let  over a million people into our country legally every single year, and  it enriches our country. It is a legal process. And there are millions  of people waiting to come to this country the right way.   So while we recognize that greatness of our country, we also  recognize that there are people who are bad people who come into our  country every single day as well, and we need to have the tools to  secure our border so we can stop that.   So the real question is: How much money is the other side willing to  support to actually secure the border?   If the department that is tasked with keeping our country safe is  saying they need $5.7 billion, if you agree to a smaller number, if you  want to put on the table a smaller number--it is not $1, and let's at  least recognize that was an insult. So if it is not $1, then what is  the amount you will support and put on the table to start a real  negotiation to solve this crisis?   I yield to the gentleman.    Reclaiming my time, Lindsey Graham did say we need to  build the wall. Lindsey Graham has a different solution, I am sure,  than the gentleman from Maryland. So let's be clear.   And I was speaking to Senator Graham last night about this. He wants  to start building the wall. And clearly, your side has not been  willing.   And the President, by the way, in the meeting in the Oval Office, in  the Situation Room, 2 days ago looked at the Speaker directly and said:  Okay. We don't agree even on some of these other areas of government  that haven't been open, but if you will agree to work with me on the  wall, I will support another 30 days of keeping all government going,  even on the areas we disagree, but to open everything up and continue  negotiations on the wall. And the Speaker said no.   We could have everything open today, but the Speaker is the one who  is being held hostage by the far left elements of your party because  she is yet to agree to anything, not putting more than $1.    She said on TV last week she would support $1. That is an insult. And  I have yet to see, in any of the meetings I have been in, her  willingness to support more than that.   And so we could have everything opened today. That offer has been put  on the table. The President, himself, has said you can write the  definition of the wall. You can ban cement wall. The President has  already acknowledged he would be willing to support that. He would be  willing to support a lower number if you can justify how it secures the  border, but that offer has never been put on the table.   We could end this crisis today. Twenty-one days in is too long. And  there is a solution. But the solution includes, it is not going to be  your way or the highway. You can't say: ``No, we want everything or  nothing.'' You have got to be willing to put something on the table  that will secure the border of this country, or just say you are not  for border security. But you can't say you are for border security and  then not agree to more than $1.   I yield to the gentleman.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman is  finished. We will, obviously, have more time to go back and forth on  this, but let's keep in mind a few facts.   First of all, the last shutdown of the United States Government was  dubbed the Schumer shutdown because the Senate minority leader wanted  to force his way on DACA.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman for one moment.    Oh, it lasted very shortly because the gentleman from  New York realized he was on the wrong side of the issue, just like  right now your side is on the wrong side of this issue opposing border  security.   Let's be very clear what the fight is about, and it shouldn't be a  fight. It is a fight because the President has said: Here is a proposal  that my Department of Homeland Security has brought that said these are  the tools they need to keep the country safe with a crisis at the  border.   It can't be denied. I know some on your side want to deny it. I don't  think the gentleman from Maryland denies it. But, clearly, when the  Senate minority leader and the Speaker of the House go on national TV  and say it is a fabricated crisis at the border, the American people  see what is happening at the border. We can debate how best to solve  it.   The President, through the Department of Homeland Security, has put  down a proposal of what it is going to take. This is not a new idea.   Obviously, the President ran on this as a front-and-center issue. He  not only ran on it, but he was elected by the American people as  President to carry out border security and build a wall. It was part of  the national debate.   I know some people on your side don't even want to recognize that  that election occurred and the result, but it happened.    You were not the majority leader when that happened. He  was elected on that. We were still in the majority.   Let's remember why we are here. To think that this is some new idea  the President is bringing forward is ignoring the history, and let's go  through some of that history.   Obviously, it was front and center in the presidential election, and  he was elected in large part on building a wall to secure our country's  border.   Then we go to the first spending bill as he was President, and we had  a disagreement. There were a lot of things that we were in disagreement  on.   We wanted to rebuild our military, and we finally came to a 2-year  agreement to do just that. It was critically important to start  rebuilding the military of this country that was decimated, to give our  men and women in uniform who risk their lives for our country a much- needed pay raise. We finally did that.   In that negotiation, the President wanted and he was talking about  $25 billion for full border security, to build out the full 550 miles  that are not secure right now, and they are well identified. The  gentleman from Maryland knows those areas where we haven't built walls.  Sure, we have got some money to build walls. There is about 120 miles  of wall being built, wall that is not all cement. Some of it is steel  slats.   Let the experts figure out the best way to secure our border. We are  not the architects of the border. Let the experts be that.   But there is some wall being built, but not enough, especially in the  areas where Federal law today prohibits wall from being built.   You want to know how ridiculous some of the laws are right now that  we are trying to change? Federal law prohibits the President from  building walls in the most cost-effective way, in the most efficient  way. Why would we have those kinds of prohibitions in law?   We passed a bill through the House before the shutdown happened. You  voted no. A lot of your side voted no. I think all your side, in fact,  voted no. But it was a bill the President would have signed that would  have given him the tools he needs to secure the border.   It went over to the Senate. The reason it didn't get to the  President's desk is not because there wasn't Republican support. They  have a 60-vote rule in the Senate.   I can disagree. You might even disagree, I don't know. I disagree on  that. On appropriations bills, they should at least let the majority  rule so we can properly govern this country in a more efficient manner.  But they have a 60-vote requirement.   So the Senate minority, the Democrats in the Senate, all voted  together to block it, and that led to a shutdown. That bill would have  kept the government running and secured the border, but Democrats voted  no in the House, Democrats voted no in the Senate, and so we have a  shutdown.   How are we going to get out of this? How are we going to get it  resolved? We can talk about hostages. We can talk about the people on  your side of the aisle who refuse to support any border security with a  dollar amount behind it. You can use words all day, but words don't  secure our borders. Borders secure our border. Walls and barriers  secure our border.   The President has said that you can call it and define it whatever  you want. He has been very flexible in wanting to negotiate. But in  every one of those meetings, there has not been a counteroffer put on  the table by your side.   If we want to resolve the crisis, it involves both sides coming  together. The President is already out there publicly, in our meetings,  saying he is willing to negotiate and come to a different place.    You should work with your side to come up with definitions, to come  up with a different dollar amount. But it has to end in securing our  border. If we all agree on that, it has to end in the actual language  and dollars to accomplish that objective.   The President said: I will give you 30 more days. Even though we  don't agree on some of these other things, I will agree to sign that  into law, if you will agree to work with me on the wall.   The Speaker said no. It was the Speaker who said no, not the  President. That is why we are at day 21.   We didn't even need to be at day 1. We passed a bill out of the  House. The Senate killed it because every Democrat voted no.   So here we are. Republicans and Democrats and everybody in this room  know how we can solve this problem, but it is not by you all sitting  there and saying we only are going to support a dollar and nothing  more. Real money has to be put on the table to solve the crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I know that we are  closing this. I do want to go back.   Last year, when the President signed the omnibus bill to keep the  government open, at that time he said: This won't happen again. He laid  down a marker last year that, okay, he will go along with a bill that  is far short of what he needs to secure the border, but he wasn't going  to do it again. That was a year ago.   So everybody has known that this issue is going to have to get  resolved because lives are at risk. The President, like we did, took an  oath to protect this country. That is what this is about. We surely  want to open up all areas of government, but keeping the border secure  is part of that. And so when the President signed the bill last year,  he said: It is not going to happen again.   Now, obviously, when we came to this year, there were some people  telling the President the votes weren't there to put the money in place  to secure the border. In fact, the now Speaker, when she was minority  leader, went to the White House and told the President: The votes  aren't there in the House to fund your request for the wall.    We had over 218, clearly.    Good for you, and, obviously, things have changed.   But when the minority leader then told the President the votes  weren't there to fund the wall, maybe the President took her at her  word and thought that was an accurate assessment of the House. It  turned out she was wrong. We passed the bill to fund the President's  request.   The House had a difference with the Senate. It is surely not the  first time in this country's history where the Senate passed one bill  that was short of what we needed to secure the border, and we came back  and passed a bill to fully fulfill the President's request to secure  the border. So we ended up at an impasse not because there weren't  enough Republican votes, but because there were no Democratic votes to  do that. And now we are here today.   Let's talk about quotes. He wants to quote Republicans. I will quote  a Democrat. I won't tell you who it is first.   In 2006, when there was a bill to put $50 billion in place, over 25  years, for border security, this Democrat in the Senate said it will  authorize some badly needed funding for better fences and better  security along our borders, and that should help stem some of the tide  of illegal immigration in this country.   That was in 2006, for over $50 billion for border security, and the  Democrat who said that was then-Senator Barack Obama. So you can quote  Republicans. I will quote Democrats.    That bill passed, but it didn't put the money there, and  that is why we are here.   And again, he can talk and give great speeches and say we need $50  billion, but if you don't appropriate the $50 billion, the money is not  there to actually build the fencing that is needed.    And so now we need to talk about how to fund the wall,  how to fund the structure, call it what you will. And again, the  President, himself, has said you can title it however you want. You can  ban cement fencing.   But at the same time, what Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer voted for  in 2006 is the authority to build what is needed, but they didn't put  the money there. It is time to finally back up the word. It is hot air  until you put the money on the table.   So the money has been put on the table by the Republicans, at least  an offer, backed up with real data of where the money would be spent to  secure this country. There has not been a counteroffer.    So let's talk now about the final issue, and that is adjournment.   I know later today the House will be voting to adjourn. Last week,  the House, under the Democratic majority, as you proudly talk about the  fact that you all are in the majority, you all voted to adjourn. We  voted not to adjourn.   We should stay here to get this job done, to finally have a real  negotiation to solve our differences. We can solve our differences, but  we are not going to solve them by continuing to adjourn every weekend  when we should be negotiating and getting the government back open and  securing the border.   On this final thought, would the gentleman address the vote, the  motion that will be made later to adjourn that we oppose?   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland.   And when you look at the women who are coming across through this  trek to try to cross the border, first of all, asylum has been offered  by Mexico to all of the people as part of that caravan. Thousands of  people were offered asylum, work permits--turned it down. There is a  legal way to seek asylum.   It seems to me, if another country offers you asylum and you want to  leave your country, you take the asylum, but they turned it down. But  the women who are coming over, Doctors Without Borders has done a study  and said that over 30 percent of the women who are on this trek have  been sexually assaulted or worse.   We should all want to address this crisis. There is a way to solve  the crisis. If we talk about hostages, both sides can use terms. But  when the President of the United States and the White House look at the  Speaker and say, ``I will sign a bill that contains things that we have  yet to negotiate that I don't agree with; I will sign it if you agree  to keep negotiating,'' and the Speaker of the House said no, that is  the my-way-or-the-highway approach that is wrong.   The President has put multiple things on the table, has offered to  negotiate on terms, on dollars, on every front, and not one  counteroffer. That has got to change. We can solve this crisis, but it  is going to involve both sides being willing to put something on the  table to solve the border security crisis. I hope we can get there, and  we will keep working at it.   I appreciate the comments and the thoughts of the gentleman from  Maryland, and I truly do believe that he wants to solve this. We have  some differences. Let's keep working and get it done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
