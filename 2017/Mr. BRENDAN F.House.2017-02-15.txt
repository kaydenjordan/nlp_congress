 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is literally  every day now that something new and even more shocking comes out about  the Trump administration and its connections with the Russian  Government. Just last night, it was reported that, according to  American intelligence officials, at least four members of the Trump  campaign, senior members, were in constant contact with Russian  intelligence officials for a year.   Mr. Speaker, this is not so much about Republican or Democrat as it  is about democracy, our democracy. I want to thank those few  Republicans in the Senate who have had the courage to put country  before party and come forward and demand an independent, bipartisan  investigation. Sadly, that has been met with silence on the Republican  side of the aisle in this House.   We must have a 9/11-like commission to investigate to what extent  Russian intelligence infiltrated our election.                            ____________________     BOYLE of Pennsylvania. I am very excited to be joined  in this effort with the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, this comes out of a number of conversations that my  colleague, Marc Veasey, and I have had just in the back of this Chamber  about both of our experiences growing up, which are very similar,  coming from working class or blue-collar parents who worked very hard  to make sure that their children had opportunities that they may not  have had. In many ways, that is the American experience: people who  work hard, play by the rules, pay taxes, raise their kids, and hope  that their kids will have opportunities that they didn't have. That is  what built the American middle class.   What is so difficult about the time in which we are living is that it  is not just about an economic growth that is 2 percent; it is not just  about the statistics that we often cite on this House floor. It is  about a loss of hope in the power of the American Dream.   There was a statistic that came out--having just said it is not about  statistics, let me cite one--that I think is, in fact, very telling and  really shocking. Ninety-two percent of the World War II generation went  on to earn more than their parents did. For the generation of which I  am a part and Marc is a part, taken at exactly the same point in life,  that figure is exactly one-half--46 percent.   Consider another statistic. Compared to the year 2000, in inflation- adjusted figures, the middle class has less wealth today than at that  point 16, 17 years ago. That is the only decade-and-a-half that you can  look at in American history in which the middle class is worse off than  the decade-and-a-half that preceded it.   So while these are presented as just ``economic issues,'' really,  they are much more than that. They strike at the very heart of who we  are as Americans and what we stand for. So we are going to be talking,  as part of this caucus and over the next close to an hour or so and for  many weeks and months to come, about what we can do specifically for  the blue-collar economy, for those who work with their hands and for  those who have been, in many ways, held back because of transitions  that our economy has faced.   I have many things that I want to talk about as part of that, but I  don't want to go on too long because we have been joined by someone who  doesn't just talk the talk, but has walked the walk, a union worker  himself, an ironworker, I believe, a good friend of mine from  Massachusetts, and someone who works hard himself both in his previous  occupation and now standing up and fighting for working people.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. We are planning, actually, to  talk about someone who was, quite frankly, the worst Labor Secretary  nominee in our Nation's history; literally putting the fox in charge of  the henhouse. You can tell I am from the city because I botched that  metaphor, but maybe Marc will be able to help me with that.   To put someone in charge of the Labor Department who had a complete  history of ripping off fast food workers, paying in some places, in  some Hardy's, below minimum wage because they were falsely classifying  workers, I can't think of really someone who, in many ways, epitomized  the kind of greed that we see in our economy today than the former  Labor Secretary nominee.   That actually works to a point that I wanted to raise. I think it is  a big part of what has been happening in our American economy today.   In the post-World War II era, for roughly three decades we had large  gains in productivity and large gains in wage growth. That is from  roughly the mid-1940s to about the late 1970s. You saw workers becoming  more productive, working harder and smarter and better than ever, and  you saw wages growing to almost exactly the same percentage: 97 percent  increase in productivity, 91 percent increase in wage growth.   But then, over the last 30 years, something quite different has  happened. The productivity growth has continued. The American worker is  more productive than at any point in our Nation's history and is the  most productive workforce in the world. That is not boasting; that is  an economic fact.    Yet, since the 1970s, wages have barely gone up at all. Those are the  averages. That doesn't account for the fact that when you are talking  about the blue-collar economy, when you are talking about those who  don't have a higher education, when you control for just that group,  wages are actually lower today than they were 30, 40 years ago.   Now you might wonder: Well, how are CEOs doing? Have they shared in  the pain?   Well, 50 years ago, CEOs made 20 times what typical workers make. As  of 2013, they make just under 300 times a typical worker's pay--from  making 20 times more than your average worker to more than 300 times  your average worker.   I believe in capitalism and I believe in the market, but clearly  something is deeply wrong in our economy, the structure of it, when we  have that sort of situation, when workers are not being rewarded for  their hard work.   I recall my colleague, Mr. Veasey, talking a little bit about his  family experience and the similarities to my own and the fact that  blue-collar workers like our parents actually have fewer opportunities  in America today than they did when we were growing up: fewer job  opportunities for lower wages and not as rich benefits. I say not as  rich benefits, but, actually, very insecure benefits in terms of health  care and a lack of a defined pension.   If Mr. Veasey would possibly talk more about that and other parts of  the heart and soul of our Blue Collar Caucus.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Marc is exactly  right. I was so glad that he brought up unions and the important role  that they play because when I talked earlier about the fact that for  30, 40 years we had an economy that was working well, that saw  productivity gains but also wage gains in roughly equal proportion. And  then suddenly in the last 30 years you have seen that change. You have  seen the productivity gains continue, but you have seen wage growth at  practically zero.   Well, it is not a coincidence that for three, four decades you had  strong unions, from the mid-1940s until about the late 1970s or so.  They were there fighting for workers, fighting for increased wages,  fighting for a secure retirement, fighting for real health benefits.   Then you saw an economy beginning in the early 1980s where the power  of unions declined. The number of workers involved in the workforce who  were unionized declined. I don't think it is a coincidence that just as  you saw the number of workers in unions decline and the number of  unions decline and the power of unions decline, you also saw real wages  decline. Certainly no coincidence. For 70 years, worker wages and the  strength of unions have moved in tandem, going up together or going  down together.   Critical to the strength of the American workforce are provisions  like Davis-Bacon that have existed since the late 1940s that guarantee  a prevailing wage on Federal projects. It helps not just those workers  who are unionized. It lifts all workers because when you have a union  that is out there fighting for higher wages and fighting for better  benefits for its members, it helps all workers. It helps all of those  in the workforce.   I talked earlier, and I was thinking about this when Marc was talking  about his family's experience in those towns in the Dallas-Fort Worth  area. I remember from my own family's experience, we were very lucky  that my dad, without a college education, with the equivalent of a high  school education, after many years of trying, was able to break in to  Teamsters Local 169 as a warehouseman. It simply means he worked in a  warehouse for Acme Markets. He did that for 25 years. There were a  couple thousand such workers who were employed in the city of  Philadelphia.   Then in the late 1990s, around the year 2000, they closed all those  warehouses. They laid off close to 2,000 workers. They decided that  they would set up shop, instead, in a place where they could pay the  workers half the wages, reduced benefits, and not as many workers.  Fortunately, things worked okay for my dad. He ended up on his feet. He  spent the last 16 years as a worker, as a janitor for SEPTA, the  Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.   Many of the guys who got laid off in their 50s and 60s weren't as  lucky. Many of them never found, again, a job as well paying or as  secure. Some of them turned to alcohol. Some of them turned to drugs. A  couple even committed suicide. Again, I want to show that these are not  just economic issues. Sometimes the elites--and I mean elites not just  on the Republican side; elites of all political ideologies--sometimes  look at these as just economic issues. They are real-life issues.   When we see the diseases of hopelessness that are happening right now  in places like western Pennsylvania or Texas or Kentucky or, really,  all parts of our country--and, by the way, White, Black, Hispanic,  Asian, what we are talking about touches all races, all ethnicities,  all backgrounds--these diseases of hopelessness that have been on the  dramatic rise are a real problem for our society, but to look at them  as just a drug problem or just an alcohol problem or just a mental  health problem and not see the economic link is very naive and  incomplete and will never solve the real problem, go to the heart of  solving the real problem.   Mr. Speaker, Marc and I both look forward--he had mentioned it to  me--to periodically coming to this House floor and talking about this  new President's record when it comes to addressing these issues. He  talked a lot during the campaign, made a lot of promises. He is great  at making promises. In fact, you would probably say he is the best ever  at making promises. Well, we are going to be showing his record, to see  if he is keeping those promises to the American people.   On some issues, he sounded like a Democrat. On some issues, when it  came to infrastructure or trade, he said things that I can agree with  and do agree with. Now that he is President, let's see if the record  matches the rhetoric. We are going to be here to hold him accountable,  to hold both sides accountable because, you know, the fact is this  town, for many decades, has not looked out for the blue-collar worker.  We are quick to indict the other side where they are wrong, and I think  appropriately so.   This Blue Collar Caucus is for all those who really want to make a  difference in the blue-collar economy, for those who want to put the  American worker first and foremost. I can say President Trump is not  off to a great start with some of his Cabinet picks, who look more like  the board at Goldman Sachs than any union hall. I hope that this first  month will not be a sign of more to come, but whether he is getting an  A or an F, we are going to be here to grade his performance on these  real-life, meat-and-potato issues that matter to the vast majority of  American families.    Mr. Speaker, Marc and I represent two different regions of the  country, two different areas, yet, in many ways, exactly the same kind  of folks. I wanted to know what Marc is hearing as he goes out into his  community in Fort Worth about how things are going for American workers  and what they want from this administration.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. We have been joined by Donald  Norcross, our colleague within the Democratic Caucus and here in the  House, and my neighbor from just the other side of the Delaware River.  Marc brought up football a couple times. Yes, he is a diehard Cowboys  fan. Well, as a Philadelphia Eagles fan, I am glad to have been joined  by another Eagles fan, someone much like Stephen Lynch, someone who  doesn't just talk the talk but has walked the walk, who has worked with  his hands and is someone who brings great credibility to these issues,  as someone who himself was out as a blue-collar worker every day and  now gets the chance to fight for them here on the House floor where  that fight is badly needed.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, recently, Deborah  Lipstadt, American historian and author of influential books such as  Denying the Holocaust, wrote an important article in The Atlantic. In  this article, entitled ``The Trump Administration's Flirtation with  Holocaust Denial,'' Lipstadt specifies an important distinction in  types of Holocaust denial.   Most people are familiar with what Lipstadt identifies as ``hardcore  Holocaust denial.'' In this type of rhetoric, anti-Semites argue that  the Holocaust simply did not occur; that there was no systematic plan  to destroy the Jewish people based solely on their religion.   This type of hate speech has unfortunately been espoused by those who  seek to delegitimize the suffering of the Jewish people since the  Holocaust began. It is not acceptable and we must do all we can to  teach our children the tragic events of the Holocaust and how to  counter such hateful rhetoric.   Yet, perhaps a more insidious form of denial rhetoric has begun to  creep into our national discussion.   This is what Lipstadt terms ``softcore Holocaust denial.'' This form  of denial, argues Lipstadt, ``uses different tactics but has the same  end-goal . . . It does not deny the facts, but it minimizes them,  arguing that Jews use the Holocaust to draw attention away from  criticism of Israel . . . .   ``Softcore denial also includes Holocaust minimization, as when  someone suggests it was not so bad.'' Softcore denial, then, is  potentially more insidious than our traditional form of denial, by  minimizing the suffering of the Jewish people and suggesting that while  the Holocaust may have occurred, it was not about the Jews per se.   By minimizing the suffering of the target of the Holocaust and the  six million Jews who perished at the hands of the Nazis, we are denying  the truth and setting ourselves up to forget the worst genocidal  massacre in human history.   What is more disgusting and unacceptable, though, is that the  President of the United States is now espousing these dangerous and  hateful ideas.   By refusing time and again to acknowledge that Jews were the targets  and victims of the Holocaust, our President is denying the truth of the  Holocaust and is aiding and abetting the Holocaust deniers and White  Nationalists in their goals of once again persecuting individuals based  on their ethnicity, religion, race, etc.   We must do better. I call on the President to recall his statement  and make clear that the Holocaust was a systematic persecution of the  Jewish people.   Anything less than this outright admission is Holocaust denial.                            ____________________
