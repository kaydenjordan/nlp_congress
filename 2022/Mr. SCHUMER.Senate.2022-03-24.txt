 Madam President, well, it was another busy and  productive evening here on the Senate floor. Yesterday, we confirmed  another six judges to important positions on the Federal bench and all  of them, I am happy to say, with bipartisan support. We now have  confirmed 56--56--judges under this Democratic Senate majority, and I  thank my colleagues for their patience and for keeping the pace moving  here on the floor last night.   There are two judges I am especially proud to have confirmed. First,  we confirmed Hector Gonzalez to serve as a district judge for the  Eastern District of New York. Mr. Gonzalez is a most deserving, most  qualified, and most inspiring individual to serve as a judge. Born in  Cuba, raised in Queens, he is the embodiment of the American dream.   We also finally confirmed a judge who has inspired me for more than a  decade--Ali Nathan, now confirmed as circuit judge for the Second  Circuit. When I first met her, I thought, ``Here is someone who is  truly special,'' and I still believe that to this day. And, to boot,  she increases the diversity of the court as only the second-ever openly  [[Page S1758]]  lesbian to sit on the Second Circuit--open lesbian on the Second  Circuit. I believe that is in the whole Federal judiciary. We will  check that.   The Second Circuit is one of the most consequential courts in the  entire country, calling for only the best of the best to sit on the  bench, and Ali Nathan fits the bill.   I am glad both of these nominees were confirmed with bipartisan  support.   On the legislative front, the Senate is pressing ahead on bipartisan  competition legislation to lower costs, boost American manufacturing,  and fuel another generation of American scientific ingenuity.   For the information of all Senators, last night, I moved to file  cloture on both the substitute amendment and the underlying legislation  for our competitiveness legislation. As I have said previously, our  plan has been to take up the House-passed version of this legislation  and amend it with the exact same language the Senate approved last  summer with bipartisan support, the U.S. Innovation and Competition  Act.   Once we pass this amended bill, it will go back to the House, and  they will be able to request a conference committee. As convoluted as  the Senate process often is, the bottom line is that the train is  moving forward when it comes to this bill.   A lot of Senators from both parties have worked for years to see  legislation like this reach the President's desk. If the United States  is to thrive in the 21st century, we need to keep our competitive edge  in science and innovation, and this bill would do just that. We must  continue growing American jobs. We must continue to lower the price of  critical technologies like semiconductors, and this bill would do just  that as well.   We have a few more steps to take before we reach a conference, but  support of this bill is strong and bipartisan, and the process is  moving forward.                                    Russia    Madam President, on PNTR, negotiations are continuing on passing  bipartisan legislation to strip Russia of permanent normal trade  relations with the United States. This legislation is greatly needed  and timely as President Biden continues meeting with European allies  regarding Putin's despicable war on Ukraine.   The House passed PNTR by 424 to 8--424 to 8--and the Senate  absolutely should pass it with equally strong bipartisan support. There  is no justification to delay a popular policy that would deal a heavy,  heavy blow on Putin's Russia, especially given that it got such strong  Republican support, including from Leader McCarthy in the House.   Yesterday, I am happy to say, my team and I had a productive series  of talks with Senators Crapo, Wyden, Manchin, and the White House. We  reached an agreement with Senator Crapo to move forward on PNTR as soon  as we can, while addressing oil ban legislation separately. That way,  the PNTR legislation can go right to the President's desk.    I hope the rest of my colleagues will get with the program quickly so  we can send PNTR legislation to the President's desk as soon as  possible. We need a little more work, but we are close to passing this  urgent legislation.                     Nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson    Madam President, finally, on SCOTUS, after 3 marathon days of  speeches and questions and answers, Judge Jackson's public testimony  before the Senate Judiciary Committee has concluded.   After watching the judge weather 3 long days before the Senate  Judiciary Committee, my respect and my admiration for her have never  been higher. There is not a shred of doubt in my mind that she merits  confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.   Once again, a handful of Members on the other side--not all, just a  handful--tried to smear the judge with misleading and downright false  accusations. Once again, the judge remained poised, thoughtful, and  strong in her answers.   As Senator Booker said yesterday, no amount of cynicism and nastiness  could overshadow that Judge Jackson's nomination is a cause for  celebration. She is not only a historic nominee; she is one of the most  qualified nominees to ever come before the Judiciary Committee.   Yesterday, Chairman Durbin announced that the Judiciary Committee  will meet on Monday afternoon to begin the process of reporting Judge  Jackson's nomination out of committee. There is nothing in Judge  Jackson's record suggesting that the committee should have difficulty  reporting her nomination out. Once the committee concludes its work, I  will move to have her nomination come to the floor in short order. The  Senate is on track to have Judge Jackson confirmed as Justice Jackson  by the end of this work period.   I commend Judge Jackson for her excellent testimony over the course  of this week. It is not easy to endure 3 days of testimony with the  entire Nation watching, but Judge Jackson has erased any doubt that she  is brilliant, she is beloved, and she belongs--unquestionably belongs-- on the U.S. Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, as I have said all week long, there has  been an imperative for the Senate to unite and quickly pass legislation  stripping Russia of normal trade relation status with the United  States. The House has acted; the White House supports it.   As the President meets with our allies in Europe, it is very  important we send a message to the world that we are united in making  sure Putin pays a heavy price for his war on Ukraine. After the House  passed PNTR last week by 424 to 8, including the support from Leader  McCarthy, it is unreasonable and deadly wrong for the Senate not to do  the same, especially while the President is abroad. So we are seeking  consent to move this legislation forward ASAP.   After a day of long negotiations yesterday, I reached an agreement  with Senator Crapo, with concurrence from Senators Wyden and Manchin,  to move forward on PNTR while also taking action on oil ban legislation  separately.   Now, I understand that Senator Paul has further objection and is  demanding we amend this agreement with a major change to the  legislation. Senator Paul appears to be the lone Senator demanding  this. I believe that all other 99 Senators are in agreement to proceed.   Look, all of us want to see this bill move quickly because it is so  very much needed and it is so bipartisan. I  [[Page S1763]]  am willing to include, as part of our unanimous consent right now, that  Senator Paul be entitled to have his amendment with a majority vote  threshold.   The question before Senator Paul is, even though the vote was 424 to  8 in the House and is very bipartisan here in the Senate, is he going  to tank PNTR because his arcane interpretation is not forced into the  bill? Can Senator Paul take yes for an answer? Can he let us move  forward today to hold Putin accountable?   Every Senator would like his proposal or her proposal put in the  bill, but in the Senate, we vote; and we are willing to give the  Senator a vote, even though we greatly disagree with his interpretation  of the law that is here.   I truly, I earnestly, and I strongly hope that my Republican  colleague does not object to bipartisan legislation that would deal a  heavy, heavy blow on Putin's Russia, especially after the House of  Representatives acted with overwhelming bipartisan support.   Many of our Republican colleagues have criticized the Biden  administration for supposedly not acting quickly enough on Putin, but  now, one Republican Senator is holding up this overwhelmingly  bipartisan bill. I strongly hope some of my other Republican colleagues  can persuade Senator Paul to accept our agreement here so that we can  move forward. Let us be equally resolute in standing with Ukraine and  fighting back against Putin's brutal war by passing PNTR in the Senate  right away.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be  determined by the majority leader, following consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the en bloc consideration of  H.R. 6968, the Russian Oil Ban, and H.R. 7108, Russia PNTR, both of  which are at the desk; that there be 2 hours for debate on the bills en  bloc equally divided between the two leaders or designees; that it be  in order for Senator Crapo, or a designee, to offer the Crapo-Wyden  amendment at the desk to H.R. 6968; that there be 30 minutes for debate  equally divided prior to the vote on the amendment; that it be in order  for Senator Paul to offer the amendment at the desk to H.R. 7108; that  there be 2 hours for debate equally divided and controlled in the usual  form prior to a vote on the Paul amendment, and that these be the only  amendments in order to either bill; that upon the use or yielding back  of time, the bills be considered read a third time en bloc and the  Senate vote on passage of H.R. 7108, as amended, if amended, and H.R.  6968, as amended, if amended; finally, that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table without further intervening  action or debate.    Before I yield to my friend from the State of Maryland,  the author of the Magnitsky Act, let me just say this to my good friend  from Kentucky: Every Senator would like their amendment to be easily  inserted into a bill, but in the Senate, we vote. I am offering the  Senator a vote on his amendment. If each Senator said ``my way or the  highway,'' we would have total paralysis even on an important piece of  legislation like this.   I yield to the Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                    Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 4521     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motions on amendment No. 5002  and H.R. 4521 ripen at 5:30 p.m., Monday, March 28; that if cloture is  invoked on the substitute, all postcloture time be considered expired;  the remaining pending amendments be withdrawn; no further amendments be  in order; the substitute amendment be agreed to; the cloture motion on  the bill be withdrawn; the bill, H.R. 4521, be considered read a third  time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, with 60  affirmative votes required for passage, all without further intervening  action or debate.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?   The Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, yes, I give the Senator from Vermont my  firm commitment to do whatever I can to get an agreement to have votes  on his two motions to instruct when the message comes back from the  House on this measure.  [[Page S1768]]    Having made that commitment, I ask the Senator from Vermont whether  he might allow the Senate to agree to my original unanimous consent  request?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 725.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 791.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, March 24, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have four requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         COMMITIEE ON ARMED SERVICES    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, March 24, 2022, at 9:30 a.m., to  conduct a hearing.
