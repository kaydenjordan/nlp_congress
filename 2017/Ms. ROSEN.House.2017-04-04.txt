 Mr. Speaker, if today's vote on the previous question  fails, we will have the opportunity to vote on my bill, H.R. 1868,  Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017, which will reverse last night's  disastrous action by President Trump when he signed a partisan  congressional resolution allowing internet providers to sell their  customers' personal information without their knowledge or consent.   Before my time in Congress, I started my career as a systems analyst.  I have firsthand experience writing code, and I can tell you that the  first thing to protect vulnerable and sensitive data is to make sure it  is kept private.   S.J. Res. 34, which the House passed last Tuesday, unraveled those  vital protections for sensitive information belonging to millions of  Americans nationwide.                                time  1330    The resolution negating essential protections for private citizens  was signed by President Trump last night. The October 2016 FCC rule was  the only rule that required internet service providers to obtain  consumers' permission before selling their private internet browsing  history and other sensitive information.   I am simply shocked that my colleagues across the aisle would vote  for a measure that violates American privacy by selling your most  personal and intimate information, including your email content and  your app usage, all without your consent. Not only is this wrong and a  blatant violation of policy, but it jeopardizes Americans' personal  data and puts them at risk of hacking.   Repealing the FCC rule with S.J. Res. 34 allows broadband providers  to turn over your info to the highest bidder or anyone else they want,  including the government, without a warrant, without ever telling you.  That is right. I will repeat it. Repealing the FCC rule with S.J. Res.  34 allows broadband providers to turn over your private information to  the highest bidder or anyone else they want, including the government,  without a warrant, without ever telling you.   Even worse, S.J. Res. 34 also tells providers they no longer have to  use reasonable measures to protect consumers' personal information.  This is absolutely unacceptable. We are living in a time where identity  theft and internet hacking has become the new norm. We must provide  consumers with these protections. No American wants their most personal  information to be up for grabs.   Eliminating this rule prevents the FCC from publishing rules that are  substantially the same absent additional legislation, establishing a  very dangerous precedent for private citizens. Americans should have  the right to decide how their internet providers use their personal  information.   What this bill does, Mr. Speaker, is simple. This bill makes clear  that the American people's browser histories are not for sale. The  American people's health information: not for sale. The American  people's financial information: not for sale. And the American people's  location data: not for sale.   It is a simple concept and one I hope my colleagues across the aisle  will recognize and support. The American people don't want the  legislation that was signed last night. In overwhelming numbers, they  are calling Congress and letting it be known that they want to keep  their private information private.   I am proud to stand up for the American people by introducing the  Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017, which reverses this misguided  resolution and says, once and for all, that ISPs cannot sell customers'  personal information without their knowledge, without their permission.  This bill says that your privacy is not for sale, period.
