 Mr. Speaker, I thank the incredible gentlewoman from  North Carolina for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in the last 10 years, the number of Americans entering  apprenticeship programs has more than doubled--a success. The demand  among employers and workers in a variety of industries is an  endorsement of the apprenticeship model's promise to close the skills  gap and provide opportunities to millions of Americans--a great thing.   The legislation we are considering today, however, would shut down  efforts to expand apprenticeships and make the existing 80-year-old  registered apprenticeship program and system the only option.    Talking to job creators in my district, which I do extensively, I  have heard firsthand the needs for talented, new workers and their  challenges with the cumbersome apprenticeship system that limits  employer-led innovation for union and nonunion employment.   The registered apprenticeship system is not the gold standard; it is  the old standard. American workers and employers need a system as  innovative and dynamic as our current American economy.   Republicans offered an all-of-the-above approach that improves the  registered apprenticeship system and promotes flexibilities to  strengthen our workforce, particularly in manufacturing and  construction, and would allow the apprenticeship model to be applied  across all new industries such as tech, healthcare, logistics, and  energy--particularly, Mr. Speaker, as we strive to fortify U.S.  manufacturers and rebuild our infrastructure and repatriatize  manufacturers from around the world, including China.   We should not insist on ratio standards, but we should set very high  gold standards. So we should focus on baking pies, not cutting them up.   The economy workforce has evolved over the past 80 years. Our laws  should, too. I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.
