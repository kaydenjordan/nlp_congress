 I rise to speak today because I just finished up visiting  all 92 counties in our home State, and every one of them, especially at  the tail end, have backed what we have been doing here, especially  following the lead of President Trump.   When it comes to the particular issue of Syria, I think it begs the  question when people say it green-lighted what occurred there. What  would the reaction have been had we not gotten out of harm's way? I am  guessing it would have been a bigger fiasco in many different  dimensions.   The minority leader indicated that Mr. Paul's idea was horrible. I  want to make the point that, collectively, over the last 40 to 50  years, we have been engaged all the way back to the Vietnam war, where  we have been adventuresome and have done it where we have not paid for  it, and we are now in a pickle. That is why I was for what the  President decided to do. You cannot continue being engaged like this  when running trillion-dollar deficits--$22 trillion in debt. Hoosiers  understand that, and most Americans do as well.   So I am going to support Rand Paul's amendment, and I am glad that  the President finally had the guts to do what most Americans have been  for, and I am disappointed that the other side in any other situation  would have been for that exact action.   I yield the floor.
