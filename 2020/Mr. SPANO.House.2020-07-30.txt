 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the  resiliency of the people of my home State of Florida.   Floridians have long been recognized for their ability to persevere  amidst crisis and hardships. From hurricanes to flash floods, from war  efforts to pandemics, our homestead is the most resilient place in the  world, but it is the people who make it truly special.   During these difficult days, I have traveled throughout our district,  meeting unsung heroes in our communities. From first responders and  medical personnel risking their lives and health to small business  owners adjusting to continue serving their community, the dedication  and passion for others and for our community is truly inspiring.   It is during trying times that we truly get to know who we are, what  we are made of. And I can tell you this: The good people of Florida 15  stand strong.   Whether you live or work in Hillsborough, Polk, or Lake Counties, you  know how special our district and Main Streets truly are. So today, I  thought I would take just a moment to say thank you to all those who  make Florida 15 what we call it, our home.                 Honoring Lakeland City Manager Tony Delgado     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Tony Delgado  for his 23 years of service to the city of Lakeland, Florida.   Mr. Delgado began his service to city residents in 1997 as a  facilities assistant director and, through hard work and dedication,  quickly climbed the ranks to become Lakeland's city manager, known as  someone who is approachable and always accessible to his colleagues,  his staff, and the city's residents.   Mr. Delgado leaves behind a legacy of accomplishments, an impact that  won't soon be forgotten. Mr. Delgado has always been known as someone  who builds bridges and brings people together. In my time of knowing  him and his team, they have been nothing but helpful and professional,  exuding the values of our district.   A loving and devoted husband to his wife, Robin, I want to wish them  both the very, very best in the next chapter of their lives.   Tony, all the best to you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for  your hard work and your dedication. Lakeland is a better city, a better  community, because of your selfless service.                          Supporting Border Security     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to once again express my full  support of President Trump's efforts to secure our borders, restore law  and order, and complete the wall on our southwestern border.   Since I joined Congress, time and time again, Democrats in this  Chamber and their allies have sought to stop the President from  securing our borders and protecting the American people.   Even this week, Democratic leadership has continued this attack on  the President and on the American people. In multiple portions of the  bills meant to fund the government next year, Democrats have not only  prohibited funds from being used to build the wall, but they have also  sought to rescind funds already allocated for border security by  President Trump.   I have traveled to the border myself, and I will tell you this: Walls  work. And the Border Patrol officers I spoke with when I was there  agree: Walls work.   According to Customs and Border Protection, during the first 6 months  of 2020 this year, 180,000 people were apprehended or deemed  inadmissible. In 2019, last year, during the same period, this number  was almost 600,000. That is a reduction of 416,000 people, or a  whopping 70 percent.   A more secure border means safer communities across America, and as  of July 27, 256 miles of the border wall system has been completed.   As our Nation experiences social unrest from coast to coast, it is  critical that we restore law and order, to include our borders.  President Trump has pledged to continue to do just that, and I am proud  to stand with him in this effort.                            ____________________
