 Madam Speaker, we have an urgent problem that we must  immediately find common ground on to solve. If healthcare isn't  affordable, it is not accessible. That is why I led the introduction of  the State Health Care Premium Reduction Act, a bill to lower the cost  of health insurance premiums in the individual market by 10 percent, on  average, across the country. But that is only part of the solution.   Fifty-one percent of nonelderly people in my congressional district  have a preexisting condition. That is why it is critical that we pass  the bill that I have cosponsored, the Protecting Pre-Existing  Conditions and Making Health Care More Affordable Act of 2019.   I will fight this administration every day if they roll back  healthcare in this country. It is not perfect, but we have to put aside  the petty politics of the past and quit thinking that if we fix our  Nation's healthcare, somehow we are handing the other side a victory.   People across this country need our help. They need us to fix the  cost of prescription drugs. They need us to unleash generic  competition.                            ____________________
