 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to support  the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act.   Appropriately named after an American hero, the conference report  contains policy and funding initiatives that provide our military with  the resources necessary to restore readiness and rebuild combat  capability. Chairman Mac Thornberry has been very successful, with  leadership, to expedite this critical legislation in record time.   As Readiness Subcommittee chairman, I appreciate that the conference  report authorizes additional funding for training, spare parts,  equipment, and weapons systems maintenance.   The conference report also focuses on aviation readiness by  increasing flying hours, funding for spare parts, and establishing a  commission to examine the tragic rise in military aviation accidents.   Both the House and Senate bills address Navy surface forces  improvements in response to last year's collisions and tragic loss of  17 lives on the Fitzgerald and McCain. I appreciate the conference  report because it contains a range of provisions that improves the  operation of surface fleets.   The conference report provides critical funding for Fort Jackson and  continues construction of the mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility at  the Savannah River site to protect the environment in South Carolina  and Georgia.   It also supports our strongest ally in the Middle East, Israel, by  establishing defense partnerships to counter Iran's terrorist  activities.   In conclusion, I want to thank Chairman Thornberry again for his  success with his dedicated, professional staff. I also appreciate the  Readiness Subcommittee's distinguished ranking member, Madeleine  Bordallo of Guam, for her contributions to this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support the  bill.                                time  1045
