 Madam Speaker, as if things could not get any worse under  this administration, we found out last week that inflation is now at a  30-year high. This comes as Americans are worried about the cost of  Thanksgiving dinner, the cost of putting gas in their cars, and even  the cost of heating their homes for the winter.   Under this administration, inflation has metastasized at an alarming  rate across the country. Every small town in America feels the strain  of inflation. Every American family feels it. Every hardworking  taxpayer feels it. Yet, this administration is too blinded by its own  ignorance to figure out what is happening.   Madam Speaker, it is clear that the so-called Build Back Better  agenda was just a lie this entire time.                            ____________________
