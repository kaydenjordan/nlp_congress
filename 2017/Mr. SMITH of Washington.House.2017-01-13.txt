 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the chairman, and I want  to thank the members of the Armed Services Committee. I think we had a  very excellent debate on this issue yesterday in committee. A lot of  very well thought-out opinions on both sides were expressed in a  respectful way.   I also want to thank the chairman because the second that it was said  that General Mattis was going to be the President-elect's selection for  Secretary of Defense, he joined me in saying that we wanted General  Mattis to appear before our committee to answer our questions. This is  something that has only happened twice, and the first time in 67 years;  and our committee members wanted the opportunity to do our job as the  House Armed Services Committee and hear from the nominee about how he  felt about the civilian control of the military, which is the reason  that this law was put in place back in 1947. So I thank the chairman  for that. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.   The one thing I would correct, we do have to pass this piece of  legislation in order for General Mattis to become the Secretary of  Defense. We do not have to do it now. I will explain more on how we can  do that in just a second. But the problem of where we are at right now  because of the actions of the transition team, we basically, certainly  on the House Armed Services Committee and, to some extent, in the full  House, are being treated as irrelevant.   It was mentioned during our committee that General Mattis received an  81-17 vote on this legislation in the Senate. That is true, it was  bipartisan. He appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The  Senate Armed Services Committee was given the respect to do their job,  and they heard him, and they asked him questions. It didn't take very  long. He was done by 12:30, and they voted. That didn't happen for us.   Really, it is sort of a two-step process in which the legislative  branch--in this case, the House--was basically ignored and treated as  irrelevant. First was in the continuing resolution that we passed to  keep the government open where, with guidance from the transition team,  they insisted on very specific language in the CR to set it up so that  General Mattis could be confirmed, and that was stuck into the CR. Now,  we, on the Democratic side objected to a couple of things in that at  the time, but those objections were ignored, and it was put in, and we  were not prepared to shut down the government over this issue since it  was put into the CR.   The chairman has mentioned one of the problems with it, and the  biggest one, and that is in the past, in the case of General Marshall,  they exempted him from this provision that retired officers are subject  to the UCMJ. They did not exempt General Mattis. When we are talking  about civilian control of the military, if you have a retired military  officer who is still subject to military law, that, without question,  blurs the line between his being a military officer and his being a  civilian. It is something we easily could have fixed. But the way they  wrote it into the CR there was no way for us to do that.    Then, second, and more--I can't think of the right word--second and  worse, let's just put it that way, as we said, we agreed. We were going  to have General Mattis come and talk to us. Both the chairman and I  spoke to General Mattis on the phone. He was very anxious to come  testify. In fact, 3 days ago, we noticed in our committee that we were  going to have a public hearing with General Mattis before us answering  our questions and addressing whatever concerns we might have. Then, the  next day, 24 hours before he was supposed to appear, the transition  team--and as I was led to believe, it was some low-level person on the  transition team--said: Nah, we are not going to let him come.   Reporters have asked me many times: Why did the transition team do  that? The best answer to that question is because they could, because  they just really didn't feel like it. Some people have said: Well, it  would be a lot of effort, a lot of work.   Like I said, General Mattis testified before the Senate committee.  Most of us watched it on television. He was done at 12:30. We were  scheduled to have him at 2:30. He could have had a nice lunch, walked  over to the House, sat down for an hour, and the House Armed Services  Committee could have been permitted to do its job.   The reason this is important--and I have heard for 8 years endless  complaints from the Republican side of the aisle about how President  Obama has ignored the legislative branch, how executive authority is  making irrelevant the people's House, and how wrong that was. On a  number of occasions I've actually agreed with them. I think that has  happened.   But here we are before this President is even in office, at the very  first opportunity, he is choosing to completely ignore us for no  reason. You cannot tell me that General Mattis couldn't handle an hour- and-a-half's worth of questioning in the House Armed Services  Committee. He has done it before countless times.   So what we can do and what I think we should do, what I think we  should  [[Page H522]]  have done at the time when the transition team called up and said that,  is we should have said: Okay. We appreciate your opinion, but you need  us to pass this law in order for General Mattis to be Secretary of  Defense. We have been told that he is going to appear before our  committee. We have told our members of the committee and everybody else  that he is going to appear; and until he does, we are not going to pass  that law.   Now, I am of the opinion that if we had said that, if we had shown  some backbone and stood up for what is our right as the legislative  body, that all of a sudden General Mattis would have been available and  we could have avoided all of this.   Even today, I submit that if we defeat this bill on the floor, we  couldn't get him in by January 20. I grant you that. But we are back  January 23 and 24. We were scheduled to be here January 25. I gather  that got canceled because the Republican retreat is going to be a bit  longer than expected.                                time  1400    But we could certainly take that day back. We could wait 3 or 4 days,  which I don't think would be the end of the world, and assert our  authority as the legislative branch. Because, let me tell you  something, if we set this precedent now, if you think President Obama  exercised executive authority in a highhanded way, ignoring the  legislative branch, there is every indication that President-elect  Trump is going to have an even greater approach in that direction. So  if we don't stand up for ourselves now, we are going to be rolled over  countlessly.   We all want to support General Mattis. We want that bipartisan vote.  The way to get that bipartisan vote is to do what we said we were going  to do, have him come before the Armed Services Committee and simply  address the issue we want to raise. That is why I would ask this body  to reject this motion now, so that we can actually have the Armed  Services Committee do its job.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin).   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this bill.   Mr. Speaker, every one of us in this body was elected to serve and  represent the people of our districts. Doing our jobs means fairly and  fully considering the legislation that comes before us. If we pass this  measure, we will have failed to meet that incredible responsibility.   Our democracy depends, in part, on civilian control of the military.  If we are going to appoint a recently retired general as the new  Secretary of Defense, that decision calls for careful deliberation and  informed debate.   Mr. Speaker, I hear nothing but good things about General Mattis, but  the good people of the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia didn't  hire me to take someone else's word for it. If we are going to waive  this law that has been on the books for oh so many years, Members of  this body deserve the opportunity to ask General Mattis questions, to  hear his answers, and to weigh his views.   Unlike our colleagues in the Senate, Members of this body did not  have the opportunity to have a full committee hearing with General  Mattis. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen).    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   This is not a vote against General Mattis. I think I made that very,  very clear. I think it is very important that  [[Page H524]]  the House have the opportunity to hear from him, as we said we were  going to do.   Now, yes, he has appeared before the Senate. But, as all of us on the  Armed Services Committee know, after the transition is over and the new  Secretary of Defense is in place, one of the first things they do is  come up and report the budget to us. The Secretary of Defense and the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs will come up. They go to the  Senate, too.   Are we just going to say we can watch the television? Why does he  need to go to both places? Why would we bother to have him come all the  way over to the House and have our members have the opportunity to ask  him questions? I don't want to set that precedent.   So, as passionate as the previous speaker was, please understand--and  I have expressed this directly to General Mattis--this is not a vote  against General Mattis. In fact, I have said: if we have the  opportunity to do our job as the House Armed Services Committee, if we  simply do not roll over for the transition team, we would be more than  happy to support General Mattis in a bipartisan way. We have plenty of  time to do this right, instead of doing it in the rushed way that  disregards the power and importance of the House Armed Services  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I have an enormous amount of respect for the gentleman from  California. I have enjoyed traveling with him to Afghanistan and  elsewhere.   I think what he said in the first part of his remarks was, basically,  the Trump administration is going to ignore us, and we just need to get  used it. That is not my interpretation of our jobs. I think we were  elected as well, particularly on the Armed Services Committee, and, in  our elections, we even got more votes than our opponents. That is how  we were able to get here.    So I don't think we should simply roll over for the Trump  administration because that is the way he is likely to behave.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), a new member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just point out that,  because of the way this law is written, General Mattis actually will  not be going back to civilian life after he leaves. He is still subject  to the UCMJ and, therefore, is still, in some ways, a military officer  while he will be the ``civilian head'' of the Defense Department.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman specifically for a clarity on  the status of General Mattis as the legislation is written.   I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that all of us who stand make  sure the American people know of our greatest respect and honor for  General Mattis. His history of service to this Nation, his tactical  expertise, and his ability to acknowledge the constitutional  underpinnings of which this Nation is based is without question. But we  have, as my colleagues have said on the other side of the aisle, a very  serious moment in history.   In the public domain is a conspicuous intrusion of Russia and the  election of 2016. There is also knowledge of other areas of which they  have used the cyber system for cyber warfare.   The talent of military persons is welcome, but that is the strength  of this Nation: that we don't yield and bend this little book called  the Constitution, which has, as I indicated, its essence being that our  Nation is governed by the civilian population under principles of  democracy and equality, the recognition of the three branches of  government, and the separation of our military and civilian operation.                                time  1430    This waiver is extraordinary. This waiver, I believe, undermines the  very sense of the freedom of our military, its ability to counsel as a  separate entity, and it undermines, again, the idea that in 1947 our  Congress decided to acknowledge and only waived to General Marshall  because of the potential concern and catastrophe of the Korean  conflict, now Korean war. It has not been done since.   So I would ask my colleagues whether or not we are going to bend--not  bend the arc toward justice and recognition of the Constitution, but  bend at any moment of convenience. I do not believe that this is a time  in history to bend for convenience.   I believe General Mattis would agree, with his very fine record, that  civilian control of the government should be superior and raise the  question himself, if asked, whether or not this waiver is for this time  and for now and whether or not we are in such a moment of history that  that waiver needs to be granted. My view is that it does not. My view  is that we should, in essence, adhere to the regularness of  constitutional premise and also to recognize the well-established  separation of civilian and military.   At this time, I want to thank General Mattis for his service, and I  would argue that this resolution should receive a ``no'' vote from our  colleagues in the United States House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S. 84, which provides an  exception to a limitation against appointment of persons as Secretary  of Defense within seven years of relief from active duty as a regular  commissioned officer of the Armed Forces so that the President-Elect  can nominate Gen. James Mattis to serve as the next Secretary of  Defense.   Gen. Mattis retired from active duty in 2013, which under current  law, makes him ineligible for appointment as Secretary of Defense.   Civilian control of the military has been a bedrock principle of our  democracy since the founding of the Republic.   That principle has served the nation well and there is no reason to  depart from from 66 years of precedent in strictly protecting the  American principle of civilian control over the military.   Indeed, in the history of the Department of Defense, the only Defense  Secretary ever given a waiver was then-Secretary of State, General  George Marshall--who was provided an individual waiver in 1950 at the  height of the Korean War in a stand-alone bill approved by the  Congress.   It is not the service of the individual nominated or his or her  fitness to serve that is in question, but the dangerous precedent that  would be set by entrusting leadership of the Department of Defense to a  retired military person whose active duty military experiences have not  been moderated by the tempering effect of life in the civil sector.   I urge all Members to join me in voting against S. 84.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just  to say, not to be a stickler for detail, but we are actually not giving  a waiver here. We are changing the law, and that is what makes this  appointment different. When you confirm someone to the Cabinet, the  gentleman is absolutely right, the Senate, that is their authority. It  is in the Constitution. We don't get involved in that. But when you are  changing a law, the House has a say in that. It is the Senate and the  House.   This debate actually makes me even more strongly opposed to this bill  as I continue to hear about: We just don't matter. The Senate has got  it. Trump has got it. What do we need to do?   We have a responsibility as the House, and when you are changing a  law, it has to go through the Senate and the House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  the time.   I thank the folks for the debate. I think it has been very good, as  it was in committee. But it is disturbing to hear this described as  politics, or we feel slighted and we should rise above that. This isn't  what this is about. It is about our exercising our constitutional  authority as Members of the House and our constitutional authority as  members of the Armed Services Committee. It is about us being relevant  in the process and doing our jobs, as I said in the opening.   Again, there is every opportunity to confirm and then also pass this  change in the law that is necessary to make General Mattis the next  Secretary of Defense. We can simply insist with the transition team  that he appear before our committee. As I have pointed out, if we had  done that in the first place, we could have met the January 20  deadline; and even now we could still do it by January 23 or 24. I  don't think a few days would make that big a difference compared to the  institution of the House actually mattering.   Now, I will say that, as I listened to the debate today, I become  even a little bit more disturbed, as we have heard some of the  reasoning behind supporting this change in the law to allow General  Mattis to become the Secretary of Defense. As was said, basically, the  Trump administration is going to do this kind of thing quite  frequently, as one Member of the opposite party said, so we should just  get used to it.   I really do think that makes it all the more important at this point,  at this moment, that we assert our authority. Again, we can do that and  have a bipartisan vote and approve General Mattis. We just have to  insist upon it instead of rolling over and accepting what the  transition team has said. That was my original argument. I will not  belabor it or restate it. I think it is compelling. I think we should  stand up for our rights here in the House and on the Armed Services  Committee.   The final thing I will say is, while I have an enormous amount of  respect for General Mattis--and like many who have spoken, I have not  served in the armed services, I didn't work with him there, but I  certainly have worked with him on the committee--I will point out that  General Mattis is not God. As we listen to the people talk here about  how we absolutely have to have somebody from the warrior class lead us  in the military, that we have to have him in there in order to protect  us from this dangerous world, that sort of language kind of makes me a  little nervous.   That is the point of civilian control of the military. We do not want  to be run by the warrior class alone. Now, absolutely we have many  Members on both sides of the aisle who have served in the military, and  I think that is terrific. That perspective is enormously important. It  is not the only perspective that is important to running a  representative democracy. We have heard comparisons to the Roman  Empire. Again, another analogy that is somewhat troubling. That is not  what we want. But more than anything, what we don't want is we don't  want a president who thinks that he can roll over the House Armed  Services Committee and the entire House any time he feels like it,  frankly, as in this case, for no reason.   General Mattis, as everyone has admitted, was perfectly prepared to  testify, perfectly prepared to come before us, and they simply decided  not to send him. I don't think it was mere pettiness or anything like  that. I have watched the way President-elect Trump conducts himself,  and he is, shall we say, aggressive. I think they wanted to make it  clear that they are going to be running things and that we better get  the heck out of the way.   Well, that is not what I was elected to do as a member of the House  Armed Services Committee or a Member of the House. We are not here  simply to get out of the way of President Obama or President-elect  Trump. We are here to stand up for the people who elected us and for  the country and to do our jobs. In this case, for no good reason, we  were denied the ability to do that.   So, again, I will urge Members to vote down this bill today so that  we can assert our authority, hear from General Mattis, get him  approved, go forward, but do it in a way that shows that the House of  Representatives and the House Armed Services Committee actually matter.  We cannot set the precedent that the President of the United States can  simply ignore us on a whim.   So I would urge us to vote ``no'' on this matter.   I, again, thank the chairman for his leadership on this. We have  worked very closely on this issue, amongst many others. To echo the  comments of the freshman colleague from California, this is a very  bipartisan committee. It will continue to be. We have done a bill for  55 straight years, and I am hoping we will make it 56 this year. I look  forward to working with Chairman Thornberry, all of the members of the  committee, and all of the Members of the House to achieve that goal.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H529]]         Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
