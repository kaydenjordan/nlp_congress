 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  service of 99-year-old Reverend Willard Smith of Pittsylvania County,  Virginia.   My office came to know Reverend Smith when he and his wife requested  assistance with a Federal agency. We were more than happy to  successfully resolve his case.   Mr. Smith was drafted into the U.S. Army at age 18 during World War  II, where, as a member of the 553rd Quartermaster Service Battalion, he  brought supplies to the front lines and prisoners back to camp.   During the war, Reverend Smith came to know the Lord and relied on  his Christian faith and the truth of the Bible for his strength to  persevere through such challenging times.   Upon returning home to Virginia after the war, Reverend Smith began  serving the North New Hope Baptist Church congregation in Danville,  Virginia, where he has faithfully pastored for over 60 years. Now that  he is 99, Reverend Smith continues to serve his congregation and give  back to the Danville and Southside communities.   I am honored to represent wonderful constituents of Virginia's Fifth  District such as Reverend Smith, who is an example for all Americans to  follow.                            ____________________
