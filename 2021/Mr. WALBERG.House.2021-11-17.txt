 Madam Speaker, shortly, this body will begin debating  the most radical and expensive spending bill in our Nation's history.   Shockingly, Democrats are intent on moving forward without the CBO's  final cost analysis. But independent estimates put the bill's price tag  around $4 trillion, twice what Democrats claim. This level of reckless  and unpaid-for spending is unsustainable.   On top of that, the problematic provisions in this bill are a mile  long. It will heighten the border crisis, undermine American energy,  and worsen the inflation crisis. It will raise taxes on hardworking  families and calls for hiring 87,000 new IRS agents.   Unbelievably, one of the biggest parts of this bill is a special tax  break for the wealthy. The list of problems goes on and on, but the  bottom line is this massive bill represents cradle-to-grave socialism.  That is not what America stands for.   Madam Speaker, please join me and reject this radical legislation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, today, we are here to take a stand against President  Biden's unconstitutional vaccine mandate on private businesses and  their employees. And in the end, I think it is clear that we need to  make sure we understand this is unconstitutional, this goes against the  American way and the American ideals.   By invoking the Congressional Review Act, we are taking an important  step to protect the liberties of millions of Americans in the  workforce, and more importantly, to protect American ideals and the  freedoms that we expect.   In his first year as President, President Biden has led a lackluster  economic recovery plagued by record inflation, supply chain backlogs,  and workforce shortages. The President's coercive mandate will only  worsen issues within the workforce as millions could face termination-- wrongly and unnecessarily.   I have heard from many constituents concerned about their  livelihoods. Small businesses concerned about keeping their doors open.  Rural healthcare providers concerned about meeting staffing demands and  even staying in business. While I am encouraged to see the early court  rulings on this issue, and OSHA's step to back up a little bit today,  Congress must not stand on the sidelines.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his  leadership in introducing this legislation, and I am proud to be a  cosponsor.   We have had enough topdown mandates.
