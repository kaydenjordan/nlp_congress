 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6651) to extend certain authorities relating to  United Sates efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria  globally, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6651         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``PEPFAR Extension Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. INSPECTORS GENERAL AND ANNUAL STUDY.

Section 403 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/      AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673)       is amended--        (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``2018'' and inserting       ``2023''; and        (2) in subsection (c), in the matter preceding paragraph       (1), by striking ``2018'' and inserting ``2023''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6651, the PEPFAR Extension Act  of 2018.   Twenty years ago, I was honored to serve as the chairman of the  Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International  Organizations Subcommittee on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  During my tenure, everywhere I went, particularly in southern Africa,  hospitals were full and classrooms sat empty as teachers fell ill. Life  expectancy plummeted, and economies deteriorated across the continent.  Tens of millions of children were orphaned across Africa when mothers,  fathers, teachers, soldiers, factory workers, and health professionals  died.   The AIDS pandemic that ravaged sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Latin  America, Eastern Europe, and Asia was so bad that, in 2000, the U.S.  intelligence community identified HIV/AIDS as a major threat to U.S.  economic and national security.   To address this, a diverse, bipartisan coalition of administration  officials, Members of Congress, faith leaders, advocates, and NGOs  joined with President Bush to launch the most significant global  response to a single disease in our history. Authorized by Congress in  2003, and later reauthorized in 2008 and 2013, the President's  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known today as PEPFAR, quickly became  the most successful U.S. foreign aid program since the Marshall Plan.   Today, through PEPFAR, the U.S. is supporting 14 million people with  lifesaving treatment, which helps stabilize societies and shrink the  pool of new infections. More than 85 million people have received  voluntary testing and counseling, while more than 2 million babies born  to HIV-positive mothers have been born AIDS-free.   By strategically targeting resources and holding partners  accountable, PEPFAR has helped reduce new infections among the most  vulnerable groups, particularly young women and adolescent girls. It  has done so by as much as 40 percent.   Just last month, I returned to southern Africa and witnessed the  impact of PEPFAR for myself. Parents are surviving; the workforce is  recovering; and health systems are becoming stronger. This is  tremendous progress for which we all should be extremely proud.   But now is not the time for retreat. There remains more to be done.   The PEPFAR Extension Act of 2018 provides a framework for PEPFAR's  continued success while addressing new challenges. Among other  improvements, this act extends a requirement for the inspectors general  for the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International  Development, and the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct  joint oversight and joint audit plans. It also extends annual reporting  requirements, which contributes to continued and effective  congressional oversight.   The United States cannot and should not fight this fight alone. That  is why this act ensures that our programs are complemented by an  effective, efficient, and accountable Global Fund to Fight AIDS,  Malaria and Tuberculosis. That fund is accountable.   This is a sensible, bipartisan approach that will enable the United  States, through PEPFAR, to continue to help partner countries expand  access to treatment, prevent new infections, and achieve epidemic  control.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this timely, important,  lifesaving measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). Mr. Chris Smith is chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations, and he is the author of this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). She is the chairwoman  emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, an original cosponsor of  this bill, and the co-chair of the HIV/AIDS Caucus here in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with the help of our  ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel, has worked across both Chambers of  Congress. We have worked across party lines. We have worked to craft a  bill that preserves congressional prerogatives and advances U.S.  interests and helps save lives.   I again thank Mr. Chris Smith, because H.R. 6651 does all of that. It  does not contain new authorized appropriations, nor does it affect  direct spending or revenues. It does not create new programs or include  major new policy provisions. It is, in other words, a noncontroversial  bipartisan measure that extends critical PEPFAR authorities and the  transparency requirements that expired on September 30 of 2018.   Congress has reauthorized, now, this program twice before, and I  thank the U.S. Global Aids coordinator, Ambassador Birx, for her  steadfast commitment to making PEPFAR as efficient and effective as  possible.   And, of course, I want to again thank all of the sponsors-- Representatives Smith, Ros-Lehtinen, Engel, and Lee--for championing  this effort and doing so from the very start.   And, finally, I thank Joan Condon on my staff, who has been  instrumental in seeing this important legislation over the finish line  and who has long worked for effective U.S. assistance programs that  both save lives and reinforce the moral stature of the United States  around this globe.   The success of these efforts, the success of this program will  forever be measured by the lives it has saved. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1055) to affirm strong United States- Liberia ties and support for democratic principles, and call for full  implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission  recommendations, including the establishment of an Extraordinary  Criminal Tribunal for Liberia.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1055         Whereas today the United States is home to an estimated       80,000 people of Liberian ancestry in vibrant communities       across the country, who have been instrumental in America's       efforts to build a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous       Liberia;        Whereas Liberia and the United States share close       historical, political, and economic ties over the course of a       nearly 200-year relationship;        Whereas the people and Government of the United States have       a deep interest in Liberia's democratic stability and       postconflict development;        Whereas the civil war from 1991 to 2002 resulted in the       death of over 200,000 people in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the       displacement of over 1,000,000 persons, and the horrific       cases of amputations, mass rape, and human rights abuses       conducted under the leadership of Charles Taylor;        Whereas Charles Taylor was convicted through the Special       Court for Sierra Leone for 11 different charges of war       crimes, crimes against humanity, such as rape, sexual abuse,       and slavery, and violation of international law, including       the use of child soldiers;        Whereas a comprehensive peace agreement was signed by the       Government of Liberia, rebel groups, and political parties in       2003;        Whereas the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as       established under the 2003  [[Page H9492]]       comprehensive peace agreement, was formally created in 2005       with a mandate ``to promote national peace, security, unity       and reconciliation by investigating gross human rights       violations and violations of humanitarian law, sexual       violations, and economic crimes that occurred between January       1979 and October 2003'';        Whereas the Truth and Reconciliation Commission released a       report in December 2008 recommending the establishment of an       Extraordinary Criminal Tribunal for Liberia and listed       individuals, corporations, and institutions recommended for       further investigation and prosecution, among other       recommendations;        Whereas the Government of Liberia has not fully implemented       the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Agreement       to date, including the establishment of an Extraordinary       Criminal Tribunal;        Whereas Liberia experienced its first democratic and       peaceful transition of power since 1944 after President Ellen       Johnson Sirleaf respected constitutional term limits and       George Weah defeated Vice President Joseph Boakai following a       runoff during the 2017 Presidential elections;        Whereas the United States congratulated the people of       Liberia on the successful conclusion of the Presidential       runoff election and recognized the important role Liberia's       Supreme Court, political parties, security forces, and civil       society organizations played in holding a peaceful and       transparent contest; and        Whereas the United States Government and American citizens       have invested in Liberia to rebuild and support democratic       institutions, postconflict recovery, economic growth,       improved access to education and health care,       professionalization of the country's military and civilian       security forces, and efforts to foster accountability and       transparency of government institutions: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) upholds its commitment to maintain and foster the       enduring relationship between the people and the Governments       of the United States and Liberia;        (2) urges the Government and people of Liberia to support       the truth and reconciliation process through full       implementation of the recommendations of the Truth and       Reconciliation Commission, including the establishment of an       Extraordinary Criminal Tribunal; and        (3) supports efforts by the Department of State and United       States Agency for International Development to advance       Liberian efforts toward national reconciliation through       continued support for the rule of law, effective governance,       and the robust role of civil society.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1055, which affirms the  strong ties between the United States and Liberia and calls for full  implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission  recommendations.   I want to thank Representative Donovan and Representative Johnson for  their work on this resolution.   During my time as chairman of the Africa Subcommittee, we held  hearings and we pressed legislation to bring attention to the brutal  civil war in Liberia and Sierra Leone that killed 200,000 people and  that displaced more than 1 million, one of whom was also an orphan,  orphaned by this conflict, and he worked in my own office here in  Congress.   We heard testimony, for example, also, from a young girl no more than  10 years old who recounted the atrocities she, herself, endured during  the war, a gruesome illustration of the horrific and lasting impact  this conflict had on the people of Liberia and Sierra Leone.   The Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International  Organizations Subcommittee worked across party lines and alongside the  international community and alongside the people of Liberia and Sierra  Leone to apprehend the notorious warlord Charles Taylor, and I would  like to thank our staff director, Tom Sheehy, for his help in this  regard. Today, Charles Taylor remains behind bars.   In 2003, the Government of Liberia, rebel groups, and political  parties signed a comprehensive peace agreement. A Truth and  Reconciliation Commission was created, which recommended the  establishment of a war crimes tribunal to ensure justice for the people  of Liberia. This would be along the same lines of what we had worked to  effectively establish for the people of Sierra Leone in terms of their  special court.   Unfortunately, however, this war crimes tribunal for Liberia has  never been established, although Liberian Government figures and  Liberian activists alike have continued to call for one. This  resolution repeats this important call.   We have turned the page on this horrific chapter in Liberia's  history. In March, the U.N. peacekeeping mission there officially  ended. It is not often we get to celebrate the successful end of a  mission, and we remember the 202 peacekeepers that lost their lives to  bring peace and to bring stability to the region.   President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was democratically elected in 2005  and reelected in 2011 before stepping down from power. Last year, the  country experienced its first democratic transition of power since  November of 1944. This further strengthened democratic institutions,  and it set an important precedent for future leaders.   Much more needs to be done to crack down on corruption and create a  more conducive environment for trade and economic investment. The  government must ensure the policies are in place to encourage business  to invest and grow and create jobs, but this resolution affirms the  U.S. commitment to continue to partner with Liberia to support civil  society, rule of law, and good governance. We stand by the Liberian  people in their continued efforts for a more prosperous and a more  democratic Liberia.   The United States and Liberia share close historical, political, and  economic ties over the course of our nearly 200-year relationship. The  United States is home to 80,000 people of Liberian ancestry. This  resolution commends this diaspora population, which has been  instrumental in America's efforts to build a peaceful, democratic, and  prosperous Liberia.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  reclaim the time I previously yielded back.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan), an esteemed Member from the  Committee on Foreign Affairs and the author of the resolution.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank my colleagues. I thank  Representatives Dan Donovan and Hank Johnson for their work on this  legislation, as well as Chris Smith, Eliot Engel, and Karen Bass for  their support.   The U.S. stands by the Liberian people, those living in Liberia, and  the diaspora in their continued efforts for a more prosperous and a  more democratic Liberia.   Reconciliation from the atrocities of the past is an important step  in this process and will ensure peace, and it will ensure that the  stability remains. The U.S. must continue to support civil society,  rule of law, and good governance to strengthen democratic institutions.   I urge my colleagues to support this important measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1052) affirming United States- Australia cooperation on space research, exploration, and utilization.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1052         Whereas the United States of America and the Commonwealth       of Australia are treaty allies;        Whereas United States and Australia defense cooperation       extends back 100 years, to the Battle of Hamel in World War       I;        Whereas the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security       Treaty, also referred to as the ANZUS Treaty, has formed the       framework of the United States-Australia alliance since 1951;        Whereas the Australia-United States Ministerial       Consultation, also referred to as AUSMIN, has contributed to       a deeper partnership between the two nations;        Whereas the National Aeronautics and Space Administration       (NASA) notes that, ``The United States and Australia have       been cooperating in civil space for more than 50 years'';        Whereas the United States Apollo missions and subsequent       space science and exploration conducted by the United States       benefitted greatly from the partnership with our Australian       allies;  [[Page H9494]]         Whereas Neil Armstrong's first steps on the surface of the       Moon were relayed to Houston through the Honeysuckle Creek       site in Australia;        Whereas NASA also notes that, ``The Canberra complex is an       integral component of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN), the       world's largest and most sensitive scientific       telecommunications system'';        Whereas the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex       (CDSCC) is one of NASA's largest tracking and communication       facilities outside the United States;        Whereas, on Tuesday, October 17, 2017, Australian       Ambassador to the United States Joe Hockey and Acting NASA       Administrator Robert Lightfoot signed a 25-year agreement for       continued cooperation on space cooperation, including on       space tracking;        Whereas the United States and Australian governments have       jointly committed to expanding Space Situational Awareness       (SSA);        Whereas United States-Australia cooperation on SSA is       critical to maximize defense capabilities, monitoring       environmental changes, avoiding space congestion and       collisions, and protecting against exploitation from the       growing counter-space capabilities of our adversaries;        Whereas, on September 24, 2017, the Government of Australia       under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull committed to creating       the Australian Space Agency, with operations beginning on       July 1, 2018; and        Whereas the Australian Space Agency commenced operations on       July 1, 2018: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) commends the Australian Government in constituting the       Australian Space Agency;        (2) recognizes the value in United States-Australia       cooperation on space research, exploration, and utilization,       including on terrestrial research, commercial activities, and       human and robotic space exploration;        (3) supports international cooperation on space research,       exploration, and utilization and other forms of space       diplomacy as being in the national interest of the United       States;        (4) encourages the Department of State to support and       facilitate international cooperation with Australia on space       research, exploration, and utilization through diplomatic       efforts, including through the Australia-United States       Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) forum and multilateral       initiatives with Japan, Canada, the European Union, and other       partners of both the United States and Australia; and        (5) supports deeper cooperation with our Australian allies       in contributing each country's unique strengths and resources       to mutual prosperity and security.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Representative Castro from  Texas, for sponsoring this measure, which affirms the longstanding  strategic alliance between the United States and Australia, and  especially our extensive cooperation on space-related activities.   Australia has long played a key role in the U.S. space program. It  hosts several facilities that are crucial for maintaining  communications with our manned and robotic missions. These facilities  also support U.S. satellites and spacecraft, including those related to  military and intelligence-related activities.   The establishment of the Australian Space Agency, which was just  announced this past year, will only add to this long history and will  promote more mutually beneficial cooperation as advanced technologies  create new opportunities for jobs in both countries.   This increased cooperation is especially timely, as Australia's  importance to the U.S. national security is enhanced by the ongoing  militarization of space that is being undertaken by both Beijing and  Moscow. This resolution highlights the growing importance of our two  countries' cooperation in this vital area and looks forward to even  closer ties in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Representative Castro of  Texas, for sponsoring this measure.   Our cooperation with Australia in space-related activities is a key  element of our broader strategic relationship. Those ties will become  increasingly important as new technologies create expanded  opportunities for peaceful endeavors and as Beijing and Moscow and  others increasingly challenge U.S. national security in space.   Expanding our joint efforts in this area will enhance the interests  of both countries and further strengthen our longstanding strategic  alliance.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  timely, bipartisan measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6018) to establish an interagency program to assist  countries in the Sahel, Maghreb, and adjacent regions of Africa to  improve immediate and long-term capabilities to counter terrorist  threats, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6018         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Trans-Sahara       Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership, launched       in 2005, is an interagency program to assist partner       countries in the Sahel and Maghreb regions of Africa on their       immediate and long-term capabilities to address terrorist       threats and prevent the spread of violent extremism;        (2) armed groups and violent Islamist terrorist       organizations, such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko       Haram, the Islamic State of West Africa, and other affiliated       groups, have killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians,       displaced populations, destabilized local and national       governments, and caused mass human suffering in the affected       communities;        (3) it is in the national security interest of the United       States to combat the spread of radical Islamist extremism and       build partner countries' capacity to combat these threats in       Africa;        (4) extremist movements exploit vulnerable and marginalized       communities suffering from poverty, lack of economic       opportunity (particularly among youth populations), and weak       governance; and        (5) to address critical security, political, economic, and       humanitarian challenges in these regions of Africa, a       coordinated, interagency approach is needed to appropriately       allocate resources, share responsibility, de-conflict       programs, and maximize the effectiveness of United States       defense, diplomatic, and development capabilities.       SEC. 3. TRANS-SAHARA COUNTERTERRORISM PARTNERSHIP.         (a) Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership.--        (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of State, in consultation       with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of the       United States Agency for International Development, shall       establish a partnership, to be known as the ``Trans-Sahara       Counterterrorism Partnership'' (TSCTP), to coordinate all       United States programs, projects, and activities in North and       West Africa that are conducted for any of the following       purposes:        (A) To build the capacity of foreign military and law       enforcement entities in such regions to conduct       counterterrorism operations.        (B) To improve the ability of foreign military and law       enforcement entities in such regions to cooperate with the       United States and other partner countries on counterterrorism       efforts.        (C) To enhance the border security capacity of partner       countries in such regions, including the ability to monitor,       restrain, and interdict terrorists.        (D) To strengthen the rule of law in such countries,       including access to justice, and the ability of the law       enforcement entities of such partner countries to detect,       disrupt, respond to, investigate, and prosecute terrorist       activity.        (E) To monitor and counter the financing of terrorism.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6018, the Trans-Sahara  Counterterrorism Partnership Act.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues here, Chairman Mike McCaul  and Ranking Member Keating, for their bipartisan leadership to advance  this important measure.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, Boko Haram, ISIS-West Africa, as well as  ISIS in the Greater Sahara, al-Qaida affiliates, and other armed groups  continue to create havoc across north and west Africa. Thousands of  civilians, including countless women and children, have died at the  hands of these terrorist organizations.   In response to these threats, the U.S. has deployed over 1,000 troops  in the region, but the many diverse and increasingly pressing security  threats across Africa demand more than just a military presence.   Realizing this, in 2005, the U.S. established the Trans-Sahara  Counterterrorism Partnership, known as the TSCTP program, to bring  together the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the  U.S. Agency for International Development, and they did that to  coordinate and streamline U.S. and partner nations' efforts to combat  terrorism, as well as preventing the spread of violent extremism in  north and west Africa.   This program rightly recognizes that we must build the capacity of  countries so that they can themselves detect and defeat terrorists  within their own countries. This is a long-term approach that can  produce high returns with relatively low investment. We are investing  in the future security of partner nations.   But TSCTP is not just about security assistance. Strengthening  democratic institutions of partner nations to ensure responsive  democratic governance and rule of law is also a key part of this  program. Often our efforts help bring government officials around the  table with local communities, including women's groups and including  civil society at large, to increase dialogue on peace and security.  Having women at the table not only makes peace agreements more likely,  but also makes agreements last longer.   This region is home to some of the poorest countries of the world,  and the humanitarian and development needs are immense. High youth  unemployment, food insecurity, low education, and severe lack of  government services together create an environment ripe for terrorist  recruitment.   To improve these underlying conditions, USAID is supporting  vulnerable populations through livelihood training, through access to  health resources, and through agricultural development.   TSCTP coordinates our diplomatic, defense, and development tools to  counter these terrorist threats and to help bring stability to this  region. The bill we are considering today supports this program by  establishing core objectives in benchmarks and strengthening  congressional oversight so it continues to be efficient and effective  and timely.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), chairman of the Committee on  Homeland Security, a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  and the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the  Subcommittee on the Middle East and north Africa and is the former  chair of the Africa Subcommittee as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism  Partnership Act mandates an important interagency effort to combat  terrorism and to prevent the spread of radical extremism. It increases  congressional oversight by requiring increased reporting and regular  monitoring and evaluation, frankly, of all of our programs. In doing  so, through programs like TSCTP and with just a relatively small amount  of foreign assistance dollars, we are investing in the future stability  of these nations and their own ability to defeat terrorist attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Mike McCaul for this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
