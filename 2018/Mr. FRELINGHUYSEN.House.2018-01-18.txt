The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 696, the motion  shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.   The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   I rise this afternoon to present the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 195, the Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act  of 2018. This critical legislation extends government funding through  February 16. Our current funding expires tomorrow night, and if  Congress does not pass this bill and the President does not sign it  into law before then, the government will shut down.   It is our congressional duty to prevent that from happening and to  ensure that the American people have access to government programs and  services they depend on. The additional time, just under a month, will  allow congressional leadership and the White House to come to a final  budget agreement.   This legislation includes a very limited number of technical changes  to ensure good governance. The bill also includes language to continue  the Children's Health Insurance Program through fiscal year 2023 to  help sick children from low-income families get better and to ensure  they have healthy and happy futures. Additionally, this proposal  extends several healthcare-related tax provisions.   Mr. Speaker, a continuing resolution is not the preferred way to  conduct the Nation's fiscal business, but at this point it is  absolutely necessary to avoid a costly, destabilizing government  shutdown. It is my hope that this will be the last continuing  resolution, that leadership of the House and Senate and the White House  will quickly come to an agreement on top-line spending levels and that  we can complete our appropriations work for fiscal year 2018 in short  order.                                time  1645    It is critical that we enact all 12 full-year funding bills to ensure  that our Armed Forces have the resources they need to accomplish their  missions both at home and abroad and that our government supports and  maintains programs that are important to the lives and livelihoods of  all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this critical legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman of the Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on  Appropriations.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill.   This short resolution, this continuing resolution will give us time  to negotiate it, but it addresses our Nation's priorities. Let's be  very clear. If this does not pass now, go to the Senate, pass there and  then sent to the President for his signature and signed, the Federal  Government will shut down this week.   So we all know, as the chairman said, that short-term CRs, that is  not something that we want to do. That is not our preference. But  again, if this one does not pass now, the Federal Government will shut  down.   This is no time to shortchange our first responders, our military as  we continue to recover from natural disasters in places all throughout  our country and, again, respond to the threats that face us abroad.  This is no time to shut down the Federal Government.   The CR supports ongoing transportation safety missions, including air  traffic control.   Again, we cannot allow the government to shut down and put all of  that in jeopardy.   It allows us to continue to house the most vulnerable families,  especially our veterans. This is not the time to let them down by  shutting, again, the Federal Government down.   It also funds medical care for millions of children, blocks  burdensome health insurance taxes, and, again, supports mission- critical defense activities. This is not the time to let them all down  and shut down the Federal Government.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this short-term CR will allow us to work  together to find common ground on, again, full-year 2018 bills that  meet both our defense and domestic priorities.   Something else, Mr. Speaker. I want the country to know that we also  have to deal, have to solve the issue of DACA. Both sides have been at  fault for, in many cases, refusing to sit down in good faith to  negotiate a solution. This CR gives us some time to make sure we solve  that issue.   It is not time now for political games and gamesmanship and politics.  We need to be able to solve the issue of those young folks. We can't do  that if the government is shut down.    It is time for leadership, for courage. Let's sit down, work out our  differences, help secure the border, and provide a solution for these  deserving kids.   For that reason and for so many others, Mr. Speaker, it is essential  that we do not allow the Federal Government to shut down. Voting  against this resolution is a vote to shut down the Federal Government.  I believe that will be highly irresponsible, so I urge a strong ``yes''  vote.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Walden), chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Barton), the vice chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee's Subcommittee on Energy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee's Subcommittee on Energy.    Mr. Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to my  colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  [[Page H532]]  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), chairwoman of the Ethics  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan  an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from the great State of Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), who is the  chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we are about to face a very critical deadline in many  States, including my home State of Washington. CHIP funding will run  out.    More than 60,000 kids in my State count on CHIP and need certainty.  This funding bill reauthorizes CHIP for 6 years, the longest extension  in the program's history. Now Democrats are threatening to hold this up  again for a DACA deal.   Now, to be clear, I want a DACA deal, too, and I am disappointed that  we don't have one yet, but that is no reason to punish children across  the country. Today we are voting to prioritize our Nation's children,  and it is time for the Democrats to join us.   I also want to take this opportunity to stress the importance of  reauthorizing the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education  Program, which expired in September. These centers face a looming  deadline of January 31 to decide whether or not to recruit their July  2018 classes.   Without a long-term solution, the centers across our country cannot  make the important decisions that will affect the lives of hundreds of  residents.   Unfortunately, one teaching health center in Memphis has already made  that decision. They closed their doors earlier this year, leaving 25  residents without a place to continue their medical training and  reducing patient access to care. Although reauthorization of the  Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program was not  included in this bill, we must get this done as soon as possible.   I look forward to working with the chairman and the committee moving  forward, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this 6-year reauthorization of CHIP.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we are five months in the 2018  fiscal year, yet here we are again getting ready to vote on another  short-term government funding bill.   Has this become the norm in the new Republican-led government?   I'd like to point out that this will be the fourth continuing  resolution since September.   Our country isn't winning when our military, government agencies, and  important federal programs are operating under short-term spending  bills.   The American people are tired of the partisanship that has kept  Washington from doing its job. They expect results and it's our job to  deliver.   It's our job to fund the military and domestic programs, deliver  protections for DREAMers, keep our quality community health centers  open, reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, and for  those whose districts were impacted by natural disasters, it's our job  to pass disaster aid for the families and small businesses that were  impacted.   There's broad bipartisan support for all the priorities that I  mentioned.   It's my hope that the Republican majority will roll up their sleeves  and get to work for the American people.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  Continuing Resolution because we must stop kicking the can down the  road, and that is all this Countinuing Resolution will do.   The Republican approach to governing has been to pass short term  extensions of programs and Continuing Resolutions that merely delay the  hard work of making decisions on the big issues facing our country.   This is now the fourth stop-gap Continuing Resolution for Fiscal 2018  that we are being asked to consider. Each time Republicans have said  they need more time to deal with this crisis of their own making. And  yet each time, they have failed to negotiate with Democrats to make any  progress toward the bipartisan budget agreement that we need in order  to develop responsible appropriations bills.   Instead, Republicans are again bringing a bill to the floor that  fails to address the big challenges our nation faces. This CR does not  help Americans recovering from the hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico, the  Virgin Islands, Florida, and Texas and the wildfires and mudslides that  have ravaged California. It does not fund community health centers that  people depend on for their healthcare or help those who need assistance  battling opioid addiction. It does not protect those in danger of  losing their pensions, and it will not stop our nation from hitting its  debt limit.   Republicans have also failed to negotiate in good faith on a solution  to the crisis that President Trump himself created for the millions of  Dreamers living in this country.   Dreamers are American in every way but their citizenship, and due to  the President's actions, more than 16 thousand of them have lost their  DACA protections, an average of 122 per day. Tens of thousands more  Dreamers will eventually lose their jobs and their protection against  deportation if we do not take action.   As the author of the Dream Act in the House, I believe we must act  NOW. It is inhumane to force Dreamers to live in fear and uncertainty.  They can't afford to wait until the last minute for a solution, as  Republicans have done so often while leading Congress.   Governing by repeated CRs is neither governing nor leading. It leaves  federal agencies such as our Department of Defense unable to plan for  the future or begin new initiatives, which undermines our national  security and leaves our homeland more vulnerable. This is not how the  appropriations process is supposed to work.   We cannot keep kicking the can down the road. I oppose this CR and  urge my colleagues to vote no so we can get the job done now.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to Rules Committee  Print 115-55, legislation extending the Continuing Resolution now in  effect for another month, or until February 16, 2018.   But before I proceed further, I want to note--and Americans needs to  know--that this is not a spending bill; it is instead an affirmation of  the House Republicans' inability to govern.   This is the fourth time House Republicans have chosen to kick the can  down the road rather than work with Democrats to come to a necessary  bipartisan agreement to lift the Budget Control Act (BCA) spending  caps, giving appropriators the direction they need for full-year  funding bills.   The reason given for passing each of the prior Continuing Resolutions  was that the extra time was needed to reach a comprehensive agreement  to fund government operations in a fair and balanced way.   Yet, even with the extra time, House Republicans made no progress  during any of the previous extensions.   This should not be surprising; the House GOP is carrying the water  for the president, who a few months ago said ``we need a big beautiful  shutdown.''   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support a CR that does not include full funding  for disaster recovery, extends additional health access for veterans,  provides funding to combat the opioid epidemic, and protects pensions.   Most important, it is outrageous that House Republicans would bring  to the floor and request support for a fourth CR extension that does  not address and resolve the crisis the Republican Administration has  inflicted on 800,000 Dreamers and their families, including 124,000  Dreamers in my home state of Texas.   Instead of acting responsibly to address these issues and fund the  government for the remainder of the fiscal year, House Republicans  continue wasting time.   This is not appropriations; this is a stop-gap funding measure to  save ourselves from collapse.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us includes a six year  reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),  which provides health coverage to nine million children, and which  Republicans allowed to lapse on September 30, 2017.   This is not a meaningful extension.   In contrast, making CHIP permanent would not only provide long-term  stability for families, providers, and states, it would save $6 billion  according to the Congressional Budget Office.   Republicans are only just now getting around to reauthorizing the  program because they wasted months on efforts to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and enact unpaid for tax cuts for the wealthy.   I know firsthand about the important work done through CHIP.   My state is home to the Texas Children's Hospital. Any Republican who  believes it is acceptable to play politics with children's health  clearly does not appreciate the work done there.   This CR includes additional tax cuts totaling over $26 billion,  including a two year delay of the medical device and Cadillac taxes,  and a one year delay of the health insurance tax.   At the same time, the resolution fails to address numerous other  expired and expiring health priorities, from funding for community  health centers to waiving caps on therapy services for seniors on  Medicare, to preventing cuts to safety net hospitals.   Mr. Speaker, despite controlling the House, Senate, and the White  House, Republicans have not funded the government for the entire year,  even though we are already four months into the fiscal year.  [[Page H536]]    Democrats, meanwhile, have done the work with which we were tasked. I  am a member of the Budget committee and we Democrats proposed a budget  that:   Respected the needs of all Americans, including those who serve  bravely in the Department of Defense;   Honored the sacrifice of our heroes in uniform;   Protected programs like CHIP, made investments in infrastructure and  ensured that Americans have access to quality healthcare.   Because Republicans refuse to work with Democrats and compromise on  how to provide relief from the BCA's sequester level spending caps,  they are lurching from CR to CR--degrading the readiness of our  military and preventing government agencies from properly serving the  American people.   This is not a responsible way to govern; therefore, I cannot support  this bill.   House Republicans need to work across the aisle with Democrats and  get our work done--including upholding the long-standing precedent of  agreeing to parity when providing relief from sequester caps.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 696, the previous question is ordered.   The question is on the motion by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen).   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
