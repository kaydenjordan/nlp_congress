 Mr. President, in 2021, the year of our Lord 2021, we  have major universities in this country that are discriminating in  admissions against Asian Americans. Now, I know they think they know  how to discriminate in the right way, but discrimination is  discrimination.   At one of these universities in 2013, Harvard admitted that if it  admitted Asian Americans purely on the basis of academic achievement,  it would have doubled the number of Asian Americans. Now, this is  wrong; it is contemptible; it is odious. This amendment doesn't go  nearly far enough. It is a baby step, but at least it is a step.    Mr. President, I want to join my colleague Senator  Cantwell in congratulating Senator Hirono and all of us for almost  unanimously passing this bill that would try to stop discrimination  against Asian Americans. I am happy that passed. There was only one  vote against it.   I just don't think it goes far enough. I think it is ludicrous, it is  odious to me, that in the year 2021, we have major universities in the  United States of America that are setting quotas on their admissions  for Asian Americans--not quotas to have enough Asian Americans, quotas  to keep Asian Americans out. They are, and everybody in this body knows  they are doing that.   Harvard is in litigation over it. Harvard officials have already  stated that but for their quotas, there would be twice as many Asian  Americans at Harvard as there are now if they base the decision solely  on academic achievement. And that is wrong.   There is no way to discriminate in the right way. Discrimination is  discrimination. Judge people on the basis of their academic  achievements.   President Biden has talked an awful lot about the error of  discriminating against Asian Americans, and he is absolutely right.  What is the first thing he did? He pulled his Justice Department off of  filing litigation to try to stop these quotas on Asian Americans and  universities. I mean, if there weren't double standards around here,  there would be no standards at all.   So I strongly encourage--Senator Cruz and I offered an amendment to  Senator Hirono's bill to try to fix this. Unfortunately, we couldn't  get 60 votes. In fact, I don't think a single--maybe I am wrong in  saying this, but not very many of my Democratic friends voted for it.   But I would say to President Biden, now, if you are serious about  ending discrimination against Asian Americans, tell your Justice  Department to get off its ice cold, lazy rear end and do something  about it. Stop the quotas in higher education.   Anyway, that is not, really, what I came up to talk about.                            ____________________     Mr. President, you are aware, as we all are, of the  scourge of opioid abuse in this country. It is horrible. It is  terrible. We sometimes lose as many as 50,000 of our people a year.   And as you also know, many people who become addicted to opioids  don't necessarily buy the opioids on the street. They get the opioids  from family and friends. So one of the best things you can do to try to  stop the scourge of opioid abuse is to clear out your medicine cabinet  so that people aren't tempted to use the drugs. Turn them in, if they  have been prescribed to you, and you don't need them any longer.   To make this easier, our DEA, as you know, Mr. President, holds  pretty regularly what we call Take Back Days. On a Take Back Day, any  person can go into his or her medicine cabinet, find drugs, including  opioids, that they are not using anymore, that could be dangerous if  abused, and they can take those unused medications and drop them off at  a previously announced DEA drop site.   Take Back Day is this Saturday, April 24. I want to encourage all  Americans and Louisianans to do this. Go through your medicine cabinet.  If you have opioids that have been prescribed to you--legally, of  course--and you don't need them any longer, don't just leave them  hanging around. Turn them in, please.   But not every day is Take Back Day, and last year Congress, in its  wisdom, passed a law, a very good law, instructing the Department of  Veterans Affairs to ask--well, actually to require--VA medical centers  to have these drop boxes permanently so that American veterans can  throw away medications, including but not limited to opioids, that they  don't need. And it has worked out really well.   The question that occurred to me after we passed the bill was why  limit that kind of access only to our veterans. So I have a bill to  basically open up the Veterans Administration drop  [[Page S2153]]  boxes for unused drugs, including but not limited to opioids, at VA  medical centers to anybody who wants to go get rid of these unused  drugs at any time. You don't have to wait until Take Back Day. This  would be a permanent program.   The name of the bill is the Dispose Unused Medications and  Prescription Opioids Act. And before I offer this bill up, let me just  give one more plug. I would remind everyone that this Saturday, April  24, is Take Back Day. If you have unused medications, including  opioids, that you want to get rid of, it will have been publicized in  your community by the DEA. You can go drop them off, and I hope people  will do that.   Mr. President, toward that end, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration  of my bill, S. 957, and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    Mr. President, I further ask that the Kennedy substitute  amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to, that the bill, as  amended, be read a third time and passed, and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
