 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Nation's oldest, continuously running Memorial Day parade, the Ironton- Lawrence County Memorial Day Parade.   In 1868, the Grand Army of the Republic established May 30 as  Decoration Day, later changed to Memorial Day, to commemorate soldiers  who died during the Civil War. It was in 1868 that Ironton held their  first parade, and 2018 marks 150 straight years of honoring America's  fallen heroes.   Ironton and Lawrence County have a long association with America's  military. Lawrence County was named for James Lawrence, a naval hero  who commanded the USS Chesapeake. It was Lawrence's dying command  during a naval conflict against the British that is still remembered  today: ``Don't give up the ship.''   The 40 members of the parade committee work year round to organize  the event, which has 12 separate divisions and draws tens of thousands  of visitors annually. I commend the committee and the people of  Lawrence County for their steadfast commitment to remembering and  honoring American heroes over the last 150 years.                            ____________________
