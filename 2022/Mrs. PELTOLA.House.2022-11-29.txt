 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on S. 3115, the  POWER 2.0 Act. This bill is the Senate companion to my bill of the same  title, H.R. 9113.   Both bills address the same flaw in our system, that survivors of  intimate partner-related violence and intimidation often lack the legal  resources they need to protect themselves from future injury. In this  paradigm, victims are too often unable to escape their perpetrators,  often to devastating effect.   Thankfully, in 2018, Congress offered an avenue to relief. The Pro  bono Work to Empower and Represent Act, sponsored by my Senate  colleague, Senator Sullivan, authorized a pilot project calling for  each district court to hold at least one event annually in concert with  domestic violence service providers to promote pro bono legal services  for victims of partner-related violence and intimidation.   Additionally, to address the appalling victimization rates among  Alaska  [[Page H8625]]  Natives and American Indians in particular, the bill also mandates  partnerships between district courts and Tribes and Tribal  organizations.   Since its enactment, the POWER Act has brought together dozens of  service organizations and tens of thousands of lawyers, all with the  aim of combating our skyrocketing rates of violence and intimidation  endemic across many parts of our country.   As one of my first legislative actions in Congress, I am proud to  introduce the POWER 2.0 Act. This bill removes the sunset on the POWER  Act and will ensure more victims have the ability to protect themselves  from further violence and intimidation.   I am both grateful and filled with anticipation to see this body act  so uniformly in favor of this bill, S. 3115, today.
