 Mr. Speaker, in my previous life, before Congress--I am a  veterinarian in the practice for 30 years--I have had the pleasure of  taking care of all of God's creatures. It has been a privilege, a  pleasure, and an honor.   So much is going on in Washington and the world, and we hear a lot of  bad things going on, so tonight we are going to do a Special Order  honoring K-9 Veterans Day, March 13. This evening, my colleagues and I  would like to take a moment and pay tribute to the thousands of working  dogs that serve our Nation.   They serve in the military. They serve in the fire department, the  police department, and the Drug Enforcement Agency. They serve in your  neighbor's house next door to alert people of intruders, maybe a fire,  or finding a lost child. There is a group of people who do search and  rescue only on a volunteer basis.   These unsung heroes, our K-9s, serve our Nation in many ways. Their  contributions to our neighborhoods, communities, towns, cities, States,  and even Nation cannot be overstated.   The biggest thank-you goes out to all of these K-9s serving our  Nation's military and working to keep the homeland safe both here and  abroad, as well as our local law enforcement K-9s. Tonight we honor  you.   Over the past few months, I have had the honor of getting to know the  working K-9s and their handlers that serve  [[Page H1532]]  Florida's Third Congressional District. After great visits,  demonstrations, discussions--and I even had the experience yesterday  with our team in our district; I experienced the subdued tactics of  these dogs, wearing protective gear, of course--I am convinced more  than ever that these amazing animals and their handlers need support  and recognition for the incredible work that they do.   It is not just in north central Florida and northeast Florida. You  can find these selfless heroes in all districts all across our great  country. Whether it is checking the stadiums top to bottom, which,  incidentally, yesterday, when we got to talking to the different  sheriff's organizations, they said, at every Gator game at the  University of Florida, the dogs check the entire stadium.   For those who have been to Gator Nation and seen our stadium there,  it is a huge stadium, as all are, and they check it before every game,  every basketball game, every big venue, and these dogs are out there  working to keep Americans safe. Whether it is checking, as I said, the  stadiums top to bottom for explosives or narcotics prior to big  sporting events or helping find a missing person or being there at just  the right moment when an officer is in need of backup, these K-9s  deserve to have their stories heard tonight.   Tonight we celebrate National K-9 Veterans Day. My colleagues and I  intend to do just that. While we celebrate their services tonight, I  want to encourage all Members to do what they can to support these K- 9s, their handlers, and the departments they represent.   National K-9 Veterans Day began in World War I, when the most famous  K-9, Sergeant Stubby, shined a spotlight on the incredible working dogs  and the value they bring to our national service. Brigadier General  Scott Perry is going to talk about Stubby more tonight, so I will leave  that for him.                                time  1930    In Vietnam, nearly 4,000 dogs actively served, and in Iraq, these  dogs were critical in sniffing out deadly IEDs. Since then, these dogs  have served in our military and law enforcement, working hard to keep  Americans safe. We owe not just today to these K-9s, but a thanks every  day for their service.   To begin tonight, I would recognize the K-9 teams that serve in my  home district and will share many of their stories here tonight.  However, I want to start with one of my favorites from the Alachua  County Sheriff's Office.   In December 2017, in the far northern reaches of rural Alachua  County, a previous victim of domestic violence and battery was walking  out to meet detectives when she heard the voice of her assailant  calling to her from the darkness. Terrified, she ran back inside,  called 911, and deputies responded in an effort to catch the suspect  with active warrants that included kidnapping and sexual assault.   Deputy Sheriff Chris Drake and K-9 Rous arrived, knowing full well  that the suspect had not only stolen the victim's car with a gun inside  earlier, but dug a hole and buried himself to elude a helicopter  searchlight and a floor camera the night before. With that information,  Chris and his dog, Rous, began to track the suspect.   Lifting K-9 Rous over some fences and cutting their way through  others, Deputy Drake and others continued following the suspect's scent  until, as Drake's report reads: ``Rous . . . still smelling human odor  . . . ears forward, and staring intently . . . identified something  lying in the water . . . the man stood up from the water . . . turned  north into the woods and disappeared.''   Continuing their track, K-9 Rous and Deputy Drake again found the  suspect hiding in a separate swamp, with only his back exposed. That is  not a good thing with a catch dog.   When challenged, the felon fled again, and K-9 Rous was released to  catch him. K-9 Rous ran into the water, swam briefly, and apprehended  the suspect on the arm, enduring punches to the head and holding on  until deputies could arrive and assist, placing the suspect in  handcuffs for a trip to the hospital and then jail.   These deputies and their K-9 partners are on the road every day,  working 12-hour shifts, 24 hours a day, supporting every local law  enforcement patrol task and providing mutual aid to our neighboring  jurisdictions when called upon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham),  another veterinarian.    Mr. Speaker, next I yield to the gentleman from my  Pennsylvania, Brigadier General Scott Perry, my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania,  Brigadier General Scott Perry, for sharing that story.   The attitude and loyalty of the dog is amazing, as well as the  singularity of purpose in their drive and ambition.   Like I said, yesterday, we got to experience police K-9 dogs going  after a victim. I was the victim. I had a glove on my arm. But we saw  the intent and the way those dogs focus. They showed us a demonstration  of sniffing out gunpowder. They hid it in a big room with all sorts of  explosives. These dogs just go to task and don't complain. I think  there is a lesson we all can learn from.   I thank the gentleman for his participation and for his story. I look  forward to that movie. It is funny how people say dogs can't talk, but  we know they do through their body language. That is why movies like  that that highlight the actions of an animal, especially dogs, do so  well. I know that will be a blockbuster.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Jones).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from North Carolina.  And I love that story. That is a great story. What you touched on is  the loyalty, the trust, the integrity of these working dogs--not only  in the work they do, but when they come back to the home--of what they  do. It is unconditional love and unconditional loyalty.   We should take a lesson from that as humans, shouldn't we?    Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to tell a story  from my district, and this deals with seizing the drugs and profits  that arm criminals: As part of their regularly assigned duties with the  Gainesville-Alachua County Drug Task Force, Sergeant Bryan Jones and K- 9 Jerry responded to assist another agent with a traffic stop on  Interstate 75. Despite a series of efforts by the suspect, like those  seen on television to hide contraband in hidden compartments, K-9 Jerry  couldn't be fooled--locating nearly $100,000 in cash and over a  kilogram of narcotics. It is just amazing how these dogs know what to  do and they are so good at it. They smell things that we can't even  think about with their sensory perception.   Another story is rescuing those that need our help: In February 2018,  the Florida Highway Patrol contacted the Alachua County Sheriff's  Office after finding an abandoned vehicle along Interstate 75 near San  Felasco Hammock Preserve State Park. It appeared as though the driver,  diagnosed with a mental illness and having fled his home in south  Florida, may have wandered into the park and its over 7,000 acres of  forest, sinkholes, rattle snakes, ponds, alligators, and trails.   Deputy Sheriff Lloyd O'Quinn and K-9 Eins began tracking the subject  through the woods until becoming physically exhausted in the heat.  Deputy Sheriff James Riley and K-9 Knight, Deputy Sheriff Esau Bright  and K-9 Rosco, Deputy Sheriff Chris Drake and K-9 Rous, and Sergeant  Michael Hurlocker and K-9 Havok all responded and relieved one another  with tracking throughout the park.   After tracking and searching the wooded area for several hours, and  with the help of the prison bloodhounds sent to assist from the Florida  Department of Corrections, the driver was safely located and was  provided the treatment he needed at an area hospital to the relief of  his family and friends far away.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia,  Tom Garrett, a good friend of mine that served in our military in the  Army.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Virginia. The  gentleman brought up some great things there, the dedication of the  handlers. Here we have got the Clay County Sheriff's Department with  Diesel, a bloodhound that these guys are so dedicated with the dogs  that they work with. It is unbelievable, the good they do, the search  and the rescue that they do. And you brought up on Maggie how she had-- the 350th working call that Maggie had performed for the people of our  country.   And this is something people don't realize, the amount of calls these  dogs go on and the amount of work that they do. The average lifespan or  service of these dogs is anywhere from 7 to 9 years, and people wonder  about the cost of the dog, the cost of a program. Yeah, it is expensive  to keep these dogs, but what we have found is so many people out there  who are goodhearted who realize the benefit of the working K-9 that  they donate the cost of the dog. Many times the cost of the dog can run  from $5,000 to $9,000 by the time you get it trained, and $4,000 to  $5,000 a year to maintain these. And there is a lot of community help  to make sure this gets done.   Mr. Speaker, I will now talk about another dog at the Gainesville  Police Department: Justice is a German Shepherd that worked for the  Gainesville Police Department starting in September 2006. During his  career, Justice was responsible for locating hundreds of--hundreds of  offenders. He assisted several other agencies throughout his career to  include the Florida Highway Patrol, the Alachua County Sheriff's  Office, the Putnam County Sheriff's Office, the University of Florida  Police Department, the City of Alachua Police Department, and the City  of High Springs Police Department.   Justice was credited with saving a life. The incident involved a  suicidal person who had taken a deadly amount of prescription pills,  left a suicide note, and walked off into the woods. After 2 hours of  officers trying to locate the person, Officer Owens and Justice were  called to the scene while off duty. Justice was able to track and  locate the person who was passed out by the effects of the pill and  clinging to life. EMS was called, and the person was taken to the  hospital. Doctors stated that if the person was not located when they  were, the medications taken would have, no doubt, ended in their death  and another suicide.    Justice received a lifesaving award through the department. On the  last night of his career, Justice was called to locate a suspect that  fled from an officer who recognized him as a felony habitual traffic  offender and a drug dealer. The officer tried to conduct a traffic stop  on the vehicle being driven by the suspect. When the officer activated  his overhead lights, the suspect turned off his headlights, accelerated  to a high speed, fleeing through a neighborhood. The officer did not  pursue the vehicle. Another officer located the abandoned vehicle  minutes later. A perimeter search was established.   Office Charles Owens and Justice responded to the scene. Justice  began a track from the driver's side door. The track led through  several backyards and for several blocks. Justice's track led into a  wooded area where the suspect was located by Justice trying to conceal  himself under a fallen tree. If not for Justice, the suspect would have  eluded capture. Justice was sent to retire at the end of the shift,  which ended at 4 a.m. He captured his last suspect just in the nick of  time at 3 a.m. Officer Owens took possession of Justice after his  retirement, and they have been with each other since.   Justice turns 15 on March 15 of this year and is still as active as  he can be in his seasoned age. And I think, again, that is a model for  all of us to follow.   Another story, Mr. Speaker, K-9 deputy successfully talks down an  armed suicidal subject: The Marion County Sheriff's Office deputies  responded to the 17,800 block of County Road 25 in reference to a  domestic altercation. It was learned that the suspect battered and  strangled a female victim. The suspect fled the area, just prior to the  deputy's arrival. K-9 Deputy Jeremie Nix and K-9 Drago tracked and  located the suspect in a wooded area, at which time the suspect advised  he was armed with a firearm and a knife and threatened suicide.  [[Page H1536]]                                     time  2000    Deputy Nix was able to create a dialogue with the suspect and  persuaded him to surrender peacefully. He did not have a firearm, but  he was armed with a knife. The suspect was arrested and charged with  domestic battery by strangulation and is being held in the Marion  County Jail on $10,000 bond.   During this standoff, Deputy Nix and K-9 Drago accidentally stepped  into a yellow jacket nest and were stung over 20 times. K-9 Drago was  taken to the veterinarian's office to be checked out after the call,  and he and Deputy Nix recovered and are back to work. Great job for  everyone.   The K-9 team locates burglar, recovers approximately $3,500 of stolen  property: On the morning of Thursday, February 1, 2018, Marion County  Sheriff's Office deputies responded to Ernie's Auction Center, located  at 5305 South Pine, in reference to a burglary that just occurred.   As employees were opening the business, it was observed that the  front door had been forcibly entered and suspects were observed running  through the inside of the business.   Deputy Branden Donahue and his K-9 partner, Tipster, and Deputy  Nickolas Frost immediately tracked the suspect and located him within  30 minutes. During the track, two different locations were found where  the suspects were stashing stolen items from the business. The stolen  property, valued at $3,500, was recovered and returned to the  businessowner.   People just don't realize the acute sense that these dogs have and  why they are so valuable.   Another story is about Deputy Brian Litz. On February 7, 2004, Deputy  Brian Litz and another deputy responded to the Pine Run subdivision in  reference to a well-being check on a 74-year-old individual.   When the deputies arrived at the house, the individual met them at  the door with a handgun. Deputy Litz was attempting to pass under the  front window of the home to get a better visual on the individual with  the gun. Unknown to Deputy Litz, this person was watching from the  window, and he then shot and killed Litz.   Today, a statue in honor of Deputy Litz and his K-9 stands proudly in  Florida's capital. In a tragic twist, Deputy Litz' call sign was  Batman. Today, visitors of this statue at the Florida capital can find  the Batman emblem on the bottom of his K-9's foot.   Just an amazing story and, again, a great example of the ability of  these dogs and their success in helping out with people, whether it is  the person in need, the lost individual, search and rescue, the drug  dealer, and just people who want to do other people harm in domestic  violence.   I just want to briefly talk about dogs and handlers. The Putnam  County Sheriff's Office has five dogs: Aries, handled by Sergeant Randy  Hayes; Judo, handled by Blaine Moody; Zeke, handled by Jerry Gentry;  Halo, handled by Josue Garriga; and Putnam, named after the county,  handled by Emmett Merritt.   Bradford County Sheriff's Office: Deputy Brandon Shoup and K-9 Grim.   Ocala Police Department: Officer King and K-9 Zorba; Officer Burgos  and K-9 Babbo; Officer Arnold and K-9 Senior.   The Marion County Sheriff's Office, again, yesterday, we had the  privilege of going down and presenting all the working dogs and their  handlers with our Congressional Challenge Coin. As you can see, that  dog looks rather well the way he is wearing that. At the Marion County  Sheriff's Office, where we were yesterday, we got to have the  demonstration on the catch dogs, or attack dogs, and we got a great  demonstration. There are: Sergeant Daniel Trammell and K-9 Nitro;  Deputy Alan Lee, who handles K-9 Zeus; Deputy Timothy Fretts with his  dog, K-9 Robo; Deputy Colton Sullivan with his dog, K-9 Adelmo; Deputy  Matt Bowers with K-9 Otow, which is named after a retirement village  that donated the money for their dog; Deputy Jeremie Nix with his dog,  K-9 Drago; Deputy Branden Donahue with his dog, K-9 Tipster; and as we  just heard the story, Deputy Matt Hopper with K-9 Rambo.   The Gainesville Police Department: Corporal Jeff Kerkau with his dog,  K-9 Roo; Corporal Dylan Hayes-Morrison and his K-9 Ares; Officer Rob  Rogers and K-9 Nero; Officer Ed Ratliff and his dog, K-9 Ace; Officer  Josh Meurer and his dog, K-9 Ranger.   And the Alachua County Sheriff's Office:   Deputy Sheriff Lloyd O'Quinn and K-9 Eins. We just heard a story  about them. A Malinois working in patrol, narcotics, and tracking.   Deputy Sheriff Esau Bright and K-9 Deacon, a Malinois working in  patrol, narcotics, and trafficking.   That is what a lot of people don't realize. These dogs are trained in  multiple disciplines and just work their hearts out.   Deputy Sheriff Mikell McKoy and his dog, K-9 Kaos, a Malinois working  in patrol, narcotics, and trafficking.   Deputy Sheriff Brian Ritter and his dog, K-9 Kolt, a Malinois working  in patrol, narcotics, and trafficking.   Deputy Sheriff Chris Griseck and his dog, K-9 Mack, a Malinois  working in patrol, bombing, and tracking.   Then there is Deputy Sheriff Bill Arnold and his dog, K-9 Wick, a  Malinois working in patrol, narcotics, and trafficking.   I think we are getting the point here of how valuable these dogs are.  I would recommend to people, if you want to see the value and why we  want to spend money and allow these dogs to be in our law enforcement,  military, DEA, then watch demonstrations of these dogs and the  acuteness of them.   There is Deputy Sheriff Chris Drake and his dog, K-9 Rous, a Malinois  working in patrol, bomb, and tracking.   Sergeant Michael Hurlocker, who we heard the story of, and his K-9  partner, Havok, a Malinois working in patrol, bomb, and tracking.   Deputy Sheriff Adam Diaz and his dog, K-9 Shiloh, a Labrador  Retriever working with the Drug Task Force.   Sergeant Bryan Jones and K-9 Jerry, a Malinois working with the Drug  Task Force.   And then there is Sergeant Nigel Lowe and K-9 Zoey, a mixed breed  working narcotics detection in our schools; and K-9 Malzi, a Malinois  just joining the sheriff's office as a gun detection dog in our  schools.    It is interesting, after the Parkland shooting on February 14, we had  a roundtable of law enforcement, county sheriffs, city police chiefs,  superintendents, school resource officers, and one of the things that  came out of there is how the resource officers in our schools act as a  deterrent for a lot of the kids. They are there. They see a person of  authority.   One of the sheriffs brought up what I thought was a great suggestion  that a lot of people also thought was a great suggestion, and that is a  dog that can detect gunpowder in our schools. Let them tour the  schools, let them show what the policemen can do beneficially to all of  us.   It is a shame that we are in a time in society where we have to worry  about guns going off in school, but until we rectify the underlying  cause of that, I think we need to do what we can to keep our schools  safe so our kids feel safe going to school.   I just want to end with this picture. Again, this is the Clay County  Sheriff's Office with their dog, Diesel, who proudly took our  Congressional Challenge Coin.   Mr. Speaker, I want to give a shout-out to all the offices that  participated and shared stories with us. We are proud of them. We are  proud of their K-9s. I don't want to say we are more proud of the K-9s  than we are of them, but we are proud of all of them for the work that  they do to keep us safer as citizens of the Third Congressional  District, but also around the country and around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
