 Mr. Speaker, today, House Republicans will move one step  closer to giving a budget-busting $2 trillion tax cut to the  superwealthy on the backs of hardworking Americans, one step closer to  increasing taxes on vulnerable Americans, one step closer to gutting  Medicaid by $1 trillion and slashing Medicare by $500 billion, one step  closer to decimating programs that help veterans, seniors, students,  and families.   Many families in my home district in Ohio are struggling--struggling  because they haven't had a pay increase in over a decade. That is why,  instead of pushing Donald Trump's ``Billionaire's First Tax Cut Plan,''  we need to ensure that all Americans have a chance to achieve an  American Dream by expanding the earned income tax credit, child care  tax credit, and low housing income tax credit, not capping retirement  contributions, and eliminating tax loopholes that allow U.S. companies  to profit from shipping jobs overseas.   Mr. Speaker, it is time that we provide a level playing field for all  families to truly help them have a better life.                            ____________________
