 Madam Speaker, I rise in absolute fury today over what is  going on to American women and this horrific decision by the Supreme  Court to take away a fundamental right--for the first time in our  Nation's history, to take away a fundamental right for millions of  American women.   Egregious enough in its own right that this has happened, we compound  it with the fact that tens of thousands of women who have stood up to  answer our Nation's call, to raise their right hand, to take the oath,  to give their life for this country, to defend our freedoms, now don't  have the same freedoms themselves.   What is going on in this country?   I served this country as an Army Ranger, three combat tours in Iraq  and Afghanistan. I served with my fellow men and women. I now sit in  this body. I sit on the Committee on Armed Services with my good  friend, Jackie Speier, where we now make policy that impacts the very  servicemembers like I used to be.   I remember what it was like being Private Crow, sitting in those  boots, having to live with the consequences of the decisions made under  this dome. I think about that now. I think about all the young women  who want to serve. Maybe they want to follow in the footsteps of their  mother or their grandmother. Maybe they are deeply patriotic people,  and they want to give back to their country. Maybe they are trying to  pursue better opportunities and get some money for college.                                time  1630    Whatever the motivation, they stand up and take the same oath that I  took and the same oath that millions of others have taken over our  Nation's history. It is an oath that says you are willing to give your  life and put it all on the line for your fellow countrymen and -women.  Now, we are asking those women to not just be willing to give their  lives in defense of our Nation but to do so in a way that sets aside  their own fundamental rights and their own freedoms and gives them  second-class citizenship in the process of doing it.   What is going on in this country and in this Capitol? We know that  abortion care is a time-sensitive and necessary procedure, and we know  that if servicemembers can't access this necessary healthcare, their  very own health is in jeopardy.   Let's just take a minute. Let's just set aside the moral arguments.  Let's just park those for a minute and just talk about military  readiness. Let's talk about the defense of this Nation that people love  to talk about here in this Capitol: support the troops, tie a yellow  ribbon around the tree. All right, how about we actually do right by  the people who are willing to make those sacrifices?   Servicemembers don't have a choice of where they go to serve. That is  part of the deal. You raise your right hand, go to boot camp, get  trained on your job, and go where the Nation needs you. Are we really  going to send thousands of women to places where they don't have rights  and can't access healthcare? How is that in the interests of our force?  How does that create a healthy, productive, vibrant military? How is  that good for recruiting? Well, it is not, obviously.   It is not often where we have an issue that is just so egregiously  abusive to people who are trying to do the right thing. It is not often  where we are literally in a position of dissuading young men and women  from serving this Nation and making it harder for them to do it and  making it harder for our military to recruit them.   That is why I have been proud to work with Jackie Speier. We started  this effort by co-leading together the MARCH for Servicemembers Act,  and then we talked to folks. We held roundtables. We held discussions.  We knew that just wasn't going to do it, that that wasn't enough. We  had to do more.   That is why we drafted and are pursuing this legislation, the Access  to Reproductive Care for Servicemembers Act, which will require  commanders to approve leave for abortion care automatically. It will  make DOD reimburse servicemembers for the cost of travel to receive  care, and it guarantees privacy protections for servicemembers against  retaliation from commanding officers and peers.   Imagine that, being retaliated against by your commanding officer.  Well, it should be illegal, and we are going to try to make it illegal.   Folks, until we can pass a national law protecting abortion care and  abortion rights for women, which we are going to try to do--and we are  going to have to get rid of the filibuster to do it in the Senate-- until we do that, we are going to do everything possible to protect  everybody we can.  [[Page H8007]]    Now, today, it is going to continue with us protecting our  servicewomen. They are willing to give everything for us. The least we  can do is have their backs.   We must pass this bill. I implore my fellow Members to walk the talk.  Don't just talk about supporting our servicemembers. Do it. This is the  way to do it. We can and must do this. We must have their back. Let's  get this done.
