 Mr. Chairman, do we have a role as Congress to protect  American families?   In my home State of Florida, it is hard to go anywhere without  meeting a family who was affected by the foreclosure crisis. Many not  only lost their homes, but their life savings.   Through Dodd-Frank, Congress created the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau to go after the bad actors that made tough times  worse for homeowners in Florida by giving the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau the authority to go after mortgage companies for  deceptive practices, threatening people who were behind on payments and  putting them into debt collection when they were eligible for loan  modification programs.   Dodd-Frank also allowed state attorneys general to file consumer  protection lawsuits against bad actors on behalf of families in their  States.   The Financial CHOICE Act would repeal these important consumer  protections and return us to a time when families were being unfairly  forced into foreclosure.   Mr. Chairman, we can't go back. This is America, where we take care  of our own, don't we? If Congress doesn't protect American families,  who will?    I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and to reject this bill.
