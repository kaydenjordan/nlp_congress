 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  recognize this month of February as Black History Month. Black History  Month is an important celebration of the achievements and sacrifices of  African-Americans in building our nation.   Black History Month has a rich history itself, from its humble  beginnings as `Negro Awareness Week', celebrated in February to  coincide with the birth months of both Frederick Douglass and President  Lincoln, the expansion to a month was first celebrated at Kent State  University in 1970, before being officially recognized by President  Gerald Ford in 1976, who said that it was a `seize the opportunity to  honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in  every area of endeavor throughout our history'. February has  [[Page H1176]]  been officially designated as Black History Month by every President  since, and while the month is not itself sufficient to honor the  legacies of African-Americans, it makes a good start.   This year is especially important, as is this day, as we honor the  200th birthday of Frederick Douglass, a towering presence in African- American history. Born into slavery, secretly teaching himself to read  and write, Frederick Douglass would become a powerful voice for  abolition, and for the equality of all people.   But during this month, we must honor not only Frederick Douglass and  the other leading figures of our movement, but also the thousands of  ordinary African-Americans who formed the tide that swept slavery from  our nation, the many people who continue in the effort to eradicate  racism today, and all those who will do so in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Al Green for convening this  special order session, so that we can appropriately honor Black History  Month, and recognize the sacrifice and courage of African-Americans  throughout our nation's history.                            ____________________
