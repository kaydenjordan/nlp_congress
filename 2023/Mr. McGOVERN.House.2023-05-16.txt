 Mr. Speaker, one of the major reasons people get  readmitted to the hospital is what is in their cabinet at home or, more  notably, what isn't.   A poor diet, combined with conditions like heart disease and  diabetes, contributes to a staggering number of hospital readmissions  every day.   Finally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is providing  greater flexibility for those using and paying for medically tailored  meals. For those too sick to cook, these prepared and delivered  medically tailored meals often make all the difference.   It has been a long road to get here. I have introduced legislation on  this, launched the Food is Medicine Working Group, and uplifted  organizations across America that prepare these meals.   We still need to push for medically tailored meals to be a covered  Medicare benefit, but this is great news and one of the many  transformative changes stemming from last year's White House Conference  on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. It will make opening the pantry less  painful for our neighbors and help end hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I begin today with a story. Once upon a time in  Congress, House Republicans put forward their top agenda, a package of  bills so crucial, so urgent, that teeing them up for consideration was  one of the very first things we did on the floor of this Congress-- after, of course, Kevin McCarthy's 15 votes for Speaker.   Tucked into this package was a little bill about supporting the  police, H. Con. Res. 5, a simple, nonbinding resolution, really, that  didn't do much. It was purely symbolic, but it did express support for  our Nation's police, all of our Nation's police.   But something mysterious happened, Mr. Speaker, and I hope you will  join me in trying to solve that mystery today.   Instead of bringing their bill up right away, Republicans waited, and  they waited, and they waited. They waited until this week, and they  brought up a bill, but something changed. See, in the original bill,  the language read that Congress expresses support for the Nation's law  enforcement agencies.   As you can see, Mr. Speaker, ``Nation's,'' ``Nation's.'' It was about  all of our police. In their new bill, the one that we are considering  today, they only express support for local enforcement officers.   Here is the new bill, Mr. Speaker. We see the word ``local,''  ``local''--nothing about our Nation's law enforcement officers, just  ``local.'' Huh. That is weird. What a strange change.   It is National Police Week, but they took out all of our national  police agencies. Democrats searched and searched and searched for a  reason. We looked high and low in the Rules Committee, but we couldn't  find an answer.   Not a single person, not one Republican, Mr. Speaker, has been able  to articulate to us who made that change, when it was made, or, most  importantly, why it was made.   No one was able to explain to us why Republicans edited their bill  from saying ``any efforts to defund or dismantle law enforcement  agencies'' to any ``efforts to defund or dismantle local law  enforcement agencies.''   Here is the important thing, and call it the moral of the story, if  you will. The change was not without consequence because what the GOP  did was cut out every officer at the FBI, ATF, CBP, U.S. Marshals  Service, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Protective Service, and  Secret Service. They cut out every officer at the United States Capitol  Police. They cut out the police who are standing outside these Chamber  doors right now, keeping us safe. They cut out all the police who  rushed to this building to keep all of my GOP friends safe on January  6, 2021.    Apparently, our Republican colleagues think National Police Week  shouldn't include our national police.   I wish I could say that this was an unsolved mystery, I really do,  but the answer is obvious, Mr. Speaker. The new Republican position is  that they only support some police.   The new Republican position as of 2 weeks ago is that they want to  defund police. They voted to cut COPS grants, fire 400 local police  officers, defund the FBI, and cut grant funding for State and local law  enforcement agencies.   The new Republican position, as put forward by their frontrunner for  President, is that we ought to pardon the convicted criminals, white  supremacists, and neo-Nazis who beat cops, crushed them in doors, and  hit them with fire extinguishers on January 6.   The new Republican position is to give George Santos due process  before he is kicked out but to deport legal immigrants who haven't even  been charged with a crime.   Here is what I see today, Mr. Speaker. It seems like Republicans back  the blue until they realize that laws apply to them, too.   That gets me to my final point because an important change is  happening here today, and I want law enforcement officers across this  country to take note. I know many of them are watching because it is  police week, National Police Week, and here is what I want them to  know: Democrats want to keep communities safe.   Democrats want to address gun violence in our schools, an issue I  hear from police officers about all the time.   Democrats want to invest in programs that keep our communities safe,  programs that get to the root causes of crime.   Democrats want to make sure police aren't put in situations they  aren't trained to handle.   Democrats have passed bills that protect our communities and support  our police, bills to help cops with PTSD and to invest in small police  departments.   Republicans want to wrap their arms around the police while they cut  funding.   Make sure we don't forget this, Mr. Speaker: 21 Republicans voted  against awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the Capitol Police-- 21.   Republicans changed their bill to deliberately exclude America's  national police agencies from National Police Week, which dishonors and  disrespects the Capitol Police officers who protect our Capitol  Building.   Republicans are using our law enforcement officers like political  pawns. They are putting politics over public safety.   It is clear, Mr. Speaker, that my Republican friends have lost their  way on law enforcement today, and it is clear who is in charge. It is  not Speaker McCarthy. It is the most extreme of the extreme, and once  again, the American people lose.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am happy to yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota if she could  respond to a question that we couldn't get an answer to in the Rules  Committee last night as to why Republicans did not bring up their  original bill, H. Con. Res. 5, the one that they made in order with  their opening day rules package.   I don't know whether she can explain it to me. I am happy to yield  her some time to do that. The silence is deafening, Mr. Speaker,  because the question that we asked in the Rules Committee last night  that nobody could answer is, in their original bill we honored our  entire Nation's law enforcement, including the Capitol Police, who  protected us on January 6. However, the bill they bring up today  changed all that and basically narrowed it down to local police but  took out any recognition of our Capitol Police or any of our Federal  law enforcement officers.   The gentlewoman will not answer the question. Nobody in the Rules  Committee would answer the question.   To the gentleman from Pennsylvania who just spoke, who was talking  about defunding the police, I will tell you, when I was the chairman of  the Rules Committee, we didn't bring any resolutions to the floor to  defund the police.   Two weeks ago, my Republican friends voted to cut money for local law  enforcement and for our Federal law enforcement agencies. They are the  ones who voted to defund the police. Just don't believe me; you can  Google it. Check it out. Two weeks ago, their bill that they brought to  the floor will cut law enforcement agencies.   Give me a break, Mr. Speaker.   Again, the idea that my Republican friends made a conscious decision  to remove the Capitol Police from a resolution honoring our Nation's  police is beyond the pale.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a  letter from the Department of Justice regarding the cuts proposed  within the Republicans' debt limit bill.    My Republican friends are actively cutting funding from  Federal law enforcement that work to protect us every day. Their plan  would also cut funding for nearly 400 local law enforcement positions.  I mean, Republicans cannot be serious about supporting law enforcement  when they are actively using their majority to defund them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Indiana began her remarks by  talking about National Police Week, but the resolution doesn't honor  our national police. The Republicans made a conscious decision to  remove the Capitol Police, FBI, ATF, CBP, U.S. Marshals Service,  Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Federal Protective Service, and the  Secret Service. I am happy to yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana to  help me understand why the Republicans changed the wording of their  resolution. I am happy to yield her any time.   Mr. Speaker, again, the gentlewoman from Minnesota says we are  playing word games. No, we are not. The only people playing word games  are my Republican friends. They introduced a bill that honored all of  our police, and then they changed it. They made a conscious decision to  change it because I think they are afraid of the extreme of the extreme  of their base that somehow don't want to admit that anything bad  happened here on January 6, and they are afraid if they honor the  Capitol Police that somehow their extreme base would be offended. That  is just sick, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we defeat the previous question. If we do, I  will offer an amendment to the rule for consideration of a resolution  which states that it is the House's responsibility to protect and  preserve Social Security and Medicare for future generations and reject  any cuts to these essential programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record along with any extraneous material immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, Social Security and Medicare are vital to  many of our constituents' economic health security, and yet many of my  Republican friends across the aisle have called for major cuts to these  critical programs. Once again, I am offering my friends the opportunity  to reassure the American people, not just with rhetoric but with their  votes, that they will not cut these vital programs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Tlaib) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me just say to the gentleman, again, the only people who in this  Chamber voted to defund the police are my Republican friends. Two weeks  ago, you all voted for a bill to cut money for local law enforcement,  every one of you.   Let's talk about the police that you are not honoring here today.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a CNN  story about two FBI agents who were shot and killed last week, and yet  they have been taken off the list of law enforcement officials that we  are honoring.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the  Record the names of the law enforcement officers who died as a result  of the Capitol riots: U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, U.S.  Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood, D.C. Police Officer Jeffrey  Smith, D.C. Police Officer Gunther Hashida, D.C. Police Officer Kyle  DeFreytag.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to also include in  the Record a CNN story about the 21 Republicans who voted ``no'' on a  bill to award Congressional Gold Medals for the January 6 police  officers.    Mr. Speaker, again, I am happy to yield to the  gentleman from New York whatever time he needs, but I guess he left the  floor. I would like somebody to explain to me why Republicans decided  to change the wording of the bill that they introduced at the opening  day session of Congress to exclude all of our Federal  [[Page H2367]]  police officers and exclude our Capitol Police.   I don't quite understand why they did that except I think they are  afraid of their base, the extreme element of their base who basically  do not want to honor them. I find that really disturbing.   Again, talking about defunding the police, the only people in this  Chamber who voted to cut money for the police are on the other side of  the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, what the gentleman who just spoke neglected to say is he  only wants to honor some of our police officers. They made a conscious  decision to, quite frankly, remove our national police, our Capitol  Police, from the resolution that they were originally included in.   He said don't believe us. Well, the words are here. This is their  original bill: ``H. Con. Res. 5, Expressing support for the Nation's  law enforcement agencies and condemning any efforts to defund or  dismantle law enforcement agencies.'' Their new bill was changed to  just say ``local law enforcement.''   They made a conscious decision to do that. The gentleman keeps on  quoting, and there is an old saying that the only thing that really  matters around here is votes. Everything else is B.S. We can play this  game of quotes versus votes, but the bottom line is the votes are what  matter and what matters the most.   My friends on the other side of the aisle 2 weeks ago brought a bill  that they all voted for that cut money for law enforcement at every  level. They voted for that. That is their record. I hope my friends  will appreciate that.   As we honor our Nation's police officers, as we should, I have to say  it is disappointing that we are only honoring some, that a conscious,  deliberate decision was made to exclude others. I find that really,  really disturbing, and, quite frankly, we tried to fix it last night in  the Rules Committee. We tried to fix it in the Judiciary Committee, and  all the Republicans voted it down.   I urge people to look at the votes. The votes are what matters.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman runs out, I will just say  you can yell all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that my  friends on the other side of the aisle, including the gentleman, voted  to cut money for local law enforcement   Mr. Speaker, what they did is they voted to cut a million dollars per  State  [[Page H2368]]  in Federal money for our local law enforcement. They would fire, lay  off, 400 local police officers. That is what would happen if their bill  that they voted on 2 weeks ago became law. It could cut COPS grants. It  would cut other DOJ funding for our local police.   The gentleman who just had a meltdown on the floor, screaming and  yelling, comes on the floor all the time to talk about our border. I  mean, my Republican friends made a conscious decision to remove Customs  and Border Protection from the bill honoring our law enforcement.   I would like somebody to answer why. They removed the Capitol Police.  They removed the FBI. They also removed CBP.   Mr. Speaker, their bill, according to the Department of Justice, if  it became a law, the reduction in support for our police and Federal  law enforcement would result in a reduction in our operations  equivalent to the following: 154,000 pounds of cocaine not seized, 859  pounds of fentanyl and 1,948 pounds of heroin not seized, 17,148 pounds  of methamphetamine not seized, $9 million in currency not seized, 561  criminals not arrested, 57,594 apprehensions not made, and 361 people  not rescued. The gentleman says he is being fiscally responsible, and  that is why they voted for these cuts? Enough.    Again, can somebody please explain to me from the party that voted to  defund the police why the omission, why were the words of the  Republican bill changed to omit all of these other brave men and women  who are protecting people all across this country and the Capitol  Police who protect us every single day?   By the way, the gentleman who just spoke was among those who voted  not to give a Congressional Gold Medal to the Capitol Police. Thank  goodness 400 Members, Democrats and Republicans, disagreed with him.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the  Record an article from MSNBC titled: ``The list of Republicans open to  `defunding' the FBI keeps growing.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say I am concerned because, on the one  hand, my Republican colleagues say they support the police. On the  other hand, their own Members are calling on Congress to defund Federal  law enforcement.   They want to defund the FBI. They want to defund ATF. They want to  defund DOJ.   I guess it just shows that Republicans support only some of the  police. In fact, there is a Member on the other side of the aisle who  is selling ``Defund the FBI'' T-shirts on her web page.   Mr. Speaker, I have asked over and over and over again why the  Republican bill was changed to exclude a whole bunch of law enforcement  officers on the Federal level, including the Capitol Police. As those  who are watching this debate saw, every time I wanted to yield to get  an answer, there was silence.   Nobody can explain why this happened. Nobody will help us solve this  mystery as to why they decided not to honor a whole bunch of our brave  men  [[Page H2369]]  and women who protect us in so many ways all across this country. It is  baffling to me that this is where we are.   I began by telling a story, and let me end with telling a story.   Mr. Speaker, I was here on January 6. I was in the Speaker's chair on  January 6. I was the last person off the House floor. I saw everybody  who was here in this Chamber, including some of my colleagues on the  Republican side, cowering behind Capitol Police officers because they  were afraid for their lives. It was a terrible, terrible day.   Luckily, nobody here was injured, none of us, none of the Members of  Congress or our staff. The Capitol Police protected us that day. I  mean, we owe them our lives.   Today, as we honor our national police, my Republican friends thought  it was appropriate to remove them from the list of people being  honored. I find that disgraceful.   I can't even imagine what the thinking was to make that kind of  decision. It is so insulting and so offensive to the people who  protected us that day and protect us each and every day. I don't  understand that.   I can't get a response, but we know what is going on here. We know  that they removed the Capitol Police and that they removed some of  these Federal law enforcement agencies because they were afraid they  were going to lose votes on their side, that some of their Members  would not vote to honor all of our law enforcement officials. Let that  sink in for a minute.   This should have been a day of unity. This should have been a truly  bipartisan endeavor to get us legislation to the floor that everybody  could support, that we could all say thank you to our police. But, no,  it is politicized.   They get up here and start quoting people on defund the police, but  they don't tell anybody that they voted to defund the police 2 weeks  ago. It is public record. Every one of them did, including the  gentleman who was down here screaming.   He gets on the floor all the time and talks about the need that we  have to better protect our border, yet the people who are charged with  protecting our border were removed from the list of people we were  honoring.   This is not right by any measure. It is not right. I am so  disappointed that my Republican friends have decided to politicize  this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question so we can protect Social Security and Medicare, and I urge  them to vote ``no'' on this rule.   This is beneath this institution. This is not honoring our police.  This is politicizing our police. This is saying to some of our police  that we don't value their service. It is saying to the Capitol Police  that we don't value their service.   How dare anybody on the other side suggest that? How dare you bring a  bill to the floor that does just that? This is sickening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
