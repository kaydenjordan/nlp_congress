 Mr. Chair, in 2019, the United States became energy  independent for the first time in 62 years. However, on his first day  in office, President Biden destroyed American energy production by  killing the Keystone XL pipeline and outsourcing our energy needs to  our enemies.   President Biden's energy policies not only hurt our families at the  pump, but they also threaten our national security. That is why I have  introduced an amendment to H.R. 1, my Defend America's Rural Energy  Act, to defend our farmers and energy producers from foreign adversary  land grabs. My amendment would specifically prohibit China from buying  farmland suitable for ethanol and biodiesel production, which is vital  to the rural American economy.   Honoring our Commitment to America, Republicans will end Biden's war  on American energy and fulfill another promise to the American people,  and that is keeping American land in the hands of the American farmer.   Mr. Chair, I am a passionate supporter of H.R. 1.
