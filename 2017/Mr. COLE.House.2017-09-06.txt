 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 500 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 500         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 3354) making appropriations for the Department       of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.

Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Oklahoma?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Oklahoma?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule for consideration of H.R. 3354, the Department of the  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018,  also known as the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act  of 2018. The rule provides for 2 hours of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us is the second  installment of the House's effort to pass all 12 appropriations bills  on the floor for the first time since 2006. The overall package will  consider the remaining eight bills, covering $416.3 billion in total  spending. It represents many months of work by the Appropriations  Committee.   Today's rule covers four divisions of the bill: the Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act; the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations  Act; the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Appropriations Act; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.   Together, these four divisions encompass $168.2 billion of  discretionary Federal spending. This represents a decrease of $7.8  billion from fiscal year 2017, as Congress seeks to fulfill its  obligation to the American people to be fiscally responsible stewards  of the taxpayers' hard earned money.   Most importantly, it represents the next step in fulfilling the  greatest responsibility we have as legislators: to fund the Federal  Government and keep it open each year to provide our constituents the  services they deserve while ensuring that we appropriately prioritize  where and how to spend taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies division will provide  approximately $20 billion in appropriations, a decrease of $870  [[Page H6679]]  million from fiscal year 2017. The division will fund critical programs  for farmers and ranchers, which is of critical importance to my home  State of Oklahoma.   The bill also supports conservative priorities, including language  rolling back regulations that harm businesses, industries, farming and  ranching operations, and rural and urban communities alike. In  particular, the bill includes language allowing schools to get waivers  from particularly problematic Obama administration regulations  governing school lunches, and prevents the Commodities Futures Trading  Commission from imposing harmful de minimis levels of trading activity  that would force thousands of end users to comply with onerous  regulatory requirements.   The bill also includes language changing the Food and Drug  Administration's predicate date rules for premium cigars, e-cigarettes,  and vaping products, thereby preventing the FDA from regulating these  industries out of existence.   There is much to like in the Agriculture Appropriations division, and  I look forward to considering the bill on the floor.   On the security side of the ledger, the Department of Homeland  Security Appropriations division provides $44.3 billion, an increase of  $1.9 billion over fiscal year 2017. Of importance, the bill provides $7  billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an increase of $620  million. These funds will be used to enforce immigration laws and  combat illegal immigration, which our constituents have repeatedly told  us they oppose.   The bill provides $13.8 billion for Customs and Border Patrol, an  increase of $1.6 billion, to ensure the continued security of our  border. It also provides $1.6 billion for physical barrier construction  on the Southern border, thus fulfilling the first step of one of  President Trump's key promises. It provides $10.5 billion for the Coast  Guard and supports FEMA's disaster relief fund at $7.3 billion.   As with the earlier security appropriations package the House passed  at the end of July, the funds in this division will help ensure  America's national security and go a long way towards funding key  Member priorities.   The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations division provides  $47.4 billion, a decrease of $10 billion from fiscal year 2017. Even  with this decrease, the committee has funded key priorities. Security  assistance is funded at $8.8 billion, and full funding is provided for  battling international organized crime, antiterrorism programs, and  combating cybercrime. The bill also fully funds the $3.1 billion  Memorandum of Understanding with Israel.   The Appropriations Committee has prioritized programs of importance  and de-prioritized programs that are not in the best interests of the  United States, such as reducing funding for the U.N. by $939 million,  eliminating all funding for UNESCO, and eliminating funding for the  Global Climate Change Initiative.   In producing this division, the Appropriations Committee made  difficult choices about the Nation's priorities, and made them well,  and ensured that taxpayer dollars are going to the most important,  critical, and efficient programs.   Finally, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and  Related Agencies Appropriations division provides $56.5 billion, an  increase of $1.1 billion over fiscal year 2017. That number does not  include $45 billion also authorized to be spent by the highway trust  fund for America's highways. Of note, the bill provides $16.6 billion  for the Federal Aviation Administration, an increase of $153 million,  to maintain and promote air travel and security. This sum includes $1  billion for so-called NextGen for more efficient air traffic control,  and $162 million for the contract tower program, a crucial safety net  that covers many districts across the country, including facilities  like Westheimer Airport in Norman, Oklahoma, as well as towers in  Lawton and Ardmore in my own home district.    It provides $38.3 billion in net discretionary funding to Housing and  Urban Development. Critically, it sustains Section 8 and Public and  Native American housing programs at $27.5 billion. It also includes  increases in funding for programs benefiting vulnerable citizens,  including $573 million for housing for the elderly, an increase of  $70.6 million over fiscal year 2017, and $47 million for housing for  Persons with Disabilities, an increase of $800,000 over fiscal year  2017.   In all, T-HUD Appropriations covers important priorities and ensures  that our Nation's housing and transportation infrastructure will be  adequately funded to meet our needs.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and  the underlying bill. The package before us represents a fulfillment of  our most important responsibility as Members of Congress, and provides  appropriate funding in four areas: Agriculture; State and Foreign  Operations, Homeland Security, and Transportation and Urban  Development.   I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their  months of work in making this bill a reality, and I cheer their efforts  on moving forward to the completion of the fiscal year 2018  appropriations process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my friend, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have nothing but the highest respect for  my colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), and I know he wants this House  to run better. But the fact of the matter is, I feel bad that he has to  defend this lousy, restrictive, indefensible process.   As I said last night in the Rules Committee, regular order in this  House is dead. The current Republican leadership has made it very clear  that they have nothing but contempt for regular order, and today's  appropriations package is only another example of that fact.   Instead of considering bills one by one, and allowing thoughtful  debate and Member input, Republican leaders decided to call up eight  appropriation bills all at once this week, and even set amendment  deadlines while Members were back in their districts for the August  work period.   Last night, in the Rules Committee, Republicans blocked 229  amendments from even coming to the floor on the four bills we are  talking about today alone. Those are Democratic and Republican ideas  that won't be heard and won't be debated. Who knows how many more they  will block on the next set of appropriation bills?   That is not the open process that we were promised by Speaker Ryan.  That is not regular order, my friends.   What is even worse than this terrible process is the substance of the  bills that are being brought before us. They are filled with funding  cuts and poison pill riders that attack women's health, attack poor  people, attack healthcare rights; repeal important financial reforms  that protect our constituents and our economy; undermine the Affordable  Care Act; make our land, air, and water dirtier; make our roads less  safe; and undermine important civil rights protections. I could go on  and on and on and on.   These bills are political documents, Mr. Speaker. They are red meat  for the Republican base which, I think, is at around 15 percent of the  American people the last time I checked. That is right, Mr. Speaker,  the majority's ideas are so unpopular that over three-quarters of the  American people disapprove of what they are doing here today. That is  not coming from any liberal or leftwing source. That poll was released  last week by FOX News, you know, the network that you guys always  watch.   We all know we will need a continuing resolution to avert a  government shutdown on October 1, so why are we wasting the House's  time on this partisan exercise when we should be dealing with the CR?   And oh, yes, we need to raise the debt ceiling, pass a budget,  continue to fund hurricane relief, and so much more we need to do.   Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of playing to the extremes. I am  sick and tired of this President picking a fight with a different group  of people every week, constantly trying to divide  [[Page H6680]]  Americans, rather than unite us for the common good.   And the latest target are the DREAMers. The DREAMers are our  coworkers, our relatives, our neighbors, and our children's classmates.  They have lived nearly their entire lives in America. They are part of  the very fabric of our country.   The decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or  DACA, is a cruel betrayal of their trust in the United States. It  needlessly and stupidly robs us of the enormous talents, hard work, and  ingenuity of these 800,000 young people. Ending DACA is a lose-lose  proposition for America and for us all.   President Trump vowed to show great heart in his decision and  declared that DREAMers could rest easy. That is a lie, and that is a  betrayal.   And shame on the Republican leadership of this House that has avoided  making DACA a permanent program for nearly 7 years. Shame on the  Republican Party for voting against the DREAM Act in 2010, even though  it ultimately passed the House.   Shame on the Republicans in the Senate for blocking cloture in 2010,  when it was clear that there were plenty of votes to pass the DREAM Act  then. Shame on the Republican leadership of this House for not making  DACA a permanent law when President Obama first initiated the program  in 2012.   Shame on the House Republican leadership for failing to take up the  Senate-passed comprehensive immigration bill for the past 4 years,  which included DACA and a pathway to permanent residency and  citizenship for the DREAMers and so many other immigrants caught in  legal limbo in our country.   Shame on the Republican leadership for being such political cowards  that they have failed time and time again to actually demonstrate  leadership and resolve these problems.   800,000 young people, who are totally American in every way that  matters, put their trust in the United States Government and in us here  in this Congress, not just to protect them, but to be proud of them.  They have been cruelly betrayed.   The memo issued yesterday by the Department of Homeland Security even  says that they should be prepared to pack their bags and be deported to  their countries of origin. But, Mr. Speaker, the simple truth is,  America is their home.   It is unconscionable that the President pardoned radical racist  Sheriff Arpaio, who actually is a criminal, while punishing 800,000  law-abiding, hardworking DREAMers.   I stand with the CEO of Microsoft and hundreds of other business  leaders who said to the President: ``To deport a DREAMer, you'll have  to go through us.''   I stand with the thousands of religious leaders, college and  university presidents, mayors, State attorneys general, and civic  leaders who demand that we reject the President's decision and have  Congress pass the DREAM Act immediately. This Congress cannot and must  not continue to fail these 800,000 young people.    This morning, this House passed emergency aid for Hurricane Harvey. A  DREAMer died in Houston attempting to rescue victims of the  floodwaters. Another DREAMer, who is a Houston paramedic, and who  worked night and day in rescue and relief efforts, just found out  yesterday that his country, the only country he has ever known, has  turned its back on him. Well, I refuse to turn my back.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that the DREAMers need a permanent  legislative fix. We can do that this very day. If we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative Roybal-Allard's bipartisan, bicameral bill, the DREAM  Act. It is time to do what is right.   You know, earlier today, Speaker Ryan said: Well, we have time to  work this out. Really?   The Speaker seems totally content to have 800,000 people continue to  live with uncertainty and fear. I think that that is sad and that is  cruel.   He also said: We need to develop some sort of compromise.   I don't know what he is thinking about. Maybe he is thinking about  trying to add more border security money or add this stupid wall that  the President keeps on talking about.   Well, here's the deal. There is nothing to compromise on. You either  support the DREAMers or you don't. They are not political pawns. They  are people like you and me and our kids. They deserve better from us.  Stop screwing around with their lives.   Defeat the previous question. We can pass the DREAM Act today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to begin by discussing process with my good friend from  Massachusetts, where I think he makes some good points, but I think he  fails to recognize the progress that this bill represents.   My good friend knows, because we have the privilege of working  together on the Rules Committee, I have thought for many years,  frankly, that we needed to get back to regular order. I remind this  House the last time we actually operated under it in an appropriations  process was in 2006. My friends were actually in the majority when we  got rid of open rules on appropriations bills. My friends never brought  all 12 appropriations bills to the floor and where they were subject to  amendments by various Members.   I would agree with my friend, this is not a perfect process that we  have. If I had my way, we would go back to the way we operated in 2006,  before the last Democratic majority, actually bring the bills down  individually and, frankly, give every Member an open shot at amendment.  I think that is the appropriate way to proceed.   Again, my friends thought differently when they were in the majority  and never made a move to restore regular order--quite the opposite. We  have actually fought to do that. We did have a period of open rules on  appropriations bills. We didn't get every bill down here, I regret to  say, but we got quite a few of them down. But my friends decided they  would engage in poison pill tactics.   I regret, honestly, personally, that my conference gave into that;  were more worried about casting tough votes. I think you are sent here  to cast tough votes.   So I will make this commitment to my friend. I will continue to work  with him and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who would  like to return to that process. However, I do recognize this is  significant progress toward doing that.   This is the first time, since 2006, that all 12 bills, in one form or  another, will reach this floor, and, frankly, every single Member has  been free to offer amendments on any portion of those 12 bills that  they care to. Now, not all of them were made in order by the Rules  Committee, and I would hope we get past that again some day.   But, again, before my friends decry that too much, they need to  remember the role they played in actually getting us out of that  process.   I also would like to talk just briefly with my friend about his  thoughts about DACA, and I am sure we will have a good discussion on  that in the course of the day, and, honestly, I think the discussion is  helpful.   But I think the President of the United States did the right thing  when, number one, he recognized that he does not have the  constitutional authority, something even his predecessor wondered  about, to actually engage in law and put this issue back in the hands  of the Congress. The Congress now has 6 months to deal with it. The  Speaker has assured us that we will do that.   I think the appropriate way to proceed is to have the committee of  jurisdiction actually hold hearings and move forward, but we will see  which way we go. But I think there is a better chance for a long-term  solution, as even my friend agrees, if we have a legislative fix to the  problem. I think that will involve some give-and-take, but my hope is  we will end up at a place where all parties are satisfied. But we will  see. That is what the legislative process is all about.   Final point to make, Mr. Speaker, I think we need to recognize that  what we are debating on here today, in terms of these four  appropriations  [[Page H6681]]  bills, and we will have another tranche of appropriations bills down  here later, is actually a process.   What we are really doing today is defining the position of the  majority party as to where it stands on funding the government. I don't  expect my friends to agree with that. There will be elements of these  bills that they agree with without a doubt. I don't think they will  oppose a lot of things that we do in regard to T-HUD, or in regard to  some of these other various programs that we will deal with.   But at the end of the day--and my side needs to recognize this--we  are going to end up in a negotiation with the United States Senate and  the administration some time probably after the 1st of October, and  that negotiation has to be bipartisan.   As my friends know, the other body requires 60 votes, and that would  mean there has to be Democratic participation. And quite frankly, the  appropriations bills that have moved across the floor here in fiscal  year 2015, fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2017, have all been  bipartisan. They have all been the product of negotiations.   At the end of the day--and I remind my friends, in May, a majority of  them actually voted in favor of the omnibus spending bill for FY 2017  in the House and in the Senate, as did, by the way, a majority of  Republicans in the House and Senate, and President Trump signed it. So  we know how this process ends, and we know how to make it work  appropriately. This is simply another step in the process.   It is my hope that, at the end of the day, we arrive at a bicameral,  bipartisan process that actually funds the government, and we are able  to accomplish, in concert with one another, things that we think are  important to the American people. I have a great deal of confidence we  will get there because that is what we have done the last 3 years. We  are actually doing it a little better this year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my good friend from Oklahoma, who  I respect a great deal, that if he wants to defend this process, he can  go right ahead and do so. But I think most people watching this, the  fact that two-thirds of all discretionary Federal spending is going to  be decided in, like, a week's time, I don't think is a good process,  and I don't think it is one that the American people have much  confidence in.   I don't think it is reasonable to expect that any Member, really, has  read all 1,305 pages of the eight bills that my friend is bringing to  the floor, and I am not sure everybody has had time to read all the 970  amendments that were proposed--many of them that were not made in order  by the Rules Committee. So this is not a process I think anybody wants  to defend.   The final point I want to make with regard to the President's  decision on DACA, as the gentleman knows, this Congress and the  previous Congresses could have acted on this any time they wanted to.  When the Democrats were in control here in the House, we did. We passed  the DREAM Act. Unfortunately, many of you wouldn't support it, but it  actually passed the House, and we had Republican obstructionism in the  Senate.   Now, if you want a legislative fix, we have the solution for you.  Vote ``no'' on the previous question, and we will bring up Ms. Roybal- Allard's bill to pass the DREAM Act. We will get this done today. We  will actually have a day of consequence where we are doing something to  help people in this country.   So, Mr. Speaker, as I said, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat  the previous question. We will then offer Representative Roybal- Allard's bipartisan, bicameral bill, H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act.                                time  1445    The legislation would help thousands of young people like the ones  whose heroic stories my colleagues will highlight today and who are  Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the ranking  member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, the President's decision to rescind  DACA brings heartbreak and fear to hundreds of thousands of young  DREAMers who, regardless of their immigration status, are American in  every way.   The President's senseless and cruel action is upending their lives  and the lives of their families, and it is sending a chilling message  to our immigrant communities.   It is unbelievable that we first introduced legislation to help  DREAMers in 2001. That is 16 years ago. The fight to protect DREAMers  has gone on for far too long. Defeating the previous question will  enable us, today, to vote on the DREAM Act of 2017, which is a  bipartisan, bicameral bill that will protect our Nation's DREAMers once  and for all.   The fact is this is our chance, as Members of Congress, to fulfill  our responsibility on this serious issue. For those of my colleagues  who say they support the DREAMers but that they believe that DACA is  unconstitutional, this is your opportunity to help the DREAMers through  the legislative process.   The DREAMers did not choose to circumvent American immigration laws,  and they should not be punished for something they are not responsible  for. Today, my Republican colleagues can provide relief to these young  people by voting to bring the DREAM Act for a vote.   Protecting DREAMers is not only a moral issue, it is also an economic  issue. The President's decision to end DACA strikes a vicious blow to  our economy. Forcing hundreds of thousands of young people out of the  workforce will disrupt businesses across our Nation. California, alone,  stands to lose $11.6 billion annually, and the U.S. stands to lose a  cumulative $460 billion in GDP over the next decade if DREAMers are  removed from our economy.   As Members of Congress, we represent the American people, and the  vast majority of Americans, regardless of their political affiliation,  support our Nation's DREAMers.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we  can pass the bipartisan, bicameral DREAM Act today to enable our  DREAMers to continue contributing to our Nation without fear of  deportation from the only country they know as home.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I do not yield.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma does not yield;  therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Ruiz) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I am reiterating my earlier announcement that  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only, and I will not  yield for any other purpose.  [[Page H6682]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma does not yield;  therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Velazquez) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the chairman of  the full committee, the ranking member of the full committee, certainly  the ranking member of the subcommittee, and the staff for the  tremendous assistance they provided in putting together this rather  large and complex piece of legislation.   It is fair to note for the record that the allocation we received of  $156 billion is $5 billion less than we had last year. While our lower  allocation this year forced us to make some difficult decisions, I want  to remind my colleagues that the cuts we are making today amount to  barely 3 percent of what we spent last year and is essentially what we  spent in fiscal year 2016.   The bill before us today focuses on key national priorities:  investing in biomedical research to find cures for diseases like  Alzheimer's and cancer; ensuring our country is fully prepared and able  to protect our citizens from disease outbreaks or bioterrorism;  continuing to support early childhood education, particularly for those  at risk; helping first-generation college students prepare for, access,  and complete a postsecondary education; and continuing to support  people living with disabilities.   The bill also preserves funds for popular programs like career and  technical education, support for Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, programs to help Native Americans, the AmeriCorps  program, LIHEAP, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.   The National Institutes of Health, our Nation's premier biomedical  research agency, is funded at $1.1 billion above last year. NIH is  working to find cures for Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and develop the  next generation of medical treatment through the use of precision  medicine techniques.   We need to continue to build upon the $2 billion increase provided in  the omnibus last year. I view this proposal as a floor, not a ceiling,  for biomedical research funding. I am hopeful that this number can  increase as the process moves forward.   Biodefense and preparedness programs, including new funding to  prevent a pandemic flu from occurring, are increased across the bill.   We are all aware of the terrible toll prescription drugs and opioid  abuse is taking on our Nation. I am proud to say this bill includes  another $500 million to continue comprehensive grant programs to enable  States, localities, and tribes to develop anti-opioid initiatives  focused on prevention, education, and treatment and recovery services.   Head Start receives a $22 million increase in this bill. Preschool  programs are continued at $250 million. Childcare programs receive a $4  million increase. Special education programs for students with  disabilities are increased by $200 million, which will help local  school districts ease the financial burden of providing specialized  educational services. TRIO and GEAR UP, which help disadvantaged  students prepare for and complete college, receive increases of $60  million and $10 million, respectively, over last year.   The bill also includes $500 million for the Student Support and  Academic Enrichment grant program. These funds can be used flexibly by  school districts across the country, whether the need is in the area of  counseling, computer science instruction, or teacher training and arts  programming.   Pell grants are maintained at a maximum of $5,920.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I will also note that this is an initial allocation and the  beginning of the congressional funding process. As always, I look  forward to working with our counterparts in the Senate and my friends  across the aisle to see if there are additional areas where we can  cooperate.   Finally, I want to note that the bill protects human life by  continuing longstanding prohibitions against Federal tax dollars being  used to pay for abortions, including new provisions to ensure that no  tax dollars are used for research on human fetal tissue obtained by an  abortion.   This bill represents a balanced approach that will benefit every  American and maintain the appropriate stewardship of taxpayer dollars  that we have been entrusted with as Members of Congress.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins), my colleague, for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins), my colleague, for the purpose of a colloquy.    I thank the gentleman for raising this issue. Along with  Congressman Woodall and Congresswoman Handel, you have been leaders in  this effort. I appreciate what you are doing and will stay in touch as  progress is made.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota  (Ms. McCollum) for the purpose of a colloquy.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your work on this bill  providing funding to critical programs. I appreciate the opportunity to  speak about the importance of the Community Services Block Grant. This  program funds community action agencies that address poverty and assist  seniors and other vulnerable populations in becoming self-sufficient. I  have seen, in my district, the valuable services these groups provide  helping people find jobs.     I thank my colleague from Minnesota for speaking about the  importance of this program in her district. I agree that Community  Services Block Grant provides important services to help people escape  poverty. The program has broad bipartisan support.   As the gentlewoman knows, several challenging decisions have to be  made to meet overall spending priorities and allocation. I take to  heart the concern expressed by the gentlewoman and, as we move forward,  I will work to ensure funding for the Community Services Block Grant  reflects the priority of our Members.   Ms. McCOLLUM. I thank the chairman, my friend, for his response and  commitment to robustly funding the Community Services Block Grant. I  know this program, as I said, helps people across the Nation and brings  great value to the communities it serves.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman), my colleague, for the purpose of a colloquy.    I thank my colleague from South Carolina for raising this  important question. I agree that the National Emergency Grant program  is an important bipartisan program to train workers and help them find  new careers.   Current year funds for the Dislocated Workers National Reserve are  increased by $109 million and advance appropriations for fiscal year  2019 are eliminated, for a total of $130 million. Within that total,  the National Emergency Grant program is approximately $70 million each  year.   It is expected that, after fully funding the National Emergency  Grants, the Department of Labor will use additional funds from the  Dislocated Workers National Reserve for other authorized purposes, such  as technical assistance and grants to help workers dislocated from the  coal industry find new employment.   So the short answer to the question is, yes, the National Emergency  Grant program is fully funded in this bill.
