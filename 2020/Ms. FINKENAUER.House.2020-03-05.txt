 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent the great  State of Iowa and the First Congressional District.   We have been getting a lot of great things done here in the House,  working across the aisle and moving a lot of bipartisan bills forward  since I got sworn in over a year ago. It has been an honor to get to  represent my district and have its back every day.   In the middle of all of this, I happen to have gotten engaged a  couple of months ago to my very kind and supportive fiance, who is  sitting up there in the gallery right now. He has been there through so  much of it, and I am grateful every day.    You see, we are very much looking forward to one day starting our  life together and are talking about raising a family and doing it in  Iowa and how much that means to us.   So it would surprise most folks to know that just about 4 weeks ago,  on a Friday after votes, I was back where I stay in D.C., sitting on my  bed, doubled over in pain, googling hysterectomies.   It was a pain familiar to me, stabbing in my lower left abdomen, and  a tight pain like two fists clenched together in a vise grip in my  lower back.   I know this pain well because I have been experiencing it  intermittently for over the past decade because I have a condition  called endometriosis. I have had this most of my adult life.   I was diagnosed at a young age, luckily, at the early age of 18. See,  a lot of women don't get an accurate diagnosis until much later in  life.   Endometriosis is a very painful condition where the tissue that  normally lines the uterus grows outside and can even attach to organs  and nerves. Endometriosis is also the number one cause of  hysterectomies for women ages 30 to 35.   I have already had two surgeries, laparoscopies, where they went in  and cut off or burnt off the tissue. I have white-knuckled my way  through more flights, events, and days knocking on doors than I can  count.   There are so many women out there who have been told that the  stabbing pain in your lower left abdomen is normal, or they are told  that the tightness in their lower back that they are doubled over with  in their beds is normal, but none of that is normal.   On this particular day, 4 weeks ago, I felt like I had enough. So I  sat there, frustrated at the prospect of more delays in the airport in  severe pain. I was looking at some of the most extreme options that are  out there that would mean I couldn't even have children.   And to be honest with you, I just got frustrated because it shouldn't  be this hard. It should be more well known, and there should be more  options for treatment.   As I was looking up hysterectomies, I came across a place called the  Endometriosis Foundation of America, and their website was full of  information, some that I didn't even know as somebody who has been  living with this for over 10 years, like the fact that endometriosis  affects 1 in 10 women worldwide and an estimated 7 to 10 million in the  United States alone, or that it is the leading cause of infertility,  but there is no known cure.   You see, when I was looking up hysterectomies, the reason there are  not more options, or options are slow to come by is because it is also  one of the least-funded diseases and conditions by Congress, by the  National Institutes of Health.   So once I decided to start talking about this, the number of people,  whether it is their staff who has it, or their sister who has it, or  possibly somebody they work with every day, or people they have met on  the campaign, I mean, it just goes on and on, the number of people this  touched, the women who have it and the men and women who love them.   I was also reminded, as I decided to look into this, how lucky I am.  You see, I am lucky that I had a mom who believed me, who believed my  pain, and good health insurance from my dad's union, where we could go  to doctor after doctor after doctor until finally somebody said: ``Hey,  she might have this. We better take a look at it.'' That is when,  again, I was able to be diagnosed.   I am lucky to have great support from my staff and others. But there  are so many women across the United States who don't have that support.   When I decided to talk about this just a few weeks ago, I was  actually getting my hair trimmed, and my hairdresser heard me say the  word ``endometriosis.'' She looked at me, and she said: Do you have it?   I said: Yes, I have it.   And she said: Well, right now, I am feeling like I am being stabbed  in my lower left abdomen.   I said: Yes, I know that pain.   She was working three jobs, and she is dealing with it every day. It  is something where she doesn't have the luxury to not show up. Many  women don't. You just push through it, and you get through that pain  day in and day out.  [[Page H1525]]    I know there are so many women hearing this today who may be hearing  their pain described for the very first time, and that is why I want to  make sure that I give a voice to them today and say that it is okay to  talk about this. That is why I decided to do what I am doing today.   See, I am in this position with a platform as a Member of Congress,  and I can talk about this important issue that touches so many women  across the U.S.   To be honest with you, I didn't say anything for years because I was  afraid that people would think I was weak, that I couldn't do my job,  but that is not true. I show up every day; I have done it for the last  decade. I have represented my State and my District well, and it is not  weak to talk about it.   In fact, the women who are living with it every day, they are strong  as heck. It is time that people across the country know about what this  is.   Every day, women are pushing through their pain and living their  lives. They are not weak; they are strong.   And I am not standing here alone because once I started talking about  this with my colleagues, I found out how many other Members of Congress  are touched by this or know people who have this.   Again, we found out about sisters, comms directors they work with. In  fact, even just this morning, after I started talking about it, there  was another Congressman who came up to me and said his wife has it. As  I talked about it more in my personal life, I have also met more women  who struggle with endometriosis.   So I am standing here today with them and in support of them and  their pain. And today, at the beginning of this Endometriosis Awareness  Month, we are launching the very first Endometriosis Caucus.   Through this caucus, this bipartisan caucus, we are going to raise  awareness with the public and in Congress to get more funding and the  kind of support that this disease deserves. We need to end the stigma  around endometriosis and bring more attention to this condition  affecting millions of women, their families, and their friends.   Today, I ask my colleagues in Congress, and everyone watching, to  join me in this movement, to join this caucus. We have to up endo  funding, up endo research, and up endo awareness.   It is too important, and there are too many women across the United  States and worldwide who deal with this every day to be ignored for far  too long.   Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak here today  about this important issue.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
