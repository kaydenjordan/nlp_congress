 Mr. Chair, when the Americans with Disabilities Act  was first signed into law, President George H.W. Bush praised this bill  for its assurance ``that people with disabilities [were] given the  basic guarantees for which they have worked so long and so hard:  independence, freedom of choice, control of their lives, and the  opportunity to blend fully and equally into the rich mosaic of the  American mainstream.'' His words were true when the ADA passed, and  they are true today.   H.R. 620 would reverse decades of progress. It would pave the way for  businesses to delay or completely avoid complying with the ADA, and  shift the onus on people with disabilities to report noncompliance. If  this bill were signed into law, it would effectively hold harmless  places of public accommodation for willfully failing to comply with the  ADA.   This legislation purports to curb ``drive-by'' lawsuits, which can be  a legitimate problem, but these suits have arisen predominantly in  states that provide for recovery of money damages in their state laws.  The federal ADA does not provide for damages, only injunctive relief  and attorney's fees.   This would be a step backwards. We have a responsibility to protect  these safeguards and ensure that people with disabilities are provided  accessible accommodations.
