 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to how  corporate greed threatens our public health and environment with an  alarming example from my hometown of Detroit.   On November 26, 2019, a portion of a dock operated by Detroit Bulk  Storage collapsed into the Detroit River sending tons of crushed  limestone into the river, disturbing contaminated river sediment and  exposing the public and our water supply to the decades of  contamination buried at this former uranium rod manufacturing site.   Detroit Bulk Storage took unnecessary risks by overloading its  failing dock, caused a collapse into the river, and waited 3 days  before notifying the National Response Center. When they did, they  merely reported it as a dock collapse with no indication for State or  Federal regulators of the contamination present at the site and the  need for urgency.   Testing from State regulators and the EPA is ongoing, and so far  tests appear to indicate no significant radiation exposure. However,  the site's owner, Revere Dock, LLC, continues to drag its feet in  developing and implementing a restoration plan.   This is yet another stark reminder that we cannot ever count on  corporations to put the public interest ahead of their own profits and  that we need drastic changes to strengthen regulatory tools and to hold  them accountable to protect our public health.                            ____________________
