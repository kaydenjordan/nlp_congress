 Mr. Speaker, let me just say that our side hasn't been  consulted.   The Republicans have 238 votes to pass anything here. They have the  vast majority. You only need 218 votes, so if you wanted to pass it,  you could do it right now. You could have done it a month ago, you  could have done it 2 months ago, you could have done it 3 months ago.   But there is something fundamentally wrong on that side of the aisle,  and, of course, you have to deal with the other body where you hold a  majority, and you can't get it done there either.   Now, in football, you would call this fumbling the ball. In baseball,  you would call it flubbing the ball.   Honestly, if you can't consult with our side of the aisle, why would  you expect anybody would want to work with you anyway? You treat us  like we are from, I don't know, Borneo. Why would you think we would  want to vote for something that we can't agree with because of its  essential unfairness?   I really can't understand why you are putting the Republic through  all these contortions.   You don't have a budget. You know, we have been asking for a budget,  and you don't make decisions about departments until you have a budget  because you might underfund one department or overfund another  department, so we want to do this in a very orderly way.   But our Republican friends appear to hope the government will  function with no road map. Are they really asleep behind the wheel of  the car? They are sure careening, and they might even hit a brick wall.   If the Republicans cannot put together a framework agreement for a  vote this week, it is safe to say they have fumbled and flubbed every  opportunity they have had. It reminds me of the old Looney Tunes  character Elmer Fudd. They can't even catch Bugs Bunny when he is  staring them right in the face. They aren't making progress and,  indeed, are losing ground.   There was hope on September 8, when we voted the first time for a  short-term extension, that you could actually reach agreement. But here  it is, the brand new year, and we still don't have agreement.    So here we are, January 18, 2018, 1 day before the risk  of another shutdown, and their fiddling is unprecedented. Don't have a  budget framework; can't make decisions; don't consult with our side.  Why should we be in a helpful mood?   We were always told Republicans are stern taskmasters. Not only have  they failed to pass a budget, now they have added a trillion more  dollars to the deficit and the long-term debt because they wanted to  give tax giveaways to all their donors.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this sinking effort and demand action  for a final, full-year funding plan. That is what is responsible. That  is essential, and that is what the American people expect.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the persevering and  prescient life of American General Edward L. Rowny, who passed away on  December 18 of last year at the age of 100.   Proud of his Polish-American heritage, he attained a century of life  in the Polish tradition of Sto lat, dear general. This valiant soul  served our Nation under five Presidents, of both parties.   He served under the command of General Douglas MacArthur and rose to  be a shining general in his own right, a brave guardian of liberty  through courage, sacrifice, expertise, and wisdom.   General Rowny was born the son of a Polish immigrant and a Polish- American mother on April 3, 1917. A West Point graduate, he served in  World War II and led a battalion with the 92nd Army Infantry Division,  driving up the west coast of Italy.   He remained a dogged ally of then-occupied Poland and the Polish  people and advanced the return of the remains of Ignacy Jan Paderewski  to Poland in 1992 after the fall of the Berlin Wall 3 years earlier.   He later founded the Rowny Paderewski Scholarship Fund to bring  Polish students to the United States to study American democracy. He  continued to raise funds for it until his dying day.   General Rowny lived to see solidarity bring freedom to Poland and  helped usher Poland into the NATO security alliance.   He was an esteemed arms control adviser under every President from  Richard Nixon to George H.W. Bush.   After being a chief negotiator in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  with the former Soviet Union, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens  Medal.   General Rowny's life and being was imbued with his long history of  fighting for freedom, justice, and democracy, including helping free  his ancestral land of Poland. His accomplishments will not be  forgotten.   Thank you, General Edward Rowny, for your service to liberty. You  have been one of a kind, unceasing in your utter dedication to liberty  at its cutting edge.   ``Dziekuje bardzo. Bardzo. Bardzo.'' Thank you very much.                            ____________________
