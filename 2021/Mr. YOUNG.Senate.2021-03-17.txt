 Madam President, I rise today to speak about a subject  that is a point of pride and a source of passion for my constituents.   Visit Indiana, and you are bound to see them: a backboard hammered to  an old barn, rows of asphalt courts in city parks, a lone hoop in front  of a cornfield or in a clearing, steel poles standing in driveways.   Though basketball wasn't technically invented in Indiana, Indiana is  indeed its epicenter. Even the game's inventor, James Naismith, once  said: ``Basketball really had its origin in Indiana, which remains the  center of the sport.''   So it is appropriate that this year's NCAA tournament will be played  in its entirety in our State.   Now this, of course, is in part because planning and hosting 68 teams  in the middle of a global pandemic presents unprecedented challenges,  challenges that Hoosiers in and around Indianapolis are going to be  able to navigate. And they will be able to work their world-class  college campuses in order to host teams from around the country. It is  a great source of pride for us.   But it is also fitting because this sport is so important to our  State. You see, it is March Madness meets Hoosier Hysteria. The gyms  where we play basketball are historic sites. The men and women who have  competed and coached back home are Indiana folk heroes. We know their  names. They are part of our common language: The Big O, Catch, the  General, Bird, Wooden.   Memorabilia, artifacts, and sites associated with them are preserved  in museums and townhalls. They are in school gyms. They are marked by  bronze plaques and other ways to memorialize those who have preceded  us. Streets and roads are named in their honor. We can even identify  legendary teams and major moments in our basketball history with just a  few almost mythic words that are familiar to the ears of Hoosiers:  ``Franklin Wonder Five,'' ``Plump's last shot,'' ``8 points in 9  seconds,'' and, yes, the infamous ``chair throw.''   Even the color of the ball--orange, of course--can be traced back to  a Hoosier, Tony Hinkle, who thought it was a good idea.   For Indiana, basketball is much more than just a pastime. It is a  source of joy. It is a source of joy for our communities, and it brings  the people in and across them together. After all, it takes little more  than a basket and a ball to play.   That is why wherever you go in Indiana and no matter the neighborhood  you might be visiting or passing by, be it affluent or hit by hard  times, in the country or in the city, you are going to see basketball  played. It almost doesn't matter what the time of year it is or what  the weather is like, you are likely to see basketball if you hit the  road for a few hours in Indiana at any given time of year. You are  going to hear it discussed. The basketball court and the gymnasium  bleachers are great levelers.   I am sharing this with you because there is a larger point at play.  Today, it increasingly seems that Americans have less and less in  common with one another; that we are defining ourselves not as a  diverse nation united by a common set of values with a shared past and  a shared future, but we are instead sorting ourselves into tribes based  on geography or class or even political affiliation. This has been  accompanied by the hollowing out of many of our communities and a loss  of faith in the public spaces and access to these public spaces and  institutions that shape our national identity and bind this vast,  pluralistic, and beautiful country together.   Now, these are dangerous trends, this separation, this tribalism;  ones that we are going to have to work hard to turn back. There is only  so much this body can do--I am under no illusions--there is only so  much government can do to make America whole again.   That is why we should cherish and celebrate the institutions that do  have the power to unite us. And, as any Hoosier will tell you,  basketball is one of them   Even beyond this, as its history in Indiana shows, this shared ritual  that brings us joy and brings us together also pushes us to be better  individually and collectively.   I think of the persistence of a teenager by the name of Steve Alford,  endlessly practicing free throws in his driveway in New Castle, even in  the snow and rain; and the courage of Indiana University's Bill  Garrett, who fought segregation and broke the Big Ten color barrier;  and then the faith of Little Milan High, enrollment hardly 100, beating  mighty Muncie Central, enrollment over 1,000, for the 1954 State high  school championship; the grace of successive generations of graduates  at Crispus Attucks. Now, this is a high school built to segregate Black  students in Indianapolis, but it then grew into an academic and  athletic powerhouse whose basketball program was a beacon in the civil  rights movement and, to this day, remains a great source of pride not  just for Black Hoosiers but for all Hoosiers. It was also the first  African-American team to win a State championship in the Nation; the  spirit of the tiny town of Medora, an underdog community featured in a  recent documentary, who stood by their team while its players laced up  work boots because they couldn't afford basketball shoes. Then they set  out with grit and determination and resolve to end a season losing  streak.   So these scenes from Indiana's history, up to the present day, like  the game itself, unite people from different backgrounds, and they  foster pride in our places, especially our struggling places. They  teach us to draw a line between competition and contempt, to keep  perspective and to have the humility to remember that defeat is never  permanent and neither is victory. They help us see and treasure what we  have in common. They show us the power of opportunity and empowerment.   Institutions like basketball can't be taken for granted. They bring  meaning and purpose into the lives of people and places that we call  home. They encourage our citizens to dream beyond limit, and I would  say that they are what we need in this Nation right now.   So as the NCAA tournament tips off and the games begin across our  stadiums, field houses, and arenas, Indiana's hardwood civic temples,  as we like to think of them, I know will be a reflection for our love  for basketball and an exhibition of our collaborative ability to host  such a large event during such a difficult time.   But what will also be on display is the other reason it is right and  proper that this event takes place in Indiana. We are devoted to this  sport because it brings us hope, and it brings us together. It instills  the virtues necessary to preserve many of the other features that make  our country so special. It really can help make America whole again.  [[Page S1605]]    Now and then, we all need to be gently reminded, I think, of the  importance of these very things, and I can think of no better time or  place for that than March in Indiana.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor and recognize the  distinguished legacy of Larry ``Cliz'' Clisby, who passed away on  February 27, 2021, at the age of 74 after a valiant fight against  cancer. Famously known across the State of Indiana as the legendary  Voice of the Boilermakers, he will forever be remembered for his  unmatched play-by-play commentary of Purdue basketball and his  trademark ``Bullseye!'' calls during crunch time.   Born and raised in Ohio, Larry graduated from Warren Howland High  School and Kent State University. Shortly after college and service in  the U.S. Army, Larry started his broadcasting career in Paducah, KY.  However, his time in Paducah was brief, as he moved to West Lafayette,  IN, to work for WLFI-TV in the sports department in 1977. During his  early career in the Lafayette area, Larry called high school basketball  games and assisted during Purdue sports broadcasts. It wasn't until  1982 that Larry became the full-time radio announcer for the  Boilermakers.   Over the course of nearly 40 years, Larry called a total of 1,890  Purdue men's basketball games, including dozens of high-profile Indiana  vs. Purdue rivalry games. Since the 1980s, Larry was involved in many  of Purdue's historic moments, including one Big Ten Tournament title,  nine Big Ten Championship Seasons, 28 NCAA Tournaments, and three Elite  Eight appearances. In 2018, he was inducted into the Indiana  Sportswriters and Sportscasters Hall of Fame, and he received one of  Indiana's highest honors, the Sagamore of the Wabash, from Governor  Eric Holcomb in 2020.   From the Purdue sports staff to the team players, everyone saw Larry  as a true, dedicated Boilermaker and not just a typical play-by-play  announcer. Throughout his career, Larry devoted his charisma, talents,  and life to the Lafayette community, and I believe his work will serve  as a benchmark for those who aspire to join the field of sports radio.   I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our sympathies to Larry's  wife, Michelle; his children, Chad and Carly; his sister, Carol; his  stepchildren and grandchildren; and all of his family and friends as  they mourn his loss. And to Larry's Purdue University family, I wish  his beloved Boilermakers many, many ``Bullseye!'' moments in the years  to come.                            ____________________
