 Mr. President, I am here to share the words, the  stories, the fears, and some of the faces of people in Connecticut who  will be impacted by the bill that was released this morning--the so- called discussion draft, if that is the right term for it. We learned  this morning, I think, why that discussion draft has been shrouded in  secrecy. The reason is very simply that my Republican colleagues are  ashamed and embarrassed about it, and rightly, because it is not only  mean, as the House bill was, but it is meaner. It is cruel and costly.   It will be cruel and costly to the people of Connecticut, in human  suffering and illness and disease, and it will be costly in failing to  prevent and treat disease before it becomes more expensive. That is one  of the lessons of public health policy today: Treat earlier; prevent  before diseases or illnesses or conditions become even more costly. It  is not only a way to save lives; it is a way to save money.   The voices and faces of Connecticut have been heard nowhere in this  process because of its secrecy, because it has denied anyone in  America, in fact, the opportunity to be heard, to comment, to make  their views known. Speed and secrecy have been the watchwords, and they  are a toxic recipe, and they should mean this discussion draft is dead  on delivery today.   My constituents have actually come in overwhelming numbers to an  emergency field hearing on healthcare that I began in Hartford earlier  this week, Monday morning at 9 a.m. They came for 2 hours. There were  many more than we expected on very short notice, and they were there to  make sure their voices and faces were heard and seen. That is what I  did earlier in the week when I entered their testimony into the Record  of the Senate. I was proud to do so.   We are continuing that emergency field hearing, in fact, tomorrow at  1:30 in New Haven at the Aldermanic Chambers, which have even greater  capacity. We are expecting many more, judging by the response to the  email blast and invitations that we have sent, because people care  about healthcare.   They should care because it is the difference between life and death,  and this bill will be the difference between life and death for so many  people in Connecticut. It will be death. Even though that statement may  sound like hyperbole or exaggeration, the public health experts, the  docs, and the hospitals that deliver healthcare in Connecticut and  around the country know that it is true, and so do the people of  Connecticut and our country.  [[Page S3716]]    My colleagues have failed to hear those faces and voices because they  have refused to have hearings, markups, committee meetings, and robust  full debate on the floor of this Chamber, as is the practice and should  be in other pieces of legislation. Why is it not for one of historic  and unprecedented importance for the future of our Nation?   Instead, they have met behind closed doors, a group of men who,  maybe, coincidently, produced a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood  and, in effect, furthers a war on women's health--an assault on women's  healthcare that will deny mammograms, screenings, preventive care--and  on primary care for men, as well as women, in this country.   It will gut Medicare and Medicaid. It will rob millions of people of  the healthcare they now have through Medicaid. It will mean higher  costs and less care for America and especially for our seniors, who  will be among the most victimized by these cuts.   For anyone who cares about opioid addiction and abuse--and everyone  in this Chamber, by an overwhelming majority, during the last session  voted for the 21st Century Cures Act and then for the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act, bipartisan, but it was nowhere nearly  enough funded--this bill means, in fact, less funding than the House  measure would have provided, from $65 billion increased funding for  opioid addiction and abuse treatment to $2 billion.   When my colleagues characterize this bill as heartless, they  underestimate its impact on people who suffer from the disease--it is a  disease, not a moral failing--of addiction and abuse.   Yesterday the voices and faces that I elicited on the floor of the  Senate were three people who have struggled with substance use disorder  and encountered different endings--Justice, Sean, and Frank. We lost  Sean just a few weeks ago. Frank could not come to the hearing we  conducted on Monday because he is recovering, as well, and the  heartbreak of Sean's loss so affected him.   But Maria Skinner described their struggle to recover from that  substance use disorder. Justice will likely never recover from the  injuries she sustained when she overdosed. Although Frank is doing  well, I am pleased to say he has access to Medicaid and the essential  treatment services that he needs only because Medicaid exists in the  present form. Denying him that kind of service and treatment means that  he may be consigned to the risk that doomed Justice and Sean. The  coldheartedness of the House bill was hard to match, but on Medicaid  the Senate version has outdone even that coldheartedness--cutting the  program even more drastically and costing our Nation, not just  healthcare but also jobs.   When we say Medicaid, let's be very clear whom we are talking about,  and let me introduce three of the people who are affected.   With me in this photograph are Evan, Amelie, and Amanda. They live  with their mom in Ansonia, CT. Following their father's death 6 years  ago, the entire family went on Medicaid so they could continue  receiving the coverage they need and deserve and the healthcare they  need and deserve.   Their mom reached out to my office to speak at the hearing that I am  having tomorrow. She wrote to me:         I am very frightened that federal funding for state       Medicaid programs will receive tremendous cuts with this       potential repeal. I hope to advocate to all those in       positions of power that will listen so they can see a face to       this problem.    The face to this problem is before us in this Chamber. It is children  and families that will see Medicaid decimated for them if the  Affordable Care Act is repealed, as would be done by this so-called  discussion draft from our Republican colleagues.   Today Evan, Amelie, and Amanda's mom is just learning how tremendous  these cuts will be, and today she will fear even more for her  children's health and well-being, because when we talk about cuts to  Medicaid, we aren't talking about a line item on a budget. We aren't  talking about a simple number or a statistic. We are talking about  literally millions of children like Evan, Amelie, and Amanda, who have  parents fearing what will happen if their reliance on Medicaid is  betrayed ruthlessly, senselessly, and recklessly and if their  dependence on this vital program for the basic healthcare they need is  stripped away.   This bill would also jeopardize affordable access to people with  preexisting conditions. At my hearing, a woman named Michelle Virshup  told her story of how the Affordable Care Act was there for her to  provide coverage as well as services when she was diagnosed with an  autoimmune disease in her early twenties. Now, 3 years later, she is  doing a lot better and is actually an attorney fighting to remove  barriers to healthcare for others in her community. She will suffer  under this bill because her access to essential services will be  weakened. She will be stripped of coverage that is actually affordable.  She will be effectively cut from healthcare once and for all.   When telling me about her illness, Michelle said:         The Affordable Care Act allowed me to see it through and       the Affordable Care Act protects me now. Though my health is       good, my experience is a preexisting condition that will       follow me for the rest of my life.    That is the thing about a preexisting condition. It follows people  for the rest of their lives. It is preexisting before they have  insurance coverage, and so it is preexisting forever. This bill, in  enabling States to eviscerate the safeguards against abuse of  preexisting conditions, means their healthcare will be in jeopardy and  their lives will be at risk and the abuses that I fought when I was  attorney general--time after time, year after year--will come back  again.   Among the most meaningful of the work I did as attorney general was  to fight person by person when insurance companies said: No, we will  not cover that preexisting condition. Their excuse proved to be a ruse,  a charade, because they could abuse preexisting conditions, and they  will do it again if this bill passes.   This bill's depravity unfortunately goes even further. It actually  defunds Planned Parenthood, our Nation's largest women's healthcare  provider, while eviscerating protections that guarantee women have  access to maternal care throughout their pregnancy. It not only stops  and undermines effective family planning, but it then denies effective  healthcare when women become pregnant. So it is a kind of catch-22.   This action is cruelly ironic, turning women away from basic birth  control services and then threatening their access to maternity care  when they unavoidably become pregnant. It is really and simply  devastatingly bad public policy, a foolish proposal that attacks  women's healthcare and defunds Planned Parenthood, which is an  overwhelmingly popular healthcare provider. The objective is to score  cheap political points on the far right.    Tomorrow in Connecticut, when I hold another hearing--and we may have  another afterward--many of my colleagues may wonder why. They may well  be scared of having that kind of hearing, where they have to listen to  the voices and see the faces of the people who will suffer under this  bill. They certainly have been too scared to have that kind of hearing  in the U.S. Senate.   I will hear from the people this bill will hurt. I will hear from  people whose lives will be put at risk as a result of this heartless,  cruel, and costly measure. I will be inspired by these people, and I  will fight as long and as hard as possible to be sure that this bill  never becomes law.   Listening to our constituents is really the way democracy is supposed  to work. We are proud of talking about democracy. We are approaching  the Fourth of July. What better way to celebrate our democracy than to  listen in this Chamber, in these halls, to the people who have  expertise and experience that we need instead of the secrecy and speed  that we are seeing now.   I am proud that we are having these hearings in Connecticut. I urge  my colleagues to do the same. They are emergency hearings because we  face the historic and unprecedented exigencies of a proposed bill that  will rip away guarantees of effective insurance coverage that Americans  need and deserve.   Healthcare is a right. Eventually we will have single-payer in this  country. But for now, let's build on the Affordable Care Act, let's  make it better, let's cure its defects, and let's work together across  the aisle. We can do that if we have that resolve.  [[Page S3717]]    Thank you. I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.
