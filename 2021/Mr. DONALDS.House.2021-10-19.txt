 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, it is important that we are here this evening because  the President of the United States and the majority party has never  actually talked about what is in this bill. They would like to throw  out their catch phrase build back better, they like to talk about how  they are helping the children and helping our economy transform, but  what they never talk about is what they are actually going to do.   What the American people don't know, Madam Speaker, is that in this  bill is a $1.3 billion provision to give newspapers $12,500 per  employee for local newspapers all across the United States. I don't  know about you, but I don't know how that helps anybody build back  better when we are giving tax dollars to newspapers.   In this bill, it gives $42 billion in tax credits to the rich to buy  electric cars. The reason why they are tax credits for the rich is  because working families, middle-class families don't have the  disposable income to buy electric cars; only the wealthy buy them. But  that is in this bill.   The administration wants to give the IRS access to your checking  accounts. This is outrageous. This completely eliminates due process.  It makes every American guilty until proven innocent. And the White  House wants this provision in the bill because they can't tax the  American people enough to pay for all their radical spending, so they  have to go find every piece of change in the couch cushions.   The only time in American history we unleashed the IRS on checking  accounts and on bank accounts was when  [[Page H5666]]  we allowed for currency transaction reports to track drug cartels and  businesses breaking the law from laundering money in the United States  because of drugs and terrorism. That is when we unleashed currency  transaction reports on transactions in the United States. It has never  been done in any other time, but Joe Biden wants to do it to every  American. And make no mistake, America, it is to every American.   In this bill it raises taxes radically in our corporate sector, makes  us the highest corporate tax income country in the world, higher than  China. You know, China, the country that is our economic rival. And it  raises those taxes. It makes us less competitive. But that is supposed  to help us build back better?   And let's talk about spending because in this very bill, one of the  key proponents that Joe Biden and the Democrats want is to expand and  continue the child tax credit, which pays $300 per child. But what they  will never tell you is there is no provision in the bill to actually  track based upon Social Security numbers to make sure that even if you  are going to give a benefit--which, by the way, we should not give-- that anybody in the United States can get it. And I stress anybody in  the United States because by the end of this year there will be easily  2.3 to 2.5 million people who have crossed our borders illegally.   This bill is a catastrophe. This bill spends far more money than we  possibly have. It will create more--and I stress ``more''--inflation in  our society, which is already crippling poor people. It is already  crippling working families. It is not going to help our country.   You know, back in February when we told the administration do not  extend Federal unemployment benefits because it was going to pay people  to stay home, Joe Biden said, no, it won't, everything is going to be  A-okay.   Well, look at our economy today. Everything is not okay. Everything  is screwed. And if we listen to Joe Biden, somebody, frankly, who has  never been right, somebody who has never had a job one day in his life  about what it is going to take to actually allow our economy to thrive  and prosper, our country is going to see its last great days.   Madam Speaker, the reason why you guys can't get the votes is because  even Democrats in your own party realize how destructive this will be  to the small business owners in their districts, how destructive this  will be to the economic vitality of the people in their districts. You  can't get the votes. It is time to stand down. This bill is a disaster.                                time  2000
