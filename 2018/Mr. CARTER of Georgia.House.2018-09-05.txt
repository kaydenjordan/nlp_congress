 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the  lives of two outstanding Georgians, Joseph and Josephine Mengoni, who  passed away last month only a day apart and after 63 years of marriage.   Mr. Mengoni dedicated his life to practicing pharmacy, advancing the  profession in Georgia for both pharmacists and their patients. He  practiced retail pharmacy for nearly a decade before serving as vice  president of the Georgia Pharmacy Association, becoming a certified  diabetes instructor, and being the chairman of the board for DataRX  Management. His work is exemplified by his creation of a program that  helped pharmacists help their patients to quit smoking.  [[Page H7865]]    Mrs. Mengoni devoted her life to her husband and raising their three  children. She was deeply involved with the 4-H Club and even started  the 4-H Club location in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she lived for a  number of years.   Mr. and Mrs. Mengoni, their children, and other family members will  be in my thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
