 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Graves and Chairman  DeFazio for their work and the committee staff for their work on this  piece of legislation.   Water is the lifeblood of Florida, and there is not a more important  piece of legislation to our State or to our community, my community  specifically, because of the work that this bill does.   The Water Resources Development Act demands that the Army Corps of  Engineers rewrite protocols that they have that allow them to poison my  community, demands that they accelerate construction of the hugely  important EAA Reservoir, demands that they move more water into  Florida's Everglades where it is needed because they are dying because  of lack of water.   This piece of legislation is vital to our State. I would absolutely  argue there is nothing more important to our State, and I couldn't  thank enough the chairman, the ranking member, and all the staff for  all of their work on this very important piece of legislation.
