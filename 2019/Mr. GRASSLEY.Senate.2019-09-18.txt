 I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for 30  seconds.    Mr. President, I would like to share some real Iowa  history this morning.   Merle David Hay from Glidden, IA, was the first Iowa serviceman to  die in World War I. Hay enlisted on May 9, 1917, with his father's  blessing, as he was too young to be drafted. He was assigned to the 1st  Infantry Division, Company F.   In the early hours of November 3, 1917, while posted in the trenches  near the French village of Artois, the Imperial German Army attacked,  and Merle Hay was killed. Hay's father said: ``I am proud of my boy if  he has given up his life for his country.''   Merle Hay Road in Des Moines, IA, is a constant memory of this  person's sacrifice.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
