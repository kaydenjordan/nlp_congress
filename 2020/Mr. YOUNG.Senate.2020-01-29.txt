 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Indiana.    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself and  Senator Braun.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The Senator from Indiana and Senator  Braun ask both parties the following question:         We were promised by House managers that the evidence       supporting each article of impeachment would be       ``overwhelming'' and ``uncontested.'' Virtually every day,       House managers have insisted that the Senate cannot have a       trial without witnesses. Do both parties agree that the       Senate has included in evidence in this trial the testimony       of every single witness from which the House heard before       they voted, except for the intelligence community IG report       that Chairman Schiff kept secret?    We begin with the House managers.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Let me take this opportunity, if I can, to answer  a few questions. First, is the fact that the testimony of the witnesses  before the House sufficient to relieve the Senate of an obligation to  have a trial? And the answer is no. There is no reason, and, indeed,  every other Senate trial--impeachment trial in history--has involved  witnesses who did not testify before the House. This will be the  [[Page S691]]  first departure. It shouldn't be if it is to be a fair trial.   I want to quickly respond to a couple of other points. The question  was asked: Why didn't we charge bribery? And the answer is we could  have charged bribery. In fact, we outlined the facts that constitute  bribery in the article, but ``abuse of power'' is the highest crime.  The Framers have it in mind as the highest crime. The facts we allege  within that do constitute bribery, but had we charged bribery within  the ``abuse of power'' article, I can assure you that counsel here  would be arguing: You have charged two offenses within the same  article. That makes that invalid. We wouldn't have had Alan Dershowitz  making that argument because he says abuse of power is not impeachable.  They would have had Jonathan Turley here making that argument. If we  split them into two separate articles--one for abuse of power and one  for bribery--they would have argued you have taken one crime and made  it into two.   The important constitutional point here is not that the acts within  abuse of power constitute bribery--although they do. The important  point is we charged a constitutional crime--the most serious crime. The  Founders gave the President enormous powers, and their most important  consideration was that the President not abuse that power, and they  provided a remedy, and that remedy is impeachment.   One final point. Mr. Sekulow said that is not how the Constitution  works. The Constitution doesn't allow the Chief Justice to make those  decisions, but, you know, he doesn't say the Constitution prohibits.  The Constitution permits it if they will agree, but they won't. And he  said it is the same as in the House, and it is the same as in the  House. And it is the same in this way: If they were operating in good  faith, if they really wanted a fair resolution, if they weren't just  shooting for delay, they would allow the Chief Justice to make these  decisions.   But what they do not want is they do not want you to hear John  Bolton. And why? Because when you hear, graphically, a man saying the  President of the United States told me to withhold aid from our ally,  to coerce foreign assistance in his election, when the American people  hear that firsthand--not filtered through our statements--they will  recognize impeachable conduct when they see it.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Sekulow, you have 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   With regard to the last statement, I am just going to say: Asked and  answered. I have answered the question about the issue of moving  forward if there were witnesses and our view on that. I don't have to  say anything else.   Now, with regard to the question that was actually presented, 29  times--29 times--the House managers have used the phrase  ``overwhelming, uncontested, sufficient.'' ``Proved'' they said 31  times. Now, that is just what the record says.   It is true that the record from the House was accepted provisionally  subject to evidentiary objections, but they are the ones who have said  ``overwhelmingly'' and ``proved.'' Now, we, of course, disagree with  their conclusions as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. But for  them to come up here and to argue ``proved'' and ``overwhelmingly'' a  total of, I guess, 64 times in a couple of days, tells me a lot about  what they want.   What we are asking for is this proceeding to continue, and with that,  we are done.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The majority leader is recognized.                            ____________________
