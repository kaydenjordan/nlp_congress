 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3017, the  Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization  Act of 2017.   There is bipartisan support for the EPA program that proves when the  Federal-State partnership operates as intended, work gets done.   Brownfields cleanup and redevelopment benefits the environment, the  community, and the local economy. This legislation reauthorizes the  brownfields program and expands eligibility for nonprofit organizations  to receive grants.   In my home State of Ohio, the brownfields program has leveraged over  $1 billion for property revitalization. In my district specifically,  brownfields funding was used to restore a former industrial  manufacturing site, now used as Chesapeake Energy Company's office  complex.   I thank the sponsors for introducing this bill and I urge my  colleagues to support its passage.
