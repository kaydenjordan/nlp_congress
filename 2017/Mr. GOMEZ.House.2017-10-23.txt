 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   In the spirit of good sportsmanship, I accept the gentlewoman's wager  and the barbecue that I will get to enjoy next week.   The Houston Astros are an amazing team, with 101 wins, but the  Dodgers are better, with 104. I know that the Astros stumbled across  that finish line to make it to the World Series. I know it is going to  be a hell of a game between the two teams.   If we lose, I will bring some French dip sandwiches from the  Louisiana institution, Philippe's, in downtown Los Angeles.   Let the best team win. Play ball.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Reclaiming my time, barbecue is good everywhere in  Texas.   Where there is a will, there is a way. The Astros have the will and  the way.   Go Astros.                            ____________________
