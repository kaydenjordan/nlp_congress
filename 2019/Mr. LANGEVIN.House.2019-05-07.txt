 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan  Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, I rise to recognize May as  National Foster Care Month.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to bring front and center the more than  400,000 youth in our foster care system across the country. These young  people are courageous, and they face and overcome many challenges.   Let's raise up their voices because they deserve to be heard, and  they deserve a seat at the policymaking table.   May is also a time to recognize the foster care professionals,  advocates, and families who devote themselves to supporting foster  youth every day. These individuals deserve our utmost respect and our  gratitude.   I am proud to cosponsor Representative Karen Bass' resolution  recognizing Foster Care Month.   To the foster youth and those who support them in Rhode Island and  across the country, you matter, and I am here to be your advocate in  Congress. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me.                            ____________________
