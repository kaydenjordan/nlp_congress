 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed  to finish my remarks.    Madam President, I rise to speak about three critical  matters impacting families in Washington State and across this country  today.   First of all, I would like to say that even though the wildfires in  my State are being contained, thanks to the skilled work of brave and  dedicated firefighters, wildfires and health impacts of smoke are still  creating hazardous conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest. Until  we begin addressing the drivers of those natural disasters, like  climate change, we know these crises and the suffering they bring will  only continue getting worse.                             Judicial Nominations    Secondly, I want to talk about three nominees under consideration for  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the EEOC.   One of these nominees is Jocelyn Samuels. She is exactly who workers  need right now. As the coronavirus continues to impact workplaces  across the country, workers are facing unprecedented challenges, and  they need a champion at the EEOC who will work tirelessly to defend  their rights. Jocelyn Samuels is that champion.    With almost 20 years of experience in the Federal Government,  including at the EEOC itself, she has spent her career working to  address discrimination and making sure no one is treated unfairly  because of their age, their race, or their disability.   I am confident she will be an excellent Commissioner. I am proud to  vote to confirm her nomination and strongly urge my Senate colleagues  to join me in supporting her nomination.   Unfortunately, the other two nominees already approved by the  Senate--Andrea Lucas and Keith Sonderling--will likely have disastrous  consequences for workers' rights. These are two people who have spent  their careers working to protect corporations, not workers.   As a lawyer, Andrea Lucas has never defended workers. Her only legal  experience is defending corporations when workers tried to fight back  against sexual harassment or age discrimination and disability  discrimination. That is exactly the opposite type of experience and  values we need at the EEOC, which is why I voted against her  nomination.   Keith Sonderling's record is no better. During his time at the Trump  administration's Department of Labor, Keith Sonderling worked to churn  out policies that hurt workers.   From his joint employer rule that lets massive corporations off the  hook for minimum wage, overtime, and equal pay violations to his  initiative that gives companies a ``get out of jail free'' card for  wage theft, Keith Sonderling's legacy at the DOL has made it harder for  workers to fight for their rights and easier for companies to abuse  them. For those reasons, I opposed his nomination.  [[Page S5822]]    Finally, right now, our Nation is facing truly trying times. Two  hundred thousand lives have been lost to COVID, millions are  unemployed, and we just lost a treasured American hero, Justice Ruth  Bader Ginsburg.   So much hangs in the balance now, and people are already voting and  organizing to make sure their healthcare, their rights, and their  futures are protected in this election.   For those nationwide who have already cast their ballots and who will  vote in the coming weeks for the future of our country and to help  ensure trust--trust in our democracy--the people must have a vote in  this nomination.   The next President should choose Justice Ginsburg's replacement as  she wished to spare our democracy the painful chaos of making such a  decision so close to an election.   People are speaking out, and the Senate must listen, as Majority  Leader McConnell insisted only a few years ago. But, unfortunately, it  seems like my colleagues on the other side are content to ignore these  cries, just like they have neglected the cries of our constituents for  a COVID-19 relief package that meets this moment instead of  shortchanging our communities because nothing--nothing is more  important than pushing through their ideological agenda to jam as many  partisan judges on the bench as possible, especially on the Supreme  Court, and tip the balance of our Federal judiciary even further  against everyday people, packing our courts to ensure we can't make  progress to defend affordable healthcare and preexisting conditions  protections or addressing the climate crisis or strengthening  protections for workers or doing anything on the critical issues that  people in my home State of Washington and around the Nation care so  deeply about and that have been blocked time and again by the  Republican Party.   I will be doing absolutely everything I can to make sure everyone  from Washington State to Washington, DC, and my Republican colleagues  here in Congress know just how much is at risk if President Trump gets  to appoint another hard-right nominee an unprecedented 41 days before a  Presidential election.   It is truly impossible to understate the consequences for families  and communities across the country now and for generations to come.  President Trump has made it clear he wants a nominee who will gut  protections for preexisting conditions, who will take healthcare away  from millions of people nationwide, and do everything they can to  undermine basic rights and freedoms and protections through the Court,  including crucial worker protections that Justice Ginsburg, herself,  helped secure and the EEOC is tasked with enforcing.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting today to honor an  important part of Justice Ginsburg's legacy and vote for the nomination  of Jocelyn Samuels. Then let's keep fighting for people's healthcare,  for protections for preexisting conditions, for workers' rights, and  voters' rights, and LGBTQIA+ rights, and for the vision of a just and  equal country--a just and equal country Justice Ginsburg fought so hard  to advance.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                        Vote on Hinderaker Nomination
