 Madam President, first of all, I want to applaud the  Senator from Alaska for his comments. I agree completely with his  statements, and I think his amendment making it clear that we expect  the 2 percent to be honored by all member states is something that we  all should welcome and agree to.   I thank you for your leadership. I also thank you for how you have  articulated the importance of NATO to our national security.   NATO is a transatlantic security partnership that has served our  national security interests so well for so many years since the end of  World War II.   Today, we are going to have a chance to vote to expand the NATO  alliance by adding Finland and Sweden. I hope all my colleagues will  support that.   I will point out that Finland already exceeds the 2 percent that  Senator  [[Page S3894]]  Sullivan is talking about, the percentage of their GDP that they are  spending on defense. So I think this is another reason why we have  countries that we want to add to the alliance. We have 30 strong now.  This will even be stronger with Finland and Sweden being added to the  NATO alliance.   But what is unique about the two countries that we will have a chance  to vote on in a few moments is that they give us added value to our  alliance. They make our alliance stronger. It is in our national  security interest to include Finland and Sweden. They add value  militarily and economically to this alliance.   The geostrategic location of these two countries is critically  important to our national security. Just think for a moment about the  threats to the Baltic nations that we have seen by Russia--Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania. Think about where Poland has been threatened  because of Russia's aggression in Ukraine.   Adding Finland and Sweden will help us round out the security  alliance necessary to provide the security that we need. Both of these  countries are already committed to interoperability with the NATO  alliance. They are already familiar with how NATO's process and  procedures are utilized.   So we have two countries that are ready from day one to be active  participants in the alliance. They both participate in regular  participation and training exercises with NATO and U.S. forces. Both  Sweden and Finland have done that. They have contributed troops. Sweden  has contributed troops to NATO-led operations in Kosovo, to  Afghanistan, to Iraq. So we have countries that have already stepped up  to help us in security and now will be a formal part of the security  alliance.   They will add, also, a dimension that is important for us in regards  to winter warfare. The cold response winter warfare exercises have been  participated in. Finland has the arctic capabilities that will be  critically important to us as we move forward. So we are adding value  to the NATO alliance as well as expanding the number of countries.   I want to mention one other area: cyber and misinformation. We have  two countries that have been very active in being victimized by the  misinformation campaign by Russia. Sweden has a Psychological Defence  Agency that they created in 2016 that is going to be important for us.  As we know, Mr. Putin uses every weapon in his arsenal, including  misinformation, in order to try to bring down democratic states. We  know that in Sweden's case, they are already taking decisive action to  counter the misinformation. Finland has an anti-fake-news initiative,  which is actually fascinating. They recognize that Russia is trying to  invade their country through misinformation, and they have an active  way of defending against it. So, as I said earlier, we have two  countries that will add value to the alliance.   The timing here couldn't be better. We have stood up an international  resolve to support Ukraine in the invasion by Russia. Expanding NATO at  this moment is a clear message to Mr. Putin that we stand with the  democratic countries of Europe and we are prepared to expand our NATO  alliance to guarantee their protection.   So these two stalwart, democratic nations, Finland and Sweden, have  been robust partners to the United States and Europe on countless  fronts. They have provided humanitarian aid to many countries in need,  including Ukraine during the unprovoked invasion by Russia. Combined,  Finland and Sweden provided over $120 million in military and  humanitarian aid to Ukraine between February and June of 2022.   These two nations have also shown a commitment to democratic  governance, ranking third and fourth respectively on the global  Democracy Index of 2020, according to an economist group. So we have  two of the leading democratic states.   Finland and Sweden have proven time and time again that they have the  defense capabilities and commitment to democracy in Europe to make them  essential NATO allies. The Senate must act now to bolster this global  peace and security by voting in favor of Finland and Sweden's accession  to the North Atlantic Treaty. I urge my colleagues to do that.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to note that, during this  coming recess, we will mark the somber occasion of the 1-year  anniversary of the fall of Kabul and the Taliban takeover of  Afghanistan. I want to draw the attention of the Senate and the  American people to one of our most urgent priorities in Afghanistan:  providing immediate assistance for Afghan citizens that risked their  lives to further U.S. interests and whose lives now stand in jeopardy  should we not act soon.   Nine days--in the short span of 9 days after seizing control of the  first province to fall on August 6, 2021--Nimruz--a whirlwind of chaos  ensued. The world watched as, one by one, all of the country's  provinces fell to Taliban forces until finally reaching the capital  Kabul on August 15. With little resistance from the Afghan forces we  had trained and equipped over two decades, the Taliban simply entered  and took control. In terrified desperation, many Afghans gathered what  they could carry with them and fled. People left their whole lives  behind--their houses, their jobs, their friends and family--risking  their lives to flee the country in the wake of the Taliban takeover.  Shocking images of Afghans clinging to U.S. evacuation flights as they  took off could not have shown a clearer picture of the despair of so  many Afghans.   Amid this panic, the Biden administration acted swiftly to evacuate  American personnel and most American citizens.   We joined our international allies to call for a new Afghan  Government that is united, inclusive, and representative, including  with full participation of women. We joined international voices to  reaffirm our commitment to ensuring rights of women and girls in  Afghanistan. And along with our NATO allies, we committed to evacuate  at-risk Afghans.   And make no mistake, we as Americans remain committed to all these  priorities. We stand united with our allies to further these goals and  ensure a stable and secure Afghanistan. Central to the Taliban's  beliefs is the Pashtun code of ethics, ``Pashtunwaly,'' in which  ``nang''--which means honor--stands as the central tenet. It is with  ``nang'' in mind that we call on the Taliban to honor their commitment  to provide an accountable and inclusive government. We urge them to  honor their original and oft-repeated promise to uphold human rights  and support education for women and girls--commitments that recent  reporting suggests they are not fulfilling.   We call on them to honor their commitment to provide a safe and  secure Afghanistan for all Afghans. We join our allies in the  international community in these calls for action.   Yet in the aftermath of the fall of Afghanistan, there remains one  priority for the U.S. alone to undertake: ensuring the well-being of  Afghan citizens who put their lives on the line to serve our country.  These are the Afghans who worked at our Embassy and other diplomatic  facilities, served as our translators, helped us engage with the Afghan  Government, and provided us information and assistance. They are the  Afghans that served and studied in U.S.-affiliated centers and  universities. They are the Afghans who worked tirelessly to promote our  principles as journalists working for U.S.-affiliated outlets, like the  Afghan services of RFE/RL, Radio Azadi, and Ghandara. Without their  assistance, U.S. lives would have been lost. Without their support, we  would have been unable to talk about our U.S. values and priorities to  the Afghan people.   Without them, we would not have been able to work with the Government  of Afghanistan to promote our shared goal of regional stability and  security. To these individuals and their families, we owe a great debt  for their assistance. The 77,000 Afghans currently in the pipeline for  special immigrant visas, the 44,000 that await processing for their P1/ P2 visas, and yet another almost 5,000 that seek humanitarian parole,  these individuals are all counting on us. So I call on the State  Department to make renewed efforts to expedite these cases.   I would like to recognize that, to date, our government has made  enormous strides in this herculean effort; tens of thousands of these  individuals were evacuated from Afghanistan following the collapse of  the government. Yet tens of thousands more remain stranded in limbo,  both in Afghanistan as well as in third countries--among others, in  Pakistan, Qatar, UAE, Georgia, Albania, and the Kyrgyz Republic. They  wait patiently, many of them running through their personal savings,  many unable to work.   We continue to support these individuals, oftentimes maintaining a  delicate dialogue with the host countries about the long-term plans for  these individuals.   I would like to share with you the story of one such individual whose  life hangs in the balance. It is with her permission that I share this  story, and I will call her ``Arezo'' to safeguard her anonymity. Arezo  is a bright young Afghan woman of Hazara heritage who studied at a U.S.  university and later worked for an international human rights NGO. By  all accounts, up until the collapse of Afghanistan, she was one of the  many Afghans working to build a bright future for Afghanistan. When  Kabul fell, like so many others, Arezo shred all the documents tying  her in any way to the United States. She knew that if the Taliban  discovered this connection, both her life and her family's lives could  be at risk.   While attempting to flee, Arezo and her brother were discovered by  the Taliban and taken in for questioning about their reasons for  wanting to leave the country. Arezo's brother was savagely beaten.  Arezo was subjected to a humiliating virginity test. They were both  taken into custody for several weeks, during which they endured brutal  and inhumane treatment, often ridiculed by the Taliban guards for their  Shi'a faith as ``untrue Muslims.''   While incarcerated, Arezo witnessed the brutal rape of a 12-year-old  girl at the hands of the Taliban. The crime of this child? She had been  imprisoned for riding in local transport without a male family member  escort. Miraculously, after external pressure, Arezo was released, but  not without the threat hanging over her head that the Taliban would  keep tabs on her. Arezo now waits for the United States to process her  visa. Hers is one of the over 44,000 cases that remain backlogged,  while her life hangs in the balance.   I tell you this: It is in our direct, immediate interest to dedicate  and reallocate resources to resolve pending cases like those of Arezo.  [[Page S3911]]    Until we resolve their cases, we continue to expend enormous U.S.  resources to support them in third countries, with no clear end in  sight. We continue to ask much of our bilateral partners that have  generously agreed to take in these evacuees. Our Embassies and  government Agencies will continue to struggle with the overload caused  by the burden of managing these extra cases. But most importantly, we  owe it to these individuals who put their own lives on the line for our  county to process their cases quickly.   It is no accident that I chose the name ``Arezo'' as a stand-in for  the young Afghan woman who, like so many others, awaits our action.  Arezo is a Hazara name that means ``hope'' or ``faith.'' And like so  many others, she has taken it on faith that the U.S. Government will  make good on its promise to take care of the Afghans like her that have  served--and continue to serve--U.S. interests and who still believe in  the American dream and still believe that America will fulfill her  promises.   I encourage that at all levels of government, we work to identify  resources to reallocate towards this goal. We have the resources, but  we must redirect these resources and make it a top priority. I call on  our State Department and USCIS colleagues to elevate the task of  processing cases to a high priority status. I propose that we convene  in committee to discuss additional ways that Congress can support the  successful resolution of their cases and permanent resettlement. On the  eve of the 1-year anniversary of an ignominious American withdrawal  from Afghanistan, after a two-decade effort, I urge that across all  lines of government, we recognize this priority and work promptly to  resolve the cases of the many Afghans who have put their lives on the  line for our country.                            ____________________
