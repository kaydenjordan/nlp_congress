The Government of Bahrain has requested to buy upgrades to       nine (9) M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to a M270       A1 minimum configuration. The upgrade will include: the       Common Fire Control System (CFCS); Improved Launcher       Mechanical System (ILMS); 600h Engine and associated engine       compartment modifications; Improved Electronics Distribution       Box (IEDB); fan speed control valve; cables and mounting       hardware, Power Take Off (PTO) and BOO series transmission;       the Digital Communication Systems (DCOMMS); and Vehicular       Intercom System (AN/VIC-3).

The estimated       total cost is $175.98 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a Major Non-NATO Ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in the       Middle East.        The proposed sale will improve Bahrain's capability to meet       current and future threats by enhancing Bahrain's ability to       defend itself against regional malign actors and improve       interoperability with systems operated by U.S. forces and       other Gulf countries. Bahrain's continued investment in its       defensive capabilities is crucial to protecting its borders,       energy infrastructure, and its residents, including over       15,000 U.S. citizens and Naval personnel living and working       in the country. Bahrain will have no difficulty absorbing       these upgraded MLRSs into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be the Lockheed Martin       Corporation, Bethesda, MD. There are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Bahrain.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 22-04       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii          (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) is a high-      mobility automatic system based on an M270 weapons platform.       The MLRS fires surface-to-surface rockets: the Army Tactical       Missile System (ATACMS) and the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket       System (GMLRS). Without leaving the cab, the crew of three       (driver, gunner and section chief) can fire up to 12 MLRS       rockets in fewer than 60 seconds.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the Government of       Bahrain can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Bahrain.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
