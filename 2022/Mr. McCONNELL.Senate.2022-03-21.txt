 Madam President, over the weekend, we learned that  four U.S. marines were tragically killed Friday night. Their training  aircraft crashed during joint NATO exercises in Norway. One of those  marines, Corporal Moore, was born and raised in Catlettsburg, KY. I  want to take a moment to mourn this great loss and salute Corporal  Moore's service to our country.   Corporal Moore joined the Marines in 2018. At only 24 years old, he  had spent 4 years honorably serving our country all around the world.  He was serving as an MV-22B Osprey crew chief based out of New River,  NC.   Corporal Moore was in Norway along with 30,000 other soldiers from 27  countries for NATO's Cold Response exercises. Every 2 years, NATO  servicemembers travel to the edge of the Arctic Circle to train in  northern Scandinavia's frozen wilderness. This long-scheduled exercise  is not directly related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the events  of recent weeks have only reminded us of the incredible importance of  the NATO alliance to America's security and to world peace.    Corporal Moore's service was hugely and directly important to our  Nation, to our allies, and to the world. So we will never forget  Corporal Moore's service and sacrifice in defense of America's safety  and freedom. We are thinking of and praying for his family at this  terribly, terribly difficult time.                     Nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson    Madam President, on an entirely different matter, this week, the  Senate will turn to a crucial constitutional duty: deciding whether to  provide or withhold consent to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme  Court of the United States.   President Biden's nominee for this incredibly consequential position  is Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.   Judge Jackson is currently a DC Circuit judge of less than a year. In  9 months as an appellate judge, she has offered only two opinions, both  after the Supreme Court vacancy opened up. So this time, unlike  Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, there is no meaningful sample size of  appellate  [[Page S1262]]  opinions for Senators to consult. We know a lot about the time Judge  Jackson spent applying precedent as a trial judge on the district court  but very little about her independent views of larger constitutional  and legal questions.   This makes the Judiciary Committee's work this week all the more  important. The country needs a respectful, dignified but vigorous and  exhaustive hearing. This is especially true in light of the curious  disconnect between the thinness of Judge Jackson's appellate record and  the white-hot intensity with which our country's farthest left  activists wanted her and nobody else for this vacancy.   Fringe groups that attack the Court's legitimacy and want Court  packing spent a great deal of time and money promoting Judge Jackson  for this nomination, and, once nominated, prominent, soft-on-crime  activists and open-borders pressure groups quickly rallied to her side.  The Senate needs to understand why.   I enjoyed meeting with Judge Jackson recently. She is a likeable  person. More to the point, she has obviously reached impressive heights  in the legal profession. But I voted against confirming Judge Jackson  to her current post last year, and our meeting the other week did not  resolve my questions and concerns.   So here is what I will be especially watching and listening for as  our colleagues question the nominee this week.   First, at the most basic level, I want to hear whether Judge Jackson  agrees that the job of a judge is to follow the law as it is written.  This is a simple, straightforward proposition. But the same liberals  who have spent decades imploring Justices to approach their jobs as  activist superlegislators are now eager to see this nominee confirmed.   Judge Jackson suggested to me in our meeting that she does not really  view herself as having any judicial philosophy whatsoever, but  meanwhile, in the press, boosters of her nomination say she does have a  philosophy and assures us that it is mainstream. So which is it? I hope  the committee can clear up any confusion.   It is also the case that President Biden has repeatedly declared that  any judge he appoints will pass certain litmus tests. He said they  would have ``an expansive view of the Constitution'' that includes the  ``penumbras'' and non-textually-based rights that activist judges  favor. The President has even made explicit promises about specific  cases. For example, ``They will, in fact, support Roe v. Wade.'' We  need to know whether Judge Jackson passed President Biden's policy  litmus test explicitly or just implicitly.    We also need to understand more about Judge Jackson's so-called  empathy for particular parties in cases over others. This is not an  accusation that Republicans invented; it is a trait that Judge  Jackson's supporters happily ascribe to her. One law professor has  explained that Judge Jackson would ``bring a measure of empathy to the  criminal defense cases, the Fourth and Fifth Amendment cases.''   I guess a judge entering a case with special preexisting empathy  would be a great deal for the party with whom she empathizes, but it  would certainly be a raw deal for the opposite party. A judge's job is  to bring neutrality, not an agenda.   And yet, even as America grapples with a historic crime wave, the  President has chosen a nominee whose own supporters say her work as a  criminal defense lawyer and on the U.S. Sentencing Commission will tilt  her judgment in favor of convicts. Even as illegal border crossings are  setting alltime records, political groups that support amnesty and  functionally open borders are cheering that, if confirmed, Judge  Jackson will ``shape the realities of millions'' of people who have  come into our country. These confident policy assertions are not  selling points; they are actually red flags.   The Supreme Court sits atop one of the three pillars of American  Government. It is the ultimate backstop for the endurance of our  Constitution and the rule of law. And we rightly entrust the Justices  who lead it with life tenure. So any nominee to this highest Bench  ought to welcome close scrutiny, tough questions, and a rigorous review  of their record. The country deserves nothing less, and this is what  Senate Republicans will provide this week.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
