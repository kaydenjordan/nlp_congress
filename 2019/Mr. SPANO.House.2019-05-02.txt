 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  National Day of Prayer, a day that exists to encourage prayer for  America.   Since our country's founding, from Washington to Lincoln to Kennedy  to Trump, prayer to our Creator has served as our most important  resource during times of celebration and days of trial.  [[Page H3430]]    With the same spirit as those who fled the shores of Europe to escape  religious persecution, we welcome this day as one in which we can come  together as a people in gratitude for our freedoms and our prosperity,  but also in earnest petition for forgiveness, unity, mercy, guidance,  and favor.   The National Day of Prayer is a day for all Americans to reflect on  our many blessings and to recognize where our ultimate source of  strength and hope comes from--our Creator.   At a time in history where our Nation is more divided than ever, I  call for us to commit ourselves to prayer this day, to seek the God  which has blessed this Nation for 242 years, and to begin again to live  out this year's theme, to love and serve one another.                            ____________________
