 Mr. Speaker, more than a year into the  COVID-19 pandemic, I rise once again to bring attention to the Chinese  Communist Party's role in this public health and economic crisis and to  call for a full congressional investigation into the origin of the  virus.   Day after day, we learn more facts and evidence that confirm what we  have expected from the beginning: The Chinese Communist Party  intentionally covered up the COVID-19 outbreak, squandering valuable  time, creating dangerous misinformation, and, ultimately, costing  lives.   Over a year ago, the China Task Force began raising real questions  about the origin of the virus. At that time, the mainstream media and  others dismissed our concerns. Despite their objections, we continued  in our efforts to expose this coverup.   Now, after lives and livelihoods have been destroyed, President Biden  and the Democrats finally are asking questions about this virus. They  finally are waking up to reality.   Not only did this pandemic start in China, but the World Health  Organization acted as a willing pawn of the Chinese Government to cover  up this virus and hide it from the world.   After taking office, one of President Biden's first actions was  rejoining the World Health Organization at taxpayer expense, without  requiring a single reform to its corrupt culture.   Time and time again, President Biden has failed to hold the Chinese  Communist Party accountable. Now, this Congress must act.   Last year, the China Task Force developed more than 400 commonsense  solutions to counter the Chinese Communist Party's threat to our  health, our economy, and our way of life. We could start by  implementing these legislative solutions and restoring America's  leadership in 21st century innovation.   As a Congress, we also should build upon the China Task Force's  investigation into the COVID-19 pandemic origin, including whether the  virus was engineered at the Wuhan lab.   Why delay? How many more Americans will need to be infected before we  say ``enough''?   As my friend, Leader Kevin McCarthy has outlined, we need to demand  transparency, and we must seek justice. We need to get to the bottom of  this question and allow the truth to come to light.   Thanks to American ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, our  Nation has embarked on the long path to recovery. However, while new  virus cases are on the decline, the pandemic isn't over.   For the families of more than 600,000 Americans who have died from  COVID-19, grief still lingers.   For the thousands of Americans struggling with post-COVID syndrome,  the virus remains a central part of their lives each and every day.   For small business leaders struggling to keep their doors open amid  the current workforce shortage, there is still a crisis.   Holding China accountable for the pandemic is still very relevant. We  cannot drag our feet. We cannot just move on.   This is the time for Congress to get serious about our oversight  responsibilities and fully investigate the origin of the COVID-19  pandemic.   Today, I urge Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats to join with  Republicans in exposing this regime's blame in the pandemic and  demanding answers from the Chinese Communist Party.   We must ensure that this hostile regime never again is allowed to  unleash a virus onto our shores. As we have seen, lives and livelihoods  are on the line.                            ____________________
