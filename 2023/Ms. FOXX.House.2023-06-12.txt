 Mr. Speaker, the so-called Green New Deal has reared its  ugly head again, thanks to the Biden administration and its allies in  Congress.   Their newest attempt to prop up this failed radical agenda involves  the banning of gas cooking appliances that millions of American  families rely on every day.   Make no mistake: This harebrained scheme is about more government  control; more control over the lives of Americans; more control over  what we do and, ultimately, how we think. What is the next domino to  fall?   Mr. Speaker, if this were to happen, American families would be  crushed by high electricity bills and costly appliances in the name of  climate activism.   House Republicans have introduced the Save Our Gas Stoves Act and the  Gas Stove Protection and Freedom Act to combat this madness. We must  push back against more government control in our lives.                            ____________________
