 Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent during  today's vote, Executive Calendar No. 55, due to my son's college  graduation. Had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  confirmation of Governor Terry E. Branstad to be the U.S. Ambassador to  China.                            ____________________
