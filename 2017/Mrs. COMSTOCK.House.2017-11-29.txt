 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership  on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 630, my legislation to  begin to deal with the sexual harassment issue.   Thirty years ago, in 1988, a 34-year-old legislative aide named  Dorena Bertussi faced a very lonely fight when she decided to stand up  to a powerful Congressman, Jim Bates from California, who repeatedly  sexually harassed her and others in his office with questions,  comments, and actions such as asking her what type of sex she  [[Page H9495]]  liked and saying different things that he would imagine. He talked  about her breasts. He humped her leg in front of the staff and said  vulgar things that are really too unpleasant to talk about in this  body.   Dorena didn't get a lot of press attention or some of the support  that victims get today. She got little support from this body. She went  on her journey alone. She received nasty phone calls and even threats.  She was warned they would release damaging information about her.   Fortunately, she prevailed. Men and women in the workplace should  know her name and know she was the first woman to win a sexual  harassment case against a Member of Congress.   Let's remember, as we see all these headlines about men leaving their  jobs and things going on, behind all of them are women who are victims  like Dorena. There is a lot of pain in dealing with such a situation.  In speaking with her recently, I could hear that pain even 30 years  later.   As a mom, former intern here in this body, former congressional  staffer and counsel, and a Justice Department employee, I do believe  this is a watershed moment.   I have a female chief of staff. I have a female district director.  But we also need to have men and women involved in this process. I am  so happy with the men who are coming forward, because this is a  workplace issue, a human rights issue, and an issue that addresses all  of us and our daughters and sons in the workplace.   When I was working in Congress in the nineties for Congressman Wolf,  just a few years after Dorena, there were Members like ``Good Time''  Charlie Wilson, who openly bragged about hiring staff based on their  looks and breast size, famously saying: You can teach them to type, but  you can't teach them to grow breasts. He used a more vulgar term.   At the same time, Senator Bob Packwood--and this is a bipartisan  problem--assaulted over a dozen women. He kept a diary of his  debauchery that had been ignored for years.   It wasn't acceptable then, and it certainly shouldn't be acceptable  now. Yet we have stories of Members still in this body today that my  colleague, Ms. Speier, and other victims are bringing forward. I told  one such story, and I am pleased that Members have responded to say  there is no place for that type of sexual action in this body.   This legislation promotes the essential principles of accountability  and personal responsibility. It is bipartisan legislation because bad  behavior transcends party labels. Men and women--all of us--are coming  together. You are seeing this beyond this body. Obviously, it was in  the corporate world just today.   This resolution sends the message, as Peggy Noonan wrote in The Wall  Street Journal: ``The Sexual-Harassment Racket Is Over.'' I include in  the Record her op-ed from this past week.               [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 23, 2017]                    The Sexual-Harassment Racket Is Over                             (By Peggy Noonan)         This Thanksgiving I find myself thankful for something that       is roiling our country. I am glad at what has happened with       the recent, much-discussed and continuing sexual-harassment       revelations and responses. To repeat the obvious, it is a       watershed event, which is something you can lose sight of       when you're in the middle of it. To repeat the obvious again,       journalists broke the back of the scandal when they broke the       code on how to report it. For a quarter century we had been       stuck in the He Said/She Said. Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas       gave their testimonies, each offered witnesses, and the fair       minded did their best with the evidence at hand while sorting       through all the swirling political agendas. In the end I       believed Mr. Thomas. But nobody knows, or rather only two       people do.        What happened during the past two years, and very much in       the past few months, is that reporters and news organizations       committed serious resources to unearthing numbers and       patterns. Deep reporting found not one or two victims of an       abuser but, in one case, that of Bill Cosby, at least 35. So       that was the numbers. The testimony of the women who went on       the record, named and unnamed, revealed patterns: the open       bathrobe, the running shower, the ``Let's change our meeting       from the restaurant to my room/your apartment/my       guesthouse.'' Once you, as a fair-minded reader, saw the       numbers and patterns, and once you saw them in a lengthy,       judicious, careful narrative, you knew who was telling the       truth. You knew what was true. Knowing was appalling and       sometimes shocking, but it also came as a kind of relief.        Once predators, who are almost always repeat offenders,       understood the new way of reporting such stories, they       understood something else: They weren't going to get away       with it anymore. They'd never known that. And they were going       to pay a price, probably in their careers. They'd never known       that, either.        Some great journalism, some great writing and thinking, has       come of this moment. Ronan Farrow's New Yorker pieces have       been credible and gutsy on all levels. Masha Gessen's piece       in the same magazine last week warned of moral panic, of a       blurring of the lines between different behaviors and a       confusion as to the boundaries between normal, messy human       actions and heinous ones. Rebecca Traister of New York       magazine has argued that it is a mistake to focus now on the       question of punishments, that maybe the helpful thing is to       focus on what's going on in our society that predators think       they can get away with this.        Caitlin Flanagan in the Atlantic wrote the most important       political piece in `` Bill Clinton: A Reckoning.'' What is       striking about this moment, she argued, is not the number of       women who've come forward with serious allegations. ``What's       remarkable is that these women are being believed.'' Most       didn't have police reports or witnesses, and many were       speaking of things that had happened years ago. ``We have       finally come to some kind of national consensus about the       workplace; it naturally fosters a level of romance and       flirtation, but the line between those impulses and the       sexual predation of a boss is clear.''        What had impeded the ability of victims to be believed in       the past? The Bill Clinton experience. He was ``very       credibly'' accused, as Ms. Flanagan wrote, of sex crimes at       different points throughout the 1990s--Juanita Broaddrick       said he violently raped her; Paula Jones said he exposed       himself to her; Kathleen Willey said she went to him for       advice and that he groped and assaulted her. These women       ``had far more credible evidence'' than many recent accusers.       ``But Clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice       that today's accused men have experienced.'' He was rescued       instead by ``a surprising force: machine feminism.''        That movement had by the '90s devolved into a ``partisan       operation.'' Gloria Steinem in March 1998 wrote a famous New       York Times op-ed that, in Ms. Flanagan's words, ``slut-      shamed, victim-blamed, and age-shamed'' the victims and       ``urged compassion for and gratitude to the man the women       accused.'' This revealed contemporary feminism as ``a       weaponized auxiliary of the Democratic Party.'' Ms. Steinem       characterized the assaults as ``passes,'' writing: ``Even if       the allegations are true, the President is not guilty of       sexual harassment.''        Ms. Steinem operated with the same logic as the skeeviest       apologist for Roy Moore: Don't credit any charges. Gotta       stick with our team.        Ms. Flanagan: ``The widespread liberal response to the sex-      crime accusations against Bill Clinton found their natural       consequence 20 years later in the behavior of Harvey       Weinstein: Stay loudly and publicly and extravagantly on the       side of signal leftist causes and you can do what you want in       the privacy of your offices and hotel rooms.''        The article called for a Democratic Party ``reckoning'' on       the way it protected Bill Clinton.        It was a great piece.        I close with three thoughts.        The first springs from an observation Tucker Carlson made       on his show about 10 days ago. He marveled, briefly, at this       oddity: Most of the accused were famous media personalities,       influential journalists, entertainers. He noted that all       these people one way or another make their living in front of       a camera.        It stayed with me. What is it about men and modern fame       that makes them think they can take whatever they want when       they want it, and they'll always get away with it, even as       word, each year, spreads. Watch out for that guy.        Second, if the harassment is, as it seems to me, weirder       and more over the top now than, say, 40 years ago, why might       that be?        Third, a hard and deep question put quickly: An aging       Catholic priest suggested to a friend that all this was       inevitable. ``Contraception degenerates men,'' he said, as       does abortion. Once you separate sex from its seriousness,       once you separate it from its life-changing, life-giving       potential, men will come to see it as just another want, a       desire like any other. Once they think that, then they'll see       sexual violations as less serious, less charged, less full of       weight. They'll be more able to rationalize. It's only petty       theft, a pack of chewing gum on the counter, and I took it.        In time this will seem true not only to men, but to women.        This is part of the reason I'm thankful for what I'm       seeing. I experience it, even if most women don't, or don't       consciously, as a form of saying no, this is important. It is       serious.     She noted the patterns of the various infamous  predators of late and how their victims were now coming forward. These  are the same kind of victims that we see in human trafficking or child  abuse.   She writes: ``Once predators, who are almost always repeat offenders,  understood the new way of reporting such stories, they understood  something else: They weren't going to get away  [[Page H9496]]  with it anymore. They'd never known that. And they were going to pay a  price, probably in their careers. They'd never known that, either.''   Sexual predators--and we need to understand the predator behavior-- has no place in this body.   Today's education effort is just the first step. In the weeks going  forward, we need to revise our process.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). The time of the gentlewoman has  expired.    In the weeks going forward, we need to revise the  process to make it easier for women to come forward and provide them an  advocate, ombudsman, or counsel, as Dorena recommended; we need to have  a prohibition on any kind of Member-staff relationships with  subordinates; no taxpayer funding for settlements of sexual harassment  by Members of Congress; and transparency and accountability about who  the harassers are.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the business community for their support.
