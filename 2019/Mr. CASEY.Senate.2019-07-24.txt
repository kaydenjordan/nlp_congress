 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise to celebrate one of the seminal  moments in American civil rights history. This week marks the 29th  anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. On  July 26, 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed a sweeping,  bipartisan bill that acknowledged and affirmed the rights of people  with disabilities.   The passage of the so-called ADA promised that people with  disabilities would be included in the guarantee of fundamental rights-- just by way of examples, the right to petition the court when  discriminated against; the right to apply for and be considered for a  job; the right to have and having the access to vote; the right to  economic security; the right to live where you want to live.   Twenty-nine years later, our country is better because we agreed to  make the opportunities of our country accessible to all. The ADA  changed the lives of 61 million Americans with disabilities and has  made our Nation more accessible. The ADA proclaimed that Americans with  disabilities must have the right and the means to fully participate in  their communities. The ADA offers a path toward a truly accessible  nation and elevates the voices of millions of individuals.   One of those voices belongs to Jean Searle from the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania. Jean works at Disability Rights Pennsylvania, where she  protects the rights of people with disabilities so they may live the  lives they choose--free from abuse, neglect, discrimination, and  segregation.   As a child and young adult, Jean was forced to live in an  institution. In that institution, she faced many indignities, the worst  of which may have been having had her infant child taken from her  without her consent. Simply because Jean lived with a disability, it  was often assumed that she was not capable of making her own decisions,  but she worked hard to find a way out of that institution. When she  finally succeeded, she chose to live independently in her community and  has found a fulfilling career in Harrisburg.   The rights affirmed by the ADA and the services and supports Medicaid  and other programs have provided have made it possible for Jean to be a  full citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and, yes, even of the  United States of America. Jean has dedicated her life to protecting the  rights of people with disabilities.   During this ADA anniversary week, it is also fitting that today is  Jean's birthday.   So, Jean, in looking at your picture on my left, I say happy  birthday. I know many here would wish the same if you were here in  person on the floor with us. I am honored to share your birthday.   Let me pause here.   Almost 30 years after her infant son, whom I referred to earlier, was  taken from her, Jean had the opportunity recently to meet him for the  first time. Jean often says that to make the world a better place, we  need to spend our time listening to people with disabilities and  learning from the disability community.    Well said, Jean.   When I listen, I hear about the greatness of the ADA and, at the same  time, about much more that still needs to be done. One of those things  is to protect what we have. That includes protecting access to  healthcare, preventing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and  ensuring that Medicaid remains intact. We also need to combat threats  to people with disabilities.   Over the past 2 years, we have seen a systemic and concerted effort  to sabotage supports that are necessary for equality, opportunity, and  the full participation of people with disabilities. What this  administration has failed to do with legislation it is trying to  accomplish through regulation and court cases. Cutting Medicaid is  contrary to the ADA's goals, and it makes it difficult--or even  potentially impossible--for people with disabilities to work, to go to  school, or to be engaged in their communities.   While we protect the hard-fought rights the disability community has  earned, we can also build upon the ADA's promises. As we celebrate the  ADA's 29th anniversary, we can do at least three things--honor the  great advancements that have been made because of the ADA; remain  vigilant to attacks on those civil rights; and work to ensure that the  ADA's goals are realized for all people with disabilities.   I believe Jean's own words make the point clearer than I can.         We must never go back. We must never forget the struggle       that people with disabilities have gone through and are still       going through today.   [[Page S5035]]     We must never go back, as Jean said. So, as we celebrate the ADA's  29th anniversary, I promise--and I know it is the promise of many  Members of Congress--to never forget that struggle. I also promise to  stand side by side with the disability community to fully accomplish  the ADA's goals.    I yield to Senator Brown.    I thank the senior Senator from Ohio, who makes the point  broadly about the importance of Medicaid in the context of healthcare  but especially with regard to Americans with disabilities. I thank him  for his comments, and I thank him for his advocacy.
