 Mr. Speaker, as the father of three school-age boys, the  health and well-being of children and school kids across America is one  of my top priorities.   As we continue to navigate the COVID pandemic, I have heard  repeatedly from parents across the 18th District of Illinois about  getting our kids back in the classroom and back on the athletic field.   Throughout this pandemic, we have heard from experts and now  President Joe Biden about the importance of trusting the science. When  it comes to schools, the science is clear: Students and teachers can go  back to in-person learning safely. The CDC is also clear on this. Risk  of transmission of COVID-19 in the classroom is extremely low.   Getting back in the classroom won't just help our kids achieve their  academic goals, it will also help with their mental and physical  health, areas that many students have struggled with during this  pandemic.   Hospitals across the country have seen increases in child suicide  attempts and mental health admissions. Nothing is zero risk, but the  consequences of keeping our children out of the classroom far outweigh  the risk.   Our kids are suffering mentally and academically. The science is  clear. Let's put our children first and get students back in the  classroom as soon as possible.                            ____________________
