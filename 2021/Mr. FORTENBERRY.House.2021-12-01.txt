 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida  for yielding. And I also thank Congresswoman Cammack for her powerful,  personal testimony. I am glad you are here today. Thank you so much for  your leadership.   Madam Speaker, beneath you, right underneath this dais right here,  are five very powerful words. And we are so busy in this Chamber  debating numerous things we don't even look at them. But there they  are, right there.   It says: Union, justice, tolerance, liberty, and peace. And we all  say we want unity. We all want justice. We say we want tolerance and,  of course, we value liberty. And all of these beautiful virtues point  to the possibility of peace. But here is the problem: We leave out one  group of persons, expectant mothers and their pre-born children. And  the question before us today is why? Why?   That was the question that was debated today right across the street  here at the Supreme Court. Why?   We don't have to live like this. What we can do is live in authentic  community with one another, where every person matters, including the  expectant mother and her pre-born child. That is called a community of  care, where a tolerant, just, and inclusive society commits to this  journey of life before birth, at birth, and after birth.                                time  1700
