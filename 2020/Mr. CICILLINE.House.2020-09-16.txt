 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8162,  the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief Act.   As the coronavirus pandemic continues, schools throughout Rhode  Island and all across America have been forced to close their doors,  some for the rest of the year.                                time  1215    This trend means that high-quality after-school and summer programs  will be even more necessary to provide young people with a safe,  enriching place to learn and grow. We have an obligation to ensure that  these programs have the resources and flexibility needed to meet the  needs of America's children.   Currently, more than 2 million children and families rely on Nita M.  [[Page H4454]]  Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers for after-school and  summer learning programming. With schools across the country closing,  many students are unable to obtain services provided by out-of-school  programs, including academic assistance, a safe place to be when their  parents are working, and access to a hot meal or healthy snack.   We know after-school programming provides one of the most effective  ways to keep children safe in the late afternoon and early evening  hours and keeps them on the right path to completing school. These  programs help students develop essential life skills such as problem- solving, critical thinking, and healthy living.   Additional flexibility for 21st Century Community Learning Centers  will help improve access to these critical programs and will make sure  that after-school programming is available to students and families to  keep children safe and engaged and to strengthen families and  communities throughout the pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding me the time.
