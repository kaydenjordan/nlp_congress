 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6 p.m.  today, the Senate vote on confirmation of the Lindenbaum nomination and  the cloture motions on the Padin, Sweeney, and Morrison nominations;  and that if cloture is invoked on any of those nominations, all  postcloture time be considered expired and the Senate vote on  confirmation of the nominations at a time to be determined by the  majority leader or his designee, following consultation with the  Republican leader.  [[Page S2649]]     Mr. President, what is the current threat of nuclear  annihilation?   The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' Doomsday Clock measures how close  humanity and the planet is to destruction. The answer is: 100 seconds.  That is tied for the closest we have ever been to planetary ruin since  the clock started in 1947.   Recent nuclear events are likely to turn the dial even further. The  size, diversity, and lethality of North Korea's weapons continue to  grow, as does its threat to our allies in the region. North Korea's Kim  Jong Un has fired more than a dozen missiles this year. Preparations  are being made for another nuclear test.   Iran is just weeks away from acquiring a nuclear weapon, the tragic  consequence of Donald Trump blowing up the Iran nuclear deal that  President Biden is now trying to stitch back together.   In Xinjiang, the same province where China has constructed forced  labor camps, more than 100 domes, likely housing missile silos, dot the  landscape. The Pentagon says these sites are part of the evidence  behind China's quest to double its nuclear forces in the next 5 years.   Belarus's authoritarian leader Lukashenka has made a deal with the  devil, Vladimir Putin, to stay in power. Part of the price for Putin's  lifeline was a demand that Lukashenka amend the Belarus Constitution to  allow for the placement of Russian nuclear weapons on its territory,  further taunting Ukraine and all of Europe with existential ruin.   European leaders are readying the distribution of iodine tablets in  the event of mushroom cloud drifts overhead. The continent's residents  are building fallout shelters right now.   It should come as no surprise then that in a recent poll, 70 percent  of Americans said they fear that Putin will use nuclear weapons in the  war in Ukraine. These global fears are well-founded. We fought over the  course of decades to make nuclear weapons taboo, but they are making a  big comeback. In January, the five nuclear weapons States of the  Nonproliferation Treaty affirmed that ``a nuclear war can never be won  and must never be fought.'' But actions speak louder than words, and  the actions of Russia in Ukraine, the hundreds of missile silos taking  form in China, and the $51 billion the United States is set to spend on  nuclear weapons this year alone tell us that nuclear weapons are still  very much in vogue.   The Doomsday Clock was created at the start of the nuclear age, and  in the past 75 years, the minute hand has fluctuated. It has inched  closer to midnight with the Soviet Union's first nuclear weapons test,  India's ``Smiling Buddha'' test, and more recently, President Trump's  threats of ``fire and fury'' against Kim Jong Un.   When the destructive power of nuclear weapons has been curbed, the  clock has receded from midnight. Kennedy and Khrushchev answered the  Cuban Missile Crisis by banning atmospheric and undersea nuclear tests;  Bush and Gorbachev retired thousands of nuclear weapons made obsolete  by the fall of the Iron Curtain; and Obama locked down nuclear material  around the globe, keeping it out of the hands of terrorists.   I fear that we are seeing echoes of the darkest days of the Cold  War--a time marked by fear and distrust of an adversary's true  intentions; a time when the gold-plated defense establishment plowed  ahead with new capabilities without any consideration of how  proliferation begets proliferation; a time when the myth of a ``bomber  and missile gap'' with the former Soviet Union spurred an arms race  that brought us to the brink.   Thankfully, President Biden has taken some steps to crank the minute  hand back from midnight. While Trump was intent on dissolving the New  START treaty with Russia, President Biden saved it in his first days in  office. The treaty's value, especially in the context of Russia's war  in Ukraine, cannot be overstated. The treaty puts our eyes on Russia's  strategic forces so we can be confident in distinguishing between  Putin's nuclear bluster and actions that should legitimately raise the  alarm.   But the New START treaty is not enough. Putin's provocations about  nuclear escalation, coupled with his brandishing of battlefield nuclear  weapons, highlight our need to negotiate new systems into a future  treaty or agreement with Russia. Putin's invasion of Ukraine threw a  wrench into progress in the U.S.-Russia strategic dialogue, but when  the moment arrives, we need to restart these discussions, and we need  to be bold.   The use of nuclear weapons as coercive tools means it is essential  that we do not welcome any new members to the nuclear weapons club.  President Trump failed us by creating a minefield of obstacles against  cleanly reentering the Iran nuclear deal, but President Biden knows  that the alternative to reentry is far worse: We will see more  enrichment, more proxy attacks, and risk a direct war with Iran versus  the United States.   We must also hold our partners to the same verification standard as  we hold Iran. Saudi Arabia must come clean about its illicit nuclear  and missile cooperation with China. We should insist that Saudi Arabia  adopt the Additional Protocol to its International Atomic Energy Agency  Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement so that we can be sure that any  future nuclear program turns out peaceful megawatts, not megatons; so  that it is an electricity program and not a nuclear weapons program.   Kim Jong Un's recent missile launches show that we ignore the North  Korean leader at our own risk. In consultation with our allies, we need  to break the endless cycle we have seen: a provocation from the North,  followed by sanctions, then another provocation, sparking a fresh round  of sanctions. Our policy is stuck in an endless loop of nuclear  Groundhog Day. It is time to concede that a leader like Kim Jong Un,  who is willing to divert resources away from his starving people in  order to strengthen his weapons of mass destruction program, cannot be  coerced to disarm by piling on sanctions alone. While the  denuclearization of North Korea is a worthy long-term goal, we have to  humble ourselves to pursue the art of the possible--incremental steps  that reduce the threat of war on the Korean Peninsula.   In facing all of these challenges, we cannot continue to preach  temperance from a barstool. As the leader of the only country to have  used nuclear weapons in a conflict, we can't afford to take a back seat  when it comes to reducing nuclear risks. The President must use his  position to send the message that responsible nuclear weapons powers  don't roll out new weapons systems in military parades; they sit down  in good-faith negotiations to reduce the sizes and uses of their  nuclear deterrents--and that must include China.   Russia's invasion of Ukraine has set back the nonproliferation  regime, but it also creates an opportunity for President Biden to  challenge China's Xi to join him in reassuring a rattled world that  firing on nuclear reactors is off limits, that threatening countries  with existential weapons is unacceptable, and to show the world that  the inevitability of a ``Sputnik moment'' with China does not have to  come to pass. Our two countries may disagree on a lot, but we can  embrace the organizing principle that the only way to win an arms race  is not to run in one.   For instance, we are concerned about China's development of  maneuverable hypersonic systems and its plans to expand its ICBM force,  but Pentagon leaders admit that Beijing's concerns about advances in  U.S. missile defenses are partly the impetus for that buildup. We are  concerned that China may be drifting away from its no-first-use  doctrine, but both the United States and Russia explicitly allow for  the use of nuclear weapons in response to a nonnuclear attack. We fear  that China may use new civilian nuclear reactors to churn out massive  amounts of separated plutonium for bombs, but other countries in the  region also have the capacity to divert fissile material from a  peaceful to a nonpeaceful program.   If President Biden can get Xi to the negotiating table, we have a  chance to shape an alternative future to the inevitable doom that the  Pentagon has previewed--one that does not see the United States and  China joining Russia in pursuit of new innovative, more lethal ways to  kill one another; one that instead negotiates near-term confidence- building measures to reduce  [[Page S2650]]  nuclear risks with China and that can ultimately lead to the conclusion  of formal arms control agreements between our countries. The United  States cannot do it alone, but we can break the cycle of nuclear  escalation and secure a future wherein the fate of millions no longer  hangs on the whims and judgments of fallible leaders or the military- industrial complex.   We need President Biden to outline that bold action plan that draws  inspiration from our better angels, not from the unhinged policies of  nuclear weapons overkill that Stanley Kubrick lampooned in ``Dr.  Strangelove.''   In my book ``Nuclear Peril: The Politics of Proliferation,'' written  in 1983, I wrote:         Nuclear proliferation is a problem too long ignored. Now,       before it is too late, the public must draw the line. The       stakes are too high.    The public clearly understands that the stakes for our planet have  never been higher, but it is not too late, not yet. Once the clock hits  midnight, though, our time is up. It is time for action, not rhetoric.  This issue is one that can no longer be ignored.   I yield the floor.
