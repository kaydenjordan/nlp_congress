 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Murray Poole, who is retiring after 54 years of covering local sports  in the news in towns across coastal Georgia.   The long-time sports editor of The Brunswick News, Mr. Poole was  known throughout the Golden Isles as both fair and supportive of all  the local players and the teams. Mr. Poole simply never wrote a bad  word about anyone.   Mr. Poole interviewed nearly every major sports star who came through  the Golden Isles, including Mickey Mantle, Davis Love III, and Adam  Wainwright, and made it a point to ask them only feel-good questions.   But more importantly, Mr. Poole gave his undivided attention to local  sporting events. Murray would highlight everyone from the high school  region championship golf team to the second-string freshman football  player.   Mr. Poole's journalism in the Golden Isles is simply irreplaceable.   Mr. Speaker, may Mr. Poole enjoy his retirement. We thank him for his  service to our community.                            ____________________     I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 151, the Pallone-Thune  TRACED Act. The Energy and Commerce Committee has prioritized combating  the scourge of robocalls for quite some time now.   In May, the Senate passed their robocalls legislation, and in July,  the House nearly unanimously passed the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act.   Last year, Americans saw nearly 50 billion robocalls. Those robocalls  come morning, night, and noon, often interrupting important life  events. This year, we are on track to see a high number of robocalls  again. Unfortunately, nearly everyone in the United States has been on  the receiving end of dozens and dozens of robocalls.   It is time we finally take action to empower telecom providers to  help put a stop to this and to hold those responsible accountable for  these actions. That is why this bill, which builds upon the bipartisan  work of the Energy and Commerce Committee, is so important.   I want to thank my colleagues in the Energy and Commerce Committee  for working with our friends in the Senate to get this completed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support this bill.
