 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is hard to keep up with Donald Trump,  particularly his Big Lie. Like the coronavirus, it is constantly  mutating.   A couple days ago, I read that one of the most vocal competitors of  that Big Lie, Mike Lindell, the MyPillow Guy, has pulled all his  advertising from FOX News. Why? Because FOX refused to sell him airtime  for a commercial repeating the dangerous, discredited lie that the  Presidential election was stolen. It is hard to imagine what level of  conspiracy craziness it takes for even FOX Network to say that goes too  far, but we have reached that point when it comes to the MyPillow Guy.   I don't know how Mr. MyPillow is going to peddle his products now.  Maybe he will stand on the street corner handing out flyers next to one  of those blow-up, scarecrow balloons that gyrates wildly in the wind.  At this point, it is hard to rule anything out.   But there is another development on the Big Lie that is far darker  and more disturbing. According to recent published reports, former  President Donald Trump is now denouncing the brave police officers who  testified last week before the select committee in the House about the  mob insurrection on January 6 in this Chamber, in this Capitol. He is  disparaging them with a word which I will not repeat.   His attacks on these officers is reprehensible and inexcusable and  totally predictable. These officers and hundreds more battled a  murderous mob sent to the Capitol by President Donald Trump to overturn  an election. He sent that mob to attack this Capitol and American  democracy because he couldn't bear the shame of losing. He wanted to  overturn the election and cling to power like a tin-pot dictator. The  police officers he now denounces still bear the wounds from the  insurrection he ordered. Some other Trump supporters have attacked at  least one of the police officers who testified as a ``crisis actor.''   This morning's New York Times has an article by Maureen Dowd, which I  would like to quote from. She is speaking of Laura Ingraham, one of the  political pundits on FOX Network. It says:         Laura Ingraham even gave awards--``Best Exaggerated       Performance,'' ``Best Political Performance'' . . . `'for the       Performance in an Action Role''--to the police who recounted       their terrifying battles with the mob. ``They came across as       political actors,'' Ingraham said. ``That doesn't help       anything. We want the police to be just police.''        Even as Ingraham was describing as ``actors'' those cops       who faced danger, Erin Smith was trying to get the death of       her husband, a veteran Washington patrolman--the second       officer to take his life after the insurrection--reclassified       from a suicide to a death in the line of duty.        After he was hit in the head with a metal pole during the       rampage, he fell into a dark depression, his wife told The       Times. On the way to his shift, he pulled his car off the       George Washington Parkway and killed himself with his service       weapon.        More than casting the police who told their stories as       drama queens and fabulists, four House Republicans,       representing the ``dregs of Congress''--    In Maureen Dowd's words--         turned up at a Washington jail on Thursday to shine a light       on the plight of insurrection suspects. One of them,       Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona, hailed them as       ``political prisoners.''        Since when do Republicans care more about criminals in jail       than the cops who put them there? Since when do they coddle       domestic terrorists?        Since Donald Trump.    There was a point decades ago where, in desperation to stop the  ravings of a Senator from Wisconsin, a man named Joseph Welch said to  the Senator: Have you no shame? At long last, have you no shame?   That is what Joseph Welch famously asked Senator Joseph McCarthy when  McCarthy tried to turn his vicious smear campaign against members of  the U.S. Army after his lies had already broken the lives of so many  Americans.   Now an angry, embittered ex-President is turning his vicious smear  tactics against a different group of democracy's defenders. It is  pointless to ask if the former President feels shame or decency or  empathy. We learned long ago that he is incapable of such feelings.   So I ask my Republican colleagues: What do you say? At long last,  will you  [[Page S5235]]  tell the former President ``enough''? ``no more''? ``you have gone too  far''? ``this must stop''?   You were all here on January 6, as I was. You know those Capitol  Police and Metropolitan Police risked their lives to defend you and me.  Will you now defend them when they are being smeared so scandalously   We are here on a Sunday, working to pass a historic bipartisan plan  to build the backbone of a strong 21st century economy that benefits  all Americans. Can't we also have a bipartisan backbone to defend the  men and women who defended the Capitol on January 6?   A few minutes ago, I walked into the building. They were there. You  know they are going to be there to protect you, the men and women of  the Capitol Police. Theirs is a dangerous job now, more dangerous  because of January 6. We salute them for their bravery, and those who  have questioned that bravery have really gone too far.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another topic, the most frustrating  aspect of America's COVID response isn't that we are being asked to  wear masks again--I have my mask here--in COVID hotspots; the most  maddening part of this pandemic is that Americans could have put this  virus in their rearview mirror long ago.   We could have saved thousands of lives. Over 600,000 Americans are  dead from COVID-19. We could have prevented a great deal of the  economic pain this pandemic has inflicted on America's families and  businesses. We are here now, battling a new surge and a more dangerous  strain of coronavirus, in large part, because the people with big  megaphones chose, cynically and cowardly and cruelly, to spread doubt  and denial about this virus and the vaccines that prevent it. Their  lies cost lives.   Fortunately, this past week seems to mark a turning point for  America. Leaders in both the public and private sectors are stepping up  for the common good and requiring their workers to get vaccinated or to  get tested regularly to show they are not sick and not a danger to  others. If you want the job, get the jab. It is time.   President Biden also announced that all Federal workers must get  vaccinated or tested. I commend his decision. That is leadership, and  it will save lives.   And to some who come to the floor of the Senate and to other places  to say that the government should operate more like a business, take  note: Some of the most innovative employers--Google, Netflix, Disney-- have also announced that their workers will have to be vaccinated, and  there will be more.   Recently, several of our Republican colleagues took to the floor of  the Senate. They even invited over their fan club from the House. They  lined up right behind the speakers over on the Republican side of the  aisle. And they are very strong in their feelings that the Speaker of  the House should not require Members to wear masks.   Well, there is a reason for it, and the suggestion that the CDC has  flip-flopped or that Dr. Fauci has flip-flopped belies the reality that  the virus has flip-flopped. We are now dealing with something known as  a Delta variant.   There is an urgent message for all Americans who have not been  vaccinated: While you have been avoiding vaccination or waiting for  just the right moment, the enemy--the COVID-19 virus--has not been  idle. The Delta variant has arrived in a big and deadly way.   Here is what Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the Director of the CDC, said:         The Delta variant is more aggressive . . . more       [transferable] than previously circulating strains. It is one       of the most infectious respiratory [viruses] we know of . . .       in my 20-year career.    Now, in case you dismiss Dr. Walensky as some nonsense-talking  Democratic Socialist and you prefer the expertise of Tucker Carlson or  Laura Ingraham on FOX, I hope you will not ignore the grim reality in  the actual numbers: Over 90 percent of those infected, hospitalized,  and dying from the coronavirus Delta variant are unvaccinated--over 90  percent. People infected by the coronavirus Delta variant may carry  1,000 times--1,000 times--as much virus and for a longer period of time  as those who were infected with the original coronavirus. Those  infected were more than twice as likely to be hospitalized than those  infected by the original coronavirus.   Vaccines still are effective against the Delta variant and  coronavirus. But don't believe, if you are unvaccinated, that you are  safe around vaccinated people. Early new data shows that fully  vaccinated people may be able to spread the Delta variant to others as  readily as unvaccinated people.   In fact, it gets down to the very basics: Until America decides to  make vaccination part of our survival, we will continue, sadly, to  witness infections; hospitalizations; and deaths and, God forbid, more  variants.   Leaders in both public and private sectors are stepping up. We should  too. People should be tested regularly, if they insist on not being  vaccinated, to show that they are not sick and not a danger to others.  The COVID vaccines are safe, free, readily available, and almost  miraculously effective, and they are the way out of this pandemic.   One more point about COVID protection: Many on the right are spitting  mad and filled with feigned confusion about the CDC's new guidance  urging people in COVID hotspots to wear masks indoors even if you are  vaccinated.   They say: How can we trust an Agency that keeps changing its rules?   Because the virus is changing and the guidance is changing  accordingly. The virus has mutated and gained strength because tens of  millions of Americans have refused to wear masks or get vaccinated.   Deliberate distortion and outraged speeches aren't going to stop the  virus. If you want to take off the mask for good--and I sure do--if you  want your kids to go to school without being burdened by a mask--and I  certainly do--we need to tell the truth. Listen to the experts. Get the  vaccine. Getting this virus behind us for good is the only way we can  reopen America's economy.   In the longer term, the way to remain the world's preeminent economy  is to invest in the fundamentals of strong, sustainable growth and  shared prosperity.   It is good that the Senate is debating this plan. I hope that it  passes this week as soon as possible, as well as our budget resolution.  But in the meantime, we cannot ignore that the Nation is still in the  throes of a pandemic.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a courtroom.
