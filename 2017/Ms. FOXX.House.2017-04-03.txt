 Mr. Speaker, last month I had the privilege of meeting Lisa  and Chad Smith and their charming son Jamil during a visit to Newland,  North Carolina, in the Fifth District.   The Smiths are the proprietors of Forage Soaps, which began in 2014  with a $50 purchase of supplies and a trip to the Avery County Farmers  Market to sell their first batch of wild-crafted soaps made in their  kitchen. Wild-crafted refers to plants collected from their natural or  indigenous habitat. The Smiths handpicked these botanicals fresh from  the trail with minimal environmental impact to ensure long-term  sustainability.   Well, that first batch turned into a second batch and a third batch,  and so on. As they continued to make soap, they bought better equipment  and invested in larger orders of supplies. Word spread about their  soap, and before they knew it, the Smiths were receiving invitations to  attend craft and artisan shows. They were invited to put their soap in  several local galleries, and it wasn't long before they were filling  their first wholesale order.   Today their business includes a retail location that also functions  as their studio as well as several small satellite locations and an  online store. Chad works for Mountain Electric Cooperative full time,  and Lisa has a master's degree in organic chemistry and biology. She  has been making soap for more than 20 years.   The Smiths adopted Jamil when he was 18 months old. They were told he  would never be able to speak and may never be able to walk. Today he  does both and is attending school and thriving with their loving care.  He even helps out with the business, where he loves to mix oils and  wild-craft herbs. Their older children help with deliveries and during  special events, while their grandchildren like to come on weekends to  help stock shelves and run the cash register. It is truly a family  affair.   Lisa likes to say she and Chad built their business one bar of soap  at a time. They didn't take out business loans or expect to be an  overnight success. Instead, they started small and grew a little bit at  a time, working long, hard hours, and eventually reinvesting in their  business.   The Smiths are living proof that one can achieve the American Dream  through hard work. It is an honor to represent them in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).                            The Florida Everglades     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
