 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank Imam  Sulieman for offering the opening prayer before the House of  Representatives and to recognize the commencement of Ramadan, the  Muslim holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal. He offers counsel  and religious guidance to many Muslims in my district and throughout  the north Texas region.   We are fortunate to live in a nation that embraces religious  diversity and interfaith understanding. I am proud to have introduced a  resolution to recognize the commencement of Ramadan and to commend the  Muslim community in the United States and throughout the world for  their faith.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I want to voice my support for H.R.  986, the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019.   This legislation will rescind the administration's October 2018  Section 1332 waiver guidance, which is an essential step to protect  pre-existing conditions and prevent the loss of comprehensive coverage  plans. We will ensure that our constituents will be able to access the  essential health benefits guaranteed under the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act.   As representatives of Americans from all corners of our country, we  have a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable in our  communities. We must ensure that our constituents, many with pre- existing conditions, are not placed at risk of losing their health  insurance coverage or fall victim to plans which fail to offer  essential health benefits.   As the first registered nurse elected to the United States Congress,  I am proud to safeguard the healthcare of my constituents and all  Americans through my support of the Protecting Americans with  Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
