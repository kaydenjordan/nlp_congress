 Mr. President, on Saturday, June 29, 2019,  more than 125 members of the Class of 1969 of Walt Whitman High School  in Bethesda, MD, held their 50th graduation class reunion celebration.  Over the years, Walt Whitman High School has been recognized as one of  the best high schools in the Nation. The WWHS class of 1969 is an  outstanding representation of that excellence.   The Mighty Sixty-Niners, as they call themselves, have earned the  characterization of ``mighty.'' From its beginning in 1962, Walt  Whitman High School was experimental and forward-looking. The original  school setting included a Buckminster Fuller-type geodesic dome that  served as the school's main gymnasium and auditorium and as its unique  visual focal point. For years afterwards, WWHS was locally and proudly  known as ``The Home of the Dome.''   The WWHS class of 1969 contributed much to the rich history of the  school. In 1968, a time of heightened racial tensions throughout the  country, Whitman students and faculty established an exchange program  with several high schools in the District of Columbia. Participating  Whitman students lived for a week and attended classes at DC's McKinley  High School and Cardozo High School. The following week, the McKinley  and Cardozo students spent a week at WWHS with their Whitman  counterparts. Those exchanges helped develop greater understanding  between the participants.   The WWHS class of 1969 also instituted a weeklong Experiment in Free  Form Education. This novel educational program gained nationwide media  attention and accolades, including a tribute on the floor of the U.S.  Senate on April 25, 1969, by then-U.S. Senator Joseph Tydings of  Maryland.   The Mighty Sixty-Niners have served our Nation in many productive  ways, and they continue to do so, excelling in many fields--the arts,  politics, government, education, literature, engineering, law, business  and publishing, among others.   I ask my colleagues to join me in sending our very best wishes and  congratulations to the Walt Whitman High  [[Page S5310]]  School class of 1969 on the occasion of its 50th reunion.                            ____________________
