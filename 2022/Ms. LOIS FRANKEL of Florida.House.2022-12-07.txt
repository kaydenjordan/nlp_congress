 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the third grade classes at Landon School.   In the class of Ms. Brown is my nephew, Jake, who, like his fellow  classmates, works very hard to treat others with respect and honor.   That is one of the important principles of Landon because Landon  holds firmly to the conviction that character matters, and they aim to  graduate students who will positively impact their communities.   The Landon third graders are off to a good start, recently finishing  a unit on the three branches of government.   I am honored they have asked me to join them over Zoom to tell them  about what it is like being a Member of Congress.   I applaud Landon students for showing interest in the important work  of serving in government, and I expect, Madam Speaker, that one day  some of them will end up right here, speaking at the podium. Go Bears.                            ____________________
