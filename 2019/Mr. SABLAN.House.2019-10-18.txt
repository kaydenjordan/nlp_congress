 Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Democrats on the House  Energy and Commerce Committee agree that now is the time to fix  Medicaid funding in the insular areas.   H.R. 2328, reported out of the committee in July, addresses the  serious funding shortfall all the insular areas face now that special  ObamaCare Medicaid funding for our areas has ended.   In the Marianas, this special funding has kept our only hospital  open, and is a significant source of revenue for doctors in private  practice, pharmacists, and an array of healthcare providers.   Take this funding away, and not only low-income families that qualify  for Medicaid will suffer, but everyone at every income level who  depends on those doctors, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers  will lose service.   The insular areas have reached the Medicaid cliff, but we have a  solution. Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden, and all of the  Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee agree: Let us bring H.R.  2328 to the floor.   Show that the House is united and fix the insular area Medicaid  funding cliff.                            ____________________
