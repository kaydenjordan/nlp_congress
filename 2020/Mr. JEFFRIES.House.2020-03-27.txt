 Mr. Speaker, America is the wealthiest country in the  history of the world. We also have assembled the mightiest military.  But you cannot judge the greatness of America based on our wealth or  our military might. We should only judge the greatness of America based  on how we stand up for the least, the lost, and the left behind.   The CARES Act is legislation that will help provide relief to the  most vulnerable amongst us. It will provide relief to everyday  Americans. It will provide relief to small businesses. It will provide  relief to displaced workers.   The coronavirus is a silent assassin and has targeted the American  people. But we are a resilient nation. We defeated the Great  Depression. We defeated Nazi Germany. We defeated Jim Crow. We will  defeat COVID-19 as well.
