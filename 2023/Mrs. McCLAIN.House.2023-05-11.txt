 Mr. Speaker, it is hard to believe that after 2 years  of record-breaking migrant encounters at the southern border, things  continue to get worse with absolutely no end in sight.   I always say, to fix a problem, you first have to admit there is a  problem. But the guy who is supposed to be in charge, the leader of  border security, just cannot admit there is a problem.   DHS Secretary Mayorkas has time and time again failed to take  responsibility, as the leader, as the boss, as the man in charge. He  has the audacity to tell MSNBC that the open border is Congress' fault,  and that Congress should do something about it.   Okay. Well, then I think it is time to do something about it. Let's  impeach Secretary Mayorkas. His blatant failures have resulted in the  deaths of American citizens and has made fentanyl the number one killer  of 18- to 45-year-olds.   Enough is enough. We need real leadership, not some Biden puppet.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today calling for the impeachment of  Secretary Mayorkas.                            ____________________
