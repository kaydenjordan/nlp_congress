 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the  amendment be modified in the form I have placed at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the consideration of what  was two amendments that we just merged into one because they went hand- in-glove.   My amendment restores critical funding to three additional  Appalachian States, the same number of States currently funded by the  Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, for the reclamation of abandoned mine  lands in conjunction with economic and community development and reuse  goals.   Now, let me explain the program quickly.   This was the brainchild of Chairman Rogers a couple of years back,  and what the idea was, originally, when they did the Abandoned Mine  Land program, you could just restore the land. They came up with the  concept in the hard-hit devastated areas of central Appalachia that we  should not only allow it to be a restoration of the land, but that that  land could be used and looked at as an economic purpose, a reuse the  community could use for community development or economic development,  and that was important.   Funding for these reclamation grants was first established in fiscal  year 2016, but it was originally provided only to the three Appalachian  States with the greatest amount of unfunded reclamation needs.   Unfortunately, that didn't, of course, reach all the States, and so  last year, an additional three States were added, those States being  Virginia, Ohio, Alabama, the original three being Pennsylvania, West  Virginia, and Kentucky.   This year, as things were working through, Virginia, Ohio, and  Alabama were not currently included. My amendment basically makes sure  they are included. We have worked with the team on the Appropriations  Committee to word it correctly. We think we have got it worded  correctly so that we now have the ability to add in all three States.   I think this is important. Folks often say to us: Those of you in  coal country, in central Appalachia, need to transition your economy.  Well, we can't transition our economy if we have huge blocks of land  which we can't use because they are unusable due to prior acts that  left them in a condition where we know they need to be reclaimed, but  you can't reclaim them looking at economic development.   So this is a way to retool. Chairman Rogers came up with it. We would  like to extend it to the other States that would be greatly helped by  this, the three that I mentioned previously, Ohio, Alabama, and  Virginia, and that is what my amendments do.   I would ask all to support this amendment to help those areas that  are economically devastated in central Appalachia and expand on a  program which is already showing signs of success.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to help us transition  the economy in central Appalachian support to the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
