 Mr. President, first of all, I rise to speak in favor  of the Senate confirming Senator Sessions to the position of Attorney  General, chief law enforcement officer of our country, but I do want to  say thank you to the Democratic minority of my committee because they  did not boycott the meetings. They debated. They debated too long, from  my point of view, but they debated, and we were able to do our work in  a businesslike way. So I want to thank all of them for their  participation.   Now I will take a few minutes to speak in strong support of my friend  and our colleague Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as the 84th Attorney  General.   Last week, the Judiciary Committee spent over 6 hours debating the  nomination. Every single Democrat opposed the nomination, but this  wasn't, of course, much of a surprise. During our committee debate,  Senator Graham correctly pointed out that, based on the standard the  Democrats established, it appears no Republican could ever earn their  support.   It is no secret that our Democratic colleagues don't like the new  President. They are doing what they can do to undermine the new  administration.   With respect to Senator Sessions, my Democratic colleagues disagree  with a number of policy positions he has taken over the years, but this  year seems to be unlike previous administrations, where Senators  supported Cabinet nominees even if they disagreed with the nominee on  policy grounds. That is what happened in 2009, when Senator Sessions  and I both supported Eric Holder for Attorney General, even though we  disagreed with him on many policies.   So after listening to all the reasons they are opposing this  nomination, I can boil their objections down to these points:   Even though many of my colleagues have known this good man for years,  even though many of my colleagues have worked closely with him to pass  important bipartisan legislation, even though many of them have praised  him in the past for his integrity and for being a man of his word, even  though Senator Sessions has pledged to support and defend all laws  passed by Congress, even those he disagrees with, when it comes time to  stand up in support of this good man, they are unwilling to take him at  his word.   This is very troubling because all of us in the Senate know Jeff  Sessions. Some of us have known him for decades. Regardless of what my  colleagues are willing to admit publicly, we all know him to be a man  of deep integrity, a man of his word, and a man committed to fairness,  to justice, and, most importantly, to the rule of law.   We all know that when Senator Sessions served as an assistant U.S.  attorney, as a U.S. attorney, and as attorney general for his home  State of Alabama, he worked hard to promote the rule of law and to  bring justice to both victims and perpetrators. We know he has a deep  commitment to the rule of law, something an Attorney General must  possess or he could not be the chief law enforcement officer of the  United States. In other words, that law or that position is all about  carrying out and having a commitment to the rule of law. As I said,  much of Senator Sessions' hearing focused on his record as a  legislator.   Now, it is true Senator Sessions has voted on legislation in ways  that the left doesn't like, and of course I have even disagreed with  him from time to time, but we all understand that every time we cast a  vote, we are voting the way we see as the best for our country. I think  we all also understand that very rarely is any bill a so-called perfect  piece of legislation.   At one time or another, every single Member of this body has opposed  legislation based upon a principle objection to a particular provision.   So, of course, Senator Sessions has voted differently than his  Democratic colleagues. Now, that is common sense. That is to be  expected. This is the Senate. We are all about debating policy and for  long periods of time. That is how the Senate works.   We all know the role of an Senator and the role of Attorney General  are very, very different. A legislator debates policy and votes on  legislation. The Attorney General enforces the laws, as enacted. All of  us in the Senate understand that difference. Senator Sessions  understands the difference better than most.   In addition to serving as a Senator for 20 years, he served in the  Department of Justice for 15 years, a Department dedicated to law  enforcement and to the rule of law and following what Congress directs  law to be.   I am disappointed in my colleagues who have suggested Senator  Sessions will not be able to put aside his policy differences that he  established here in the United States and enforce the law, even if he  voted against that law.   This is especially troubling after he specifically committed to us  during this confirmation hearing that if he is confirmed, he will  follow the law, regardless of whether he supported that statute as a  policy matter.   The criteria for this nomination is, will this man, whose integrity  is beyond reproach, enforce the law as he said he will?   Senator Sessions answered that question directly during his hearing.  He stated this:         The Justice Department must remain ever faithful to the       Constitution's promise that our government is one of laws and       not of men. It will be my unyielding commitment to you, if       confirmed, to see that the laws are enforced faithfully,       effectively, and impartially.    He goes on to say:         The Attorney General must hold everyone, no matter how       powerful, accountable. No one is above the law, and no       American will be beneath its protection.    Now, whether he said those things one time or dozens of times--and it  is more apt to be dozens of times during the day and a half of hearings  that we had on him, plus the speeches that were given--it can't be much  clearer than what he just said.   But even after he made this promise, Members asked Senator Sessions  if he would defend the laws that he had voted against, and he answered  in the affirmative, stating:         I would defend the statute if it is reasonably defensible.       It is passed by Congress, it would be the duty of the       Attorney General, whether they voted for it or support it, to       defend it.    He was questioned about a host of hot-button policy issues. Time and  again, his answer was the same. He will enforce the law. This will  actually be quite different from the Obama administration, which  refused to enforce laws it didn't like. They did this while the people  who are now in the minority--the Democrats--turned a blind eye when  they didn't enforce the law.   Senator Sessions also made clear that he possesses the independence  necessary for the Attorney General. I have often heard Senator Sessions  ask Executive nominees, including nominees for Attorney General,  whether they will have the fortitude to stand up to the President who  appointed them. So I asked him the same question during my time of  questioning in the committee. I asked if he will be able to say no to  President Trump, and he said:         I understand the importance of your question, I understand       the responsibility of the Attorney General, and I will do so.       You simply have to help the President do things that he might       desire in a lawful way and have to be able to say, ``No,''       both for the country, for the legal system, and for the       President to avoid situations that are not acceptable. I       understand that duty. I have observed it through my years       here, and I will fulfill that responsibility.    Senator Sessions' commitment to be independent from the President  when it is necessary and his promise to enforce the law is exactly what  this Nation needs right now. We haven't seen much of this over the past  8 years.   The Department has been politicized over the past 8 years, and that  has caused great harm. The leadership of the Department of Justice has  undermined our confidence in the rule of law by picking and choosing  which laws it will enforce. I am looking forward to turning a new page  at the Department under our friend's leadership as Attorney General. It  is desperately needed, particularly at this time.  [[Page S826]]    Last weekend, in particular, it showed us how critical it is to have  someone leading the Department who is committed to following the law.  Last week, then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates announced that she  wouldn't present arguments in defense of the President's recent  Executive order, even though she admitted there was a defense to be  made. As soon as she did this, Democrats ran to her defense and sang  her praises, but after Senator Sessions' hearing, I would have expected  Democrats to come to the opposite conclusion. During his hearing, they  asked Senator Sessions whether he would enforce a law that he didn't  like over and over and over. But last week, Ms. Yates refused to  enforce a law--why?--because she didn't like it, and the Democrats  lauded her ``bravery'' and ``courage.''   They lauded her ``courage.''   Now, let's be very clear. She didn't say that she can't  constitutionally defend the President's order or offer good-faith  defenses of its legality in the court. Instead, this is what--she  explained her decision by saying her job is not the same as the job in  the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel. She said,  importantly, OLC, meaning Office of Legal Counsel, does not address  whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive order is wise or  just. That seems to suggest, of course, that the decision on whether to  defend an Executive order or statute in court turns on whether the  Attorney General believes the law or order is wise or just. But with  all respect to Ms. Yates, that wasn't her job. The Department's job is  to enforce the law, just like Senator Sessions, becoming Attorney  General, said he would enforce the law. Ms. Yates' obligation was  clear. If she couldn't defend the order in good conscience, the only  proper course was to resign.   This unfortunate situation with Ms. Yates highlights why it is  important to swiftly move to confirm an Attorney General who will be  faithful to the Constitution and uphold the law regardless of policy  preferences.   Ultimately, it comes down to this: There is no one more qualified  than Jeff Sessions for this position. He served in the Department for  15 years. He served as attorney general for his home State of Alabama,  and for 20 years he served on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has  oversight over the Department of Justice.   We all know Senator Sessions is a man of his word. We all know he  will enforce all the laws on the books, regardless of whether he  supported them. Both Republicans and Democrats know he will make an  excellent Attorney General, and the Nation will be served well by his  appointment. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the  nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Armed Services be authorized to meet during the session of  the Senate on Tuesday, February 7, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Foreign Relations be authorized to meet during the session  of the Senate on Tuesday, February 7, 2017, at 10 a.m.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be authorized to meet during the session  of the Senate on Tuesday, February 7, 2017, off the Senate floor  immediately following the vote scheduled at 12 p.m.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence be authorized to meet during the  session of the 115th Congress of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, February  7, 2017, from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., in room SH-219 of the Senate Hart  Office Building.    Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion about  Senator Sessions' nomination on this floor in the last 24 hours. Before  we vote, I want to offer a couple of observations about the unfairness  in some of the statements.   First, I was hoping to limit my remarks to all of the reasons why I  believe Senator Sessions will make an outstanding Attorney General, but  instead I feel very compelled to say a few words about some of the  attacks that have been leveled against Senator Sessions here on the  floor, where he has served the people of Alabama faithfully for 20  years.   A number of Senators have come to the floor to talk about Senator  Sessions' hearing in 1986 when he was nominated to be a Federal judge.  Now, it happens that I was in the Senate in 1986, at that time by 6  years. I was on the Judiciary Committee in 1986, by that time for 6  years, and I want you to know I saw what happened. I don't have time to  go into all the details here, but I will tell you this: Jeff Sessions'  hearing in 1986 was an absolute ambush. In fact, it was a planned  ambush. He was unfairly attacked then and he is being unfairly attacked  now. I will give just two examples.   First, in the last 24 hours, we have heard Senator Sessions attacked  for a voting rights case that he pursued as U.S. attorney in Alabama.  We have heard a lot about that case. Of course, those who have raised  the Perry County trial don't tell you Senator Sessions was actually  asked to pursue that case by two African-American candidates who  believed that ballots cast by African-American voters had been altered.  The bottom line is that he was vindicating the voting rights of  African-American voters whose voting rights had been compromised.   Second, we have heard Senator Sessions criticized for testimony in  his 1986 Judiciary Committee hearing about the Voting Rights Act. It  has been said on this floor and it has been said repeatedly that Jeff  Sessions called the Voting Rights Act ``intrusive,'' but those speaking  in the last 24 hours don't know what he actually said. He did use the  word ``intrusive,'' but then he said the Department of Justice had to  do it ``because it would not have happened any other way.''   He said further: ``Federal intervention was essential in the South.''  He said it was an intrusive piece of legislation ``because it was a  necessary piece of legislation, I support it.'' That is right. He said  the Voting Rights Act ``was a necessary piece of legislation, I support  it.'' That is what he said. But if you have been listening the last 24  hours--you wouldn't know any of that by listening to those who have  come to the floor and talked all about that case in 1986.   Like I said, I was here way back then. I saw what happened to that  man who is going to be our next Attorney General, who would go on to  join the Senate for these 20-some years and become our colleague and  our friend. So you can understand why it is very frustrating to me to  listen to all of those attacks, and it is particularly frustrating to  hear it from Members who were not even here in 1986.   With that, let me just say this in closing: Senator Sessions has  served with us for 20 years. Every Member of this body knows him to be  a man of integrity. Almost all of us have been on the other side of a  policy debate with Senator Sessions at one time or another. I know I  have. What we know from those debates is that whether Senator Sessions  agrees with you or not on any policy question, he handles the debate  fairly, he handles the debate respectfully, and he handles the debate  honorably.   Senator Sessions answered our questions in the Judiciary Committee  for 10 long hours. He gave us his word on the critical issues that  should decide our vote on this nomination. Most of that was centered  around the fact that he is a man devoted to the law, and he is devoted  as the chief law enforcement officer of our country to enforce the law,  even if he didn't vote for it and even if he disagreed with it.    We know from the questioning that Senator Sessions will be  independent when he said when he has to say no to the President of the  United States, he will say no to the President of the United States. We  know Senator Sessions then, as I have said, will enforce the law  faithfully, without regard to person, for all Americans.   Motivated by those principles, Senator Sessions will make a very fine  Attorney General, and most people in this body know that--even those  who are going to vote against him.   I am pleased to cast my vote in favor of his nomination, and of  course I urge my colleagues to do the same thing.   I yield the floor.
