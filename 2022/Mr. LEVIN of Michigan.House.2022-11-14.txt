 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  bill, H.R. 7518, designating the post office at 23200 John R Road in  Hazel Park, Michigan, as the Roy E. Dickens Post Office.   Roy Dickens was a U.S. Army vet and longtime resident of Hazel Park,  Michigan, where he was deeply involved in the community. He joined the  Hazel Park Police Department in 1967 and served as an officer for 28  years, but Mr. Dickens was not finished. Following his tenure at the  police department, he went on to serve proudly as a court officer for  another 15 years until he retired in 2010.   Roy Dickens worked for the city of Hazel Park for 43 years. That  makes him the longest-serving employee in the history of the city, a  record he holds posthumously to this very day.   Mr. Dickens was known in southeast Michigan as a public servant,  community leader, and good neighbor to all. He made a positive impact  in the lives of those around him in so many ways and is remembered  fondly by many people--first and foremost, his beloved wife, Marilyn,  and children, Gina and David.   Roy Dickens left a legacy as a pillar of the Hazel Park community and  someone who embodied the essence of public service. I am proud to honor  him for generations to come with this post office dedication.   I thank Hazel Park Mayor Michael Webb, City Manager Ed Klobucher, and  other civic leaders for collaborating with me on choosing the very best  recipient for this honor. From this day forward, the post office on  John R will remind residents of Hazel Park and surrounding towns of an  unassuming leader who helped ensure the safety, peace, and tranquility  of the community for everyone, Roy Dickens.                                time  1800
