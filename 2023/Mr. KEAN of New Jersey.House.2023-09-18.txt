 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life and  service of Captain David Wallace, a United States Navy veteran and  permanent military professor, who passed away at the age of 48 on  Monday, December 26, 2022.   David was born in Stockton, New Jersey. He attended the U.S. Naval  Academy, USNA, in Annapolis, Maryland, where he earned a bachelor of  science degree in economics in 1996. He later returned to the USNA and  earned a master of science degree in information technology management  from the Naval Postgraduate School.   David served in the Navy on Active Duty for over 20 years as a  surface warfare officer. He served aboard the USS John S. McCain, the  USS Hayler, and USS Mustin. In 2012, he commanded Coastal Riverine  Group 2 Detachment Bahrain and Task Group 56.11 in Manama, Bahrain.                                time  1215    On shore, David worked at U.S. Joint Forces Command assessing and  developing practices in humanitarian assistance, counterinsurgency  operations, foreign internal defense, and stability operations. He also  served as deputy director for professional development at the USNA from  2010 to 2011.   In 2013, David was selected for the USNA Permanent Military Professor  program, earning his Ph.D. in industrial-organizational psychology in  2017 from George Mason University.   Since 2020, David has served as the department chair of the USNA  Leadership, Ethics, and Law Department, LEL, while also working as  adjunct faculty at the George Mason University and the University of  Maryland, Baltimore County, teaching graduate courses.   David was a highly decorated veteran earning the Defense Meritorious  Service Medal, three Navy Commendation Medals, two Navy Achievement  Medals, and numerous unit, campaign, and service awards.   In 2022, David received a nomination by the LEL Department for the  USNA Military Professor Teaching Award, his second Meritorious Service  Medal and his promotion to associate professor.  [[Page H4355]]    Above all, professionally, David loved fostering the spirit of  leadership in the Navy and throughout his career.   Outside of his career, David loved to pursue his hobbies of sailing,  boating, and home improvement with his wife, Valerie.   Last December, David tragically lost his 2-year battle with cancer. I  am grateful for his service and dedication to educating future military  leaders. In recognition of his exemplary service, David was  posthumously promoted to the rank of captain on April 25, 2023.   He is survived by his wife, Valerie, with whom he shared 25 years of  marriage and his three daughters, Savannah, Madeline, and Emma. May his  memory be a blessing to his family, to his colleagues in the Navy, and  to his community.                            ____________________
