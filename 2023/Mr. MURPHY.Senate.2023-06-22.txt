 Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that, prior  to the scheduled vote, I be permitted to speak for 10 minutes, Senator  Marshall for 5 minutes, Senator Kennedy for 10 minutes, and Senator  Schumer for 2 minutes.    Mr. President, America is crying out for this Congress to  do something about the epidemic of mass shootings. We average more than  a mass shooting a day right now. Kids are living in fear when they walk  into school. People don't know where the next shooter is coming from.  No place seems safe.   So what is the Senate Republicans' answer to this paralyzing fear and  anxiety that Americans have about mass shootings?   Their answer today is to put a resolution before the floor of the  Senate that would make legal a new class of semiautomatic rifles that  has been banned for 100 years because they are too dangerous.   So the answer to the mass shooting crisis in this country is of more  assault rifles, more dangerous weapons, and taking a class of weapons  that has been illegal for a century and putting them on the open  market.   That is outrageous, and it is completely removed from the  conversation that families and kids are having all across this country.  Instead of taking dangerous assault weapons off the streets, this  resolution would put more of them into the commercial marketplace.   I want to talk for a few minutes today about how dangerous this  resolution is and to ask my Republican colleagues to vote with us--to  vote with us--against this resolution so that we can protect our  families and our kids from criminal acts and mass shootings.   For almost a century, the law has treated different types, certain  types, of firearms differently than others; namely, those that Congress  has seen as more dangerous and more closely associated with violent  crime. Short-barreled rifles are in that category. They are more  transportable and concealable than long rifles. They have a longer  range, greater accuracy, and more firepower than pistols. It is kind of  the perfect recipe for criminals. That is, in part, why they are more  highly regulated than your standard handgun or your standard hunting  rifle or even an AR- or AK-style assault rifle.   To own a short-barreled rifle in this country, you have to pay $200  for a tax stamp. You have to undergo a background check. You have to  register that firearm with the ATF. You can have one, but you have to  go through that process. That system--the courts have agreed--is  consistent with the Second Amendment. It allows for responsible, law- abiding citizens to acquire these dangerous weapons while keeping them  out of the hands of criminals, people who want to commit crimes with  them.   Now, what has changed?   Well, in recent decades, gun manufacturers have responded to the  widespread popularity of AR-15 rifles by selling a variant that they  call either a large-format pistol, or a heavy pistol. It is a shorter  version of an assault rifle. It has a shorter barrel, and it lacks a  shoulder stock. These guns, theoretically, can be fired one-handed, but  very few people want to do that. They are too large and heavy to  control effectively, so they haven't been very popular in the  marketplace. So the industry figured out a way to make them more  popular.    In 2012, the first stabilizing brace was created to help a disabled  veteran shoot an AR platform pistol one-handed. You kind of see a crude  version of it here. It was sort of a rubber sling that slipped over the  buffer tube at the rear of the weapon and then cinched down on the  shooter's forearm with Velcro straps. This original design solved a  very specific problem for a disabled shooter, but the gun industry saw  an opening, and it wasn't about to let that opportunity slip by.   ``The large format pistol really took off in 2014,'' says one article  in the NRA's own magazine, Shooting Illustrated. What began as this  rubber orthotic device turned into something that looked very  different. It looked exactly like a shoulder stock.   Manufacturers started designing and marketing stabilizing braces  designed for disabled individuals that would enable firing from the  shoulder--firing short-barreled rifles, essentially, from the  shoulder--and resources popped up all over the internet showing gun  enthusiasts how to use these pistol braces designed for disabled  shooters to turn their large-format pistols--not very useful--into  short-barreled, shoulder-fired weapons.   Outdoor Life said:         The AR pistol of yesteryear is not the same platform that       shooters are enjoying today for one reason: the stabilizing       brace.    To be clear, it has always been illegal--for 100 years--to modify a  large-format pistol by adding a stock or a brace for the purpose of  firing it from the shoulder without going through that process I  mentioned: getting the tax stamp, going through the background check.  Whether knowingly or unknowingly, gun owners who modified their  firearms in this way were creating short-barreled rifles. That is not  allowed under the law, but manufacturers capitalized on widespread  ignorance of the law to expand their stabilizing brace designed for  disabled shooters and selling it as something intended to be fired from  the shoulder by nondisabled individuals. Their advertising sometimes  says that they weren't intending it to be fired that way, but over and  over, you see marketing suggesting something very different.   So here is what happened. The ATF stepped in to correct this. The ATF  stepped in to eliminate this ambiguity and just make it clear that, as  you have not been able for 100 years to turn a short-barreled rifle  into something you can fire from your--you can't take a pistol and use  one of these braces to fire from your shoulder, that that needs to be  the rule and the regulation going forward. So the ATF steps in with a  pretty simple rule that basically says: If a brace-equipped pistol  looks like a rifle, fires like a rifle, if the people who made it are  trying to sell it as a rifle, then it is a rifle.   There is no ban on these braces or on weapons equipped with them,  even short-barreled rifles. You just have to abide by the law to  acquire one, which means a tax stamp, a background check, and  registration. All we are doing, all the ATF is doing, is essentially  reaffirming what has been the law for 100 years. If you want a short- barreled rifle or you want to convert a pistol into a short-barreled  rifle, you just have to go through that process. Get the tax stamp, go  through the background check, and register the gun.   At the same time, there is nothing in this rule to prevent a disabled  veteran who wants to equip a pistol with a true stabilizing brace that  is not designed to fire the weapon from the shoulder from doing exactly  that or to prevent a manufacturer from selling a stabilizing brace  designed to satisfy those specific needs of the market. But this isn't  what the gun industry has been selling. The gun industry hasn't been  selling true stabilizing braces to disable veterans; they have been  selling an ability to convert a pistol into a short-barreled rifle.   The opponents of this rule will tell you that it is an  unconstitutional gun grab. They are not likely to tell you that it is  just law enforcement doing their job and enforcing a law Congress made  almost a century ago. The courts have upheld Congress's authority to  regulate some firearms more stringently than others because they are  especially dangerous or unusual, which is  [[Page S2203]]  why there is no unrestricted right to own a machine gun or a sawed-off  shotgun or a short-barreled rifle no matter how it becomes a short- barreled rifle.   When Congress passed the National Firearms Act, it chose to regulate  these dangerous firearms by taxing them and requiring registration.  Courts have agreed: Possession of an unregistered short-barreled rifle  poses a danger to the community.   Events have borne this out. Over the last 5 years, unregistered arm- brace-equipped guns have been used in high-profile mass shootings in  Dayton, in Boulder, and in Colorado Springs. Mass shooters like these  unregistered arm-brace-equipped guns.   This is a good rule. It doesn't make any new law; it merely helps to  enforce a law that has been on the books for almost a century. The ATF  is just doing their job.   To pass this resolution would put onto the conventional commercial  marketplace a new class of dangerous, concealable assault weapons that  for 100 years we have had consensus in this country need to be  regulated in a more comprehensive way.   The ATF is doing their job, and I would urge my colleagues to oppose  this resolution.   I yield the floor.
