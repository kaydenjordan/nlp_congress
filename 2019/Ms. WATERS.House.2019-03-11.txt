 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1122) to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development to carry out a housing choice voucher mobility  demonstration to encourage families receiving such voucher assistance  to move to lower-poverty areas and expand access to opportunity areas.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1122         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Choice Voucher       Mobility Demonstration Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER MOBILITY DEMONSTRATION.         (a) Authority.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban       Development (in this section referred to as the       ``Secretary'') may carry out a mobility demonstration program       to enable public housing agencies to administer housing       choice voucher assistance under section 8(o) of the United       States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) in a manner       designed to encourage families receiving such voucher       assistance to move to lower-poverty areas and expand access       to opportunity areas.        (b) Selection of PHAs.--        (1) Requirements.--The Secretary shall establish       requirements for public housing agencies to participate in       the demonstration program under this section, which shall       provide that the following public housing agencies may       participate:        (A) Public housing agencies that together--        (i) serve areas with high concentrations of holders of       rental assistance vouchers under section 8(o) of the United       States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) in poor, low-      opportunity neighborhoods; and        (ii) have an adequate number of moderately priced rental       units in higher-opportunity areas.        (B) Planned consortia or partial consortia of public       housing agencies that--        (i) include at least one agency with a high-performing       Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program; and        (ii) will enable participating families to continue in such       program if they relocate to the jurisdiction served by any       other agency of the consortium.        (C) Planned consortia or partial consortia of public       housing agencies that--        (i) serve jurisdictions within a single region;        (ii) include one or more small agencies; and        (iii) will consolidate mobility focused operations.        (D) Such other public housing agencies as the Secretary       considers appropriate.        (2) Selection criteria.--The Secretary shall establish       competitive selection criteria for public housing agencies       eligible under paragraph (1) to participate in the       demonstration program under this section.  [[Page H2619]]         (3) Random selection of families.--The Secretary may       require participating agencies to use a randomized selection       process to select among the families eligible to receive       mobility assistance under the demonstration program.        (c) Regional Housing Mobility Plan.--The Secretary shall       require each public housing agency applying to participate in       the demonstration program under this section to submit a       Regional Housing Mobility Plan (in this section referred to       as a ``Plan''), which shall--        (1) identify the public housing agencies that will       participate under the Plan and the number of vouchers each       participating agency will make available out of their       existing programs in connection with the demonstration;        (2) identify any community-based organizations, nonprofit       organizations, businesses, and other entities that will       participate under the Plan and describe the commitments for       such participation made by each such entity;        (3) identify any waivers or alternative requirements       requested for the execution of the Plan;        (4) identify any specific actions that the public housing       agencies and other entities will undertake to accomplish the       goals of the demonstration, which shall include a       comprehensive approach to enable a successful transition to       opportunity areas and may include counseling and continued       support for families;        (5) specify the criteria that the public housing agencies       would use to identify opportunity areas under the plan;        (6) provide for establishment of priority and preferences       for participating families, including a preference for       families with young children, as such term is defined by the       Secretary, based on regional housing needs and priorities;       and        (7) comply with any other requirements established by the       Secretary.        (d) Funding for Mobility-Related Services.--        (1) Use of administrative fees.--Public housing agencies       participating in the demonstration program under this section       may use administrative fees under section 8(q) of the United       States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(q)), their       administrative fee reserves, and funding from private       entities to provide mobility-related services in connection       with the demonstration program, including services such as       counseling, portability coordination, landlord outreach,       security deposits, and administrative activities associated       with establishing and operating regional mobility programs.        (2) Use of housing assistance funds.--Public housing       agencies participating in the demonstration under this       section may use housing assistance payments funds under       section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42       U.S.C. 1437f(o)) for security deposits if necessary to enable       families to lease units with vouchers in designated       opportunity areas.        (e) Waivers; Alternative Requirements.--        (1) Waivers.--To allow for public housing agencies to       implement and administer their Regional Housing Mobility       Plans, the Secretary may waive or specify alternative       requirements for the following provisions of the United       States Housing Act of 1937:        (A) Sections 8(o)(7)(A) and 8(o)(13)(E)(i) (relating to the       term of a lease and mobility requirements).        (B) Section 8(o)(13)(C)(i) (relating to the public housing       plan for an agency).        (C) Section 8(r)(2) (relating to the responsibility of a       public housing agency to administer ported assistance).        (2) Alternative requirements.--The Secretary shall provide       additional authority for public housing agencies in a       selected region to form a consortium that has a single       housing choice voucher funding contract, or to enter into a       partial consortium to operate all or portions of the Regional       Housing Mobility Plan, including agencies participating in       the Moving To Work Demonstration program.        (3) Effective date.--Any waiver or alternative requirements       pursuant to this subsection shall not take effect before the       expiration of the 10-day period beginning upon publication of       notice of such waiver or alternative requirement in the       Federal Register.        (f) Implementation.--The Secretary may implement the       demonstration, including its terms, procedures, requirements,       and conditions, by notice.        (g) Evaluation.--Not later than 5 years after       implementation of the regional housing mobility programs       under the demonstration program under this section, the       Secretary shall submit to the Congress and publish in the       Federal Register a report evaluating the effectiveness of the       strategies pursued under the demonstration, subject to the       availability of funding to conduct the evaluation. Through       official websites and other methods, the Secretary shall       disseminate interim findings as they become available, and       shall, if promising strategies are identified, notify the       Congress of the amount of funds that would be required to       expand the testing of these strategies in additional types of       public housing agencies and housing markets.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, rigorous studies have demonstrated that giving a low- income family an opportunity to move to a lower-poverty neighborhood  can have a profound impact, particularly for children.   For example, one study found that young boys and girls in families  that used a voucher to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods were 32  percent more likely to attend college and earned 31 percent more, or  nearly $3,500 a year, compared to their counterparts in families who  did not receive a voucher.   Unfortunately, families with housing choice vouchers who want to move  to a better neighborhood can face significant challenges, particularly  if it involves moving from one public housing agency jurisdiction to  another. In fact, data shows that only one in eight families with  children with a housing choice voucher use their vouchers to live in  lower-poverty areas.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1122 would help reduce barriers to mobility by  establishing a demonstration program that would enable and incentivize  public housing agencies to come together to come up with a regional  plan to increase mobility across their jurisdictions.   This is a bipartisan proposal that was included in HUD budget  requests under the Obama administration. Further, $25 million in  funding for this demonstration was included in fiscal year 2019 funding  bill for HUD programs, and a version of this bill passed the House last  Congress 368 to 19.   This demonstration will not only provide thousands of families with  opportunities to move to better neighborhoods, but it will also lay the  foundation for how successful outcomes can be replicated at a larger  scale across the country.   I congratulate the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver) and the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) for introducing this initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1122, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Cleaver), the chair of the Subcommittee on National  Security, International Development and Monetary Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we were able to work in a  bipartisan manner on this initiative. This bill shows that we can  foster new ideas and help improve services and flexibility for our  citizens who are receiving housing assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer)  for his engagement on the bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 974) to amend the Federal Reserve Act to require the Vice  Chairman for Supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System to provide a written report, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 974         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Reserve Supervision       Testimony Clarification Act''.       SEC. 2. VICE CHAIRMAN FOR SUPERVISION REPORT REQUIREMENT.         Paragraph (12) of section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act (12       U.S.C. 247b) is amended--        (1) by redesignating such paragraph as paragraph (11); and        (2) in such paragraph--        (A) by striking ``shall appear'' and inserting ``shall       provide written testimony and appear''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following: ``If, at the time       of any appearance described in this paragraph, the position       of Vice Chairman for Supervision is vacant, the Chairman or       their designee shall appear instead and provide the required       written testimony.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H2621]]  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very straightforward piece of legislation.   It clarifies that the Vice Chairman for Supervision is required to  provide testimony along with his appearance before the committee.   Additionally, if the position is vacant, the bill makes clear that  the Chair of the Board shall appear and provide testimony on  supervision and regulation efforts.   I think it makes good sense to codify who at the Board will testify  before Congress on the status of the Fed's supervisory efforts  regardless of whether there is a person confirmed for the Vice Chairman  for Supervision or not.   When Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act, it created the position of Vice Chairman for  Supervision so that there was one Fed Board Governor who was  responsible for ensuring robust rules for the Nation's largest  financial institutions.   We now have a Vice Chairman for Supervision at the Fed, but the  position had previously been vacant since its creation in 2010, so it  is helpful to clarify how Congress will continue to be informed about  developments at the Fed.   This bill already passed the House last year on a voice vote.   I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer) and the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) for introducing this legislation.   I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 974.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased with the bipartisan cooperation  shown by this legislation and fully support the efforts of the sponsors  to increase accountability and transparency.   I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) for his  engagement on the bill and, again, urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this important legislation, H.R. 974.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1414) to amend the duties of the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to ensure FinCEN works with Tribal law  enforcement agencies, protects against all forms of terrorism, and  focuses on virtual currencies.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1414         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FinCEN Improvement Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The mission of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network       (FinCEN) is to safeguard the financial system from illicit       use and combat money laundering and promote national security       through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of       financial intelligence and strategic use of financial       authorities.        (2) In its mission to safeguard the financial system from       the abuses of financial crime, including terrorist financing,       money laundering and other illicit activity, the United       States should prioritize working with partners in Federal,       State, local, Tribal, and foreign law enforcement       authorities.        (3) The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that       since the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, ``The threat       landscape has expanded considerably, though it is important       to note that the more traditional threat posed by al Qaeda       and its affiliates is still present and active. The threat of       domestic terrorism also remains persistent overall, with       actors crossing the line from First Amendment protected       rights to committing crimes to further their political       agenda.''.        (4) Although the use and trading of virtual currencies are       legal practices, some terrorists and criminals, including       international criminal organizations, seek to exploit       vulnerabilities in the global financial system and are       increasingly using emerging payment methods such as virtual       currencies to move illicit funds.        (5) In carrying out its mission, FinCEN should prioritize       all forms of terrorism and  [[Page H2622]]       emerging methods of terrorism and illicit finance.       SEC. 3. STRENGTHENING FINCEN.         Section 310 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (C)--        (A) in clause (i), by striking ``appropriate Federal,       State, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies'' and       inserting ``appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and       foreign law enforcement agencies''; and        (B) in clause (vi), by striking ``to protect against       international terrorism'' and inserting ``to protect against       terrorism'';        (2) in paragraph (E), by striking ``appropriate Federal,       State, local, and foreign law enforcement authorities'' and       inserting ``appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and       foreign law enforcement authorities'';        (3) in paragraph (F), by striking ``Federal, State, local,       and foreign law enforcement'' and inserting ``Federal, State,       local, Tribal, and foreign law enforcement''; and        (4) in paragraph (H), by striking ``anti-terrorism and       anti-money laundering initiatives, and similar efforts'' and       inserting ``anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering       initiatives, including matters involving emerging       technologies or value that substitutes for currency, and       similar efforts''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the FinCEN Improvement Act is a bill that will  strengthen the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN, our  national security, and our financial system. A form of this bipartisan  bill was introduced last year with the exact same language, and it  unanimously passed the House on suspension by voice vote.   Currently, FinCEN works with Federal, State, local, and foreign law  enforcement authorities in its anti-money laundering/counter terror  financing objectives. Although Tribal law enforcement is a strong  partner in fighting crime and safeguarding our country's national  security, they are not yet listed in the FinCEN statute alongside their  law enforcement partners.   Though FinCEN voluntarily works with Tribal law enforcement in these  objectives, this legislation will make FinCEN's assistance to Tribal  law enforcement mandatory. This bill will also amend FinCEN's statute  to protect against all forms of terrorism. As written, the underlying  statute only requires the protection against international terrorism.   While the United States faces a serious threat from foreign terrorist  organizations, the threat from both homegrown violent extremists and  domestic terrorists has sharply increased within the past several  years. Although this type of terrorism has been less discussed in the  news cycle, these terrorists are equally as dangerous as international  terrorist organizations, if not more.   In fact, a survey of 382 law enforcement agencies, conducted with the  Police Executive Research Forum with funding from the National  Institute of Justice, found that 74 percent of the law enforcement  agencies reported antigovernment extremism, such as sovereign citizen  extremism, as one of the top terrorist threats in their jurisdictions.  This part of the bill will ensure that a proper focus be paid to all  forms of terrorism.   Additionally, this bill will require FinCEN to work with foreign  financial intelligence units on anti-money laundering and counter  terror financing initiatives with respect to emerging technologies such  as cryptocurrencies, which are increasingly used by terrorists and  transnational criminals.   As the threat environment has changed with the birth and prominence  of cryptocurrencies, online marketplaces, and the dark web, FinCEN  needs to coordinate with and support our international partners that  share our common anti-money laundering/counter terror financing goals.   For these reasons, I am proud to support this legislation, and I  congratulate Congresswoman Wexton and Congressman Riggleman for  introducing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that Ms. Wexton and Mr.  Riggleman have brought this issue to the full House. It addresses key  gaps in our efforts to fight financial crime, something we all should  support.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 758) to provide a safe harbor for financial institutions  that maintain a customer account or customer transaction at the request  of a Federal or State law enforcement agency, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 758         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cooperate with Law       Enforcement Agencies and Watch Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR WITH RESPECT TO KEEP OPEN LETTERS.         (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``Sec. 5333. Safe harbor with respect to keep open letters         ``(a) In General.--With respect to a customer account or       customer transaction of a financial institution, if a       Federal, State, Tribal, or local law enforcement agency       requests, in writing, the financial institution to keep such       account or transaction open--        ``(1) the financial institution shall not be liable under       this subchapter for maintaining such account or transaction       consistent with the parameters of the request; and        ``(2) no Federal or State department or agency may take any       adverse supervisory action under this subchapter with respect       to the financial institution for maintaining such account or       transaction consistent with the parameters of the request.        ``(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be       construed--        ``(1) from preventing a Federal or State department or       agency from verifying the validity of a written request       described under subsection (a) with the Federal, State,       Tribal, or local law enforcement agency making the written       request; or        ``(2) to relieve a financial institution from complying       with any reporting requirements, including the reporting of       suspicious transactions under section 5318(g).        ``(c) Letter Termination Date.--For purposes of this       section, any written request described under subsection (a)       shall include a termination date after which such request       shall no longer apply.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents for chapter       53 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by inserting       after the item relating to section 5332 the following:  ``5333. Safe harbor with respect to keep open letters.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 758 would strengthen cooperation between financial  institutions and law enforcement agencies to better detect, deter, and  combat terrorism and financial crimes.   With respect to the Bank Secrecy Act anti-money laundering, referred  to as BSA/AML, supervisory actions, this bill would carve out a narrow  safe harbor for financial institutions to keep a customer's account  open at the written request of a law enforcement agency, including  those at the Federal, State, local, and Tribal levels.  [[Page H2624]]    This cooperation will enable law enforcement agencies to follow the  money in the bank accounts of terrorists, human traffickers, corrupt  officials, and those involved with organized crime.   Of equal importance, the legislation provides an assurance to  financial institutions, clarifying that they will not be held liable  for their cooperation and collaboration with law enforcement in helping  to thwart illicit finance.   I will note that law enforcement agencies are currently expected to  provide a written notice to financial institutions, requesting that the  accounts of bad actors remain open to monitor transactions and build  stronger criminal cases. However, this practice does not always happen  and exposes financial institutions to enforcement actions from their  banking regulators. Banks should not be put in a position to choose  whether or not to help law enforcement out of concern about regulatory  consequences.   We simply cannot allow bad actors to launder money and finance terror  through our banks. H.R. 758 will encourage financial institutions to  maintain a strong partnership with law enforcement.   In the 115th Congress, this bill was unanimously approved by the  Financial Services Committee. The House passed the bill by a vote of  379-4.   I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster) for introducing this bipartisan piece of  legislation. This bill is one example of our committee's efforts to  fight terrorism, corruption, and financial crime. I urge all Members to  vote ``yes'' on H.R. 758. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster).                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that Mr. Hill and Mr. Foster  have brought this measure to the House on a bipartisan basis. It will  help provide law enforcement more access to the critical information it  needs and in a timely manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
