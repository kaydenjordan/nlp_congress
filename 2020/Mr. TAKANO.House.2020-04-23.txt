 Madam Speaker, H.R. 266 provides billions of dollars in  funding for small businesses, hospitals, and much-needed testing. This  is a bill that works for the people, not just the favorite clients of  the big banks.   I have heard from small business owners in Riverside County who have  struggled to receive the help they need after the original funds ran  dry. This bill strengthens the Paycheck Protection Program by providing  an additional $310 billion to help small businesses stay afloat.    Further, this bill ensures that true small businesses--not large,  multimillion-dollar corporations--have access to these funds.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 266. The  well-being of the American people depends on it.
