 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as the House considers  legislation to address a heroin and synthetic drug epidemic plaguing  our country, to honor the memories of two young people from my  district: Morgan Brittany Axe, who died from a heroin overdose more  than 2\1/2\ years ago, and Victor Orlando Woolson, who drowned after  using synthetic drugs that he bought over the counter almost 6 years  ago.   Morgan and Victor and so many others were touched by this terrible  epidemic. Morgan and Victor were both active members of our community  and touched the lives of every person they interacted with.   Before she passed away, Morgan worked at the Dewitt Animal Hospital  and treated sick and injured animals on a daily basis. Victor was a  high-achieving graduate of Mexico High School and was enrolled in  Cayuga Community College, where he studied criminal justice and  psychology.   Drug addiction is a terrible disease. Morgan became addicted to Xanax  after the suicide of her boyfriend. She was just 17 years old at the  time. Morgan became dependent on Xanax and needed it to function on a  daily basis. She then progressed to other pills in order to numb her  pain.   After a long battle with heroin and prescription painkillers, Morgan  found the strength of sobriety for 8 months and was on the drug  Vivitrol. Vivitrol magically makes it impossible for addicts to get  high on heroin or painkillers.   After she found out that she was pregnant, Morgan went off Vivitrol  because she did not want it to harm her child. Unfortunately, post- acute withdrawal set in, and Morgan relapsed.   Morgan did not have to drive to a drug house on Syracuse's west side  to buy the bag of heroin that killed her. Instead, a career drug dealer  delivered it to her house in Fairmount after cajoling her to use it.   After doing one bag of heroin, Deanna Axe found her daughter lifeless  in her bedroom. Morgan overdosed and died, and her unborn child, Isaiah  Douglas Lee Mathis, died with her. Morgan's drug dealer, Anthony Vita,  was federally prosecuted and is now in prison for the next 15 years.  However, Vita being in prison where he belongs, will never bring Morgan  back.   Victor Woolson was your average happy-go-lucky teenager who had many  friends. He was not only a loyal friend but a loving brother, uncle,  and grandson. Victor graduated Mexico High School with an advanced  regents diploma and had 4 years in the Marine Corps Junior ROTC  program. In college, Victor was contemplating a career in law  enforcement while attending Cayuga Community College.   While attending community college, Victor began experimenting with  synthetic drugs that he was able to purchase legally over the counter.  Because he could buy these substances over the counter, Victor assumed  these illicit substances were safe. They were not.   At the young age of 19, Victor went into a shop, bought a packet of  K2/Spice over the counter at a head shop in Oswego, New York, suffered  a fatal reaction from smoking that synthetic marijuana, and drowned in  Lake Ontario.   After Victor's tragic death, his mother, Teresa channeled her sadness  and anger into advocacy and founded the Victor Orlando Woolson  Foundation, or the VOW Foundation for short, which advocates for  stronger legislation against synthetic drugs and assists individuals  and organizations in providing services for mentally ill, homeless, and  low-income youth in Oswego County.   It has been my honor to fight alongside Teresa, and this year I  invited her to be my guest at the State of the Union in order to  highlight the need to address and combat the use of synthetic drugs.   I am proud to fight in memory of Morgan and Victor and so many  others, and in this Congress I introduced the Stop the Importation and  Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues Act, or SITSA for short.   The SITSA Act modernizes the Controlled Substances Act by speeding up  the process of placing synthetic drugs on the controlled substances  list. Under current law, drug producers often make minor tweaks to  legal substances that mimic the effects of  [[Page H5100]]  banned drugs and use this loophole to prevent law enforcement from  removing these drugs from circulation.   In addition, the SITSA Act outlaws 13 synthetic fentynals that have  been identified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as an immediate  threat to public health.   Together, by passing this legislation, we can prevent synthetic drugs  from, one, being imported into this country; two, being routinely mixed  with heroin in fatal doses; and, three, being sold over the counter in  head shops and bodegas throughout this country.   These efforts can't bring Victor Orlando Woolson back. They can't  bring Morgan Brittany Axe back and so many others from our district and  our country, but this is a start in the right direction to stop this  terrible epidemic.   Every hour in this country, five people die from heroin overdose-- every hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. We have got  to stop it. We have got to keep pushing.   I am proud to be part of the legislation, and I am proud that the  Congress is acting in such a meaningful manner.                            ____________________
