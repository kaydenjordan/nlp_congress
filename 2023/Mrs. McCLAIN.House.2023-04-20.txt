 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my district, my  State, and my country to say that the Chinese Communist Party is  actively working to destroy America.   From aggressive military actions to spying on Americans through  TikTok and high-altitude balloons, the CCP is focused on becoming the  world's number one superpower.   Mr. Speaker, I want to make something very clear: China is not our  friend. They are coming at us militarily, economically, and  educationally. They are our biggest adversary.   We know that China is targeting our country as a whole, and we also  know that they are targeting individual States, as well.   For example, in North Dakota, China has bought up farmland right next  to a strategic military base. Probably the only vacant land in Nebraska  they could find was next to a strategic military base.    In Texas, China is using the shadow of TikTok to build a massive  facility that will focus on spying on Americans.   Now, in my home State of Michigan, China is tightening its grip on a  chip manufacturing facility and establishing a facility in Big Rapids.  The company taking over this town is called Gotion, which is actually a  subsidiary of a company that is owned and operated by the Chinese  Communist Party.   When Gotion proposed this new plant, they sold a good story by  promising 2,000 jobs and massive economic gains for the State.  Actually, Michigan could use some economic gains for our State, but we  know the truth. Gotion is establishing its Big Rapids plant in order to  extend its CCP influence in Michigan. They plan to utilize Chinese EV  chip technology and send the profits of its production right back to  the CCP.   By the way, those 2,000 jobs that they promised? They will be filled  with Chinese workers implanted from Beijing to work at this facility,  not to mention--wait for it--over $500 million in tax breaks from our  Governor will be used to subsidize these jobs and given to Gotion.   Let's not forget, ironically, coincidentally, that Big Rapids is home  to Ferris State University, which just got an accreditation for their  information security and intelligence program.                                time  1130    That seems like a coincidence, doesn't it?   I can assure you; I am not much for coincidences.   This is a blatant move from the Chinese Communist Party to undermine  the State of Michigan and gain greater access to our State and our  country.   Make no mistake about it, this Gotion plant poses a huge threat to  our national security. That is why I am standing before you today to  call out Gotion and the CCP for their plot to ransack Michigan.  [[Page H1900]]    I will not stand for this blatant attack by the Communist Party, and  I will not sit idly by and watch this happen.
