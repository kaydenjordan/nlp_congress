 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a simple one. The entire  text reads as follows:         The FAA Administrator shall develop global-scale       probabilistic convection guidance capability.    In plain English, this means that the FAA would be required to  develop the capability to predict where convection occurs so that  aircraft can avoid it, if possible.   Atmospheric convection is thought to induce a significant proportion  of turbulence experienced by commercial aircraft, and that turbulence,  even if only moderate, can lead to passenger and crew injuries and can  result in high insurance costs for airlines.   The FAA has been doing a commendable job of developing the capability  to produce probabilistic forecasts of domestic oceanic convection over  a 36-hour timeframe, but work remains to be done to improve this  capability globally.   The FAA would like to pursue further work in this area and has the  hope of possibly achieving this capability by the end of 2020. In order  to support this effort, I believe Congress should fully authorize the  development of this important capability, and after doing so, it should  adequately appropriate funds to accomplish the mission. Should this  amendment pass today, I am committed to fully supporting the FAA's work  in this arena through my seat on the Appropriations Committee.   I know we would all like a smooth flight in and out of D.C. each  week. Let's extend that possibility as often as possible to the  American public seeking to cross an ocean or other continents on their  travels. If you want your constituents to have smoother flights, I urge  you to vote in favor of this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
