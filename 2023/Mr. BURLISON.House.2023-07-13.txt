 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to support  this amendment to eliminate the diversity and inclusion deputy  inspector general to prohibit the establishment of new diversity,  equity, and inclusion positions within the DOD and to prohibit the  Secretary from filling any vacancies for DEI positions.   For years, the left has forced radical and unpopular ideas into our  very institutions that are under the cover of DEI policies.                                time  2150    DEI initiatives and policies are not about making everyone feel like  they belong. It is a smokescreen. Instead of uniting us, it is about  dividing us. It is about dividing our country into separate groups that  are based on identity, and conforming to a radical agenda that replaces  our shared American identity instead with a tribalism, with a tribal  collectivism.   And you know what? It is a disgrace to our political and military  leaders who have allowed this to occur in the Department of Defense.  You see, the DOD's mission is not that. Its mission, instead, is to  provide the military forces that are needed to deter war and ensure the  Nation's security.   Dividing our troops and the DOD employees by race and identity does  nothing but distract from the mission of addressing real and imminent  threats to the U.S. national security. In reality, woke indoctrination  serves as only one of these very threats.   DEI in the military breeds hostility among the enlisted by focusing  on identity-driven grievances instead of bringing people together,  instead of unity. It undermines that shared American identity and a  patriotic love of country that compelled our dedicated servicemembers  to join in the first place.   The U.S. military is one of our last great merit-based institutions  that is still standing. Millions of selfless patriots serve our  country, but their service is exploited by the wokeness and the  religion of DEI.   Instead of judging our servicemembers based on merit, they are judged  by identity. Instead of having a unified body of men and women who are  ready to defend our Nation, we have a group of people who are  fragmented into the belief of their gender identities.   Instead of men and women in the armed services being trained in  readiness, their time is wasted learning whatever new woke ideology  comes out of leftist universities. This is not acceptable, and we have  to stop this madness before it is too late. That is why I filed this  amendment.   This amendment repeals the DEI inspector general at the DOD and  prohibits the establishment of new DEI positions. Specifically, it  prohibits the Secretary from establishing any new DEI positions at the  DOD.   The DOD will not be able to fill any DEI vacancies that might come  up. This amendment simply eliminates these unnecessary taxpayer-funded  positions, and that is it.   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  the great State of Texas (Mr. Roy).
