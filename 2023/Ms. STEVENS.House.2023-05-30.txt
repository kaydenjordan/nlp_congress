 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the very significant  resolution of the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), one  of our leaders in the Congress, calling on elected officials to  identify and educate others on the contributions of the Jewish  community as we condemn the rise of anti-Semitism.   History's oldest hatred is on the rise. Synagogues, children, and  neighborhoods are being targeted.   This is tragically and palpably present in Oakland County, Michigan.  [[Page H2661]]  At the end of last year, when I gathered at the menorah lighting in  Detroit, lovingly known as Menorah in the D, we gathered to call for  our love of neighbors, to call for our love of the Jewish community,  and to call on the Jewish community to say: Be proud of who you are.   That is exactly what this resolution accomplishes: celebrating Jewish  heritage just as we call out the evils of anti-Semitism.
