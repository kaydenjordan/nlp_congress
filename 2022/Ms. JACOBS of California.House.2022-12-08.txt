 Mr. Speaker, this summer I officiated my  brother's wedding, and it was one of the proudest moments of my life.   The love that Dylan and Kay share is incredibly special and deserves  to be celebrated, recognized, and protected.   That is why I am so grateful to have voted for the Respect for  Marriage Act, to honor their marriage and so many other marriages that  have been created and affirmed in the 7 years since the landmark  Obergefell ruling. This means so much not only to my family, but to the  LGBTQ+ communities in San Diego and across the country.   This bill will take the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act off  the books, so it no longer poses an existential threat to LGBTQ+  families.   It will protect marriage equality so that a valid marriage in one  State is recognized by all other States. Importantly, it will protect  kids from discriminatory State laws and ensure that LGBTQ+ families can  stay together.  [[Page H8856]]    With the passage of this bill, our government is finally catching up  to the American people. This is long overdue, but it is no less  meaningful for my brother and sister-in-law and hundreds of thousands  of other LGBTQ+ marriages across the country.                            ____________________
