 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the VA Mission Telehealth  Clarification Act, which I am proud to have introduced.   H.R. 3228, the VA Mission Telehealth Clarification Act, is a simple  bill that builds on the VA MISSION Act's historic expansion of the  veterans health system.   One of the most significant parts of the VA MISSION Act was the  authorization for the VA to use telehealth and provide care across  State lines. The bill began as the result of a visit I had to a VA  facility before the current pandemic, as they laid out some of the  issues they were trying to overcome. But now with the COVID- 19 pandemic, we are seeing how extremely beneficial these technologies  can be for our veterans.    In fact, the VA Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina, which  serves part of my district along Georgia's coast, had an over 200  percent increase in telehealth medical services during the pandemic  when we spoke in May.   Even more incredibly, the VA announced it had a 1,000 percent  increase in telehealth video appointments using its VA Video Connect  Program during the first months of the pandemic. This is an extremely  important ability for the VA to have. However, the law did not  authorize trainees within the VA to use telehealth technologies, only  practitioners with a full license.   As telehealth medicine grows in prevalence, we need for interns,  residents, and fellows to gain experience using these services,  especially considering that many of these trainees later go on to work  as doctors at the VA, bringing with them a wealth of experience.   Rather than depending on doctors to learn while on the job, which  could delay the rollout of care, this bill would allow trainees to gain  experience on telehealth systems while properly supervised by  credentialed VA staff.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that the bill was further improved  through the committee process after input from my colleagues in the VA.  The bill will not only allow for trainees to participate in telehealth,  but it will also expand the ability to practice telemedicine to all  appropriately qualified healthcare professionals at the VA, fixing the  issue once and for all.   While Congress intended for trainees and others to be included from  the beginning, the VA's reading of the law did not include them,  although they have expressed their desire to include them in telehealth  services.                                time  1415    The VA Mission Telehealth Clarification Act will give VA the  certainty to provide essential telehealth programs  [[Page H4682]]  to our veterans, improving the quality and timeliness of their care.   Again, this is a commonsense bill with bipartisan support and has  received the support from the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign  Wars, AMVETS, and Paralyzed Veterans of America, among others.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Chatham County Commissioner James Holmes from  Georgia's First Congressional District, who passed away on August 17.   Commissioner Holmes was a devoted public servant who served as  Chatham County Commissioner for 16 years, and he was well known for his  work with the Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club.   Everyone who knew him remembered him as always smiling and living his  life to serve others.   Commissioner Holmes was known as ``Coach,'' since he was a basketball  coach at Savannah State University.   He spent 35 years as a program director at the Frank Callen Boys &  Girls Club, and he was extremely devoted to improving the lives of  youth in his community.   Commissioner Holmes was one of the kindest, most devoted people who  served his community selflessly. Everyone who knew him was touched by  his compassion, generosity, and joy he always exuded.   Commissioner Holmes' impact on the Savannah community will remain for  countless years to come. I am very grateful for the life that he lived.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during the most difficult time.                            ____________________
