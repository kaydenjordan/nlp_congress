Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to speak about the importance of  passing the Build Back Better Act, legislation nothing short of  transformational for Black America.   It extends the child care tax credit for a year, cutting child  poverty in half. In North Carolina, that is a lifeline for hundreds of  thousands of children who go to bed hungry every night.   It puts $150 billion toward affordable housing, which has been  described as the single largest and most comprehensive investment in  affordable housing in history. In Charlotte and so many other  communities across the country, that is real progress on our affordable  housing crisis and real relief for over half a million Americans who  don't have a roof over their heads.   As the chair of the CBC HBCU Caucus and cofounder of the  Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, I am proud to say that this  package provides approximately $10 billion specifically for  historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving  institutions, including $3 billion for research and development grants  at these institutions and $6 billion for increased Pell grants and  institutional support to lower the cost of college.   Universal childcare and pre-K will prepare children to receive the  education that they need to succeed in school and be admitted to  college.   As the cofounder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus  with Representative Underwood, I am also proud to say that the Build  Back Better Act includes all eligible provisions of our Momnibus  legislation and permanently expands yearlong postpartum Medicaid and  CHIP coverage in every State.    The maternal health and morbidity crisis in this country is  unacceptable, but the Build Back Better Act gets us closer to the day  when every parent who enters the maternity ward and every child born in  America makes it home safe.   Finally, I would like to take a point of personal privilege to  recognize the hard work of our Congressional Black Caucus chair, Joyce  Beatty, and all the members and committee chairs on this legislation.   I believe that promises made must be promised kept, and this package  keeps our promise to all Americans. I implore my colleagues to pass the  Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan infrastructure framework  together. This is Our Power, Our Message.
