 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee has begun the  hearing to consider Judge Brett Kavanaugh for confirmation as Associate  Justice of the Supreme Court. One of the distinguished professionals  asked to introduce Judge Kavanaugh is Lisa Blatt, a prominent and  accomplished Supreme Court litigator. She also happens to be a self- described ``liberal Democrat and feminist.''   Nevertheless, in a recent op-ed, Ms. Blatt laid out the case for why  Democrats should support Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Just last week,  she spearheaded a letter that 41 veteran appellate advocates wrote to  the committee. They said: ``Based on our experience with Judge  Kavanaugh and his work over 12 years of distinguished judicial service,  we are confident that he possesses the character, temperament and  intellect that will make him an asset for our Nation's highest Court.''   Our colleagues on the committee also received a letter from Bob  Bennett. Like Ms. Blatt, he is also a Democrat and, in fact, he served  as a personal lawyer to one of America's most prominent Democrats,  President Bill Clinton, during a particularly acrimonious time in  recent history. Yet Mr. Bennett concluded, in a letter to our  colleagues, that Judge Kavanaugh is ``the most qualified person any  Republican President could possibly have nominated.''   He went on to say: ``Were the Senate to fail to confirm Brett, it  would not only mean passing up the opportunity to confirm a great  jurist, but it would also undermine civility in politics.''   Those familiar with Judge Kavanaugh's judicial record and temperament  come away impressed. So has the American Bar Association, an  organization our Democratic friends have called ``the gold standard''  in evaluating judicial nominees. They deemed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to  be unanimously ``well qualified.'' That is the highest possible rating  they can give, unanimously ``well qualified.''   Many of our Democratic colleagues have been determined to oppose  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, no matter what, since the day he was  nominated. Some of our Democratic colleagues opposed him and anyone  else before he was nominated, but they are running out of options. They  can't find any substantive reasons why he doesn't deserve confirmation.   That explains the hyperventilation and orchestrated antics at this  morning's hearing, where they talked about almost anything besides his  distinguished record. Our colleagues keep falling back on the same  process complaints that have failed to persuade anyone for weeks and  weeks.   So let's review the facts.   The Judiciary Committee has received half a million pages of  materials with respect to this nomination. This is by far--by far--the  most materials provided in support of a Supreme Court nomination in our  Nation's entire history. In fact, it is more material than was produced  for the last five Supreme Court nominations combined.   Of course, this record-shattering tower of executive branch documents  is all in addition to Judge Kavanaugh's 12-plus-year record on the DC  Court of Appeals--obviously, the most relevant part of his record.  Again, that judicial record was something our Democratic friends said  was the best way to evaluate a judge, back when it was a Supreme Court  nominee of a Democratic President whom the Senate was considering.   Judge Kavanaugh has issued over 300 opinions from what the legal  community widely considers the second highest bench in the country. By  any objective standard, by any fair metric, any Senator who is willing  to give Judge Kavanaugh full and fair consideration is more than amply  prepared to do so, but, of course, many of our Democratic colleagues  haven't been interested in doing that.   As I said, many Senate Democrats made up their minds instantly upon  Judge Kavanaugh's nomination that they would oppose him no matter  what--no matter what his qualifications, no matter how many opinions  are in the public record or how many pages of documents are provided.  Many Senate Democrats were never going to give this nominee a fair  hearing. There could be 1 million pages of documents or 5 million or 10  million, for that matter. Nothing will change the fact that one  Democrat who serves on the committee declared she would oppose any  nominee--any nominee--before Judge Kavanaugh was even announced.  Nothing will change the fact that the very same night he was announced,  two more Democrats on the Judiciary Committee publicly announced they  finished their consideration and will vote against him. Nothing will  change the fact that the very next morning, the Democratic leader stood  up and said: ``I will oppose him with everything I've got,'' and more  and more Democrats have followed suit.   Our colleagues will have the opportunity to thoroughly examine this  nominee during this week's hearings, and afterward he will receive a  vote on the floor. No amount of partisan opposition or political  theater will stop the Senate from doing its job.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar Nos. 1069, 1070,  1071, 1072, and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk in the  Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy; that the nominations be  confirmed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further  motions be in order; that any statements related to the nominations be  printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action, and the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to a young  man who recently lost his courageous battle with cancer. Jesse Schott,  a 17-year-old student at North Bullitt High School near Shepherdsville,  KY, became a local hero and will be dearly missed by all those who knew  and loved him.   Although first diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 3, Jesse  spent his life chasing his dreams. In fact, it was often during the  darkest moments of his fight that Jesse accomplished his most  impressive feats. As a first sergeant in his Junior Reserve Officers'  Training Corps, JROTC, Jesse commanded the color guard under the bright  lights at the football stadium. Last December, after learning his  cancer had spread, Jesse surprised many when he competed in a drill  meet. When he was too ill to complete his Eagle Scout project to build  a receptacle for old or damaged flags to be properly retired, his  fellow scouts helped finish the task.   Whatever the hardship that confronted him, Jesse didn't complain.  Reassured by his faith and his loving family, he persevered and kept  fighting. Jesse encouraged those around him with bravery beyond his  years. A fellow member of the JROTC said, ``He was going through the  battle of his life and he never gave up so why should I give up on  anything?''   His life may have been cut short, but Jesse clearly left a lasting  impact on those he met. His community honored his life and his example.  The Zoneton Fire Department named him an honorary firefighter. Jesse  was named the honorary mayor of Hillview. The Kentucky National Guard  made him an honorary member earlier this year. Jesse's life will  continue to inspire those who knew him and those who will hear his  story for many years to come.   I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in extending our condolences  to Jesse's family. I hope that their happy memories of Jesse will ease  their grief during this difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
