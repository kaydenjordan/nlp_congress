 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted  to complete my remarks before the Senate recesses.    Mr. President, I know that budgets are not particularly  sexy and exciting discussions. A lot of people wonder about a trillion  here and a hundred billion there and what it all means. It means a lot.  What it means is that if this horrific Republican budget is  implemented, it will mean an enormous amount of pain for tens of  millions of working-class, middle-class, and lower income people in  this country. That is what this budget means.   After failing to pass a so-called healthcare bill that would throw up  to 32 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently  have--a bill that was widely opposed by the American people--Donald  Trump and the Republican leadership are back again. While I totally  disagree with what they are trying to do, I do appreciate their  temerity. They are not giving up in terms of trying to protect the  interests of the billionaire class against the vast majority of the  American people.   The Republicans are now pushing one of the most destructive and  unfair budget and tax proposals in the modern history of the United  States--a plan that would do incalculable harm to tens of millions of  working families, our children, the sick, the elderly, and the poor.  The Republican budget we are debating on the floor of the Senate this  week is the Robin Hood principle in reverse. Robin Hood took from the  rich and gave to the poor. What this budget does is take from working  people, the middle class, the elderly, and the poor  [[Page S6426]]  to give massive tax breaks to people who are already living in  incredible opulence.   Donald Trump and the Republican leadership claim that their plan  would provide a ``big league'' tax cut for the middle class. Nothing  could be further from the truth.   According to the Tax Policy Center, by the end of this decade, nearly  80 percent--underline 80 percent--of the tax benefits of the Republican  plan would go to the top 1 percent. Even more incredibly, the top one- tenth of 1 percent would receive some 40 percent of the tax breaks over  a 10-year period. A tax proposal which gives 80 percent of the benefits  to the top 1 percent and 40 percent of the benefits to the top one- tenth of 1 percent is not a tax proposal benefiting the middle-class or  working families of this country; it is a tax proposal designed to  benefit the wealthiest people and the campaign contributors of the  billionaire class.   This budget cuts Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over a 10-year  period. That is kind of strange. The United States of America is the  only major country on Earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all  people. What the American people want, in my view, is to join the rest  of the world and understand that healthcare is a right, that we should  not have 28 million people without any health insurance and even more  underinsured with high deductibles and high copayments. Yet what this  budget does, unbelievably, is throw 15 million people off of the health  insurance they have with a trillion-dollar cut in Medicaid.   I would hope that my friend the chairman of the Budget Committee  might at some point during this long debate tell us what happens to  somebody today who is struggling with cancer, with heart disease, with  diabetes, with a life-threatening illness, who suddenly loses the  Medicaid health insurance they have. What happens to that person? I  would hope that some of my Republican friends would tell the American  people what happens, because study after study tells us what will  happen, and that is that thousands of people will lose their lives.  They will die because they will no longer have access to the health  insurance they had.   Further, this budget does what Republicans have not yet attempted to  do during the past year in their so-called healthcare legislation, and  that is to make a $473 billion cut to Medicare. So it is not only a  trillion-dollar cut to Medicaid, it is also a $473 billion cut to  Medicare.   Interestingly enough, I think many Americans will recall that during  his campaign for President, Donald Trump told the American people that  he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He said that  over and over again. On April 18, 2015--this is just one quote of  many--Mr. Trump said:         Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social       Security, they want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it       on Medicaid. And we can't do that. And it's not fair to the       people that have been paying in for years and now all of a       sudden they want to be cut.    That is Donald Trump running for President.   Well, I would say to President Trump: That is what you told the  American people during your campaign, and now I hope you will tell your  Republican friends right here in the Senate that they should respect  the campaign promises you ran on and that if they pass a budget that  cuts Medicare or Medicaid, you will veto that legislation.   I hope the President has the integrity to do that. I don't think he  will, but I hope he does that.   Poll after poll tells us that the overwhelming majority of the  American people do not want Congress to cut Medicare or Medicaid. In  fact, I think in this country today, if you ask people what their  deepest concerns are, they are concerned about jobs, and they are  concerned about income. I think even more so they are concerned about  the healthcare they have, how much it costs, and whether they are going  to have it tomorrow.   Poll after poll tells us that the American people do not want  Congress to cut Medicare--which, by the way, is the most popular health  insurance program in this country--and they don't want to see Medicaid  cut either because they know, among other things, that about two-thirds  of nursing home dollars come from Medicaid. So if you have a mom or a  dad dealing with Alzheimer's or some other terrible illness in a  nursing home and massive cuts to Medicaid are made, what is going to  happen to your parent who is in a nursing home? People know that. They  do not want to cut Medicare and Medicaid.   A recent Pew Foundation poll finds that 85 percent of Republicans and  94 percent of Democrats want to either maintain or increase funding for  Medicare.   Sixty percent of Americans oppose slashing Medicaid, according to a  recent Quinnipiac poll.   A recent Wall Street Journal and NBC poll finds that only 12 percent  of the American people believe the wealthy should receive a tax cut,  while 62 percent believe the wealthiest people in our country should  pay more in taxes.   You have the American people saying: Don't cut Medicare. Don't cut  Medicaid. Don't give tax breaks to billionaires. In fact, ask them to  pay more in taxes. That, by and large, is where the American people are  coming from, whether Democrats, Republicans, or Independents.   Then the question arises: Why is the Republican leadership bringing  forward a budget that does the exact opposite of what the American  people want? The answer to that question, I am sorry to say, is not  complicated. It has everything to do with a corrupt campaign finance  system that allows billionaires and the wealthiest people in this  country to exert their influence over the political process.  Increasingly, it is not the ordinary American middle-class worker the  Congress listens to, but it is wealthy campaign contributors. Today, we  have a corrupt campaign finance system that enables multibillionaires,  along with some of the most powerful CEOs in America, to contribute  many hundreds of millions of dollars to the political process.   Many of us believe that the concept of democracy is one person, one  vote. You get a vote, and I get a vote. Sometimes you win; sometimes  you lose. The majority wins. That is what we teach the children in the  fifth grade and sixth grade: One person, one vote, majority wins.   Unfortunately, as a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme  Court decision, the American campaign finance system has been totally  corrupted. We now have a situation where billionaire families can spend  unlimited sums of money to help elect candidates who protect their  interests, and not only can they spend that money, that is exactly what  they are doing.   There was a very interesting article in the Boston Globe just the  other day, October 14. This is what the article says. The headline is:  ``The Koch brothers (and their friends) want President Trump's tax cut.  Very badly.''   This is what the article says--but first, I should say a word about  the Koch brothers. Not everyone knows who they are. The Koch brothers  are the second wealthiest family in America. They are struggling to  catch up to the Waltons. They are not quite there. They are worth only  $90 billion. They are struggling, but they are getting by, I am happy  to tell you. With that $90 billion, what they are doing, along with a  few of their friends, is spending hundreds of millions of dollars every  campaign cycle to elect people, in this case Republicans, who support  their agenda. This is what the article says:         The message from the billionaire-led Koch network of donors       to President Trump and the Republican Congress it helped to       shape couldn't be more clear: Pass a tax overhaul, or else.        As the donors mixed and mingled for a policy summit at the       St. Regis hotel in midtown Manhattan last week, just a block       south from Trump Tower, it came up again. And again. And       again.        ``It's the most significant federal effort we've ever taken       on,'' said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for       Prosperity, a Koch-aligned group with offices in 36 States.       ``The stakes for the Republicans, I've never seen them this       high.''        Many in the Koch network, a vast group of libertarian-      leaning nonprofits and advocacy and political organizations,       described the upcoming legislative push for a tax overhaul as       an inflection point in modern political history, a do-or-die       moment that would define whether their efforts over the years       will pay off or not. The network leaders plan to dedicate       much of their two-year $400 million politics and policy       budget to the effort--though they wouldn't give an exact       number.    That is $400 million in the next two years to pass this piece of  legislation.  [[Page S6427]]  This comes from a family, the Koch brothers, who are pretty upfront  about what they believe. They do not want to cut Social Security or  Medicare and Medicaid. They will take that, but that is really not  their goal. They want to eliminate Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,  and virtually every other Federal program that provides help to the  working families of this country.   By the way, just in passing, if the estate tax, which is part of the  Republican budget, is repealed, we might want to mention that the Koch  brothers' family would see a benefit of some $30 billion. If your  family is going to get a $30 billion benefit, then putting a few  hundred million dollars into seeing that legislation passed is not a  difficult idea.   This budget makes clear who the Republicans in Congress are listening  to, and it is not the middle class or the working families who do not  want to see Medicare cut or Medicaid cut and who certainly do not want  to see a $1.9 trillion tax break for the top 1 percent. I am afraid  that my Republican colleagues are listening to their top campaign  contributors who have told the Republican Party, in no uncertain terms,  that if they do not get their tax cuts, they will stop providing the  Republicans with hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign  contributions. How sad is that?   Think about the incredibly brave Americans who have fought for  democracy over the years. Some of them never return from the  battlefields where they have fought for an American democracy that  makes us a country where people rule. Abraham Lincoln reminded us that  we are a ``government of the people, by the people, for the people,''  not a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the  billionaires.   Let's be clear about something else. The entire economic theory that  Senate Republicans and President Trump have embraced with this budget  is called trickle-down economics. That is what it is. You give tax  breaks to billionaires and large corporations, and the benefits trickle  down. They improve the economy. This whole theory is a fraud, and when  applied, it has been an abysmal failure.   Since Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy  and deregulated Wall Street, trillions of dollars in wealth have been  redistributed from the middle class and working families to a handful  of millionaires and billionaires. Today, we have more wealth and income  inequality than at any time since the 1920s. Today, the top one-tenth  of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. This  budget would make a bad situation even worse by widening that gap with  its trillions in cuts to social programs and gifts to the top 1  percent.   The Republican budget we are debating today would make horrific cuts  to the needs of working families. Let me give you a few examples. This  budget would give the wealthiest family in America, the Walton family  of Walmart, a tax cut of up to $52 billion. Does anyone in their right  mind think that the wealthiest family in this country needs a tax break  of up to $52 billion? They do that by repealing the estate tax.   At the same time, however, if you are a low-income senior citizen-- and we have too many of them in the State of Vermont--trying to figure  out how to keep warm in a cold winter, you and 700,000 other senior  citizens and families might not be able to keep your home warm in the  winter because of a cut of about $4 billion to the Low Income Home  Energy Assistance Program.   This budget says that if you are the second wealthiest family in  America, the Koch brothers, your family will see a tax break of up to  $33 billion. But if you are a working class kid right now in high  school in Vermont or in Texas or in Wyoming and you are scratching your  head as to how you can afford to go to college and, in your  computations, you are looking at what a Pell grant might mean to you,  this budget would cut over $100 billion in Pell grants and other  financial assistance programs.   This budget gives members of the Trump family a tax cut of up to $4  billion. But if you are a low-income, pregnant woman, you and over a  million other new moms, babies, and toddlers may not be able to get the  nutrition you need, thanks to a $6.5 billion cut to the Women, Infants,  and Children Program, the so-called WIC Program.   At a time when millions of working-class families all across this  country are paying 40 percent or 50 percent or more for the housing  they need, this budget eliminates housing assistance for more than a  million families due to a cut of about $37 billion to the Section 8  rental assistance program and other housing programs.   At a time when the cost of childcare has skyrocketed, which is a very  serious problem in my State, the Republican budget eliminates Head  Start services for 25,000 children each and every year by cutting this  program by some $3 billion.   In total, the Republican budget would cut more than $5 trillion from  education, healthcare, affordable housing, childcare, transportation,  and other programs that working people desperately need over the next  decade.   What is alarming is that despite this incredible giveaway for the  billionaire class, the Koch brothers and their network say that it is  not enough. They want more. Let us be very clear that their eventual  goal--not today, not tomorrow, but their eventual goal is to see that  programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are completely  eliminated.   Let me conclude by saying that this budget is not a budget for the  people of Texas. It is not a budget for the people of Vermont or the  people of Wyoming or the people of the United States of America. This  is a budget for the billionaire class, which today is already doing  phenomenally well. This is a budget for campaign contributors whose  greed has no end, who provide millions of dollars to candidates who  represent their interests.   This is a budget that must be opposed by the American people. I urge  the American people to tell their Members of the Senate to vote no on  this budget.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
