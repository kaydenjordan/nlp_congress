 Madam Speaker, while I strongly condemn white supremacy and  white nationalism, my position remains unchanged. Anything short of  censure is shallow. Steve King has made a career of making racist  statements. That is the only thing he is known for and this pattern of  rabid racism must be confronted head on by the House of  Representatives. This resolution just restates the obvious. It does not  address Steve King's violent, vitriolic, and rabid racism. This  Democratic resolution is an insult to the legacy of Martin Luther King,  Jr. as we recognize his birthday. We must proceed with a vote to  censure him with the same zeal that the House used when censuring  Charlie Rangel. Yesterday, the notice I provided of my privileged  resolution to formally censure the Member from Iowa, started the clock  for a floor vote to punish him for his bigotry and racism. We need to  be clear to the American people that we use condemnation to express our  disapproval of those not in the House. We use censure for those in the  House, Steve King is a sitting member.
