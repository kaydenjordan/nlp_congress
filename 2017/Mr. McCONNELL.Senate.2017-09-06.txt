 Mr. President, as I said yesterday, Congress has a  number of pressing issues to address in the coming days. There are  three critically important things before us that need to be done very  quickly: pass disaster relief legislation to allow us to rebuild from  Harvey and prepare for future disasters headed our way, such as Irma;  prevent a default so those emergency resources can actually get to  Americans who need them; and, of course, keep the government funded.  These are the President's immediate priorities, these are my immediate  priorities, and they are critically important to establishing  credibility and stability as our country continues to recover from one  record-setting storm and prepare for yet another. Harvey has already  unleashed more rain than any other single storm recorded in the  continental United States. Irma has already forced the entire State of  Florida into a state of emergency.   I would like to repeat two quotes I shared that are even more  relevant now given the further approach of Irma. This is the  President's budget director:         Given the need for additional spending as a result of       disaster response and initial recovery from Hurricane Harvey,       the administration continues to urge the Congress to act       expeditiously to ensure that the debt ceiling does not affect       these critical response and recovery efforts.    That is the budget director.   That is because, as the Treasury Secretary explained, ``If Congress  appropriates the money, but I don't have the ability to borrow more  money and pay for it, we're not going to be able to get that money'' to  the States, and they need it. The need for certainty now is incredibly  important.   I have been having conversations with the Democratic leader on my  view of the way forward on these issues, and this morning he and I,  along with House leaders from both parties, will head to the White  House for a meeting to discuss the issues further. It is good to see  that Congress has already made steady progress.   I again thank the President and his team for working closely with us  to ensure that families and States are able to get the help they need  and for working with us to prevent a default or lapse in government  service that could get in the way of that help actually being  delivered.   As we work on these immediate priorities, Members will also continue  working on other critically important items, such as tax reform,  national security, and filling vacancies across the Federal Government.  We clearly have a lot to do in the coming weeks and months, but we will  all keep working to tackle these issues as soon as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the body  the message to accompany H.R. 601.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the House agree to the amendments numbered       1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 601)       entitled ``An Act to enhance the transparency and accelerate       the impact of assistance provided under the Foreign       Assistance Act of 1961 to promote quality basic education in       developing countries, to better enable such countries to       achieve universal access to quality basic education and       improved learning outcomes, to eliminate duplication and       waste, and for other purposes.'' and be it further        Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment numbered 6       of the Senate to the aforementioned bill, with an amendment.
