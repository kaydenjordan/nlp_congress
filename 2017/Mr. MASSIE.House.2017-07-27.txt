 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the retirement of  Judge Fred A. Stine, the Chief Circuit Court Judge of the 17th Judicial  Circuit in Campbell County, Kentucky.   Judge Stine graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1973, and  received his J.D. from the Salmon P. Chase College of Law at Northern  Kentucky University in 1978. He then worked in private practice for 2  years until his appointment as the Assistant United States Attorney for  the Eastern District of Kentucky.   Judge Stine has honorably served the Commonwealth as circuit court  judge since 2005. He has many awards, which include a Distinguished  Service Recognition from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and a  Special Recognition for Victims' Rights from the U.S. Department of  Justice.   Throughout his career and despite his heavy case docket, Judge Stine  selflessly gave his time to serve his community. Judge Stine is a true  public servant who has served his State and Nation well.   On behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and all of the citizens of  the Fourth District, I am honored to wish Judge Fred A. Stine the very  best in his retirement. Thank you from us all.                            ____________________
