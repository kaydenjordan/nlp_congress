 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the New York Times' latest reporting  tells us everything we need to know about why President Trump has  worked so hard to conceal his tax returns from the American people. The  President is a liar, a cheat, and a fraud. For years he marketed  himself as a self-made, successful businessman, but it is all an  illusion. Like the Wizard of Oz, behind the curtain is just a small,  petty fraud.   He made millions playing a billionaire businessman on TV, but in real  life, Donald Trump was racking up huge losses in debts that he then  used to get out of paying his fair share of Federal taxes. Call it tax  avoidance. Call it tax evasion. Call it whatever you want. The bottom  line is that Trump is no business genius. He is a con artist who thinks  that the rules don't apply to him.   The President managed to avoid paying any Federal income tax for 11  of 18 years, from 2000 to 2017, and then only paid $750 in 2016 and  2017. When I first read that in the New York Times, I thought there  must have been a typo. Surely there were zeros missing. I was wrong.  The page read right. Our self-proclaimed billionaire President paid  just $750 in Federal income taxes--$750. That is a heck of a lot less  than what essential workers supporting America throughout this pandemic  pay in taxes, like the grocery clerk in Newark, NJ, who makes $11 an  hour but owes about $1,060 in Federal taxes--$300 more than Donald  Trump. How about the nurse in Hackensack, NJ, working nights to save  patients with COVID-19, making $60,000 a year. She owes about $6,200 in  Federal income taxes--more than eight times what the President paid.   Most people would agree that is a problem with our economy. Americans  are working harder than ever for less. They are drowning in  skyrocketing healthcare, housing, childcare, and tuition bills. At the  end of the day, many middle-class New Jersey families still find  themselves owing money to Uncle Sam. Meanwhile, for rich people like  Donald Trump, the tax rate is the lowest it has been in decades, and  you can write off fancy haircuts and consulting fees paid to your own  daughter and all the losses you racked up running your business into  the ground.   I have to say, this is no surprise to most New Jerseyans. We watched  in horror as Donald Trump ran his Atlantic City casinos into the  ground, scamming hard-working contractors out of their pay and costing  the local economy thousands of jobs. Donald Trump was like a reverse  King Midas--everything he touched went bankrupt. Then after his string  of bankruptcies and broken promises to workers, Trump turned around and  got a $72.9 million bailout from the IRS--you heard me right, a $72.9  million bailout from the IRS. Most people I know think it is a good  year when they get $400 or $500 back from the Federal Government; this  scam artist got off with $72.9 million.   Yet Donald Trump isn't swimming in cash; he is drowning in debt. The  President is on the hook for approximately $421 million in loans, more  than $300 million of that coming due in the next 4 years. To get out of  the debt, the President is doing everything he can to profit off the  Presidency. Over the last 4 years, he has continued to make money off  foreign investments, rake in cash from special interests and foreign  officials at his Washington hotel, and charge the Federal Government  millions for the use of his properties. He could go anywhere. He could  go to Camp David. No. He goes to his properties, where millions--Secret  Service and other entities protect the President and help the President  whenever he leaves Washington. But he is always at his properties.   In spite of all this revenue, Trump is still badly in debt. It is no  surprise that intelligence experts are concerned about who is holding  it. They worry about the President's personal exposure to foreign  creditors and what that might mean for national security. Anyone else  in that much debt to foreign entities would have their security  clearances immediately revoked. Is this why Trump refuses to punish  Putin for putting bounties on the heads of U.S. soldiers? Is this why  he applauds dictators like Erdogan and sells out American allies like  the Kurds? Is this why he applauds dictators like Philippines President  Rodrigo Duterte for doing ``an unbelievable job''?   The bottom line is this: Who does Donald Trump owe those hundreds of  millions of dollars to, and how much do  [[Page S5891]]  they know about him and how deep are they into him?   For years, the President has fought to keep Americans in the dark.  Well, now we know why. He is a liar, a fraud, and a failed businessman  so deep in the red, he is a potential national security liability.   Let me close by quoting President Donald Trump in his own book, ``The  Art of the Deal.'' He said:         You can't con people, at least not for long. You can create       excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds       of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you       don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.    I only hope the American people are catching on.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me  first say that I want to be clear that my opposition that I will  announce briefly to moving this resolution by UC today is not by any  means because I disagree with the assessment of China's abhorrent human  rights record or the importance of the Olympics living up to the  highest standards of upholding human  [[Page S5926]]  dignity. The Olympic Charter states that the goal of Olympism is to  promote ``a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human  dignity.'' Beijing has not, by a long shot, earned the honor of hosting  the 2022 games.   Now, my record is crystal clear when it comes to calling out and  condemning China's horrific record on human rights and the threat it  poses to the United States and the rest of the international community.  As my colleagues know, during my years in Congress, I have introduced,  advocated for, and helped pass legislation on behalf of the people of  Xinjiang, Tibet, Chinese civil society dissidents, a democratic and  autonomous Hong Kong, and supporting democracy across the Indo-Pacific  region. Just recently, I introduced a comprehensive bill to strengthen  the United States across various sectors to best confront and counter  China's efforts. I also recently released a report about the necessity  of standing up against China's dangerous new digital authoritarianism.   There is no question that under Xi Jinping, China has taken a great  leap backward on human rights, establishing concentration camps in  Xinjiang, and instituting a surveillance state that not even George  Orwell could have imagined and crushing any thoughts and ideas that  deviate from the dictates of the party. China's rise, bringing hundreds  of millions out of poverty during the last century, is something the  Chinese people can be justly proud of. But Xi Jinping's dystopian  totalitarian vision, currently crushing the Chinese people, is one of  the century's great tragedies.   So I am very sympathetic to the goals of the resolution and the  sponsor of the legislation. However, I believe these issues merit  serious discussion in drafting of the appropriate language before the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I have been urging Chairman Risch  to hold a legislative markup for months to discuss the many pressing  pieces of legislation that Members on both sides of the aisle have had  pending for many months                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 549     Mr. President, I would, in response to the Senator's  request, say that there is a human rights crisis much closer to home  that we have discussed before the committee. We have an opportunity to  address people suffering from a dictatorship who are right here in the  United States, many of whom live in Senator Scott's State of Florida.   For the second time in 2 weeks, I would like to call upon this body  to take up legislation the House has passed that would designate  Venezuelans for temporary protected status. I am asking Republicans to  remember that there was a time before President Trump when our Nation  stood in solidarity with victims of dictatorship.   Nicolas Maduro is a dictator, plain and simple. His regime is a  cruel, criminal cabal that has destroyed Venezuela. Some 200,000  Venezuelans currently live in the United States without legal status.  They are unable to safely return to their homeland, and they would  benefit from temporary protected status. I believe we have to do the  right thing. We have to uphold American values and offer them  protection.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 549 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; further, that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed; and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object to this  modification, on these three amendments, I respect my colleague who  sits on the Foreign Relations Committee. We don't always agree, but I  always respectfully listen to him.   This effort that I am trying to bring to the floor, in line with  Senator Scott's question about human rights in China, is human rights  right here in our hemisphere. The amendments that the Senator proposes  seeks to basically gut the existing statute for temporary protected  status, and it distracts from other issues in our immigration system as  a price for providing Venezuelans with temporary protection in our  country. One of these amendments is aimed at making it nearly  impossible to renew TPS for foreign nationals, no matter the country or  the conditions in the country.    I would also note that this is at a time in which we have 131,000  with temporary protected status from other countries helping to support  the Nation as essential workers. So I object to the modification, and I  object to Senator Scott's motion.    Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my  colleague from Florida.   Let me just say, first, that we don't even need legislation for  Venezuelans to get TPS. Let's not lose sight of that.   President Trump, with a stroke of his pen, could give temporary-- temporary--protected status to the 200,000 Venezuelans who have fled  the Maduro regime--a regime that President Trump himself has signaled  out in every possible way as a regime that undermines the human rights  of its people and that attacks them. So we don't even need legislation.   The only reason the House of Representatives, with Democratic  majorities, passed legislation is to try to instigate the President to  go ahead and give TPS to Venezuelans.   Unfortunately, every time Senator Scott has come to offer what he  calls a reform of TPS, it is really basically the death of TPS. I don't  know why we have to deny those who presently have TPS and whose  country's status may not have changed--slaying their status in order to  give it to Venezuelans. I am not that Solomonic. So that is why there  has been an objection.   Again, I remind us that we don't even need legislation. President  Trump, with a stroke of his pen, could declare TPS for Venezuelans.  That is the first thing.   The second thing is, I would urge my colleagues and all my Republican  colleagues--by the way, I know that you all know this, but just to  remind us, you are in the majority. Chairman Risch is the chairman  because there is a Republican majority. Chairman Risch gets to call  when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee goes into a business  meeting. So as I have said to many of my colleagues, if you want to see  your legislation considered--and I certainly would agree to an agenda  that includes Senator Scott's legislation--urge Senator Risch to hold a  business meeting and a markup on legislation. That is the way this body  is supposed to work. Otherwise, then, let's just meet here as 100 and  make it the committee of the whole, where we can all opine and cast  amendments on Appropriations, Judiciary, Foreign Relations, Energy and  Commerce--the whole spectrum. But if the committee system is supposed  to mean anything, which is the concentration of those who have  dedicated their time to be on that committee and who have insights for  which legislation passes through, then it has to hold meetings and  markups to consider legislation. So it is not that you have to urge us;  you have to urge your colleague, the chairman, to hold markups to  consider your legislation.   I am sure that with some modifications, I would be one of those who  would support your legislation in committee. But we cannot have  everybody bypass the committee, come to the floor, and think that is  the way things are going to operate.   Yes, there are some things we would love to see in a timely fashion.  From the reading of several motions the majority leader made for  nominations, it sounds like we are going to be here next week. Well,  the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee could call a business  markup for next week. We could get your resolution on; we could get it  passed; and then we could get it to the floor. Why not? Why not?   Then, the last thing: I don't know what the Senator is referring to  in terms of stopping moneys going to Maduro. My VERDAD Act, which  became law--along with Senator Rubio and others--in essence tried to do  exactly that. But I am certainly happy to join with the Senator in any  efforts to continue to work on stopping any flow of money to the Maduro  regime and, more importantly, to reclaim the money that has already-- the national patrimony of Venezuela that has been spent elsewhere.   But let's be honest. TPS for Venezuelans could have happened already.  It could have happened yesterday. It could happen today, could happen  tomorrow if President Trump only wants to declare it so.   I think he should. I don't think we should have to pass legislation,  but that is where we are.   I yield the floor.    Has the Senator yielded the floor?    Mr. President, I won't stay the whole night debating my  colleague, although I would enjoy that. But let me just say, No. 1, he  has the power, as a colleague in the majority, to go to the chairman of  the Foreign Relations Committee and say: I really think this resolution  is timely and needs to be done.   We are going to be in session next week. The chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee can call a markup next week. For his resolution, I  will give him my word that I will support asking the chairman to put  his resolution on the business meeting, and, probably, with some  modifications, I would support it. But he needs to ask the chairman to  hold a markup, No. 1.   No. 2, the reality is that the concern about TPS not being  ``temporary''--well, that concern was vitiated. I don't know if it was  the Ninth or Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals that recently held a  decision that said the President of the United States can give TPS, and  he can end TPS, in his judgment. I don't necessarily agree with that  judicial decision, but, nonetheless, that is, right now, the law of the  land, so that concern is over.   The suggestion that we have to end TPS as we know it in order to make  sure that it only remains a temporary protected status--the courts have  determined that. They have said that the President can give TPS and can  take it away. So, as far as I learned in my civics lessons, the court  is the final law of the land in interpreting what it is that the law  is.   Lastly, I am going to look at--I would like the gentleman to get in  contact with--I don't know what legislation he keeps referring to that  somehow we blocked, but before the gentleman even arrived here, I have  been pursuing the Castro regime for 20-something years--since I was in  the House of Representatives, passing the LIBERTAD Act and so many  others--and, certainly, the Maduro regime as well. So I am happy to  look at that.   But let's get the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to hold  a markup, and I think we can solve a lot of these problems.   With that, I yield the floor.
