 Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about the  border--not the important need to secure the border, which I am for,  but I want to talk about the humanitarian crisis we have seen occurring  at the border. Frankly, the Senate and the House--the Congress--have  been watching that occur for too long.   It has been several weeks now since the administration notified  Congress that the money that was allocated for what would have been a  traditional set of challenges at the border is about to be spent and  that there is no money left for some of these issues we have to deal  with at the border in a particular way.   We have seen the flood of people approaching the border to be not  only incredibly different in numbers but incredibly different in  context. Probably 20 years ago, 90 percent of the people who came  across the border were coming directly from Mexico.   By the way, when that happened, the law was changed so that if they  came across from Mexico, you could send them right back to Mexico.  Hopefully, our neighbors in Mexico are working with us to still have  some potential to do that with people who come across the border and  come through Mexico--not necessarily Mexican in their nationality but  come through Mexico to the border--to go back and wait for what needs  to happen for their case to be heard in Mexico rather than here.   Most of the people coming today are coming from Central America-- Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. In the last year, I think the  principal place that has people coming to our southern border--over 1  percent of the population of all three of those countries has come from  those countries collectively.   Clearly it is a problem, but it is especially troubling to look at  the numbers of children who are coming to the border unaccompanied.  Just last month, about 130,000 people came to the border. You can  multiply that by 12 pretty quickly and see 1 million people or more  coming to our border to come in without the right kinds of documents.  Another million, by the way, come into  [[Page S3343]]  our country through the normal process. We have about 1 million  immigrants a year who legally immigrate to the United States. We are  not a country that does not want people from other countries to come  here; we just want them to come here based on the law and the  requirements for everybody else who would like to come to the United  States.   Of that 130,000 people who came in May, 11,507 of them were children  without families. It is really important for us to understand as we  discuss this that we are not talking about children who came with their  families and were separated from their families once they got here.  There are plenty of those children coming right now with families  because it is pretty clear that saying you want asylum and saying you  have children with you and your family is one of the things that check  a couple of boxes that more likely will have you in the United States  waiting for your case to be heard sooner rather than later. But these  are 11,507 children who came by themselves. About 30 percent of them  are under 12, and about 70 percent of them are between 12 and 18.   You have 11,000 children coming a month. We think in the calendar  year, that will be about 88,000 children--not in the calendar year but  in the fiscal year, the spending year, the year that started October 1.  We already believe that number is going to approach 88,000.   Usually, within 72 hours of those children showing up at the border  by themselves, the Department of Homeland Security transfers them to  the Department of Health and Human Services, which is much better  positioned to take care of them than they otherwise would be. The  Department of Health and Human Services enters into agreements with  Lutheran charities, Catholic charities, and other groups--almost always  not-for-profit--that would provide shelter on a clearly understood  basis. This is something where HHS knows the kinds of housing these  children are going into, provides shelter, provides medical care, and  provides other services, such as education, that are provided by these  groups that contract with us. As part of their goal, they also make an  effort to find a safe and appropriate place as soon as possible for  these kids to be with relatives who are already in the country or an  alternative that would be appropriate.   Of the 14,000 or so spaces that we have--beds is one way to look at  this, places to sleep--people are going into and out of those as soon  as we can find somewhere safe for them to go. So, ideally, children  would stay a very short time in one of these facilities while the  Department of Health and Human Services, working with that security  provider--security for the children--finds a sponsor. Again, it is  usually a family member. But other people stay a long time.   The older teenagers tend to be harder to place, frankly. For some of  the Central American countries, they don't have the family connections  that immigrants at the border have had in the past, so there is no  family to put them with. Some of these older teenagers wind up staying  longer than they would want to or that we would hope that they would  have to, but it is just the way it is.   Of those 11,507 kids who came to the border in the month of May, a  few of them may have been in the facility for less than a day. Some of  them may still be in the facility they went to because there is nowhere  safer than that for them to go right now.   The problem is that Health and Human Services is running out of  space, and they are also running out of money. In April, Secretary  Azar, the head of Health and Human Services, came to Congress and said:  I just want to give you a warning. We are going to be out of money on  this current pace by sometime in June.   By the way, we are now in June, and Congress has not stepped up and  done what is necessary to take care of these kids.   Let's think about all the alternatives that can happen. One of the  alternatives is you just provide less assistance. Maybe the education  goes first and the recreation time goes second, and you wait longer to  get into the transitional space that we would want you to be in, and  you are waiting more than 72 hours.   The other alternative is totally unacceptable, which would be what  you would do with people who are over 18. You say: OK, if you are 18 or  28 or 38, we will hear your case at some future time. We are going to  release you into the United States, and you come back at a future time,  and we will hear whether there is merit. We will decide your case at  that time.   Well, you can't release a 12-, 13-, or 14-year-old boy or girl into  the United States and hope that is going to be a good thing for them to  have happen to them. With the inadequate funding, they stay in  facilities with the Border Patrol longer than anybody would want them  to.   As I said, the administration estimates that by the end of  September--that would be the end of our spending year, the one we have  allocated money for--there will be about 88,000 kids who have come  across the border by themselves, and the American people would want you  to take care of them until you can find a safe place for them to be. No  thinking American would say: Well, just let them go back across the  border by themselves. Let them out in the United States and see what  happens to them. Nobody would think that.   That is 88,000. The previous high was 59,000 in 2016. It looks like  already we are probably just about to get to that number right now.  With the time between now and September 30 left in the spending year,  we have already had more kids come than we had in the previous high  year.   Congress, which appropriated money for what we thought would probably  be no more than 59,000 kids during the course of the year, didn't  appropriate enough money. So we knew we might not appropriate enough  money, so we had a transfer authority, where you could take some  money--up to a certain amount--from other accounts, and you could  transfer that into the account to take care of more kids than we would  have thought. That money is gone too.   The Department is being forced to cut back on some of the things they  have tried to provide for children who have come into our care through  certainly no fault of ours and maybe not much fault of theirs-- redirecting money from programs like refugee programs that are designed  to help people who come truly as refugees. That money is now being used  for unaccompanied children.   Remember, Health and Human Services is legally required to take care  of these children but is also legally required not to spend money they  don't have. If Congress doesn't act quickly--and we intend to act on  this bill within a week--HHS, the Department of Health and Human  Services, will have to tell the grantees--these normally not-for-profit  organizations--well, if you just keep taking care of these kids, at  some point we will give you the money we had agreed to give you to take  care of these kids. But between now and then, you spend the money and  hope you will be reimbursed. It is kind of like a government shutdown,  except just for this one group of people--unaccompanied children. It is  a government shutdown. There is going to be no money available. These  critical services--you go to the outside groups that have been willing  to step forward and provide shelter, and you say: Just keep providing  the shelter, and we will pay you if we can. Some of these groups may  have all kinds of money and be able to afford to do that. My guess is,  not so much so, and not many of them will have.   So we need to step up. We need to adapt to this change in  circumstances that we didn't anticipate. We anticipate that as many  people might come as has ever came before, but we didn't anticipate  that maybe 30 percent more people would come in this category than ever  came before.   In the disaster bill we just passed--by the way, this is a shameful  thing to have to say--it took over 8 months for Congress to cover the  disasters that Congress has normally covered right away. Health and  Human Services has asked for money in an emergency funding situation to  take care of this. Congress should take this request seriously and pass  this funding before there is no money from any source to take care of  even the basic needs that these unaccompanied kids in our country need  to have taken care of.  [[Page S3344]]    Over the weekend and 2 weeks before, the New York Times--which is no  advocate, by the way, for the Trump administration--basically said:  Give the administration the money. This is a legitimate crisis, and it  needs to be treated like that.   In their last editorial, they said: ``Unequipped to deal with the  crush, border facilities and migrant shelters are dangerously  overcrowded, and the staff is overburdened.'' They went on to say:  ``Dysfunction, disease, and even death are a growing reality.'' The  Washington Post said the same thing.   Let's deal with this immediate humanitarian crisis. Let's deal with  it like the people whom we work for expect us to deal with this. Let's  get this humanitarian crisis taken care of before we see a human  catastrophe occur. I hope we can do it, and I hope we can do it  quickly.   With that, I yield the floor.                          nomination of rodney smith     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes  following the first vote in this series be 10 minutes in length.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
