 Mr. Speaker, I have had many heroes since I moved to  Houston: Neil Armstrong, Earl Campbell, Nolan Ryan. My newest hero is a  good friend, 93Q morning disc jockey Kevin Kline.   Kevin and his wife, Trish, have watched a teenage friend, Chelsey,  die from cancer. They turned that pain into extreme good. They started  the Snowdrop Foundation to stop kids dying from cancer like Chelsey.  They have used long runs to raise over $1 million for Snowdrop.   Movie hero Forrest Gump ran for 3 years, 2 months, and 15 days.  Recently in Italy, our real-life hero Kevin ran for 178.5 miles in 47  hours and 28 minutes.   Naval aviators are given call signs. Tom Cruise was Maverick. I was  Pistol. By the powers vested in me by the 93Q's Tim Tuttle and Erica  Rico, Kevin Kline's on-air call sign is now and forever Gump Man.   I hope Gump Man is smiling. I know Chelsey and her friends are  smiling in heaven.                            ____________________
