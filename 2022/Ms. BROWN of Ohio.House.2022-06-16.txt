 Madam Speaker, rising prices at the pump and at  the supermarket are costing families more each month, and higher prices  are falling hardest on low-income families, who spend a larger share of  their budget on food and gas.   Since the beginning of the year, gas prices have increased by nearly  $2. No doubt, this is in part due to Putin's war in Ukraine, but it is  also driven by oil and gas companies raising prices on consumers.   Last month, the House passed the Gas Price Gouging Prevention Act to  institute the first Federal law against profiteering by oil and gas  companies. Today, the House considered and passed legislation to make  cheaper and cleaner ethanol blends more available.   These commonsense measures would get gas prices under control and put  money back in families' pockets.                            ____________________
