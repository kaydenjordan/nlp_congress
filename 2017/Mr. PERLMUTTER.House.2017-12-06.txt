 Mr. Speaker, I can't think of a more breathtaking  display of nerve or brass than what the Republican majority is doing  with this bill.   After the tragedies we have suffered in Las Vegas and in Orlando, in  Aurora, Colorado, that I represent, to race to the bottom to have the  easiest laws--and no offense to Georgia, but Georgia has no business  and no right to tell Colorado what its laws concerning the health,  safety, and welfare of Coloradans should be under the 10th Amendment.   Instead of taking up real legislation on assault weapons or bump  stocks that make those assault weapons machine guns that mowed down all  those people in Las Vegas, we are saying: No. Whatever State has the  weakest, most lax gun laws, then that State is going to control all the  other States. That is wrong, that is unconstitutional, and this bill  should be rejected right here and right now.
