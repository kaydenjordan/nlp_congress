 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to  thank the rabbi for coming to the Capitol today to share with us a time  in prayer, a time when we often need it.   America has been through many battles. We have many debates. But we  always come out strong, and we come out together, at the end of the  day.   I thank the rabbi for his kind prayer and thoughtfulness as we  proceed forward as a Nation.                            ____________________
