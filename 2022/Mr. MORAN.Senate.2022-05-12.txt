 Mr. President, this week, our Nation observes National  Police Week, a time when we pay tribute to our brave law enforcement  officers and honor those who died in the line of duty.   Over the course of this week, Americans will come together to pay  tribute to the 619 officers who gave their lives in the line of duty  last year. Among them, six brave officers from Kansas will be  memorialized on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in  Washington, DC.   Thousands travel to our Nation's Capital to honor those who have paid  the ultimate sacrifice during this ceremony, and back home, Kansans  will gather to honor the men and women who put on a uniform each day to  protect the communities we call home.   One officer Kansans will gather to pay tribute to next week is  Captain Clay Germany of the Wichita Police Department. Captain Germany  was a U.S. Navy veteran and started his law enforcement career serving  with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office and the Midwest City Police  Department. He then dedicated 27 years to serving with the Wichita  Police Department and, throughout his time, served as police officer,  detective, sergeant, lieutenant, and captain.   Captain Germany earned a reputation for being a trusted leader and  mentor within the community and in the department, always willing to  lend a helping hand. On behalf of Kansas, I want to express my  gratitude for his service. Captain Germany's dedication helped make  Wichita a better and safer community.   I also want to recognize Wichita Police Department Officer Kyle  Mellard, who was shot when responding to a welfare check in June of  last year. After fighting for his life, Officer Mellard is able to walk  again, a recovery that his fellow officers call a miracle. Despite his  severe injuries, when talking about his recovery, Officer Mellard made  his goal clear: to get back to work as an officer as soon as possible.   All too often, we forget about the many important roles that our  police officers have within our communities. This extends beyond  relationships between police officers and individual residents. It is  about the relationships between law enforcement and key institutions in  our communities, such as churches, hospitals, schools, and businesses.   During Police Week, we honor those we have lost, but we also remember  the families they left behind. May God comfort them in their time of  grief and be a source of strength for them.   May God bless our law enforcement officers and protect them from harm  as they faithfully perform their duties each and every day.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week, leaders across Washington  have gathered to celebrate our Team USA Olympic and Paralympic athletes  during the 2022 Winter Games. In that spirit, today, I want to both  recognize and congratulate Lieutenant Commander and Kansan Dan Cnossen  on his recent gold medal victory for the United States in the mixed  relay cross-country event at the 2022 Paralympic Winter Games.   While this accomplishment itself is worthy of our praise, it is Dan's  journey leading up to this remarkable achievement that renders this  feat all the more outstanding and commendable.   A fifth-generation Kansas farm kid and graduate of Shawnee Heights  High School in Tecumseh, Dan attended the U.S. Naval Academy,  completing the rigorous and physically excruciating BUD/S program to  commission as a Navy SEAL. He reached the rank of lieutenant commander  and was serving as a platoon commander for Seal Team ONE in Afghanistan  where his life was forever changed as a result of his service to our  Nation.   In September of 2009, Lieutenant Commander Cnossen was severely  injured when he stepped on an IED in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He was 29  years old. He woke up 8 days later to learn that both of his legs had  been amputated just above the knee.   Imagine that. Imagine waking up back in the U.S. to realize the life  you always knew and the future you had envisioned had changed forever.  Imagine being one of the most physically and mentally advanced  soldiers, only to have that change in an instant--because of one single  step.   Despite the extent of his injuries and though his life had changed  forever, Dan did not give up. Or, as his fellow SEALS would say, he  never ``rang the bell.'' Dan relearned how to walk with new and  unfamiliar prosthetic legs and attacked every opportunity in life with  vigor and determination. But the road was long, and it was never  steady. Not giving up was a choice that had to be made each moment of  each day.  [[Page S2490]]    In a moving article from the Washington Post that covers Cnossen's  journey, author Dave Sheinin writes: ``What pulled him through was the  same brick-by-brick mentality that had gotten him through Hell Week  years earlier and the first few weeks after the injury, as well as a  relentless positivity that had allowed him to convince himself that was  a winning strategy.''   Following his injury, Dan excelled as an athlete because of this  exceptionally tough mental fortitude, winning seven Paralympic medals,  including two gold medals, over three Winter Games. Lieutenant  Commander Cnossen's success during his service and in this next chapter  in athletics is more than worthy of our praise and serves as a reminder  to each of us the sacrifice of our veterans as well as sets an example  for overcoming adversity in our lives.   Dan himself said, ``You learn during Hell Week that whatever you  thought your limits were, they're actually further away than that.''   Lieutenant Commander Cnossen's journey has been an inspiration to me  and to Kansans and continues to inspire athletes everywhere.   I extend the warmest congratulations to him on his outstanding  performance at the 2022 Paralympic Winter Games, and wish him the very  best in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
