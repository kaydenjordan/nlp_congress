 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  American Dream and Promise Act.   As an immigrant myself who came to America alone at the age of 16 and  who spent a decade in the immigrant rights movement before coming to  Congress, I stand with the Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients who have  courageously proclaimed ``undocumented and unafraid'' in the streets  and Halls of Congress and built this movement for justice.   These Dreamers, TPS, and DED holders have lived in the shadows for  too long, doing our Nation's essential work while living a life of  uncertainty and fear every day.   Mr. Speaker, Congress--we--right here and right now can change that.  We can stand up for our 4.4 million essential community members who  have made the United States home. We can legislate what they deserve,  which is a roadmap to citizenship and a future of hope, opportunity,  and contribution.   Let's stop the hypocrisy of criminalizing immigrants. Let's give  recognition and hope today. Vote ``aye'' on the American Dream and  Promise Act.
