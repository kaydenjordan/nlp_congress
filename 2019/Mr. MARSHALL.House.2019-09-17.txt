 Mr. Speaker, on September 15, we began National  Hispanic Heritage Month, one that celebrates the histories, cultures,  and contributions of Americans of Hispanic descent.   I recently learned the story of a former Kansas City resident, the  late Hector Berretto, Sr., who served as a voice for his local Hispanic  community. Hector founded the Kansas City Hispanic Chamber of Commerce  and, later, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, to counter  disadvantages of Hispanic business owners in the Kansas City area and  around the country.   The Hispanic population in the United States contributes enormously  to our country, both culturally and economically. Most of the Hispanic  individuals I have had the pleasure of knowing, many of them patients  of mine, have been remarkably dedicated to faith and family and  preserving their own culture centered around faith and family.   Many of my OB patients were Hispanic women, often accompanied by  their loving mothers, grandmothers, sisters, and aunts concerned for  the health of their family member and the baby. Every visit was a  family event of great importance to the family.    Now numbering over 55 million individuals, the Hispanic American  population is projected to combine for an estimated buying power of  $1.7 trillion in 2020. Hispanics are more likely than average Americans  to open a business. Now with over 3.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses  in the United States, millions more American workers have jobs, thanks  to these industrious entrepreneurs.   I am grateful for this opportunity to reflect on the unique  contributions of the Hispanic American community to our great Nation  and to Kansas. I look forward to continuing working with communities of  all backgrounds in pursuit of our shared goal of a free and equal  America, an America where anyone can live the American Dream if they  are willing to work hard enough.              Democrats Will Do Anything to Stop President Trump     Mr. Speaker, rather than focusing on bipartisan trade  agreements, Congress is being put on pause for a charade, a charade  that hopes to undo the will of American voters.   Democrats aren't sure what they are doing in the Judiciary Committee  today. You might hear that it is an impeachment inquiry, a meeting  about rules for impeachment, or, perhaps, a group therapy session.   We know Democrats are more interested in tearing down the President  than in building up America. They will do anything to stop President  Trump at any cost.   Democrats want to throw the brakes on a thriving economy. They want  to turn back the clock on record-low unemployment in Hispanic and  African American communities, tax cuts for families and small  businesses, and more, all in the name of bitter politics after a loss.  They, the Democrats, embody the term ``poor loser.''   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were to abandon their  tired and baseless attacks on the President, we could move forward in a  bipartisan way to pass the USMCA trade deal, secure our borders, and  reform our very broken immigration system. We can work on lowering the  costs of prescription drugs and healthcare.   Americans desperately need Congress to deliver these solutions.  Unfortunately, House Democrats have chosen  [[Page H7719]]  political divisiveness over the American people, party over country,  and hate over hope and possibility.   Republicans stand ready and waiting for Democrats to finish their  infighting and impeachment circus. We stand ready to work with them to  pass USMCA and further our economic prosperity. But until they are done  playing political games with impeachment, we, and the American people,  will be forced to wait, and all America is the loser.                            ____________________
