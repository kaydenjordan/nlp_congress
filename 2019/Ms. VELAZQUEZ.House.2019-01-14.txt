 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 116) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to  increase the amount that certain banks and savings associations may  invest in small business investment companies, subject to the approval  of the appropriate Federal banking agency, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 116         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Main Street Act       of 2019''.       SEC. 2. INVESTMENT IN SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES.         Section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958       (15 U.S.C. 682(b)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting before the period the       following: ``or, subject to the approval of the appropriate       Federal banking agency, 15 percent of such capital and       surplus'';        (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting before the period the       following: ``or, subject to the approval of the appropriate       Federal banking agency, 15 percent of such capital and       surplus''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Appropriate federal banking agency defined.--For       purposes of this subsection, the term `appropriate Federal       banking agency' has the meaning given that term under section       3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 116, the Investing in Main  Street Act of 2019.   Since 1958, the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, program has  been an integral part of SBA's mission to provide small businesses with  capital and create jobs. It achieves this purpose by partnering private  and public investments in early-stage startup businesses.   In fact, in 2016, the SBIC program provided $6 billion in financing  to 1,200 small businesses and helped sustain over 120,000 jobs. It has  afforded America's small businesses an invaluable opportunity to grow  their innovative ideas.   Just look at Apple, Tesla, and FedEx. They have all achieved what we  hope for every small business: extraordinary growth and success. And  they each received early-stage financing from SBICs.   One of the SBIC program's greatest strengths is its hands-off  approach, giving fund managers the autonomy to invest in almost any  business sector they choose, from apparel to cutting-edge technology.  This freedom, coupled with sound investment strategies, has led to its  success.   Access to capital remains the number one priority for small firms  across America. The SBIC program has helped increase the flow of  capital to worthy small companies, yet we can do more to ensure they  can meet growing demand.   H.R. 116 will strengthen and grow the SBIC program by letting banks  and Federal savings associations invest up to 15 percent of their  holdings into SBICs. This increase in capital, at no cost to the  taxpayers, provides entrepreneurs with enhanced opportunities to grow  their businesses and create jobs.   The goal of the SBIC program is to fill the gap between the  availability of venture capital and the needs of small  [[Page H523]]  businesses in startup and growth situations. Today's bill makes a  sensible change to address this goal by facilitating increased  investment in small firms.   I applaud Congresswoman Chu in identifying this issue and finding a  solution. I, therefore, ask my fellow Members to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), author of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, access to capital is the lifeblood of every small  business. The SBIC program fills the gap between the availability of  venture capital and the needs of small businesses in startup and growth  situations.   The SBIC program has long been an important way of channeling capital  to leading-edge, high-growth companies. In fact, some of the Nation's  most successful corporations received early-stage financing from SBICs.  Without it, they may not be the companies they are today.   The key to the program's success is leveraging Federal funds to  increase the amount of private capital invested in such promising  startup companies. With more than $24 billion of capital under  management, the SBIC program has a proven track record of success.   Creating parity in the SBIC program by raising the investment  threshold from 5 percent to 15 percent will result in significant small  business investment; and like we all know, providing funds to small  firms results in real growth in our local communities.   H.R. 116 has bipartisan support, and it is endorsed by the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce. As such, I once again urge my colleagues to  support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 246) to amend the Small Business Act to require senior  procurement executives, procurement center representatives, and the  Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization to assist small  business concerns participating in the Small Business Innovation  Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 246         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 246, the Stimulating  Innovation Through Procurement Act of 2019.   For more than 30 years, the Small Business Innovation Research and  Small Business Technology Transfer programs, or SBIR and STTR programs  as we call them, have provided a critical source of funding to small  businesses that engage in research and development.                                time  1615    The result is higher rates of business formation and job creation,  something we can all be proud of.   For the U.S. economy, the SBIR and STTR programs are important to  employment in scientific and technical fields. Initially, companies  must hire individuals to carry out the research  [[Page H525]]  and development. If research is commercialized, however, sustainable  jobs can be created as products are moved to market.   This ingenuity is what makes America a global economic powerhouse.  Since its establishment, these programs have helped launch tens of  thousands of successful research projects in a wide variety of  industries. Yet, small, high-growth firms often face a disconnect when  attempting to transfer their SBIR technologies to precision programs.   Today's measure, H.R. 246, bridges this gap and aids small business  concerns in commercializing their technology when obtaining government  contracts. Statutorily amending the role of acquisition personnel to  assist companies in the SBIR and STTR programs levels the playing field  for innovative businesses competing in the Federal marketplace.   Closing this gap doesn't just help our government secure the best  technologies and ideas; it grows our local communities where many small  SBIR- and STTR-funded firms operate.   I applaud the bipartisanship of Ms. Finkenauer, a freshman Member of  Congress, and Mr. Curtis in their efforts to increase participation of  small, innovative companies within the Federal marketplace by  guaranteeing them the same assistance other small firms receive from  contracting officers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Ms. Finkenauer), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms.  Finkenauer) and the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis) for introducing  today's bill to spur increased contracting activity in the SBIR and  STTR programs.   The SBIR program has helped thousands of small, innovative firms with  good ideas to compete for Federal research and development awards.  Their  [[Page H526]]  success has a proven record in a diverse range of fields, including:  defense, health, energy, and technology.   H.R. 246, the Stimulating Innovation through Procurement Act of 2019,  enables more SBIR and STTR businesses to reach their potential. It  directs procurement center representatives and senior procurement  executives in agencies to assist small business concerns in the SBIR  and STTR programs, and coordinates with appropriate agency procurement  officials.   This bill will open the Federal marketplace to more small, high- growth companies through increased technical assistance and advocacy,  ensuring our country remains a leader in innovation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 206) to amend the small business laws to create certain  requirements with respect to the SBIR and STTR program, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 206, the Encouraging Small  Business Innovation Act of 2019. For almost 40 years, our Nation has  experienced increased innovation and job creation through the Small  Business Innovation Research program and the Small Business Technology  Transfer program.   As a direct result of these programs, breakthroughs have been made in  a wide range of sectors, from agriculture,  [[Page H527]]  to energy, and most notably, healthcare. Research conducted by SBIR and  STTR awardees has helped address our country's most important  technological and research-based challenges while generating tremendous  economic growth and employment opportunities.   These programs encourage small firms, where much of today's cutting- edge ideas are born, to explore their potential while also providing  the incentive to profit from its commercialization.   Yet, as with any program, improvements can be made to further  strengthen the program and its impact on our economy.   By incentivizing more experienced SBIR and STTR firms to mentor newer  companies and rewarding mentors through a past-performance rating  increase, Congressman Rouda's legislation, H.R. 206, positively  promotes integrating these program participants into the larger Federal  marketplace.   Just as we are concerned with the broader ability of SBIR and STTR  firms to compete more broadly, it is important to ensure the  participation of all businesses within the program. Just like with  geography, when it comes to demographics, it is important that the SBIR  and STTR are serving all entrepreneurs.   This measure requires participating agencies to use part of their  SBIR allocation to conduct outreach to minorities and underrepresented  States by removing the waiver of this requirement from the statute.  Doing so, guarantees that a wide range of ideas are provided the  opportunity to thrive.                                time  1630    Finally, H.R. 206 requires an annual summit of these agencies to  share best practices to improve data collection and streamline  processes across the programs. As a result, I believe this bill is  crucial to modernizing the program and preserving our Nation's  competitiveness.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Rouda), who is the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Rouda) for introducing today's bill to increase the assistance to SBIR  and STTR firms.   Since their inception, over $40 billion in awards have been made,  proving their success as a funding source for small innovative firms.   As we have done before, we must ensure the longevity of the program  by guaranteeing it reflects modern R&D practices. It must also optimize  participation through mentorship incentives and Phase 3 awards, in  addition to including small business investment companies in the SBIR  and STTR programs to stimulate investment.   This bill achieves this goal and guarantees the program meets the  needs of our next generation of SBIR and STTR firms. H.R. 206 makes  certain that the program remains a catalyst for not just innovation,  but also the economic empowerment and job creation that is associated  with these scientific advances.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 190) to amend the Small Business Act to eliminate the  inclusion of option years in the award price for sole source contracts,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 190         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 190, the Expanding Contracting  Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2019.   The Small Businesses Act sets forth a governmentwide 23 percent goal  of Federal contracts that should be awarded to small businesses. Each  Federal agency is charged with setting its own small business goals,  which are to reflect the maximum possible opportunity for small  business within that agency.   Regrettably, small firms face barriers in securing Federal contracts.  According to the SBA, small businesses won $105.6 billion in contracts  during fiscal year 2016, representing 23.88 percent of total Federal  contract dollars. That is why the Small Business Act gives agencies the  ability to limit, or set aside, contracts for small businesses to bid  and compete against one another.  [[Page H530]]    The SBA administers several set-asides that are designed to increase  the participation of several socioeconomic categories, including the  8(a) program, HUBZone program, women-owned, and service-disabled  veteran-owned small business programs.   While most contracts are awarded through competition, sole source  contracts also exist if certain criteria are met. However, current sole  source awards have become complex and underutilized in recent years.  They do not represent the changing nature of Federal contract awards  and have become outdated. H.R. 190 raises the dollar amount of sole  source awards to reflect modern contract awards.   I applaud Mr. Marshall and his cosponsor, Mr. Schneider, for  introducing this bill providing flexibility to contracting officers  when awarding sole source contracts under SBA contracting programs.   By promoting the use of sole source contracts to small businesses,  this bill adds to the government's pool of suppliers. This results in  higher quality goods and increased job creation for the economy, as  these direct awards require the small business to do the majority of  the work and not subcontract out.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), who is a cosponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Kansas as well as the  gentleman from Illinois for introducing this important legislation to  provide flexibility to contracting officers when awarding sole source  contracts.   H.R. 190 promotes the use of sole source contracts to small business  concerns through the SBA contracting programs by raising the dollar  threshold of these contract types to account for inflation.   It promotes and preserves a strong, competitive marketplace for our  Federal agencies while also strengthening the ability of women,  service-disabled veterans, and socioeconomic businesses to participate  with the single largest purchaser of goods and services in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H531]]    The yeas and nays were ordered.
