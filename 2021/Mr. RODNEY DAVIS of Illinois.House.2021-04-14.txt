 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the former city of Bloomington council member, mayor, and McLean County  board member, Mr. Richard Buchanan. He was a clearly dedicated public  servant who dedicated more than four decades of his life to serving the  taxpayers. Sadly, Rich passed away on March 30.   Rich grew up in Clinton, and graduated from Northern Illinois  University, where he met the love of his life, Judy. After graduation,  Richard spent 6 years serving his country in the U.S. Army Reserve.  Outside of public service, he had an enduring career spanning 30 years  at State Farm and raised three children alongside Judy. His leadership  to Bloomington and McClean County will truly be missed.   My prayers are with his wife, Judy, his children, and all those who  called Richard a friend.                  In Remembrance of Patricia Everhart Reese     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  Patricia Everhart Reese of Taylorville, a teacher and beloved community  member, and my friend, who passed away on November 3, 2020.   Pat taught with the Taylorville School District for many years and  was influential with the development of the Lincoln Land Literacy  Program. She also spent time teaching at the Taylorville Correctional  Center.   Pat, of course, took on many other roles in the community. One, being  mentor to me, and also, she was the First Lady of Taylorville for 16  years and the Republican County chairwoman for 25 years, but her  service never stopped.   Pat leaves a lasting impact on the Taylorville community and will be  remembered as a great friend to so many.   My prayers are with her husband, Dan, and their entire family at this  time.                         Recognizing Patty Hornbuckle     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Patty Hornbuckle for her leadership and service to Taylorville and  Christian County, Illinois.   I had the privilege to work with Patty in her role as the CEO of the  Greater Taylorville Chamber of Commerce. The chamber is the driving  force to attract new businesses, residents, and tourists in our  hometown.   During Patty's tenure, the chamber experienced significant growth in  membership and increase in revenue through fundraising and the  expansion of the chamber's signature event, ``The Taylorville  Chilifest.''   Patty is certainly going to be missed. While we will miss her, her  leadership has set up the chamber to continue its successful service to  our community for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to send my heartfelt congrats to my friend,  Patty, her husband, Greg, and also her family.                        In Remembrance of John Curtin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  John Curtin of Taylorville.   John was my neighbor, a farmer, and active community member, who was  our longtime county board chair, and he passed away on March 10 of  2021.   John began farming in Christian County in 1957. He served 12 years as  the cattle superintendent at the Illinois State Fair and president of  the Illinois Angus Association. In 1984, he was designated master  farmer by Prairie Farmer.   John was a dedicated servant and leader to his community. And as I  mentioned, he served on the county board as chair, but he was on the  board for 40 years. The Taylorville Chamber of Commerce awarded him  with a lifetime achievement award in recognition of his community  service.   John was a fellow parishioner within the Holy Trinity Catholic parish  as part of St. Mary's in Stonington, in Taylorville, and his legacy  will be remembered forever.   My prayers are with his brothers, six children, grandchildren, and  great grandchildren.                            Honoring Todd Hanneken     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Illinois  [[Page H1740]]  State Trooper, Todd Hanneken, of Decatur, Illinois, who lost his life  on March 25.   Todd fulfilled his lifelong dream of becoming a state trooper. He was  a 20-year veteran of the Illinois State Police and always went above  and beyond the call of duty.   In 2018, Todd was awarded the Illinois State Police Medal of Honor  for heroic actions he took to rescue a man out of a burning car,  ultimately saving that man's life.   For so many, Todd was more than a state trooper. He was a husband,  father, son, brother, and beloved friend. Those that knew Todd will  remember him for his kindness and compassion. Todd cared deeply about  his community, always wanting to help others in need.   A tragic accident took Todd's life, and my prayers are with his  friends and family, both at home and with the State Police, and  particularly his wife, Shelley; and sons, Ben and Nick. Todd was a hero  in every sense of the word and will truly be missed.                            ____________________
