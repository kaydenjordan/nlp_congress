 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to an extreme  abortion ban that North Carolina Republicans passed through the general  assembly after overriding Governor Cooper's veto this week.   Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade nearly a year ago,  North Carolina has become a safe haven for  [[Page H2444]]  women seeking reproductive care across the South. As States like  Georgia and Florida enacted dangerous 6-week bans, North Carolina stood  as a bastion for women's reproductive freedom.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans in my State are now turning the clock back  50 years by enacting a dangerous abortion ban and restrictions on  providing healthcare.   The truth is women will suffer and doctors will be penalized under  this dangerous law. We will not stay silent in the face of attacks on  our rights and our healthcare.                            ____________________
