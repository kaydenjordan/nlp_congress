 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, at this point, I call up my amendment  No. 999 and ask that it be reported by number.    For decades now, Russia has flooded America's uranium  market. Russia has driven America's nuclear fuel suppliers out of  business. Russia now supplies 24 percent of our enriched uranium  imports. Russia is our third largest supplier. We spend nearly $1  billion each year on Russian uranium. Russia uses these revenues to  fund its invasion of Ukraine.   Here in America, we have the resources to fuel our own reactors. My  amendment authorizes the Department of Energy to take the steps  necessary to expand U.S. nuclear fuel production.   The Energy Committee passed this legislation by voice vote in May.  The Senate passed this legislation by voice vote last December. It was  included in last year's Senate Defense bill.   I would like to thank Senator Manchin, Senator Risch, Senator Mark  Warner, Senator Budd, and Senator Coons for their effort and their  support and cosponsorship on this critical issue.  [[Page S3718]]    I urge you to support this bipartisan amendment.   I yield back all time.                          Vote on Amendment No. 999     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Bradley  Williams, a detailee in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the Congress.
