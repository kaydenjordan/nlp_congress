 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the storied career of Admiral Craig Faller, commander of the  U.S. Southern Command.   Admiral Faller is a native of Fryburg, Pennsylvania, a small town  located in Clarion County, in Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District.   His naval career started in 1983, following his graduation from the  U.S. Naval Academy with a degree in systems engineering. From there, he  went on to serve during the Gulf war.   During his service, Admiral Faller has held a variety of posts and  positions, from supporting the United Nations' sanctions against Iraq  and the humanitarian efforts following the devastating tsunami off  Indonesia to supporting Operations New Dawn and Enduring Freedom. His  service took him all over the world.   Regardless of location, either on the sea or shore, Admiral Faller  consistently provided leadership and guidance.    Admiral Faller currently serves as commander of the U.S. Southern  Command and will be retiring from the Navy at the end of this month.   Admiral Faller, thank you for your service to the United States of  America. Your dedication to our country is admirable. Enjoy your  retirement. You deserve it.                            ____________________
