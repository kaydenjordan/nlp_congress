 Mr. Speaker, you know, the clock keeps ticking, and  before you know it, my time as a Member of Congress will end, so I need  to start now saying thank you to some of those folks who have committed  their lives in helping me and supporting me in my political and  governmental career.   In Genesis 2, we find God instituting marriage:         It is not good for man to be alone. I will create for him a       helpmate. That is why a man shall leave his mother and a       woman leave her home.    I have been extremely blessed to have Karen as my partner and  helpmate for  [[Page H3096]]  33 years. We will celebrate our 33rd wedding anniversary this Saturday.   Karen and I met at my last Active-Duty Army station in Monterey,  California. She allowed me to drag her to my hometown of Collinsville,  where I had a teaching job lined up. We have been there ever since.   Karen has allowed me to run for various political offices, winning  some races, losing some races. Whether it was my first race for the  county board or my last one for Congress, she always supported me.   She always answered the call when needed. It could be stuffing  envelopes, painting signs, walking door to door, participating in  parades, attending hostile debates, or speaking for me at events when I  had a conflict. I never knew her once to say no. You will have to ask  her if she enjoyed any of it, but whether she enjoyed it or not, she  always participated gracefully.   Our sons are now young men at 27, 25, and 20 years old. I really  became an absentee father upon my election to Congress. You see, my two  boys were 3 and 1 at the time. Finishing my 24th year tells you that  their entire life has consisted of me being a Member of Congress and my  wife, Karen, being a single parent. Our boys have turned out to be nice  and respectful young men, and Karen gets the credit.   Our marriage is founded on Christ and His church on Earth. Karen is a  trained director of Christian education. She has her masters in organ  performance and has taught music at the grade school and high school  level. I am a former jock, Army officer, and a back patter. We  complement each other. And, again, as it says in Genesis: the two shall  be one flesh. We are partners. We are a team.   The decades have flown by, and I will never be able to adequately  thank Karen for her love and support over the years. She is ready to  have me home more, and I am ready to be home. COVID-19 has already  allowed us to test this theory of being home more than apart. I think  we are going to do just fine.   Thank you, Karen. I owe you a debt of gratitude, and so does this  Nation for allowing and supporting my service to it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise with concerns about the troubling  pattern of legislating national chemical policy based upon emotions  rather than scientific fact, including in this NDAA. I am referring  specifically to certain anti-science, anti-practicality, and  potentially anti-soldier provisions involving this bill related to per-  and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS.   PFAS is not one well-known substance; it is actually a class of  thousands of different chemicals of which we know very little about.  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, there is no precise,  clear definition of what constitutes a PFAS substance, with the lowest  total of several estimates of PFAS encompassing more than 5,000  substances.   The dots on this chart represent the scope of 5,070 substances  identified on the Environmental Protection Agency's current PFAS master  list. The 29 dots that are highlighted represent those individual PFAS  for which EPA has a reliable scientific method to test their presence  in drinking water. Finally, the two red dots are the only two that we  think are problematic to human health, and that is PFOA and PFOS.   Some of the uses of specific PFAS chemicals the Federal Food and Drug  Administration has approved for use: heart stents, in this case, for  patients suffering from artery blockage; and occluders for infants  suffering from the congenital heart condition known as an atrial septal  defect, which plugs a hole in the heart.   I don't have a poster for the next chart on health, but 40 new  fluorine-containing drugs were introduced to the market from 2001 to  2011, including those that treat cancer, respiratory illnesses,  cardiovascular conditions, and infectious diseases.   Regardless, section 331 of this NDAA prohibits DOD from buying any  personal care items, dental floss, or sunscreen that carries PFAS. This  doesn't mean just the two PFAS we know about; it means the thousands  for which we know nothing. This includes any safer alternative product  with a different PFAS.   We should know what this means for our troops sitting in the desert  Sun in far-off places before Congress summarily takes these products  away, some of which have already been approved for use by other Federal  agencies.   Separately, section 332 of this NDAA requires certain DOD PFAS  cleanups under the Superfund to use the strictest standards, nullifying  Superfund, which relies on cleanups ``assuring'' protection of human  health and the environment and being ``relevant and appropriate under  the circumstances.'' In other words, for only DOD, section 332 in this  NDAA disregards site characteristics; prevents more practical,  protective cleanups; and focuses only on being more stringent. This  kind of policymaking is punitive; it is wasteful; and it is  unscientific.   Later we will debate the Delgado amendment, which some suggest is a  technical fix to the Toxic Release Inventory language Congress added in  NDAA 2020. This amendment, however, is not a technical fix, and it  raises serious policy questions that regular order would have done a  much better job of settling.   Mr. Speaker, it doesn't have to be this way, with Congress playing  scientist. EPA has been working diligently to understand the health  effects of the seven most common PFAS while simultaneously  investigating the hazards of another five.   EPA also just released the Toxic Release Inventory mandates for 172  PFAS and is finalizing a Safe Drinking Water Act regulatory  determination, is completing regulation preventing market access for  long-chain PFAS, and is evaluating the need for Clean Air Act and  Superfund regulation of certain PFAS.   Mr. Speaker, I hope conference negotiation will remove these  troublesome provisions, or at least significantly modify them to align  with the realities of our fighting men and women, their needs in the  field, and not arbitrarily restrict things based upon anxiety and the  lack of science.    Madam Speaker, I oppose the Delgado amendment. Beware of  a wolf in sheep's clothing.   This is not a technical fix or a clarification of last year's NDAA.  There were no colloquies, report language, or public statements  rejecting TRI exemptions for PFAS in connection with last year's NDAA.   With zero hearings on this topic, this amendment would greatly  benefit from regular order to appreciate its impact, which would be  going through the Energy and Commerce Committee.   TRI contains several reporting exemptions, including de minimis  [[Page H3498]]  amount in chemical mixtures, when the chemical is in an article, and if  the chemical is a cleaning substance or used for research.   Madam Speaker, the Delgado amendment would strip these exemptions,  and I urge its rejection.
