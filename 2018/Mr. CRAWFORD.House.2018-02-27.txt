 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time  to me.   Mr. Chairman, this bill is one of several we passed in the House that  aims to combat the horrific and disgusting act of sex trafficking of  minors on our borders.   Today, I want to share two stories of Ashton Talley and Arissa  Farmer, both from my district, the First District of Arkansas, who were  taken for the purpose of being trafficked, but, thankfully, were  rescued before being lost in this abominable trade.   These young women were sought online by men preying on thousands of  underage minors. Their stories, sadly, mirror one another and those of  countless other minors across America.   Both were courted online by older men and believed they were engaging  in harmless friendships. In both instances, these men traveled to my  district from other States to take Ashton and Arissa to Washington  State and Nebraska, respectively, for their horrific purposes.   It is believed that, for one of the victims, her eventual destination  was to be the Super Bowl in Minneapolis, which reportedly draws an  increase in trafficking activity for big events like that. In the other  case, the victim was one of over 8,000 minors sought online by her  predator.   Mr. Chairman, these girls are not unlike our own children. They are  kids that we all see in our schools, our churches, and our  neighborhoods. We must take the necessary steps like H.R. 1865 to  protect America's children from these repugnant individuals.   This bill will not be the end-all for stamping out this unfortunate  segment of society. We must all recognize this despicable act for what  it is and work together to protect our youth by enacting responsible  policy and becoming educated in the tactics used by predators to groom  and lure our children.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I remain  committed to fighting the ongoing practice of sex trafficking.
