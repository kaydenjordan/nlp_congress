 Madam Speaker, long before he captured the attention of  football fans with his exemplary play and iconic 1970s style, Gardner  Minshew inspired my hometown in Mississippi.   I remember sitting in the stands, watching Gardner Minshew's first  game when, as a freshman, he took over for the injured starting Brandon  High School quarterback. I was among many who watched the young man  grow and mature into a leader, both on and off the field.   After four amazing seasons, Gardner left Brandon and found his way to  Pullman, Washington, to play for Washington State University. At  Washington State, Gardner showed composure in the face of adversity,  overcame all doubts, led the Cougars to an 11-win season, and won the  Johnny Unitas award as the Nation's top senior quarterback.   Gardner has taken this same mentality to the NFL, where he now faces  a similar challenge. Just like his first start in high school, when  Gardner was asked to step up and play at the next level, Gardner was  recently called on to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars. Again, Gardner  overcame all doubts, and he has continued to excel, just as he did when  I watched him on Friday nights a few short years ago.   Madam Speaker, we know Gardner will keep representing our State and  hometown well. Good luck, and go Jags.                            ____________________
