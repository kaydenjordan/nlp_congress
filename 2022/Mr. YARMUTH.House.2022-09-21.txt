 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a leader in my  community and a person I consider one of the most impactful individuals  in the history of Louisville, Sadiqa Reynolds, in her final days as  president and CEO of the Urban League of Louisville.   It was only 7 years ago that Sadiqa was an esteemed judge, a role  where she conducted herself with impartiality and kept her feelings and  opinions to herself. My, how times change.   As head of the Urban League, Sadiqa has held nothing back, leading  with an open heart and open mind, speaking out for Louisville's  marginalized communities with the passion and eloquence necessary to  create positive, lasting change in people's lives.   You cannot drive Louisville's streets without seeing Sadiqa's impact.  Our West End has begun a much-awaited transformation in the last few  years, anchored in large part by a new world-class track and field and  education complex, which she conceived and spearheaded.   Sadiqa, you have been the conscience of our community, leading the  fight against injustice in historic times. We are a better city because  of your leadership. We are grateful for your service and can't wait to  see what you will achieve next.                            ____________________
