 Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to  recognize Mrs. Mary Woodruff of Amherst County, Virginia, who turned  104 years young last week.   Born and raised in Amherst, Mrs. Woodruff and her husband of 63 years  built their iconic country store in 1952 with their own two hands, near  the site where Mary's grandfather opened the first Black-owned business  in the county.   For decades they served their community, providing groceries to  locals and gas to travelers, all while raising five children and  several foster children in the apartment above the store.   This multigenerational family business was reinvented as Woodruff's  Cafe and Pie Shop by Mary's youngest daughter, Angela Scott, in 1998.  Since then, business has been booming, attracting patrons from far and  wide to try their delicious pies, including a visit from Al Roker from  the ``Today'' show last year.   To this day, nearly 70 years after opening the country store's doors,  the 104-year-old Mary Woodruff still works at the shop and ``holds  court'' at the back table where she greets customers and tells stories.  Mrs. Woodruff, her family, and the pies are truly a blessing to our  central Virginia community.    I wish Mrs. Woodruff a very happy birthday, and I look forward to  stopping by the shop sometime soon.                            ____________________
