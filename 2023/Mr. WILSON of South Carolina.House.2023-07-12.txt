 Mr. Speaker, the irresponsible  decisions of Biden and the liberal Democrats have caused inflation to  reach a 40-year high, leaving American families in financial distress  and jobs lost.   Bidenflation has increased the cost of everyday goods and services,  reducing the annual purchasing power of families.   Worse, Biden unintentionally revealed the reality of these policies.  Recently, describing his economic policies, Biden said: I don't know  what Bidenomics is, but it's working.   The facts are inflation has caused costs to increase over the year.  Lunch meats are up 6.2 percent. Margarine is up 23 percent. Flour is up  17 percent. Cereal and bakery products are up over 11 percent.   The Republican House majority is working to correct this by having  recently passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act to rein in government  overreach and limit inflationary spending, creating jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.                            ____________________
