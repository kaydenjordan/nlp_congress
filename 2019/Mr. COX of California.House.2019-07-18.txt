 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  our amendment to the Raise the Wage Act. I joined this amendment to  look out for the small businesses and the agricultural businesses that  are so vital to the Central Valley of California and to our Nation.   The minimum wage has not been raised since 2009. In the decade since,  due to inflation and rising costs, the paychecks of millions of  hardworking Americans naturally don't go as far as they used to.   Every worker deserves a living wage, and this amendment ensures that  we can give at least 17 million Americans a raise while also protecting  farms and small businesses. We do this by requiring the Government  Accountability Office to analyze and produce a study of the impact of  the first two scheduled wage increases on our Nation's small  businesses, our agriculture industry, and our workers.   The study will consider the specific effects of raising the minimum  wage in each Census tract and rural area, so families, like those I  serve in the Central Valley of California, aren't left behind.   If we find the negative impacts are too great, the relevant  committees are required to make recommendations to Congress which may  include actions  [[Page H7125]]  necessary to delay the next scheduled increases, if necessary.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
