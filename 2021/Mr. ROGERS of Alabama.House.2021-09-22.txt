 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, this is an en bloc that was put together in close  consultation with the minority. I urge all Members to support it, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), one of our outstanding freshmen.    Madam Speaker, I have some more speakers who  aren't ready to speak right now, so at this time I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack), who is another outstanding  freshman Member.    Madam Speaker, I urge support of the  amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I fully support our law enforcement community, and particularly those  in small and rural communities like those that pepper my entire  congressional district. Those are the ones that benefit the most from  the 1033 program.   Limiting military equipment transfers would significantly impede  their ability to do their jobs to keep us safe. We need to be  supporting our law enforcement community, not making their missions  more difficult.   For that reason I oppose this amendment and urge a ``no'' vote, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida ( Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford), my good friend and a former  sheriff.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Nehls), another outstanding freshman.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I want people to understand what  the gentleman is proposing because it is naive and reckless.   When we get the budget proposal from the administration, it is just  that. It is a proposal. But it is also from the executive branch. It is  not coming directly from the combatant commanders, who are the  individuals that we charge with the responsibility for executing the  U.S. missions around the world.   This amendment would prohibit them giving us the items that were not  funded by the President's budget proposal. Keep in mind, both this  President and the last President have given us budget proposals that  were grossly inadequate. We were able to remedy it under the last  President; we were able to remedy it in this one with this President.  And we depend heavily on what the combatant commanders tell us they  need.   It is critical that Congress knows what the commanders need to keep  our servicemembers safe and ensure the success of their missions.   Here is an example. In the fiscal year 2022 unfunded priority, the  CENTCOM commander sent us a $106 million request to operate and  maintain the Patriot batteries deployed in Iraq to keep our troops safe  from missiles fired from Iran and the proxies in Syria.   That money was not in the Biden budget. We found out about it and  funded it because of that critical need, and it is now in the bill  because General McKenzie told us about it in his unfunded requirement  list. We wouldn't have known about that otherwise. That is just one  example of why this amendment is misguided.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman means well,  but I am not misguided, and I don't misunderstand anything.   I know exactly what the unfunded requirements request list is, it is  a vital piece of information for our committee to do its oversight, and  I urge the Members of this body to reject this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible and reckless  amendment, and I urge all the Members of this body to reject it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment will strip $79  billion out of the bill. That would have catastrophic effects on our  training and readiness.   I need to remind Members, we have been at war for two decades, we  have worn out everything we have got. We have got to start replacing  and modernizing for the future to be able to take on the threats from  China and other adversaries. This will set us back on clean-up and  environmental remediation of PFAS and other contaminated items.   It would put off construction of new military housing, schools, and  childcare facilities, and the list goes on.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this bill does everything the  gentlewoman just talked about. We are investing in those items that she  has talked about, and we are divesting ourselves of those $78 billion  worth of legacy platforms that will not be useful in the future, and we  are applying that money toward future platforms.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  DesJarlais), my friend and colleague, and an outstanding member of the  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that achieving  or meeting the objectives that the gentlewoman just outlined and  defense are not mutually exclusive, we can do both and should do both.   And I would point out that the $3.5 trillion that the other side is  proposing doesn't spend a dime on defense. Also, we are in the process  of auditing. The gentlewoman is exactly right, the Defense Department  has never passed an audit. This bill continues the pressure on them to  get that complete. We have had many agencies that passed, not all have,  and we are not going to let up until they pass an audit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Gallagher), the ranking member of the Military Personnel  Subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee, and an outstanding  leader.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment guts our bill  which is, I am certain, the gentlewoman's intention. It is recklessly  irresponsible. It would harm our servicemembers and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all Members to oppose it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, here we go again. This time they are stripping $25  billion in funding added by Republicans and Democrats on the committee.   The gentlewoman argues that the Biden budget is sufficient for our  national defense. I strongly disagree. The Biden budget constitutes a  cut of about $4 billion in real spending from last year. The budget  cuts the number of Navy ships. It cuts the number of Navy ships and  destabilizes the industrial base. It slashes procurement across the  board. It guts missile defense. It leaves unfunded $25 billion in  combatant commander priorities, and it cuts the Army, Navy, Air Force,  and Marines. At least they left the Space Corps alone.   It does all this while our adversaries, especially China, are  investing in military modernization. China increased its defense  spending by 75 percent over the last decade--6 percent this year alone.  They are leapfrogging this into capabilities like AI and hypersonics,  and they are stepping up malign operations against America and our  allies.   What is the President's response to this?   He responds with a budget that would cut funding programs that we  need to deter China. It doesn't make sense, especially when he is  proposing to swell nondefense spending by a massive 16 percent this  year. This bill corrects that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), who is a real leader on the  Armed Services Committee and ranking member on the Seapower and  Projection Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from the great State of Alabama (Mr. Carl), who is one of our  outstanding freshmen on the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill before this  body, the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act, would increase  spending by 3 percent over inflation, which is a modest increase. And  it passed our committee with an overwhelming bipartisan vote.   This amendment guts the bill. I urge all Members to oppose it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this en bloc package was put together in close  consultation with the minority. I urge all Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my longtime friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson), an outstanding freshman member of  the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garcia), an outstanding freshman member  of our Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendments  that are included in this amendment en bloc number 2 for the National  Defense Authorization Act.   This bill includes three amendments that were submitted by my office  that will directly benefit our Nation's security and, of course, the  people of Puerto Rico.   The first one is amendment 162, which authorizes research into the  health effects of nearly 70 years of live fire training in the  municipality of Vieques.   As well, amendment 163 supports the Puerto Rico National Guard by  prohibiting the retirement of the current landing craft ships, or the  MAG boats, not only used in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria  in 2019 and that were used again in March of this year. The Puerto Rico  National Guard has used these ships to provide lifesaving food, water,  and other equipment to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Vieques, and Culebra  after any natural disaster. We cannot afford to retire these ships  until they are replaced.   Lastly, will be amendment 164, which requires the Secretary of the  Army to allocate a Modular Small Arms Range to Puerto Rico. This is to  increase the readiness of the Armed Forces. Right now, Puerto Rico only  has a single firearms range for the Department of Defense personnel.  That means that there are numerous scheduling conflicts, and it  decreases the mission readiness on the island.   I think those amendments should be supported.   I want to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers; I really  appreciate all their good work on this NDAA. Included in this en bloc  are numerous provisions for the people of Puerto Rico as a territory.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my friend and an outstanding leader on the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the amendments  en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller), an outstanding member of  the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), my friend and colleague, and  also the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne), one of our great new freshman  members of the Republican Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), an outstanding member of the  Republican Conference and a retired general officer.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this en bloc was put together in close consultation by  the majority with the minority. I urge all Members to support it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney),  [[Page H5074]]  an outstanding member of our Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), my friend and colleague and a  real leader on the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to state this en bloc package was reached  in close coordination between the majority and minority. I urge its  favorable support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
