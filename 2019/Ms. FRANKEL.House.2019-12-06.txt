 Mr. Speaker, voting is the cornerstone of our democracy.  It has been a hard-fought right. We must ensure that every American  that is eligible to vote can make their voice heard.   This right has been trampled on after the Shelby County v. Holder  Court decision, which has unleashed a flood of State and local voter  suppression laws, silencing targeted voters, particularly communities  of color.   In my home State of Florida, laws and policies have cut back early  voting, established English-only ballots, and are now trying to thwart  efforts to restore voting rights to ex-felons, hurting access to the  ballot box for Floridians.   H.R. 4 will push back against suppressive voting laws, restoring the  great equalizer for democracy and for our people.
