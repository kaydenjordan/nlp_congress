 Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  allow the District of Columbia to receive funding and other benefits  under the Coastal Zone Management Act. I am pleased to offer this  companion legislation to a bill introduced by the Congresswoman from  the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton.   Few of us realize that 70 percent of the District is located within  the coastal plain. Similar to my State of Delaware, sea level rise,  upstream sources of water, and degraded infrastructure mean that the  District could experience serious future cleanup and repair costs due  to flooding, including damage to Federal property, which makes up  almost 30 percent of the District. Since 1950, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, reports there has been a 343-percent  increase in nuisance flooding in  [[Page S7463]]  the District. Since 2006, D.C. has experienced two 100-year flooding  events. Scientists predict that tides on the Atlantic coast could rise  2 to 4 feet by the year 2100, causing as much as $7 billion worth of  property damage in the District, which would regularly be under threat  by floodwaters. This fact was highlighted by a study released by the  nonprofit Climate Central last week. Needless to say, these events will  become more and more common due to climate change and sea level rise.   The District of Columbia would use funding from the Coastal Zone  Management Program for flood risk planning and environmental  restoration to prevent and mitigate future flood damage. At the same  time, this work would help to restore and conserve the District's  coastal resources such as habitat, fisheries, and endangered species.   If included in the Coastal Zone Management Program, the District of  Columbia would be eligible for $1 million or more of Federal funding  annually to assist in coastal flood-control projects, to combat non- point source water pollution, and to develop special area management  plans in areas experiencing environmental justice and/or flooding  issues.   The National Coastal Zone Management Program, housed in NOAA, was  established through the passage of the Federal Coastal Zone Management  Act of 1972. At the time, Congress recognized the need to manage the  effects of increased growth in the Nation's coastal zone, which  includes jurisdictions bordering the oceans and the Great Lakes.   There are currently 34 jurisdictional coastal zone management  programs, including both States and territories. In order for the  District of Columbia to participate in the program, Congress must pass  this amendment to the Coastal Zone Management Act that would include  the District under the definition of a ``coastal State.''   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill I am introducing  today be printed in the Record following my statement.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3104         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Flood Prevention Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. ELIGIBILITY OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FOR FEDERAL                     FUNDING UNDER THE COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT                     OF 1972.         Section 304(4) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972       (16 U.S.C. 1453(4)) is amended by inserting ``the District of       Columbia,'' after ``the term also includes''.       By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr.          Booker, Mr. Coons, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mr. Durbin, Mrs.          Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Hickenlooper, Ms.          Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley,          Mr. Murphy, Mr. Padilla, Mr. Reed, Ms. Rosen, Mr. Sanders, Mr.          Schatz, Ms. Smith, Ms. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden):   S. 3108. A bill to provide counsel for unaccompanied children, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.   Ms. HIRONO, Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Day in  Court for Kids Act of 2021. This important legislation would provide  all unaccompanied children with legal representation as they go through  immigration proceedings. This will protect the legal rights of  vulnerable children running from violence, abuse, and gangs, but it  will also make our immigration system more efficient.   Five years ago, I traveled to Baltimore, MD, to observe immigration  court hearings on the children's docket. I watched children, who had  suffered violence and trauma in their home countries, trying to  navigate our complex legal system without any support. Leaving young  people, children as young as 3, to combat an adversarial government  lawyer and explain why they qualify for a legal immigration status is  unacceptable and unconscionable.   I have also had the opportunity to speak to children who were able to  secure an immigration status with legal support. These children are  grateful to have escaped the dangers that drove them to leave home.  They also express with certainty that they would not have been able to  succeed in their cases if they did not have lawyers representing them.   In immigration court, people seeking relief through our immigration  system do not have a right to counsel and often cannot afford counsel  who understand our Byzantine immigration system and can explain the  lifelong ramifications that result from certain decisions. This  unfairness is most acute when it comes to unaccompanied children who  are trying to escape brutal violence and crushing poverty. Most do not  speak English, nor do they have any understanding of our legal system.  Yet we expect them to argue their case before immigration court and  against trained and skilled ICE attorneys.   The Fair Day in Court for Kids Act would remedy this injustice by  providing all unaccompanied children with legal counsel. Attorneys  would review the case, advise the child of their legal options, and  remain with them throughout their immigration proceedings. Legal  counsel would ensure these children have the legal rights and  opportunities they are afforded, helping our immigration system protect  the people it was meant to support.   In addition to protecting the rights of unaccompanied children, legal  counsel will ensure their cases move quicker and more smoothly. Cases  with unrepresented children are subject to delays and a slower pace as  the judge must repeatedly help the child understand what is going on  and help them respond. Children with legal counsel also have a 98  percent appearance rate in court. These efficiencies can only help our  overwhelmed immigration court system, which currently has a 1.4 million  case backlog.   I call on my Senate colleagues to help protect unaccompanied children  and quickly pass this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to  allow the District of Columbia to receive funding and other benefits  under the Coastal Zone Management Act.
