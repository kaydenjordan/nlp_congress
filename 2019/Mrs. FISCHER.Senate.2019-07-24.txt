 Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for  Brian Buescher, President Trump's nominee to serve on the U.S. District  Court for the District of Nebraska.   Near the end of 2017, both Senator Sasse and I were given notice that  Chief Judge Laurie Smith Camp would assume senior status on Nebraska's  Federal bench. Many people may not know this, but the case docket for  the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska is among the  busiest dockets in the Nation. In recent years, the district has  carried some of the highest per-judge criminal caseloads in the  country, which surpasses judicial districts that include New York City,  Chicago, and Los Angeles. That is why it is critical to both Nebraska  and our Nation that the Senate delivers an exceptional judge to fill  this vacancy without further delay.   In this spirit, both Senator Sasse and I worked quickly to begin the  open-application process. Nebraska is the proud home of many brilliant  legal minds, and we thoroughly studied every application and  interviewed qualified candidates. After an extensive search spanning  the course of a few months, Senator Sasse and I came to a conclusion.  We would recommend to President Trump that Brian Buescher be nominated  as the next judge on Nebraska's Federal district court.   Mr. Buescher is a proud husband and father of five children who have  been his biggest cheerleaders throughout this long confirmation  process. He grew up in Clay County, NE. There he learned the importance  of hard work at a young age on his family's farm, where they raised  corn, milo, wheat, alfalfa, hogs and cattle. It is also from this  upbringing that he developed a keen appreciation for how the law  directly affects the everyday lives of Americans and even more so for  those who live and work in America's heartland.   After receiving his undergraduate degree from the University of  Nebraska-  [[Page S5042]]  Lincoln, Brian was accepted into law school at Georgetown University.  He thrived both in and out of the classroom. He was editor-in-chief of  the Georgetown Journal of Ethics and vice president of the Georgetown  Law Student Bar Association.   Mr. Buescher is currently a partner at Nebraska's largest law firm,  Kutak Rock. He is chairman of the firm's agribusiness litigation team  and oversees large, complex commercial litigation, which includes  environmental law, food law, real estate, class actions, product  liability, and banking.   He has gained invaluable experience as a litigator, and his resume  speaks for itself. His success includes favorable rulings in cases  heard by Nebraska and Iowa's State and Federal courts, the U.S. Court  of Federal Claims, and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of  Nebraska. Time after time, case after case, he has demonstrated his  commitment to upholding the Constitution and the rule of law.   In 2017, the American Agricultural Law Association awarded him the  award for Excellence in Agricultural Law in Private Practice. The  American Bar Association rated Mr. Buescher as ``qualified'' by an  overwhelming majority. His 20 years of litigation experience has  unquestionably prepared him for his next life chapter as a U.S.  district court judge.   Nebraska's former secretary of State, John Gale, recruited Brian to  serve on the Nebraska State Records Board. Secretary Gale noted that  ``Mr. Buescher reflects the highest level for the qualities needed for  a district judge, ranging from intelligence, integrity,  professionalism, attentiveness, character, and skillful articulation to  a deep understanding of the rules and procedures of the courtroom.''   While everyone who has worked with him praises his legal acumen,  those who know him on a personal level speak to his integrity and his  character. One of his friends from college who has known Brian for a  quarter of a century praised his commitment to serving the community  and his qualities as a husband and father. His friend concluded: ``I  can say with complete confidence what kind of person Brian is and that  there is nothing that should give you hesitation about his  confirmation.''    By all accounts Brian Buescher has enthusiastic support in Nebraska  for his superb legal work and fairminded disposition.   I was proud to introduce Mr. Buescher at his confirmation hearing  before the Senate Judiciary Committee last November. I sincerely hoped  that my Democratic colleagues would see Mr. Buescher for who he was--a  sharp legal mind and a man of high character. However, my Democratic  friends on the Judiciary Committee deployed unjust, bigoted attacks  instead of using reason and open-mindedness. They could not criticize  his solid record nor his judicial philosophy. So they reverted to  attacking his personal religious beliefs. Both the junior Senator from  California and the junior Senator from Hawaii questioned Mr. Buescher's  membership in the Knights of Columbus.   For anyone who may be unaware, the Knights of Columbus is not a  radical interest group. It is not political at all. The Knights of  Columbus is the world's largest Roman Catholic fraternal organization.  Their motto is ``In service to one, service to all,'' and they are  founded on the core principles of charity, unity, and patriotism.   Over the last decade, the Knights of Columbus have donated $1.1  billion to charities and performed more than 68 million hours of  volunteer service. In 2017 alone, local councils donated and  distributed over 105,000 winter coats for underprivileged children  through their ``Coats for Kids'' program. They have raised more than  $382 million in the past three decades to help groups and programs that  support the intellectually and physically disabled. Whether it is  providing food and shelter for refugees, rebuilding homes for families  that are struck by natural disasters, volunteering at veterans medical  facilities, or simply having pancake breakfasts to raise money for  local schools, the acts of charity and kindness of the Knights of  Columbus are truly inspiring.   That is why I was shocked to hear that Mr. Buescher received a letter  from the junior Senator from Hawaii following his confirmation hearing  that suggested he leave the Knights of Columbus to ``avoid an  appearance of bias.'' The notion that being a Knights of Columbus  member is disqualifying to serve on the Federal bench is disturbing on  its own, but holding religious tests for our judicial nominees  blatantly ignores the Constitution and tears at the fabric of our core  American values--the freedom to worship and pray as we choose.   Fortunately, the Senate passed a resolution earlier this year that  condemned unconstitutional religious tests for nominees.   President Kennedy endured anti-Catholic attacks throughout his 1960  campaign, and for me it was exceptionally troubling to see that  rhetoric return to the Senate in 2019. Now we will have another chance  here in the Senate to send a clear message that we share our Founding  Fathers' contempt for religious tests for public office by confirming  Brian Buescher to the Federal bench.   In closing, I think it is important to reiterate that reverence for  our Constitution and our laws is part of what it means to be an  American. My friend Peggy Noonan characterized this best a few weeks  ago in her Wall Street Journal column. She described a young politician  in 1838 who gave a speech to a Midwestern youth group about public  policy and the political events at the time. The last of our Founding  Fathers had recently died, and in their absence, our Nation felt lost.   The Founders were a visual representation of American values and  modeled our first principles in their behavior. After their deaths,  these core values were being forgotten and mob rule began to rise,  threatening our Republic. The young politician had a solution: Our  people should transfer reverence for our Founders to reverence to the  laws that they created. He said: ``Only reverence for our Constitution  and laws'' will protect our Nation's political institutions and retain  the ``attachment of the people.''   The speaker that day, in 1838, was Abraham Lincoln, who was 28 years  old at the time. He understood the delicate nature of our laws--that  when our laws collapse, everything else in our Nation can crumble with  it.   I believe that to love our country we must respect our Constitution  and apply the laws fairly to all. When we do so, we not only honor our  past, but we protect the future generations of this great Nation. We  can do that here in the Senate by appointing exceptional judges to the  Federal bench, and I can say with great confidence that Mr. Buescher  will be one of them. He is a well-qualified nominee and a man who  possesses high ethical standards. I have no doubt that Brian Buescher  will honor his family, our State, and our Nation with his service on  the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of  his nomination.   I yield the floor.                     Nomination of Wendy Williams Berger     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
