 Madam President, I rise this evening to speak on a  subject that, with the groundswell of activism, has once again captured  national attention--and rightfully so.   Many years ago, I was a young naval flight officer stationed at a  mock field naval air station in the Bay area out in California,  preparing for the first of what would be three tours of duty in  Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war. I joined there with tens of  thousands of people one day to celebrate our country's first-ever Earth  Day. I will never forget it.   This was back when polluters dumped waste into our waterways with  impunity. Garbage littered our shores, and too many rivers oozed  instead of flowed. One of them was in Cleveland, OH. The Cuyahoga  River, north of where I went to school at Ohio State, actually caught  on fire. Factories spewed toxic fumes, and acid rain fell from the sky.  The urgency was clear then, and it is even clearer today.   That very first Earth Day was a transformative experience for me, and  it will serve as an inspiration for me for the rest of my life.   As I look at what is happening across our country today, I see the  movement for bold and transformative action to save our planet. I see  the faces of those who were there with me that day in Golden Gate State  Park.   I have had a lot of different jobs since then, but it is not lost on  me that I stand here today on the brink of yet another watershed moment  as the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public  Works--the committee that oversees our Nation's environmental laws--to  talk about climate change.   In the days and weeks ahead, Senator McConnell intends to engage in a  ploy to try and undermine the Green New Deal by calling a vote for a  resolution he does not even support. I believe he hopes that, in turn,  there may be some disruption and damage inflicted on the Democratic  Party and the climate change movement.   To the American people, hear this; it is a simple message: We  cannot--we will not--allow cynicism to win, not now and not with so  much at stake.   When it comes to climate action, there could not be a starker  difference in this Chamber between the Democratic Party and the  Republican Party in this debate.   We, as Democrats, may not agree on exactly how we should address  climate change, but we all agree it is happening. We agree that human  activity is the main cause, and we agree that we must act now.   Democrats know that climate science isn't part of some grand hoax. It  is not an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning  organization. It doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from  our Nation's leading scientists and leading scientists from all around  the world.   Just 3 months ago, 13 Federal Agencies released a comprehensive  climate report that described the dire economic and health consequences  we face if we fail to take meaningful action to address climate change  now. I may be mistaken, but I believe those 13 Federal Agencies were  acting under law signed by a Republican President. I believe it was  George Herbert Walker Bush.   This report is the Fourth National Climate Assessment. It was  developed over a 3-year period by more than 300 Federal experts and  non-Federal experts who volunteered their time--who volunteered their  time.   Here is a brief summary of their report: The science behind climate  change is settled. Let me say that again. The science behind climate  change is settled.   From our warming oceans to our atmosphere, climate change is  happening, and human activity, such as burning fossil fuels, is greatly  contributing to this crisis.   Our Nation's scientists have found a direct link between climate  change and the extreme weather we experienced in 2017, which altogether  cost the American economy more than $300 billion--that is $300 billion  in economic damages, more than any year before.   Scientists are no longer asking if climate change is happening but  rather how bad is it going to be. How bad is it going to be? Numbers  and the facts don't lie. It will only get worse if we do nothing.   If we don't act on climate change by 2050, wildfire seasons could  burn up to six times--six times--more forest area every year. If we  don't act on climate change, we will see more extreme flooding that  devastates small communities like Ellicott City, MD, not far from here,  which has been hit by not one 1,000-year flood in the past year but  two. These are floods that are supposed to occur maybe once every 1,000  years. They had two of them in the last 2 years.   If we don't act on climate change, rising temperatures, combined with  increasingly frequent and severe rain, mean farmers are likely to  experience a reduction in corn and soybean yields by up to 25 percent.  If we don't act on climate change, we will see more deadly category 5  hurricanes and storm surges like the ones we saw with Hurricanes Irma  and Maria just 2 years ago.   If we do not act on climate change, we will see economic pain across  every major sector of our economy in this country. The 2018 National  Climate Assessment concludes that at the end of this century, climate  change could slash our gross domestic product by 10 percent.   How much is that compared to what? Well, compared to the losses we  sustained in the great recession just a decade ago, 10 percent is more  than double those losses--more than double.   It doesn't matter if you are from a coastal State or from a  landlocked State. I have lived in both. It doesn't matter if you care  about public health or the environment or if you care about our economy  or national security. The fact is, every person living in  [[Page S1469]]  this country will eventually see or experience the effects of climate  change if they haven't already done so today.   We have two options. We confront this challenge head on--reduce  carbon emissions, enhance resiliency, and support millions of new clean  energy jobs--or we could choose to ignore the problem and pass the  buck. To whom? To our children, to their children, and to their  children.   Senator McConnell, President Trump, and Andrew Wheeler at EPA want to  pass the buck. They prefer to walk away from the growing threat we  face. Instead of pursuing any ideas to address climate change and  protect Americans from its effect, sadly, the Trump administration has  promoted policies that increase our dependency on dirty energy.   President Trump has even said he doesn't believe in climate change.  He doubts the credibility of his own scientists at NASA and at NOAA, as  well as 97 percent of the global scientific community. Continuing to  misinform the American people and delay real climate action puts  American lives and our economy at risk.   It doesn't have to be this way. As Democrats, we choose to confront  climate change. We choose to do so now. We know our communities are  feeling the pain now from the climate crisis because we see the effects  of climate change every day across this country.   We may not yet agree on exactly how we must address climate change,  but we all agree on three things. Here they are. One, we agree climate  change is real; two, human activity during the last 100 years is a  dominant cause of the climate crisis we face today; and three, the  United States, and especially the Congress, that is us, the House and  the Senate, and the administration should take immediate action to  address the challenge of climate change.   That is why I will be introducing a resolution that says just that.  Democrats know we can have a healthy climate and a strong economy. They  are not mutually exclusive. Anyone who says otherwise is preaching a  false choice.   Democrats know this because of the work we started with President  Obama in the White House, where we accomplished real actions to put  this Nation on a path of net zero emissions. Our Republicans friends  across the aisle should know this because of the work done by the  former President, the late George Herbert Walker Bush, years earlier  that I just alluded to a minute ago.   During the Obama administration, starting with the Recovery Act, the  Federal Government provided economic incentives, environmental targets,  and supported market developments to encourage investments in the clean  energy of the future.   Thanks to the investments during the previous administration,  consumers are paying less for energy, and more than 3 million people in  this country went to work today in the clean energy sector--3 million  and growing.   Democrats know we must build on this progress, and that is why we  continue to support policies that reduce our Nation's carbon footprint,  help create a fair economy, and support those most vulnerable to  climate effects, but in the U.S. Senate, as in most places, it takes  two to tango, and for over two decades Democrats have put forth  different policies that use market forces, make big investments in  technology, or set strict standards. We have done them all, and we  don't seem to get very far with our friends on the other side of this  aisle. I know because I have cosponsored many of these efforts.   Let me just say this. We are not going to give up. We are going to  keep on trying. We will not back down. We are going to stand our  ground.   Let me leave our colleagues with this message today. This should not  be an issue. Climate action should not be an issue that divides us as a  body. It shouldn't divide us as a country or as a world. It should  unify us.   I thank Senator McConnell in advance for allowing the Senate to  devote a fulsome period of time to this important discussion. How we  choose to act today will not decide our fates. How we choose to act  today will decide the fates of generations of Americans--not just our  fates but generations of Americans that will be on this Earth long  after the rest of us are gone. So let's get to work. Time is wasting.  Let's get to work.   I yield the floor to the Senator from Massachusetts, who has done  great work on this for as long as I have been alive--almost as long as  I have been alive, my friend and my colleague who has been a giant on  these issues for a long time and continues to be.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kaitlyn  Prichard and Zach Pilchen, a legislative fellow and a detailee in my  office, have privileges of the floor for the duration of the 116th  Congress.                            ____________________
