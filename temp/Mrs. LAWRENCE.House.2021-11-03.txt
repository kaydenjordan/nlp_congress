 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Build Back Better agenda.   We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make transformational  change for women, transformational change for families, and communities  [[Page H6132]]  of color. From affordable childcare and eldercare to raising the pay of  care workers and providing universal pre-K to expanding the child tax  credit, this agenda will lift women out of poverty, educate our  children, and lower costs.   We can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, because there is  so much good in this bill. This agenda is about who we are as a country  and the values we represent. The Build Back Better agenda will build  back better for women and families.                            ____________________
