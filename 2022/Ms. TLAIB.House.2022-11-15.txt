 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend, a  former colleague, a trailblazer in our community, Michigan State  Senator Vincent Gregory of Southfield, who passed away recently at the  age of 74.   State Senator Vincent Gregory had a passion for public service his  entire life and was known for his integrity.   He was a Vietnam war veteran, a union president, a county  commissioner, as well as, again, a former State representative whom I  had the honor to serve with.   In 2010, Vincent made history as the first Black resident of Oakland  County elected to the Michigan State Senate. He was a strong advocate  for voting rights, especially for our overseas servicemembers, and his  lasting impact will be remembered for years to come.   My thoughts are with his wife of 44 years, Yvonne, and his entire  family during this very difficult time. May his life and legacy serve  as a testament of all we can accomplish if we lead with compassion,  strength, and purpose.                            ____________________
