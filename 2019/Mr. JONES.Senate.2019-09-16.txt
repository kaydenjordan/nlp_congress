 Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of High  Street Church of Christ in Tuscumbia, AL. For over a century, this  church has been a source of hope and inspiration to the city of  Tuscumbia and the State of Alabama. Through their ministry and  outreach, they have transformed the lives of so many Alabamians.   Last year, on September 28-30, High Street Church of Christ hosted  their centennial celebration with 2 days of events commemorating 100  years of tireless work and dedication. The speakers for the event  included Brothers Michael S. Robert, Mansel Long, and Stanley Hubbard,  many of whom who have been longstanding members of the church. I am  proud to be able to honor the High Street Church here on the U.S.  Senate floor and to let the congregants of this church know that they  have my support and good wishes.   In is written, ``Upon this rock I will build my church.'' High Street  Church of Christ has proven to be a rock--a pillar of the local  community in Northwest Alabama--since its inception in 1918. High  Street Church has been a trailblazer as one of the first minority  congregations in north Alabama. Under the current leadership of  Brothers Eddie Goodloe, William Long, Roderick Metcalf, and Thomas  Sledge, the church's good work continues.   As they approach their 101st celebration, I congratulate the church  on its first 100 years, and I look forward its continued growth and  watching its  [[Page S5492]]  positive impact on Tuscumbia and Alabama for years to come.                            ____________________
