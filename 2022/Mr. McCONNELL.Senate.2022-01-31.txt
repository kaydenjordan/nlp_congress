 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Senators spent last week in our home  States. We got to hear firsthand updates about the real issues facing  real families that we all represent. I was especially glad to return to  Western Kentucky to keep working on our recovery from the catastrophic  tornadoes that hammered our State in mid-December.   Kentuckians are tough. They are resilient. But many are still reeling  from the impact of these storms. They have lost homes, businesses, even  loved ones.   I spent last week meeting with local leaders, small business owners,  and Kentuckians in the hardest hit areas. We talked about our work here  in Washington and the help they can expect to receive from us.   Kentuckians in the affected areas have been grateful for the quick  and efficient way that FEMA has begun distributing recovery aid. We  know recovery will be a very long process, but my office and I will be  standing with our people every step of the way.   And the entire State is excited to improve our roads, bridges,  railways, and broadband thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure deal  that Congress struck last year.   But like working people across America, Kentuckians also have serious  concerns about significant headwinds. Kentucky families are feeling the  pain of the worst inflation in 40 years. Our country has been hammered  by 7 percent inflation over just the past year. Employers are trying  hard to keep up.   Even as they face inflation across all their expenses, businesses  across our region have significantly upped their spending on wages and  benefits, and many workers have gotten raises. But, actually, it is  only on paper because the historic inflation on the Democrats' watch  has more than canceled the average increase in wages. Inflation is  turning pay raises into pay cuts. This is just one of the many  significant problems we confront.
