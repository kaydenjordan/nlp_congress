 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  50th anniversary of the Duckwater Shoshone Elementary School and the  important place this school occupies in our great State's history. The  Duckwater Shoshone Elementary School exists because parents wanted to  provide their children with the best education possible and help them  take pride in their heritage. The Duckwater Shoshone Tribe came  together in 1973 to create their own school, founded on the principle  of self-determination, to better oversee their children's instruction,  and preserve their culture. And the Duckwater Shoshone Elementary  School has continued that legacy ever since.   The Duckwater Shoshone Tribe is located in the Railroad Valley of  central Nevada near the Big Warm Spring, one of the largest geothermal  hot springs in the State. Taking their children's education into their  own hands, the Duckwater Shoshone Tribe formed an education committee,  which became the Duckwater Shoshone School Board, on July 26, 1973. The  parents and community of the Duckwater Shoshone were committed to their  children receiving every opportunity, no matter who they were or where  they lived and worked hard to establish their own school. This  commitment is reflected in a statement hanging on the main hallway of  the school: ``The mission of the Duckwater Shoshone Elementary School  is to provide a learning environment that promotes individual student  success and develops lifelong learners.''   On November 26, 1973, the Duckwater Shoshone Elementary School opened  its doors. The school remains a centerpiece of the Tribe's efforts to  support its families and stands as a testament to the value the  Duckwater Shoshone Tribe places on supporting future generations. On  the wall of the school, there hangs an accounting of the school's  formation written in longhand by former Duckwater chairman Paul Walker,  and it reads in part: ``What is hard to convey is the determination and  work of a whole rural Indian Community to see that their children  receive a better education than they obtained and to witness a general  betterment of our people.''   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Duckwater Shoshone  Elementary School for 50 years of service to the Duckwater Shoshone  Tribe and surrounding communities and the important role the school  plays in educating children and preserving traditions.                            ____________________
