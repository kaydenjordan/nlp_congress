 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of William  ``Bill'' Wolfe, Jr. Bill attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on  October 1.   Bill and his wife, Robyn, had two kids together, Ethan and Trevor.  Bill worked as a senior project manager for Dewberry Engineers, Inc.   Bill lived for his community. He enjoyed being a wrestling coach with  the Shippensburg Elementary wrestling program and a coach for a Little  League team.   Although he loved coaching, he loved being outdoors more. Bill  enjoyed hunting, fishing, boating, camping, gardening, and jogging.   Bill and Robyn had traveled to the Route 91 festival to celebrate the  20th anniversary of their wedding. Unfortunately, they were separated  when the gunfire erupted, and Robyn later found out that Bill did not  survive.   Bill is remembered for being very smart and always being willing to  help others. He was passionate about everything he did and was loved by  many.   I would like to extend my condolences to William ``Bill'' Wolfe,  Jr.'s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the  State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
