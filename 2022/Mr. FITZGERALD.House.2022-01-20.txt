 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of life.   This Saturday, as many of the previous speakers had alluded to, is  the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. As such, it is a fitting time to  talk about this administration's radical anti-life policies for which  some of us were caught off guard when President Biden was running for  the Presidency.   Over the past year we have watched President Biden and the Democrats  continually push what I would consider an anti-life full agenda. First,  they gutted the Hyde amendment, a longstanding provision of  appropriations bills that prevents taxpayer funding for abortions and  has saved an estimated 2 million lives.   Then the Biden Administration's Department of Health and Human  Services changed the rules to essentially require healthcare providers  to perform abortions, despite any moral objections they may have.   Finally, my Democrat colleagues passed a radical bill that removes  existing limits on abortion and allows abortions on demand, no matter  the age of the fetus.   Mr. Speaker, I will always push back on their anti-life stances with  a clear and strong message of full opposition. I believe that every  human life is precious and should be protected at every stage.  Throughout my career, I have always stood for life. I will continue to  fight against this administration's anti-life policies.
