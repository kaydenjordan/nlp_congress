 Mr. President, I rise to mark a very special day for the  Sikh religion and the Sikh community across America and especially in  Pennsylvania--specifically, the birthday of the founder of Sikhism,  Guru Nanak.   Guru Nanak was born into a Hindu household in 1469 in what is now  modern-day Pakistan. Guru Nanak showed a keen interest in religion from  very early on in his life. He had a real aptitude in his youth for  philosophizing and writing poetry. He married, had children, and became  an accountant like his father. Yet he always believed in the importance  of living a spiritual life. Eventually, he underwent a profound  personal transformation to become the religious figure and leader for  which he is recognized today.   Guru Nanak's most famous teachings include that there is only one  God, that people need not go through an intermediary, such as a priest,  to access the one God, and that all people are created equal. He  preached that his followers should meditate and remember God, that they  should earn an honest living, and that they should share with those who  are less fortunate than themselves.   Guru Nanak began teaching the Sikh faith around the year 1500, and  with around 30 million adherents, the Sikh faith is the sixth largest  religion in the world. Approximately 700,000 Sikhs have chosen to make  their homes in the United States. There are several Sikh places of  worship, known as gurdwaras, in and around the Philadelphia area,  Pittsburgh, Allentown, Erie, and across America.   Next month, on November 12, there will be celebrations at gurdwaras  across the globe to mark the 550th birthday of Guru Nanak. In addition,  Sikh leaders have come to the Capitol today to commemorate the birthday  of Guru Nanak.   A few minutes ago, a giani, or a Sikh religious official, gave a  prayer as the Senate opened for business. I am proud that he hails from  my State of Pennsylvania. This evening, leaders from the Sikh community  will convene an interfaith event to promote the peaceful values that  all of the world's major religions share.   This morning, I just wanted to add my voice to wish the Sikh  community great luck and great joy with this event and to wish Guru  Nanak a happy 550th birthday this year.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
