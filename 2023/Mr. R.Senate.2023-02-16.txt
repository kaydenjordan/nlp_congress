C. Roberts.   I can think of no better way to cap off Black History Month than to  recognize Mr. Roberts, his service to our country, and help him and his  family celebrate his 100th birthday.   How about a round of applause, America, for Mr. Roberts' 100th  birthday, a Normandy, D-Day, Omaha Beach veteran. He celebrated that on  Tuesday, Valentine's Day, 100 years old.   So who is Mr. Roberts?   Let's hear a little bit about the life that he has lived in full.  Like I said, that is him. That is him, our Alaskan of the Week, on the  poster board. He was a handsome young man, saving the world, literally.   He was originally born in Garrison, TX, in 1923. Imagine that, 100  years ago. According to letters written by friends, he worked on a  family farm, left school early in life, and joined the Army when he was  just 18, shortly at the start of World War II. He wanted to go fight  for his country, and he did fight.   Many Americans have seen movies about D-Day. Again, here is a photo-- our brave soldiers, hitting the beaches at Normandy, facing  unbelievable heavy fire, having to navigate mined obstacles on the  beach, mines on the bluffs, Germans dug in with machineguns.   You have seen in the beginning--I am sure many of you have--``Saving  Private Ryan,'' the seawalls to climb. That is what he did. That is  what he did for America, for freedom. It was the largest, most complex  combined airborne-amphibious military invasion in world history. Mr.  Roberts, our Alaskan of the Week, was there on Omaha Beach in 1944.   He eventually marched all the way into Germany with the U.S. Army,  all the way across Europe. He was part of the heroic mission that saved  the world. That is not an exaggeration.   Mr. Roberts served 3 years. He was awarded the European Campaign  Medal with three Bronze Stars, representing three difficult battles  across Europe that he fought in. And here is the thing, you have to  remember this. It was 1944. Our military was fully segregated, and  Black soldiers were discriminated against. In fact, it took until 1948  for President Harry Truman to order the Armed Forces to be integrated,  16 years before the passage of the Civil Rights Act. But this patriot,  despite the discrimination, was fighting for America.   How did Mr. Roberts make it through these ordeals--incredible  ordeals--of fire?   Prayer, he said. He said:         Every day, I prayed, and [when I got home] I was so       grateful to be back in the United States.    When he got out of the military and made his way back to Texas and  then to California, he had a friend who was in Alaska who told him that  his skills were needed up in the great State of Alaska.   It was 1964. Our State had just been devastated by the largest  earthquake ever recorded in North America. It was the second-largest  earthquake ever recorded in the history of the world--9.2 on the  Richter scale--our Good Friday earthquake in 1964. Tsunamis crushed  buildings, and of course it killed a lot of people. There was a lot of  rebuilding being done. So Mr. Roberts, who at this point was a cement  mason, made his way north--north to Alaska, north to the future.   He worked all across the State helping rebuild it: Fairbanks, Kenai,  Valdez, the Aleutian Islands Chain. He literally helped lay pavement  for the construction of what is now Ted Stevens International Airport  in Anchorage.   He bought a house in Chugiak, AK, outside of Anchorage. He met and  married the love of his life, Joan, in 1970, in Anchorage. They joined  the Eagle River Missionary Baptist Church, where they remained, and he  remains an active member at the tender age of 100. Together for more  than 40 years, before Joan passed, they raised four generations of  children and had a wonderful life together.   Like I said, Tuesday, Valentine's Day, February 14, was Mr. Roberts'  100th birthday. I had the honor of calling him, wishing him a happy  birthday, talking to him a little bit about his heroic service,  thanking him for his heroic service.   The day after his birthday, he caught up with his friend Darrell  Little. Mr. Roberts and Mr. Little have been friends--best friends--for  more than 40 years. Darrell was visiting Mr. Roberts, making him his  favorite meal for his birthday, a beef tongue sandwich. Sounds pretty  good.   Darrell described Mr. Roberts as a loyal citizen who served his  country bravely with honor and distinction. That is what being Alaskan  of the Week is all about.   Darrell asked Mr. Roberts what he wanted to say about his  extraordinary life, and here is what Mr. Roberts said just 2 days ago.  He loves Alaska. He wouldn't trade his time in the State for anything  else in the world, even with all the snow we are having this winter. He  also said it was such a great honor to serve his country, and he  thanked God for blessing him.   He sounds like an amazing guy. He is an amazing guy. I just spoke to  him.   Mr. Roberts, thank you for your service. Thank you for helping  rebuild Alaska. Thank you for living and leading such an exemplary life  for 100 years. Thank you, as we move into Black History Month, for  showing an example of a young man, patriotic, despite systemic  discrimination against him, who fought the evil Nazi regime heroically  and valiantly, part of the ``greatest generation'' that literally saved  the world.   So, Mr. Roberts, happy birthday. I know you are also happy about one  of the most prestigious awards you can ever get, Alaskan of the Week.  We wish you well, sir.
