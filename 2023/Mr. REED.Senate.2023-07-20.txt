 Mr. President, this amendment is, I think, reckless. It  would essentially halt 98 percent of the aid that we would authorize  and appropriate to go to Ukraine, which would be good news in Moscow  but very bad news in Kyiv.   This amendment is trying to incentivize our NATO partners to increase  their efforts to 2 percent of GDP, and that is a goal that has been  agreed to, but the practical, immediate effect would be to undermine  the military posture of Ukraine at a time when they are desperately  fighting for their survival. But more importantly, they are fighting  our fight also, because if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, we will lose, as  well as Ukrainians. It will incentivize the kind of autocratic behavior  that is determined--at least in the case of Putin--to destroy  democracies and destroy the international legal order.   We have already expressed our not only desire but strong, strong  imperative that NATO reach the 2 percent goal, but this is punishing  the Ukrainians for the sins of others, and that would be terrible.   I would urge that this position be rejected.                          Vote on Amendment No. 376     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60  affirmative-vote threshold for the following amendments be vitiated:  Scott, No. 510; Romney, No. 823; Sinema, No. 315; Grassley, No. 273;  Blackburn, No. 224; Moran, No. 949; and Baldwin, No. 685; further, that  the amendments be called up and the Senate vote on the adoption of the  amendments, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I report  favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in the  Record on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these nominations  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.
