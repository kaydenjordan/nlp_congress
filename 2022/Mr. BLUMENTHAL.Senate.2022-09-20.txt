 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize  Dixwell Avenue United Congregational Church of Christ as it celebrates  202 years of spiritual leadership in New Haven, CT. I am honored to  join Dixwell Congregational Church's congregation and supporters in  celebrating the church's bicentennial, 2 years later than planned due  to the COVID-19 pandemic--just the latest obstacle the church has  overcome in its long and remarkable history.   Dixwell Avenue United Congregational Church of Christ is the oldest  African-American Congregational UCC church in the world. It was founded  in 1820, when Black residents in New Haven were unwelcome at the city's  traditional churches. Seeking the freedom to worship, a group of 22  Black New Haven residents persuaded a Yale student and abolitionist  named Simeon Jocelyn to conduct religious services with them at his  home. Together they formed the city's first Black congregation and,  after meeting house to house for 4 years, began renting a small church  on Temple Street in New Haven in 1825.   In 1837, the Rev. Dr. James W. C. Pennington became the first Black  pastor of Dixwell Avenue United Congregational Church of Christ. After  fleeing from slavery, the Yale-educated Pennington became  internationally renowned as a skilled orator. Under his leadership and  the pastorate of his successor, the Rev. Amos G. Beman, the church  became one of America's most eminent civil rights organizations and a  cradle of the abolitionist movement. Not only did the church serve as a  stop on the Underground Railroad, but many of its members were active  on the Amistad Committee, which supported the defense in the landmark  1841 case United States v, The Amistad, which resulted in the U.S.  Supreme Court granting the enslaved people onboard the ship their  freedom.   The church moved to its current home on Dixwell Avenue in 1886 and  continued to work for the social betterment of the community. In the  early 20th century, the church donated the land on which the original  Dixwell Community House was built, ensuring that generations of area  residents had access to enriching education and recreation, as well as  vital social services. One of the central figures in the church's  recent history is the civil rights activist Rev. Dr. Edmond R. Edmunds,  who led the church for nearly 40 years beginning in 1959. Under his  pastorate, the congregation established daycare and afterschool  programs that encouraged academic achievement in the Dixwell  neighborhood. He also helped initiate the Dixwell Housing Development  Corporation which, for many years, provided affordable housing to  local, low-income families.   The church's current pastor, the Rev. Dr. Frederick ``Jerry'' Streets  has carried forth the congregation's tradition of serving its  community. Reverend Streets has fostered civil and constructive  conversations about race in New Haven, developed faith-based  rehabilitation programs for individuals with substance abuse disorders,  and initiated summer STEM education programs for Dixwell neighborhood  youth, amongst other good deeds.   I have had the privilege of visiting Dixwell Avenue United  Congregational Church of Christ on a number of occasions and have  always been welcomed as one of the congregation. This kindness, free  from judgement, has helped countless people in need over the past two  centuries.   As Dixwell Avenue United Congregational Church of Christ celebrates  its bicentennial plus two this September, I applaud them on their  extraordinary contributions--not just to the city of New Haven and  State of Connecticut, but to our great Nation. I hope my colleagues  will join me in congratulating Dixwell Avenue United Congregational  Church of Christ on 202 years of committed worship and service to their  community.                            ____________________
