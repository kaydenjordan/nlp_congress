 Mr. Speaker, today I want to acknowledge the Mullica  Township ACES program, a school district initiative in south Jersey. It  is an initiative started by Barbara Rheault that provides academic aid  and enrichment to students after school hours.   The ACES program started in Mullica Township, south Jersey, 12 years  ago thanks to grant funds for a 21st Century Community Learning Center  from the New Jersey Department of Education.   This after-school program is vital to south Jersey because it  provides after-school care to students that balances academic  opportunities and recreational activities. At ACES, students have time  to complete their homework and participate in sports or other games and  activities, which cultivates both their academic and social  development.   ACES also offers additional tutoring, counseling, and health-safety  education so every student has access to whatever they need to achieve  success.   I thank the ACES program, Barbara Rheault, and the Mullica Township  School District for providing this educational experience for our  youth. I am proud of them.                            ____________________
