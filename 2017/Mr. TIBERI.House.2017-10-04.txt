 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, we are making a choice today about the kind of future that  we want. We can choose a future of more deficits and more debt piled  onto our children, or we can continue having a weak economy where  people in their prime working years can keep leaving the job market.   Or we can choose a future where America's job creators, people who go  to work every day, decide that they will be better off starting or  moving their business overseas.   Or we can choose the future of more of the same, and it is not the  wealthy who will suffer more of the same. It is the most vulnerable,  low-income Americans trying to climb out of poverty. It is the middle  class families who find it harder and harder to keep up, to get ahead-- people like my dad, a machine operator who is now retired as a United  Steelworker.   It is our children and our grandchildren who will have to pay  tomorrow for the mistakes that we make today.   But we can instead choose a better future, Mr. Chair, where the  government learns to live within its means and move forward toward  balanced budgets; a future where job-creating small businesses aren't  punished by our Tax Code when they succeed; a future where we stop  losing jobs and businesses to foreign countries with lower tax rates,  when workers can finally get the pay raises they deserve, more money in  their pockets, and more prosperity is widespread, not just concentrated  on our coasts and a few large urban cities.   We will be voting soon on a budget that restores fiscal  responsibility and paves the way for a world class Tax Code built for  growth and a better future for our kids and our grandkids.   Yesterday, at the Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Chair, we held a  hearing on the decline in business startups, the engines of job growth  and innovation in America, and the role tax reform could play in  reversing this downward spiral.   Among other things, here is what we heard yesterday at the hearing.  First, simplify the Tax Code. Entrepreneurs spend way too much time and  way too much money complying with the Tax Code instead of focusing on  growing their businesses.   Second, lower the tax rates that our companies and employers pay.  That is something that foreign governments around the world, both  friends and foes, have already done to attract more jobs, more  businesses.   Third, let companies of all sizes write off the cost of their growth- producing investment immediately, this is called expensing, instead of  deducting them slowly from the taxes over many years under very  complicated depreciation rules.   Fourth, stop punishing our businesses for investing overseas profits  by bringing them back home to America. Move away from the system that  double taxes American companies that do business overseas.    These steps will boost economic growth. Growing markets will give  entrepreneurs the confidence to risk starting a business, which many  won't even do today, as we have seen more and more startups not making  it to the starting line.   More startups create more jobs, an average of six new jobs per  startup, and more economic growth means continuing to spread that  prosperity.   I am happy to report that these recommendations are a large part of  our tax reform framework that has just recently been unveiled:  simplicity, lower tax rates, expensing, stop double taxing our American  businesses that do business abroad, reward investment in America, and  boost economic growth.   We need a Tax Code that makes America the best place in the world to  do business and grow your business and keep your business.   Our job creators who are corporate taxpayers now face the highest tax  rate in the developed world. While other countries aggressively lower  their tax rate, Mr. Chair, to attract new businesses, we left our  businesses standing still.   Mr. Chair, the tax reform framework would slash our corporate rate  from the highest in the world, at 35 percent, to a competitive 20  percent. Instead of the worst, we get much better. In a global economy,  that is just not a luxury, that is a necessity.   Our tax reform framework will not only help American companies  compete with foreign ones, but also bring capital back to America to  invest and grow jobs here at home.   Let's look at how the Tax Code is punishing our small businesses who  pay individual taxes as pass-throughs, not just with complex taxes but  also high tax rates.   When Main Street businessowners went to sleep on December 31 of 2012,  their highest tax rate was 35 percent. When they woke up the following  year in January of 2013, Mr. Chair, their top rate spiked to 44.6  percent due to Obama administration policies.   Many on the other side of the aisle will say that most small  businesses don't pay the top rate, but taxpayers who do pay the top  rate, those small businesses, in many cases, are responsible for much  of our economic activity and our employment as pass-through businesses.   Every small business owner dreams of being successful, and the high  top rate punishes the very success that we want them to achieve in  America. Adding to the Federal rate, the tax rate, the local rate, many  of these small businesses pay over 50 percent in taxes.   The tax reform framework not only slashes rates for American  employers but our small businesses as well. The top rate for pass- throughs will be 25 percent.   Another feature of the tax reform framework, Mr. Chair, would allow  businesses of all sizes to deduct their business expenses, their  investments, immediately through expensing. This would encourage  companies to make the kind of investment like buying state-of-the-art  equipment that would lead businesses to grow, create more jobs, pay  better wages, higher economic growth, and the best part of all, larger  paychecks for workers.   Mr. Chair, we have a choice to make. We can turn our backs on the  most vulnerable Americans and doom them to more of the same, subpar  growth, stagnant wages, more debt, less opportunity, a complex and  outdated Tax Code that punishes job creation and investment in America,  or I hope we choose a better path forward, a better future for  Americans, bigger paychecks, and it starts today with the passing of  this budget.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this budget.   Ultimately, a national budget is like a deal between the American  taxpayers and Congress about how this country will spend their money.  Anyone who looks at the fine print in this budget plan can tell, with a  glance, that the American people want, need, and deserve a better deal.   In the Republican tax plan that goes with this budget, 80 percent of  the Republican tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. The top 1 percent gets  an average of $200,000 in tax cuts.   A better deal would drop plans to slash Medicare and Medicaid to pay  for massive tax cuts for the wealthiest few--a deal that instead would  be a bipartisan effort to bring middle class tax relief, badly needed  investments, and greater opportunity.   But what we have instead is a budget that cuts $5.4 trillion in  spending over 10 years, including $4.4 trillion in cuts to the  mandatory programs that help average Americans get and stay ahead.  [[Page H7794]]    These aren't just paper cuts. These are huge cuts--cuts that would  cause enormous damage in the lives of children, students, veterans, and  other Americans. About half of these cuts in nondefense spending are in  programs that help people who need the help the most--cuts in programs  that provide food to those in need, programs that help students from  low-income families afford a college education. They even have cuts in  the badly needed disaster relief that is helping so many in our  country.   In fact, by 2027, more than one-third of the resources for low- and  middle-income people would be gone. Struggling Americans deserve a  better deal than that. And who pays under the Republican tax plan?  Seniors, single parents, and middle class families, it goes up.   Nondefense discretionary is already at its lowest level since the  category has been tracked. Republicans want to cut even more, and so  they target senior citizens and healthcare.   This budget cuts half a trillion dollars from Medicare, replacing  Medicare's guaranteed benefits with a voucher-like system and  increasing its eligibility age to 67.                                time  1630    The CBO estimates that these cuts would cause part B premiums to  increase 25 percent by 2020. And this budget claims that it ``saves''  $1.5 trillion by repealing the Affordable Care Act, even though they  have already tried to repeal it about 60 times on this floor, without  success, thank God, and the American people have made it clear that  they don't want it repealed.   They still have no replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act. So  that means that they would just be leaving millions without health  insurance and threatening the coverage of all those with preexisting  conditions and chronic illnesses, and would leave millions facing huge  premium increases.   Their plan also cuts $114 billion from Medicaid, ripping away  coverage from low-income families and the disabled. This is just plain  wrong. Our seniors deserve a much better deal than that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Francis Rooney).   Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  for the opportunity to speak a little bit here about the tax reform  opportunities that we are seeing now.   Some people don't like to admit it, but there is a proven,  inescapable correlation among tax treatment, capital investment, and  job creation. As this chart right here shows, unequivocally correlating  an investment of capital with economic change, when you have more money  put in, you get more jobs and more economic growth. And some people  don't like to admit that connection, but it is inescapable. It has been  that way ever since the first commerce took place in the Roman era.   We have a second chart that shows the post-World War II GDP change,  an average of 3.1. The American middle class was built on opportunity,  lower taxes, economic stimuli, and growth. It wasn't built on this 2.3  to 1.6 that we are going to get if we don't get back to some serious  business-centric, investment-centric tax reform.   There is another equally inescapable fact, and that is that capital  is fungible. If tax treatment nurtures it, like watering your yard, it  will grow. If not, it will be invested somewhere else. Just look at  Texas, just look at my home State of Florida, and look at Ireland, for  example.   When the tax climate is nurturing and favorable for investment, you  get money put in, you get jobs created, you get economic growth.  Investment goes where it is most favorably treated. So going to 20 and  25 percent from 35 to 40 percent will unleash a torrent of capital  investment and job formation.   Rapid capital recovery by expensing capital assets purchases will  attract massive investments, stimulate our economy, make our  manufacturing companies do better, and build up the capital stock of  our country again, like we used to do. This is going to create one  thing: job-creating economic growth.   That is what we need and that is what the Republican reform program  offers.   It also offers one more thing and it changes treatment of foreign  income, which is something I have some experience in, and it will  incentivize companies to keep their income here. That is a good thing  for America.   So I might just mention for just a second about what they say and  what we say. They say tax cut for the wealthy. No, it is not a tax cut  for the wealthy. It lowers taxes on all businesses and middle class  Americans.   They say rising brackets on low income. This is an absolute  incorrigible falsehood. No. We are taking the 10 percent rate to zero.  We are taking the 15 percent rate to 10. By the way, Ronald Reagan  reduced the 11 percent rate to zero.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.   Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. They say it will explode the deficit,  but we all know that economic growth shrinks deficits. Ronald Reagan  proved that in spades, and we are going to see it again. When we  eliminate many of these narrowly-crafted, special interest, lobbyist- driven credits and deductions, we are going to save enough money.  Especially when we eliminate the State and local tax deduction, we are  going to save a couple of trillion dollars that will help balance this.   Then they say loss of itemized deductions is a bad thing. When we  double the standard exemption, no one is going to need to itemize. The  people that do itemize, fine, they can have mortgage interest  reduction, charitable reduction, whatever. But most Americans are going  to be able to pay their taxes on a postcard.   In the polling in this country, the frustration of Americans with the  IRS is directly related to the fact that nobody can fill out a tax form  anymore. So we have great progress here.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to speak.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, 80 percent of the  Republican tax cuts go to the top 1 percent, and the top 1 percent gets  an average of $200,000 in tax cuts. And what we see in this budget is a  slashing of investments in the future strength of our country.   Instead of slashing infrastructure spending, as this budget does, we  should be increasing our spending to fill the giant infrastructure  pothole that Republican policies have left us with.   We have airports that feel Third World. We have bridges that are  crumbling, tunnels that need replacing, roads that need fixing. Failing  to do so costs all of us in time, money, and economic development.   This budget totally fails to recognize the value of infrastructure  investment. It cuts $254 billion from transportation over 10 years.  Funding would drop from $92 billion next year to just $65 billion in  2022.   It eliminates the Transportation Investment Generating Economic  Recovery grant program used for infrastructure development and repair  projects for interstate highways, bridge improvements, and ports. This  is incredibly shortsighted.    According to a study by the American Society of Civil Engineers,  failing to close the infrastructure investment gap brings serious  economic consequences: $3.9 trillion in losses to the U.S. GDP by 2025;  $7 trillion in lost business sales in 2025; and 2.5 million lost  American jobs in 2025.   I have seen with my own eyes what infrastructure development can mean  to business development and the quality of life in the city that I  serve. The Second Avenue Subway, built with the help of Federal funds,  opened in January and has already had a huge economic impact. Stores  say their business is up 20 to 30 percent along that line and it has  cut overcrowding and reduced traveling times.   New York's old Kosciuszko Bridge, which was first opened in 1939, was  originally designed for 10,000 vehicles a day. It was carrying 18 times  that and had become an accident choke point.   Thanks to Federal funding, it has been replaced, and the biggest city  in the country will have a brand-new, 21st century bridge soon because  these kinds of investments boost productivity and bolster our economy,  with each $1 in infrastructure investment  [[Page H7795]]  generating up to $1.80 in additional economic activity.   The American Society of Civil Engineers gives our national  infrastructure an overall grade of D-plus and our transit system a D- minus. It is just plain irresponsible to slash spending on our  crumbling highways and bridges now, because if we don't make needed  investments today, we will jeopardize our competitiveness tomorrow.   Let's be clear: we are already significantly underinvesting in  infrastructure. As you can see from this chart, public investments in  infrastructure and other public fixed assets have fallen over the last  few years, dropping to a low of $274 billion in 2014, from more than  $357 billion in 2009.   We have created a giant infrastructure spending pothole that you see  right here. All told, it costs our Nation more than half a trillion  dollars in lost investment over 5 years.   The people of this country deserve modern infrastructure. They  deserve a better deal.   This budget also cuts $154 billion from nutrition, from the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, ignoring the more than 40  million low-income families, including children, the working poor, the  elderly, and the disabled, to say nothing of the 8 million people,  including 4 million children it lifts out of poverty. The hungry  children of America deserve a better deal than that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), a senior member of the Joint Economic  Committee, as well as a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I would again like to point out this little  chart that shows facts. At the bottom of the chart, if the viewers can  see, is the United States with our corporate tax rate. All of these  other countries, most of whom are our friends, even France, is lower  than the United States, Spain, Canada, Netherlands, Austria, Turkey,  Italy, New Zealand, Japan--you can go on and on.   Mr. Chairman, we have the highest corporate rate in the  industrialized developed world. Facts are a stubborn thing to deal  with, Mr. Chairman. This budget, as Congressman Paulsen said, is the  first step into dealing with something that we haven't dealt with in 31  years.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to  [[Page H7796]]  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LaHood), who represents the central part of Illinois, and  is a new member of the Joint Economic Committee.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 71, the fiscal  year 2018 budget resolution. This bill makes necessary and responsible  funding determinations by reducing the size and scope of government,  cutting Federal spending by $5.4 trillion over 10 years, and balancing  the Federal budget in fiscal year 2027.   Given our Nation's more than $20 trillion in debt, it is past time to  get serious about our Federal spending so that important programs are  able to be sustained long term. In addition, this bill sets the stage  for much-needed tax reform. Small businesses and farmers are the  bedrock of the American economy. For decades, we have allowed our Tax  Code to balloon with loopholes and tax breaks for special interests,  hurting our local economies and middle class workers.   That is why it is so crucial that we pass this commonsense budget as  the first step in reforming our Nation's outdated Tax Code. Our current  system continues to fail small business owners, farmers, and middle  class families with its overwhelmingly complex system. That is why over  90 percent of Americans have to pay for help with filing their taxes  every year.   Not only does this cost people their hard-earned money, but this also  costs us our valuable time. Every year we  [[Page H7797]]  spend a combined 8.9 billion hours filing our taxes. That is time we  could be using to focus on our work and families. For businesses, that  is time they could use for expanding and growing our economy.   The solution here is not to defend the status quo, as some on the  other side of the aisle continue to do, but to simplify our Tax Code  and lower the rates for businesses and the middle class.   Another crucial part of reforming our Tax Code must be the  elimination of the death tax, which harms farmers like those in the  18th Congressional District of Illinois. Family-owned businesses and  farms that use their hard-earned dollars to invest back in their  businesses are often forced to sell off parts or all in order to pay  the death tax.   There is nothing fair about penalizing our job creators and the  drivers of our economy for investing in and growing their business. In  fact, it is estimated that repealing the death tax would grow our  economy by 0.9 percent over 10 years.    These small business investments are often necessary for small  businesses and farmers who depend upon expensive machinery to earn  their living. Our current Tax Code, however, encourages businessowners  to put off their investments as they are only able to deduct the cost  of equipment over many years. By allowing full expensing, businesses  and farmers can fully invest in the tools they need to become more  productive, all the while earning more savings.   According to the Tax Foundation, full expensing would save businesses  money, leading to nearly a 5 percent increase in income for low- and  middle-income workers.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Chair, tax reform is about getting our economy back  to working for the middle class, and for our small businesses, growing  it from the inside out. This budget is the necessary first step in that  process, and I am proud to support it. It will help bring relief to  those who need it most.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, just to remind my colleagues, the nonpartisan Tax Policy  Center points out that 80 percent of the Republican tax cuts go to the  top 1 percent.   But in this budget resolution that we are discussing, it slashes  education funding, putting the drain of a college education for average  Americans even further out of reach. It asks the American people who  already experience crippling student loan debt to reach even deeper  into their pockets for their education by cutting $211 billion from  student financial aid programs.                                time  1700    It freezes the maximum level awarded by a Pell grant at $5,900,  covering just 23 percent of an education by 2026, compared to the 30  percent it covers today or the 77 percent it covered in 1980. In  addition, it also cuts $3.3 billion from the Pell grant surplus, which  provides a much-needed reserve to cover the cost of future education.   If that is not enough, after students graduate, this budget makes it  increasingly difficult to pay off student loans and steers graduates  away from public service and teaching jobs by eliminating the Public  Service Loan Forgiveness and Teacher Loan Forgiveness programs. Our  students and our teachers deserve a better deal than that.   I must say that we are suffering from three hurricanes, devastating  hurricanes, yet this budget eliminates three programs that play very  key roles in disaster relief. The Community Development Block Grant  program, AmeriCorps, and the Legal Services Corporation are all  eliminated. This budget abolishes these programs that are literally  supporting our relief efforts from Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   Our Nation's veterans--our Nation's veterans--our bravest, are not  spared the carnage of this heartless proposal. The GOP budget proposes  $50 billion in cuts to mandatory spending on veterans programs over 10  years, including education benefits and loan guarantees. So after we  have already asked so much of our men and women in uniform, this budget  refuses to give them the tools they need to transition to civilian  life. Our veterans deserve a better deal than that from the country  that they have served so honorably.   Cuts to research, where research is the future of our country, and  this budget would also cut investments that are directly tied to our  country's future prosperity by slashing basic research funding.   I want to point out how important research funding is to our country.  In 1996, two Stanford graduate students took a $4.5 million research  grant from the National Science Foundation and developed a new  algorithm called PageRank. Two years later, these same students took  PageRank and launched a new internet search engine we now call Google.  Today Google is worth over $600 billion and employs over 72,000  Americans, and it all began with a Federal basic research grant of $4.5  million.   Google is just one example on a long list of technological  advancement companies and, most importantly, jobs that trace their  roots to basic research investment. It is what has kept this country on  top.   According to the Brookings Institution, two-thirds of the most  influential technologies over the past 50 years were supported by  Federal research grants. It has brought us lifesaving vaccines, the  laser, touchscreen, GPS, and even the internet, technology that has  served as a launching pad for cutting-edge medical treatment.   Sadly, the chart behind me reflects a sharp decline in the Federal  share of funding of basic research dropping from 72 percent in 1967 to  44 percent in 2015. This GOP budget proposal follows that same trend  with instructions to cut $41 billion from science, space, and  technology precisely at a time when we should be increasing investments  in these sectors.   It is important to the future prosperity of America. Cuts now mean  fewer jobs and economic growth in the future; they mean less innovation  and less prosperity. So if my colleagues across the aisle want to grow  the economy, turning this trend around is an important way to do it.   Now, I have heard all day from my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle how very, very concerned they are about the deficit, but the GOP  tax plan makes it worse. The tax framework released last week by the  White House and Republican leaders would add $2.4 trillion to the  deficit in the first 10 years and another $3.2 trillion in the next 10  years.   So the Republican budget is just totally unacceptable. This budget  flat-out ignores the reality. So if Republicans are concerned about the  deficit, then they should really rewrite their budget proposal.   In conclusion, look at the fine print of this proposed deal and  imagine the harm it would cause to millions of American families, to  our children, to our seniors, to our sick and suffering, to our  disabled and our destitute, to our economy, to our research, and to our  infrastructure. It is clear--clear--beyond any and all doubt that  Americans deserve a better deal.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Conaway), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Conaway), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, America is at a crossroads, and this budget is about  choices.   Mr. Chairman, there are moms and dads, single moms and elderly folks  sitting at the kitchen table every night making choices on what to buy  and what to pay for. They have to live within their means, Mr.  Chairman.   The Federal Government, for too long, hasn't lived within its means,  and this budget is about that. This budget is about tax reform. This  budget is about growing our economy. We haven't seen the growth in this  recovery that we have seen in others.   Mr. Chairman, I remember when I got my first job at McDonald's. My  immigrant mother and my immigrant father sat me down and talked to me  about the taxes that I would pay coming out of my first paycheck. I  clearly remember my dad saying to me: Don't let the taxes that you pay  stop you from saving most of this money, because in America, not only  do you get taxed when you earn it, you get taxed when you save it, and  if you save enough, you will get taxed when you die. That was my  immigrant father with a fifth grade education. He was a steelworker.   Mr. Chairman, it is incredibly sad in America today when a successful  entrepreneur will pay over 50 percent of what he or she makes in taxes  at the Federal, State, and local levels.   Mr. Chairman, it has been 31 years since we reformed our outdated Tax  Code, and now is the time--now is the time--at this crossroads to  change the direction of America for our kids and our grandkids. I urge  a ``yes'' vote on this responsible budget to live within our means, and  I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 33 minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 33\1/4\ minutes remaining.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.
