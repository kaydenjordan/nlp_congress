 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative  Waters for her leadership on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I want to highlight some language in this en bloc  amendment that is very important to the working women of this country.  The provision requires publicly traded companies to disclose the number  and monetary amounts of settlements and judgments in connection with  workplace harassment claims.   This will not only improve transparency and accountability for public  companies, but it will provide incentives for them to foster  respectful, safe workplaces free from harassment and to make sure that  there are consequences when workplace abuses occur.   Here is the thing. Up to 80 percent of women have experienced some  form of workplace harassment, and there are serious implications that  often result: physical and mental health problems, career  interruptions, and lower earnings. Enduring this kind of harassment at  work can even discourage women from advancing their careers, which only  makes the gender wage gap worse.   All persons must have safe workplaces to reach their full potential,  and investors should know more about the workplaces they are putting  their money behind. Transparency should add motivation to employers to  keep their employees safe, and that is good for everyone.                                time  1400
