 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bill Gibbs from  Springport, Michigan, and congratulate him for being named Jackson  County Veteran of the Year.   A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of meeting Bill at VFW Post 6056  during their Veterans Day ceremony. It was a special evening with a  room full of heroes, none more so than Bill.   When our country called during the Vietnam war, Bill answered with  tremendous bravery. For his heroism in  [[Page H9527]]  harm's way, Bill was awarded the Purple Heart, four Bronze Stars with  valor device, and a number of other service medals.   Over the years, Bill has done it all at Post 6056, including serving  as post commander, trustee, post historian, and quartermaster for 33  years. When called upon, he performs as an honor guard member at  military funerals in the community.   Mr. Speaker, for all this and much more, Bill is incredibly deserving  of the Veteran of the Year award, and our Nation is eternally grateful  for his service and sacrifice. Thank you, Bill Gibbs, and welcome home.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking the chairman,  the ranking member, as well as committee staff for all of their hard  work bringing this bipartisan bill to the House floor today.   Mr. Speaker, the EPA's brownfields program is an important grant  program for the State of Michigan and, more specifically, the district  I represent, Michigan's Seventh District.   Because of Michigan's rich manufacturing history, there are a number  of former industrial sites that are ripe for revitalization. These  sites can range from large industrial manufacturing sites to local  corner gas stations.   This program provides communities the chance to take abandoned and  vacant sites and once again turn them into economic assets, all the  while cleaning up our beautiful environment.   Just this summer, the EPA announced that the historic former Tecumseh  Products site in Tecumseh, Michigan, received a $500,000 grant to  revitalize this 53-acre industrial site. This $500,000 grant will go  towards cleaning up the former manufacturing facility site and create  more jobs in the process.   In Monroe, the brownfields program played a key role in restoring  land for the River Raisin National Battlefield Park, which is one of  the leading historic attractions in our area, and one  [[Page H9544]]  that I am delighted to say I was involved with former Congressman John  Dingell in making an impact for this great district.   The positive impact for these communities and many others is  invaluable. Revitalizing these blighted areas encourages economic  redevelopment, injects new tax revenue into our local economy, and  assists local governments with the support they need to address these  projects.   H.R. 3017 reauthorizes the vital brownfields program so that more  positive work can be done in Michigan and in every one of our  districts. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.
