 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 780 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 780         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4061) to       amend the Financial Stability Act of 2010 to improve the       transparency of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to       improve the SIFI designation process, and for other purposes.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting       of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-64, modified by the       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one       motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4293) to reform       the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process, the       Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test process, and for other purposes.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services       now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-63, modified by the amendment printed in part B of the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial       Services; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. The rule makes in order two bills reported  favorably by the Committee on Financial Services. Both bills were the  subject of multiple hearings before the Committee on Financial  Services. Each bill was reported favorably by a bipartisan majority  without amendment. The rule adopts the only two amendments that were  offered to these bills.   Madam Speaker, yesterday I had the privilege of being here on the  floor debating three financial services bills, and I am back with two  more today. Last night, the Senate took a significant step toward  joining the House in producing a banking reform bill. The negative  impacts of Dodd-Frank are enough to finally overcome even the Senate's  inertia.  [[Page H1619]]    Last year, the House Republicans passed our own plan to reform our  banking system and regulate financial institutions in a smarter way.  Ever since Dodd-Frank became law, our small town and community lenders  have been hamstrung by regulations intended for large Wall Street  banks.   As is usually the case, Washington did not regulate in a manner that  focused on bad actors or that differentiated between diverse financing  institutions. Instead, Federal regulators stamped out one-size-fits-all  regulations that have had negative impacts on our local community banks  and credit unions.   Under the House Republican plan, we correct this wrongheaded approach  by forcing regulators to take into account the size and risk profiles  of smaller institutions. The Financial CHOICE Act ensures the security  of our financial institutions without creating a too-big-to-fail  government support system and encouraging local banks and credit unions  to invest in our communities.   Over the past few months, we have put various components of the  Financial CHOICE Act on the floor in order to demonstrate to the Senate  that there is a bipartisan pathway forward on many of our proposals. We  continue that effort today.   The first bill that is made in order by this rule is H.R. 4061, the  Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act. This bill  enhances transparency and procedural equity of the nonbank systemically  important financial institution designation process.   Under Dodd-Frank, systemically important financial institutions were  intended to be large banks whose collapse would bring about enormous  financial upheaval; however, in the hands of regulators, certain  insurance companies and asset managers were designated as systemically  important. This was not Congress' intent when allowing regulators to  designate nonbanks as systemically important.   The bill before us today will not roll back the ability of regulators  to determine that a large nonbank financial institution is systemically  important, but it will ensure the process for designating the nonbank  as transparent. It also forces regulators to consider other possible  regulatory fixes before designating a nonbank as systemically  important.                                time  1230    Well, this is all well and good. But what does this mean for  Coloradans and other Americans?   In 2014, the life insurer MetLife was designated as a systemically  important financial institution by regulators. By 2016, MetLife had  prevailed in court and had their designation overturned.   What was revealed was how arbitrary and capricious the designation  process seemed to be. Regulators never clarified what level of risk  would be acceptable, nor did they clearly identify particular types of  financial products or business activities that would result in too much  risk.   So life insurers and others were left wondering how to avoid the  important designation. Being designated would not only increase  compliance costs and consume resources that could not be invested into  the business, it also would have forced the financial company to limit  the options they made available to their customers.   So we see the vicious cycle of overregulation play out again: less  growth and fewer choices.   Fortunately, in the case referenced above, the courts stepped in  early and halted the process. However, we have the opportunity now to  bring about reforms to the designation process that protect Americans  from losing access to financial products that serve them well.   When we talk about Washington picking winners and losers, look no  further than Dodd-Frank and the systemically important financial  institution designation. Let's put an end to these opaque regulatory  decisions and allow light to shine on financial regulators.   Madam Speaker, the second bill that this bill makes in order is H.R.  4293, the Stress Test Improvement Act.   The Federal Reserve determines the ability of bank holding companies  to withstand certain types of economic turmoil. These determinations  have become known as stress tests.   These stress tests have become notorious for their vague rules and  the secrecy by which the regulators conduct the tests. Bank compliance  officers are often stuck trying to figure on what exactly their bank is  going to be examined. Banks not only do not know what they are going to  be tested on, they often never know what they were tested on after the  stress test is conducted.   Frankly, technocrat regulators playing ``hide the ball'' from  Americans that they are regulating seems like a system of government  wholly unlike our own.   A professor from Columbia University testified before the House  Committee on Financial Service that: ``It is hard to believe that the  stress tests' current structure could occur in a country like the  United States, which prizes the rule of law and adherence to due  process.''   Former Senator Phil Gramm testified before a Senate panel and said  the following: ``What does the stress test test? Not only does no one  know, but the regulators see that as a virtue. The Fed's vice chairman  has stated that giving banks a clear road map for compliance might make  it `easier to game the test.' But isn't the fact that compliance is  easier when you know what the law says the whole point of the rule of  law?''   The Stress Test Improvement Act inserts much-needed transparency into  the testing process. It alters current regulations to make the  internal, company-run test an annual exercise. It also streamlines the  number of scenarios on which a bank may be tested, while ensuring that  banks are still tested on whether they are able to withstand a  seriously adverse scenario.   Dodd-Frank was born out of an effort to prevent another collapse of  our financial institutions like we experienced in 2008. Unfortunately,  the broad brush stroke regulatory regime that it produced has had many  unintended consequences.   Hardest hit were our small community banks and credit unions.  However, there were also unforeseen negative impacts on larger  financial institutions as well.   The bills made in order by this rule restructure portions of Dodd- Frank that have resulted in unreasonable regulation of our financial  institutions. They preserve consumer protections while providing the  certainty needed to reduce compliance costs and expand the ability of  these organizations to provide the best and safest financial services  to Americans.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this rule and the  underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Zeldin), the sponsor of H.R. 4293.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Ross), the sponsor of H.R. 4061.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend for his support of the STOP  School Violence Act yesterday, along with 406 of our colleagues; that  passed overwhelmingly.   Madam Speaker, Dodd-Frank unleashed a torrent of regulation on our  financial institutions. While it is understandable that people reacted  strongly after the 2008 crisis, most of the Federal response heaped  needless red tape onto our banks and credit unions.   Much of this red tape has, at best, done nothing to improve the  security of financial customers and, at worst, deprived Americans of  crucial capital and financial products.   It is important that we rein in the Federal Government and allow our  financial institutions to invest their resources in our communities.   These two bills today continue the regulatory reforms that the House  has advanced since last year.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling and Chairman Sessions for  bringing these bills to the floor today. I urge support of the rule and  the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 780 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution       the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII,       declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole       House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill       (H.R. 4240) to protect Second Amendment rights, ensure that       all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a       firearm are listed in the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System, and provide a responsible and       consistent background check process. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.

Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4240, H.R. 3464, H.R. 2598, or H.R.       1478.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the  [[Page H1624]]       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
