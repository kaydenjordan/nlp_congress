 Mr. President, on September 5 of last year, President  Trump's Attorney General made an announcement. It was an announcement  that affected the lives of about 800,000 people living in America. The  announcement was that the President was going to abolish the DACA  Program.   DACA was a program created by President Obama by Executive order.  Under that Executive order, if you were brought to the United States as  an infant, a toddler, a child, if you grew up in this country, were  educated in this country, and had no criminal record of any  consequence, President Obama said that you have a chance to apply to  stay in this country on a temporary, renewable basis--2 years at a  time--and that you won't be deported and you can take a job.   Eight hundred thousand young people came forward under President  Obama's Executive order, under this DACA order. What have they done  with their lives? Many of them went to school and had to work at the  same time because, being undocumented, they didn't qualify for any  Federal student assistance. A lot of them took jobs all across the  country--about 20,000 of them as teachers in schools, and 900 of them  volunteered for the U.S. military, taking the same oath as everyone  else, saying that they are willing to risk their lives for America.   The success stories of these DACA recipients are boundless. I have  told a number on the floor in the course of discussing this issue over  the years.  [[Page S1411]]  Today, I will tell another one. I am so proud of what they have done.  They are amazing young people. Can you imagine growing up in America  with all the challenges of youth and all the demands from your parents  and peers and superiors but also knowing something that you can't say  publicly: that at any moment, you could be deported from this country  because you don't have the necessary legal status? That is the story of  these DACA young people, the Dreamers.   President Trump, if you will remember, talked about immigration a lot  in his last campaign. Some of the things he said were very harsh. He  talked about building this big, beautiful wall, from sea to shining  sea, across the Mexican border, and, of course, told us the Mexicans  would pay for it. Then he referred to those in Mexico who came to the  United States as Mexican rapists and criminals. It was pretty harsh  language. But interestingly, toward the end of the campaign and after  he was elected, he started saying conciliatory, good things about these  DACA Dreamers. He told me personally, when I first met him on the day  he was inaugurated: We will take care of those kids, Senator.   Well, on September 5 of last year, he announced that the program  protecting those young people would expire as of Monday of this week, 2  days ago. As of that date, he said, if Congress hasn't replaced the  DACA Program with something new, something legal, something statutory,  there would be no protection for these DACA recipients as their  protected status expired. For 800,000 in limbo, uncertainty is their  future.   Well, the President challenged Congress, and a number of us took him  up on the challenge. Six of us--three Democrats and three Republicans-- Senators sat down for months. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  was part of that group, a Republican; Jeff Flake of Arizona was part of  that group, a Republican; and Cory Gardner of Colorado, a Republican.  On our side, Michael Bennet of Colorado, a Democrat; Bob Menendez of  New Jersey, a Democrat. We worked out a bipartisan agreement among us  that not one of us would have written. It was a compromise in trying to  meet the President's challenge of replacing DACA with something that  could be the law of the land and work.   I reflect on that effort and believe it was a good one. It was  certainly in good faith, and it was bipartisan. When we presented it to  President Trump on January 11 at 12 noon--I remember the time  very specifically--he rejected it. He not only rejected that bipartisan  solution to the crisis he had created, he rejected five other  bipartisan proposals to try to resolve the crisis he had created in  eliminating the DACA Program.    So here we are, just 2 days after his March 5 deadline, and where do  we stand? Well, the situation has been complicated by three Federal  courts that have been asked to review President Trump's decision  abolishing DACA. Two of those courts have issued injunctions and said  to the Trump administration: Stop what you are doing. You have to prove  to us that you have the legal authority to end this program the way you  ended it.   There is an injunction stopping the Trump administration from doing  what the President said he would do. The President's administration  didn't think much of those courts and decided to file an extraordinary  appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is across the street, to knock  down this injunction and to go forward with closing down DACA. Last  week, the Supreme Court rejected the Solicitor General's petition.   So here we stand. The President has abolished the DACA Program. The  protection for 800,000 young people from being deported, the protection  that allowed them to work, is officially--President Trump's point of  view--abolished. It has not been replaced, the deadline has been  reached, and it is being argued in court.   So how much protection does that buy for the 800,000? We don't know.  We know it is a court-based protection, an injunction that could last  for weeks or months or even longer, but that uncertainty is what is  hanging over this whole debate.   So this morning I called the Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, and I asked her: Explain to me what your  Department is doing because of these court injunctions and President  Trump's decision to abolish this program.   She gave me a partial explanation. In fairness to her, she promised  to get back to me and even promised to come up here to Capitol Hill  next week and try to explain in more detail how the Department of  Homeland Security is handling this.   For example, if you were protected by DACA--a young person--and if  the President's abolition of DACA did not allow you to renew your DACA  application when it expired, what is your status? Can you be deported?   Secretary Nielsen told me point blank: No, we will not deport those  who have pending DACA applications.   I then asked the next question: Do you have the authority to allow  these same people to continue legally working, as they did under DACA?   She didn't know the answer, and in fairness to her, she said she  would look into it and get back to me. I look forward to that  happening.   It is a sad situation that this Congress can't pass a law to deal  with this kind of emergency. Ask the American people what they think  about Dreamers, what they think about young people who were brought to  the United States as children, infants, and babies, and who are asking  for a chance to be legal in America, to become citizens. Ask Americans  what they think. Overwhelmingly, they say: Of course. Why would you  punish these children who grew up in this country? They didn't break a  law or commit a crime. They didn't make a decision; it was a decision  made by others. They should have a chance.   Overwhelmingly, the American people say that, 85 percent or more,  including more than 60 percent of people who say they voted for  President Trump. Can you find an issue with that kind of public  support? For those who follow the news, there is another one called  universal background checks for guns, which has an even higher level of  support. But going back to the DACA issue, 85 percent of the American  people believe Congress should pass a law to give these young people a  chance--not punish them, not deport them. Give them a chance. Give them  a chance to earn their way to legal status. Despite that, this Senate  has failed to pass a measure to do that.   Two weeks ago, we made it to the floor. We had four different  versions of the bill. I won't go into detail other than to tell you  that the most popular version of the bill got 54 votes. You would think  that in a Chamber of 100 Senators, that would be enough, but not under  our rules--you need 60 votes.   The President had a plan, incidentally. President Trump brought his  immigration plan to the floor of the Senate the same week we debated  this. Now, understand, there are 51 Republican Senators and 49  Democrats in this Chamber. On the day of the vote, one Senator, Senator  McCain, was missing, so 50 to 49. How many votes did President Trump  get for his immigration policy presented on the floor of the  Republican-controlled Senate? Thirty-nine. Sixty Senators voted against  it, including a substantial number of Republicans. So the President's  approach to this has been rejected by even his own party.   What has the House of Representatives, the other Chamber, done about  this? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.   Sadly, that is a commentary on many major issues facing our country.  The Congress has not even taken up a serious debate, let alone found a  solution, and here we sit. It is easy for us to sit here in the Senate  Chamber, confident of our own citizenship status, but for 800,000, the  uncertainty makes a wreck of their lives. I have met many of them. I  have talked to them. They are outstanding people. They have succeeded  when others failed. They have been determined and resilient when others  gave up. They are running out of time.   President Trump created this crisis for DACA on September 5. He has  been unable to agree to any of six different bipartisan measures to  solve it--not one--and today the fate and future of these young people  rest in the hands of the courts.   It is easy to speak of these young people in gross numbers--800,000,  1.8 million--but over the years, I have decided it is better to get to  know them  [[Page S1412]]  personally. As they have had the courage to come forward and identify  themselves, I have come to the floor to tell their stories. This is the  110th time I am bringing a story to the floor.   This man is Alejandro Fuentes. Alejandro was brought to the United  States at the age of 4 from Chile and grew up in San Diego. He was an  extraordinary high school student--honor roll, AP scholar with  distinction, and a member of the National Honor Society. He was  involved in a lot of activities--high school cross-country and  lacrosse, a member of the choir--and volunteered as a worship leader at  his church.   He was accepted at Whitman College in the State of Washington, and  when he was there, he was a member of the campus Christian fellowship  group. He volunteered with the local Humane Society and was the  philanthropy chair of his fraternity. He was a student government  representative and a mentor to other students.   After graduation, he was accepted into Teach For America. We know  that program, don't we? That is where some of our best and brightest  college graduates say: I will give you 2 years of my life and work in a  school that needs me as a teacher. Send me to a tough area to work.  Thousands have done it. Alejandro--not a citizen of the United States-- said: I will do it. I will do it for my country.   Today, he is a sixth grade math teacher at a middle school in Denver,  CO. He volunteers as a mentor after school for students who need help  with math.   What is going to happen to this man? What is going to happen to him  if Congress fails to replace DACA? What is going to happen if he is  deported? And it could happen. There are 20,000 just like him, teachers  across America who are DACA-protected and have no protection now, no  protection in the law. Their only protection is a court order, which  could be changed in a moment.   If he leaves, of course, the students will pay a price, and certainly  America will pay a price. Will we be better off as a nation? Of course  not. This young man grew up in America. He was brought here at the age  of 4, went to his classrooms in San Diego and pledged allegiance to the  flag every day. This is his country. It is the only country he has ever  known. Why would we want to throw him out of this country after he has  gone through all of these things in life and achieved an amazing record  of success? To me, it would be a horrible waste.   There is a larger issue at stake here than just DACA. The issue is  immigration in America. Are we a nation of immigrants? I think so. But  2 weeks ago, at the immigration Federal agency, they decided to strike  those words from their mission statement, that America was a nation of  immigrants. They can strike all the words they want, but they can't  strike the facts. The facts tell us that with the exception of Native  Americans, who preceded us, we are all immigrants--some voluntary, some  forced, but we are all immigrants in this country. We come from every  corner of the Earth. We are as diverse as any nation could be. That is  our history, that is our strength, and that is our legacy. That  diversity makes us an extraordinary nation in the world.   Those people who came here from far-reaching shores came here for a  lot of reasons. My grandmother was one of them. She brought my mom. My  mom was an immigrant to this country. I don't know all the reasons that  my grandmother came here, but I know there was one reason she came. She  had three little kids, and she carried a bag and had with her a  Catholic prayer book from the country of Lithuania. It was written in  Lithuanian. The Russians were in control of Lithuania at the time, and  they had prohibited prayer books written in Lithuanian. My grandmother,  whom I never knew, was one tough lady. She was willing to pick up this  prayer book--this contraband in Lithuania--and bring it to the United  States of America. I don't know if she ever took a constitutional law  course, but she knew there was freedom in this country. Nobody was  going to stop her from praying from her prayer book when she got to the  United States. I am sure economics had more to do with her coming, but  that was part of the reason my family made it to this country. It is  something I have never forgotten, and I have told the story many times.   All these people who have come to this country--every single one of  us brings a story, a family story. Now we are being told it is a  mistake--it is a mistake to continue legal immigration to America.   The President's proposal on immigration would cut legal immigration  to this country almost in half. Currently, our Nation of 320, 330  million people brings in approximately 1.1 million legal immigrants a  year--1 million legal immigrants; 320 million Americans. It is not an  overwhelming number in comparison. On average more than sixty percent  of the 1.1 million people are members of families of those already  here.   Do you just ask to come in, and we let you come to America if you  have a family member here? Of course not. You wait and you wait. For  example, in the Philippines, you may wait 20 years for a member of the  family to be reunited with someone who is already an American citizen-- 20 years waiting in line. The President's proposal--the one that has  come to the floor of the Senate that got 39 votes--said we ought to cut  the number of legal immigrants almost in half, tell those people to  wait longer or stay where they are.   In most cultures, in the American culture, the family unit is our  strength--flag, family, God. How many times have we heard those  speeches from politicians? Yet these families who are trying to be  reunited and to be strong are being told: You are not wanted. That is a  mistake. The last time we did that was in 1924 on the floor of the U.S.  Senate. We decided--the Senate then--there were certain people we  didn't need in America. Asians were excluded. People from Africa and  Eastern Europe and other regions were severely restricted. That could  have included my mother's family. They restricted Italians. We had  enough Italians--that is what Congress said. They restricted Jewish  people.   That shameful chapter in American immigration history prevailed for  over 40 years, until we passed a new immigration law. Now this  administration wants to take us back to that debate. This  administration wants to change the face of immigration in America. The  President has been explicit about that in terms of what he would like  to see America look like in the future--not as diverse, excluding  people from certain places. I think that is a mistake.   If there is one thing that has made us strong, it is the fact that  this diversity, when it comes together under that flag, can conquer  everyone and everything on Earth. Why would we walk away from that  legacy? Why would we walk away from Alejandro? Why would we walk away  from 800,000 protected by DACA? Why? Is that the legacy we want to  leave, that we have excluded these talented, high-achieving, energetic,  fearless young people? Alejandro's story is certainly not unique. There  are 20,000 teachers like him who are DACA recipients and DACA- protected.   Teach For America, the program that pays these young college  graduates a limited amount of money to go to challenging schools--190  of them were protected by DACA. They are officially not citizens of the  United States, but they are willing to teach kids in the toughest  schools in America. They teach in 11 different States.   There is a question now about what happens next, and I don't know.  Right now, the President created this crisis, and only the President  can solve this crisis. There are Republican Members of the House and  Senate who will not vote for anything unless it has the Trump stamp of  approval on it, and I don't know what that can be. Six different times  we have gone to him, and six times he has rejected bipartisan  approaches. We need the President to help us work toward a solution. It  is up to the Republican leaders in Congress--they control the House and  the Senate--to take yes for an answer and accept one of these  bipartisan approaches, to save these young people, and to resolve this  crisis that faces us.   Congress needs to do its job. We should make the Dream Act the law of  the land, or we will be responsible for hundreds of thousands of  talented  [[Page S1413]]  young immigrants leaving our workforce and put them at risk of  immediate deportation. It would be a chapter in American immigration  history even sadder than 1924.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2518         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page S1457]]            SECTION 1.

The Congress finds the following:        (1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent       years and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies include       several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in       history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job       preservation and retirement security are placed at greater       risk.        (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and       retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not       kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy       by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while       protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases       have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those       in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent       and are escaping adequate scrutiny.        (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently       needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more       complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses       and industries.

TITLE II--REDUCING EMPLOYEES' AND RETIREES' LOSSES       SEC. 201. REJECTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.         Section 1113 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by       striking subsections (a) through (f) and inserting the       following:        ``(a) The debtor in possession, or the trustee if one has       been appointed under this chapter, other than a trustee in a       case covered by subchapter IV of this chapter and by title I       of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), may reject       a collective bargaining agreement only in accordance with       this section.

Recovery of executive compensation         ``(a) If a debtor has obtained relief under section 1113(d)       or section 1114(g), by which the debtor reduces the cost of       its obligations under a collective bargaining agreement or a       plan, fund, or program for retiree benefits (as defined in       section 1114(a)), the court, in granting relief, shall       determine the percentage diminution in the value of the       obligations when compared to the obligations of the debtor       under the collective bargaining agreement, or with respect to       retiree benefits, as of the date of the commencement of the       case under this title before granting such relief. In making       its determination, the court shall include reductions in       benefits, if any, as a result of the termination pursuant to       section 4041 or 4042 of the Employee Retirement Income       Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1341, 1342), of a defined       benefit plan administered by the debtor, or for which the       debtor is a contributing employer, effective at any time on       or after 180 days before the date of the commencement of a       case under this title. The court shall not take into account       pension benefits paid or payable under that Act as a result       of any such termination.        ``(b) If a defined benefit pension plan administered by the       debtor, or for which the debtor is a contributing employer,       has been terminated pursuant to section 4041 or 4042 of the       Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C.       1341, 1342), effective at any time on or after 180 days       before the date of the commencement of a case under this       title, but a debtor has not obtained relief under section       1113(d), or section 1114(g), the court, upon motion of a       party in interest, shall determine the percentage diminution       in the value of benefit obligations when compared to the       total benefit liabilities before such termination. The court       shall not take into account pension benefits paid or payable       under title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act       of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.) as a result of any such       termination.        ``(c) Upon the determination of the percentage diminution       in value under subsection (a) or (b), the estate shall have a       claim for the return of the same percentage of the       compensation paid, directly or indirectly (including any       transfer to a self-settled trust or similar device, or to a       nonqualified deferred compensation plan under section       409A(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) to any       officer of the debtor serving as member of the board of       directors of the debtor within the year before the date of       the commencement of the case, and any individual serving as       chairman or lead director of the board of directors at the       time of the granting of relief under section 1113 or 1114 or,       if no such relief has been granted, the termination of the       defined benefit plan.        ``(d) The trustee or a committee appointed pursuant to       section 1102 may commence an action to recover such claims,       except that if neither the trustee nor such committee       commences an action to recover such claim by the first date       set for the hearing on the confirmation of plan under section       1129, any party in interest may apply to the court for       authority to recover such claim for the benefit of the       estate. The costs of recovery shall be borne by the estate.        ``(e) The court shall not award postpetition compensation       under section 503(c) or otherwise to any person subject to       subsection (c) of this section if there is a reasonable       likelihood that such compensation is intended to reimburse or       replace compensation recovered by the estate under this       section.''.

The Congress finds the following:        (1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent       years and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies include       several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in       history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job       preservation and retirement security are placed at greater       risk.        (2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and       retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not       kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy       by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while       protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases       have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those       in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent       and are escaping adequate scrutiny.        (3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently       needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more       complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses       and industries.

TITLE II--REDUCING EMPLOYEES' AND RETIREES' LOSSES       SEC. 201. REJECTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.

In this section, a reference to the trustee       includes the debtor in possession.        ``(b) No provision of this title shall be construed to       permit the trustee to unilaterally terminate or alter any       provision of a collective bargaining agreement before       complying with this section. The trustee shall timely pay all       monetary obligations arising under the terms of the       collective bargaining agreement. Any such payment required to       be made before a plan confirmed under section 1129 is       effective has the status of an allowed administrative expense       under section 503.        ``(c)(1) If the trustee seeks modification of a collective       bargaining agreement, the trustee shall provide notice to the       labor organization representing the employees covered by the       collective bargaining agreement that modifications are being       proposed under this section, and shall promptly provide an       initial proposal for modifications to the collective       bargaining agreement. Thereafter, the trustee shall confer in       good faith with the labor organization, at reasonable times       and for a reasonable period in light of the complexity of the       case, in attempting to reach mutually acceptable       modifications of the collective bargaining agreement.        ``(2) The initial proposal and subsequent proposals by the       trustee for modification of a collective bargaining agreement       shall be based upon a business plan for the reorganization of       the debtor, and shall reflect the most complete and reliable       information available. The trustee shall provide to the  [[Page S1458]]       labor organization all information that is relevant for       negotiations. The court may enter a protective order to       prevent the disclosure of information if disclosure could       compromise the position of the debtor with respect to the       competitors in the industry of the debtor, subject to the       needs of the labor organization to evaluate the proposals of       the trustee and any application for rejection of the       collective bargaining agreement or for interim relief       pursuant to this section.        ``(3) In consideration of Federal policy encouraging the       practice and process of collective bargaining and in       recognition of the bargained-for expectations of the       employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement,       modifications proposed by the trustee--        ``(A) shall be proposed only as part of a program of       workforce and nonworkforce cost savings devised for the       reorganization of the debtor, including savings in management       personnel costs;        ``(B) shall be limited to modifications designed to achieve       a specified aggregate financial contribution for the       employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement       (taking into consideration any labor cost savings negotiated       within the 12-month period before the filing of the       petition), and shall be not more than the minimum savings       essential to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy, such that       confirmation of a plan of reorganization is not likely to be       followed by the liquidation, or the need for further       financial reorganization, of the debtor (or any successor to       the debtor) in the short term; and        ``(C) shall not be disproportionate or overly burden the       employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement,       either in the amount of the cost savings sought from such       employees or the nature of the modifications.        ``(d)(1) If, after a period of negotiations, the trustee       and the labor organization have not reached an agreement over       mutually satisfactory modifications, and further negotiations       are not likely to produce mutually satisfactory       modifications, the trustee may file a motion seeking       rejection of the collective bargaining agreement after notice       and a hearing. Absent agreement of the parties, no such       hearing shall be held before the expiration of the 21-day       period beginning on the date on which notice of the hearing       is provided to the labor organization representing the       employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement.       Only the debtor and the labor organization may appear and be       heard at such hearing. An application for rejection shall       seek rejection effective upon the entry of an order granting       the relief.        ``(2) In consideration of Federal policy encouraging the       practice and process of collective bargaining and in       recognition of the bargained-for expectations of the       employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement, the       court may grant a motion seeking rejection of a collective       bargaining agreement only if, based on clear and convincing       evidence--        ``(A) the court finds that the trustee has complied with       the requirements of subsection (c);        ``(B) the court has considered alternative proposals by the       labor organization and has concluded that such proposals do       not meet the requirements of subsection (c)(3)(B);        ``(C) the court finds that further negotiations regarding       the proposal of the trustee or an alternative proposal by the       labor organization are not likely to produce an agreement;        ``(D) the court finds that implementation of the proposal       of the trustee shall not--        ``(i) cause a material diminution in the purchasing power       of the employees covered by the collective bargaining       agreement;        ``(ii) adversely affect the ability of the debtor to retain       an experienced and qualified workforce; or        ``(iii) impair the labor relations of the debtor such that       the ability to achieve a feasible reorganization would be       compromised; and        ``(E) the court concludes that rejection of the collective       bargaining agreement and immediate implementation of the       proposal of the trustee is essential to permit the debtor to       exit bankruptcy, such that confirmation of a plan of       reorganization is not likely to be followed by liquidation,       or the need for further financial reorganization, of the       debtor (or any successor to the debtor) in the short term.        ``(3) If the trustee has implemented a program of incentive       pay, bonuses, or other financial returns for insiders, senior       executive officers, or the 20 next most highly compensated       employees or consultants providing services to the debtor       during the bankruptcy, or such a program was implemented       within 180 days before the date of the filing of the       petition, the court shall presume that the trustee has failed       to satisfy the requirements of subsection (c)(3)(C).        ``(4) In no case shall the court enter an order rejecting a       collective bargaining agreement that would result in       modifications to a level lower than the level proposed by the       trustee in the proposal found by the court to have complied       with the requirements of this section.        ``(5) At any time after the date on which an order       rejecting a collective bargaining agreement is entered, or in       the case of a collective bargaining agreement entered into       between the trustee and the labor organization providing       mutually satisfactory modifications, at any time after that       collective bargaining agreement has been entered into, the       labor organization may apply to the court for an order       seeking an increase in the level of wages or benefits, or       relief from working conditions, based upon changed       circumstances. The court shall grant the request only if the       increase or other relief is not inconsistent with the       standard set forth in paragraph (2)(E).        ``(e) During a period during which a collective bargaining       agreement at issue under this section continues in effect,       and if essential to the continuation of the business of the       debtor or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate,       the court, after notice and a hearing, may authorize the       trustee to implement interim changes in the terms,       conditions, wages, benefits, or work rules provided by the       collective bargaining agreement. Any hearing under this       subsection shall be scheduled in accordance with the needs of       the trustee.
