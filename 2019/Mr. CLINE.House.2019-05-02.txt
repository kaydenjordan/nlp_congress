 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize our guest  chaplain, the Reverend Jonathan Falwell of Thomas Road Baptist Church  in Lynchburg, Virginia.   Reverend Falwell has long been a leader in his community, the  Commonwealth of Virginia, and the United States. His sermons are  delivered to thousands each week at Thomas Road, on television, and  through the internet. Jonathan Falwell followed in the footsteps of his  father, Dr. Jerry Falwell, as senior pastor of Thomas Road Baptist  Church.   Jerry Falwell was founder of Liberty University, one of the largest  Christian universities in the United States. In addition to his role as  senior pastor at Thomas Road, Reverend Jonathan Falwell also serves as  executive vice president of spiritual affairs at Liberty.   On this National Day of Prayer, I extend my thanks to Jonathan  Falwell for his devotion to Christ, his family, and his community.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, I urge that the Speaker would immediately  schedule this important bill that will save lives.
