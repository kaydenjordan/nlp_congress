 Mr. Speaker, this Hispanic Heritage Month I lift up the  legacy of Santos Rodriguez, a child murdered by police in my home of  Dallas, Texas, 50 years ago this year.   At only 12 years old, Santos was shot and killed by police in front  of his brother in Dallas' Little Mexico district. He was unarmed.   Earlier this summer, I hosted a commemoration of Santos in Dallas,  celebrating the tireless advocacy of his family in securing justice and  change after his senseless murder.   In the years since his death, the Rodriguez family and the Latino  community of North Texas have built a movement of resilience and  strength in his honor.   Santos did not come into this world to become a martyr. He simply  wanted to live and grow like any other child.   Today, I ask that we honor the life and the family of Santos  Rodriguez not just with words but with actions.   No child should have to lose their life for the world to recognize  that their life had meaning. We can and should do better for all, but  especially for our kiddos.                            ____________________
