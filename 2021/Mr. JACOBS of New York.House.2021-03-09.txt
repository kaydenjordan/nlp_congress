 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  legislation, the Dairy H-2A Eligibility Act.   As I have traveled around my district and met with dairy farmers,  their number one need has consistently been a reliable workforce.   Currently, dairy farms do not have access to the H-2A visa program  because their work is not considered seasonal. My very simple one-page  piece of legislation would simply make dairy workers eligible for these  temporary work visas.   Farming is the largest economic driver in my district, and dairy  farming is a critical part of the American economy and food supply.   We need to ensure that farmers have the resources and workforce they  need  [[Page H1131]]  while enforcing our immigration laws and preventing illegal  immigration.   This change would put dairy farmers on equal footing with other H-2A  employers and adhere to the same rules and regulations in force today.   As larger reforms to the agriculture workforce are debated, I ask for  the consideration of this urgent fix to ensure American dairy farmers  can continue to provide for the American families and thrive for  generations to come.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  call up H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from  behind the screens and back in the classroom.
