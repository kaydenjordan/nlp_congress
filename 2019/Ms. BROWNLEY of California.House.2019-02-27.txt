 Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, President Trump  falsely declared that there was a national emergency occurring at our  southern border.   The real emergency that he should be focusing on is the devastating  gun violence epidemic that has torn communities apart across our  country, including my own, where we are still mourning the loss of 12  precious lives at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks,  California.   This week, the House will vote on the first major gun safety  legislation in decades. While there is no single answer that will stop  all gun violence, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 are commonsense, bipartisan  steps to strengthen our background check system to keep deadly firearms  out of the hands of those we agree should not have them.   If the President is serious about addressing national emergencies, he  should join us in supporting these bills.                            ____________________
