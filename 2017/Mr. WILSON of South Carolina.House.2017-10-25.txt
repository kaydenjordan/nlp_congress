 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, sadly, radical Islamic  terrorists continue their assault on innocent victims across the world.   This month, there were ISIS-inspired knife attacks in France and  Canada, as well as the surprise attack in Niger, with mass murders of  worshippers at mosques in Kabul.   Gratefully, there are victories over the terrorists, such as the  recent liberation of Raqqa, Syria, and now in the Philippines.   Congratulations to the people of the Philippines, successfully led by  President Rodrigo Duterte and their courageous military, on the recent  liberation of Marawi from ISIS militants.   Marawi is the capital city of over 200,000 citizens in the province  of Lanao del Sur on the island of Mindanao, which has been under ISIS  control since the end of May. Innocent families were persecuted in this  murderous occupation.   While liberating Marawi from ISIS control is a milestone in  combatting global terrorism, this fight is far from finished. We must  be successful to defeat the terrorists overseas to protect American  families at home.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Zeldin  for his leadership. We sincerely appreciate his leadership for American  families, particularly based on his service in Iraq.   Mr. Speaker, on October 23, 1983, an otherwise peaceful Sunday  morning in Beirut, Lebanon, there was, tragically, a disruption of a  suicide truck bomb that crashed into the Marine Corps barracks, killing  241 courageous U.S. Marines. This was the deadliest attack, 21,000  pounds of TNT, since the U.S. Marines were in the Battle of Iwo Jima.  Investigators determined that Hezbollah, an Iran-backed terrorist  organization that has targeted America and our allies for decades, was  responsible for the attack.   The 34th anniversary of the Beirut attack serves as a solemn reminder  that we have a responsibility to defeat Hezbollah and radical Islamic  terrorists across the globe, many of whom are financed by Iran, all the  way from Niger to the Philippines. It is important that we defeat the  terrorists overseas to protect American families at home.   President Donald Trump's decision to decertify the Iranian deal was  correct. President Trump is protecting American families. The deal was  reckless and dangerous from the start; it never served the interests of  American families; and it threatened the safety and security of America  and our allies in the region, from Israel to southeastern Europe,  Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania.   I am grateful to join Members of the House, especially my colleagues  on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in promoting the fight against  global terrorism. This includes tougher sanctions like those being  considered by the House that target Hezbollah and its financiers in  Tehran, and it includes working together with President Trump's  administration that is committed to peace through strength.   I am grateful to thank Congressman Lee Zeldin from New York, an  appreciated Iraq veteran, for his leadership and for being firm with  the Iranian regime, which subjugates its extraordinary people.   As the father of four sons who have served our country overseas, I  want to say once again: God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
