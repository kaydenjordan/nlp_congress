 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I support the REINS Act and the rule that brings it to  us, but I want to underscore the point made earlier by Mr. Barr.   The REINS Act says that any regulation--that is, an act with the  force of law--adopted by the executive branch and costs more than $100  million must then be approved by Congress to take effect.   As necessary as this bill is in the current environment, I am afraid  it has got it completely backwards. Under the Constitution read on this  floor today, it is not the role of the executive branch to make law and  for the legislative branch then to approve or veto it. Quite the  contrary, making law is the singular prerogative of the legislative  branch; the executive then approves or vetoes that law.   The REINS Act is necessary solely because for years Congress has  improperly ceded its lawmaking powers to the executive, and it is time  we restored the proper role of the legislative branch to make law and  for the executive branch to faithfully execute it.
