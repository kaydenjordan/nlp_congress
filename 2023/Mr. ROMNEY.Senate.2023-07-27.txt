 I thank the Senator from Oregon. I agree with him that  this amendment is critical.   Congress needs to push the Federal Government on this policy. Our  government must acknowledge the reality that China is no longer a  developing country. I commit to working with the chairman of the  Finance Committee, in good faith, in conference.
