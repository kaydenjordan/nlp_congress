 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge the passage of the  Hershel ``Woody'' Williams National Medal of Honor Monument Location  Act.   The Medal of Honor is our Nation's highest military decoration that  is awarded to U.S. servicemembers who have distinguished themselves  with extraordinary acts of valor and sacrifice that far exceed the call  of duty.   Texas, my home State, is home to over 70 valiant Medal of Honor  recipients, and we also have over 1 million veterans and Active Duty  military that call the Lone Star State their home. That is why I teamed  up with the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore), my good friend, again to  lead the passage of this Act.   Last year, we had the opportunity to work on a designation for a  National Medal of Honor Museum being built in Arlington, Texas, that  was in my district at the time. This amazing bill will authorize a  monument right here in Washington, D.C., for Medal of Honor recipients,  their families, their friends, loved ones and people who want to learn  more about the history of the Medal of Honor to be able to come to D.C.  and see why it is important that we create this lasting impact to the  recipients of this highest award.   Today's bill, the Hershel ``Woody'' Williams National Medal of Honor  Monument Location Act, is a continuation of the efforts that we worked  on last year and will position this monument where it rightfully  belongs, near the Lincoln Memorial, honoring President Lincoln, who was  awarded one of the first Medals of Honor in 1863.   I end today by thanking Congressman Moore for continuing to work with  me on this important issue. I urge my colleagues to support this new  bill that commemorates the bravery, service, and sacrifice of more than  3,500 Medal of Honor recipients that have lived across our communities  here in the USA.
