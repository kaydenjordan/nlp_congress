 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a few of the ways  that I am keeping my commitment to the people of the Big First.   A few weeks ago, I released my commitment to the Big First, which is  a legislative roadmap for the 118th Congress that details my plans for  an economy that is strong, a government that is accountable, a future  that is built on freedom, and a nation that is safe.   Here are some of the ways I am working to get America back on track.   To create an economy that is strong, I voted ``yes'' on the Family  and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, which the House just  passed. Kansas families and small businesses are already paying the  price of President Biden's inflation tax. The last thing we need is  87,000 more IRS agents and 1.2 million more audits.   I voted ``yes'' on the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection  Act because it is a clear-cut way to fight back against one of the most  egregious pieces of legislation from the last Congress.   The $72 billion of taxpayer money that Washington Democrats allocated  to the IRS last year would have ballooned the agency to a size larger  than the Pentagon, State Department, FBI, and Border Patrol combined. I  am committed to creating an economy that is strong by stopping  President Biden's audit army, and I am keeping my commitment.   To create a government that is accountable, I voted ``yes'' on the  Strategic Production Response Act, which the House also passed.  President Biden has been playing fast and loose with one of our  country's most important national security assets. His administration's  energy policies have caused prices to skyrocket at the pump, and using  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a political tool to mask that  failure has led to severe U.S. energy insecurity and depletion of our  oil reserves, which poses a threat to our national security.   I voted ``yes'' on the Strategic Production Response Act, which is a  step toward ending President Biden's war on fossil fuels, empowering  domestic energy producers, and resurrecting American energy  independence by protecting our SPR from an administration that clearly  doesn't understand how important it is. I made a commitment to hold the  government accountable, and I am keeping that commitment.   To create a future that is built on freedom, I voted ``yes'' on the  Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, which the House passed. This vote  was crystal clear: If a child is born alive following an abortion or an  attempted abortion, that newborn child deserves the same standard of  medical care that any newborn deserves.   It is horrifying that we need to address issues like this in a free  country, but Washington Democrats have advocated for unthinkable,  gruesome policies that constitute an all-out attack on human life. I am  proud to be a pro-life Member of Congress, and I will always support  policies that protect life. I made a commitment to building a future  based on freedom by supporting the God-given right to life held by  unborn American citizens, and I am keeping my commitment.   To create a nation that is safe, I will vote to denounce the horrors  of socialism later this week. I hope that all of my colleagues can get  behind this. Socialism ideology runs counter to everything we stand for  in America because it requires the concentration of power, which  results in totalitarianism. Democracy, on the other hand, enshrines  individual liberty and gives people a voice in who governs them.  Socialism creates famine, devastation, and bloodshed. It tears families  apart, creates exile and mass theft, and flatly denies individual  rights as fundamental as personal property.   You don't have to look very far, Mr. Speaker, into the history of  socialism to find these abuses and atrocities. They happen every time a  country tries socialism on for size.   It seems that certain people in America would like to experiment with  socialism, but enough socialist experiments have been conducted  already, and the verdict is clear: Socialism has no place on American  soil.   I made a commitment to ensuring that America is a nation that is  safe, which means continuing to stand strong as a world leader in  democracy and freedom. I am keeping that commitment.   When we reflect on our work, it helps us to stay the course in the  future, and we still have a lot of work to do in the 118th Congress. We  need to create a balanced budget and strengthen the supply chain. We  need to lower taxes and secure the southern border. We need to fully  fund a robust police and military. We need a comprehensive  reauthorization of the farm bill with strengthened crop insurance. We  need a maintained stepped-up basis tax provision and global food  security legislation that stops wars before they start.   I will be keeping all of these commitments to the people of the Big  First, and I will continue to spend time thinking, praying, and  reflecting on how best to serve the people in my district. I did not  come to Congress to be a caretaker in the slow demise of America. I am  here to fight and work to make America stronger. With all of us working  together, our brightest days are yet to come.                            ____________________
