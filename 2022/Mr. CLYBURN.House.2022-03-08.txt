 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear  friend and mentor who was a man of great faith. Elder Alonzo Middleton  passed away on March 1, 2022, at the age of 91.   Elder Middleton used his longevity in great service to the African  Methodist Episcopal Church. He was a proud lifetime member of my home  congregation, Morris Brown AME Church, in Charleston, South Carolina,  and was a graduate of Allen University, where he later served on the  board of trustees.   Elder Middleton was a pastor and presiding elder in the Seventh  Episcopal District, which encompasses the entire State of South  Carolina. He served as a delegate to multiple quadrennials of the AME  Church's general conference and on its general board.   He retired from active service as presiding elder of the Mount  Pleasant District, one of the largest in the AME Church.   One of his lasting accomplishments was engineering the merger of  three small Charleston congregations to create a single church renamed  the Greater Middleton Chapel AME Church.   Elder Middleton was a mentor for many generations of AME clergy and  laymen. He will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
