 Mr. Speaker, the Special Supplemental  Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children--or WIC--is a short- term intervention program designed to help ensure pregnant women and  their children are able to meet healthy nutritional needs.   WIC began in 1972 as a supplemental food pilot program aimed at  improving the health of pregnant mothers, infants, and children in  response to a growing concern of malnutrition among low-income  families. By 1974, WIC was operating in 45 States and became a  permanent program in 1975.   WIC provides participants with monthly benefits redeemable for  specific foods to supplement their diets, as well as related nutrition  and health services. WIC provides quality nutrition education and  services; breastfeeding promotion and education; a monthly food  package; and access to maternal, prenatal, and pediatric healthcare  services. WIC has served 8.3 million participants each month through  10,000 clinics nationwide in 2014; 806,000 pregnant women; 592,000  breastfeeding women; 575,000 postpartum women; 2 million infants; and  4.3 million children.   Mr. Speaker, numerous studies have shown that pregnant women who  participate in WIC have longer pregnancies, leading to fewer premature  births. They have fewer low and very low birth weight babies. They  experience fewer fetal and infant deaths, and they seek prenatal care  earlier in pregnancy and consume more of key nutrients, such as iron,  protein, calcium, vitamins A and C.   WIC has been addressing the nutrition and health needs of low-income  families for more than 40 years. I rise today as chairman of the  Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition but also as someone who knows  firsthand how important WIC is for many Americans.   In the early 1980s, when my wife, Penny, and I were just starting  out, we were eligible for WIC based on our income. We used WIC to  supplement our personal resources at the time to ensure that Penny, who  was expecting our first son, was healthy. Back then, WIC truly helped  us supplement what we needed after our personal resources and the  family assistance and support came into play.   Nutrition influences health at every stage of life. Good nutrition  during pregnancy is especially important to support fetal development  and protect mothers from pregnancy-related risks of gestational  diabetes, excessive weight gain, hypertension, and iron deficiency  anemia. Good nutrition in early childhood can promote development and  foster healthy behaviors that may carry over into adulthood.   Mr. Speaker, the facts are clear: WIC works. Let's ensure this  program remains viable for generations to come. WIC truly provides a  competitive edge that will give everyone a fair shot at life--a fair  start in life, and the American people deserve no less.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I will meet  with leaders from the School Nutrition Association of Pennsylvania,  commonly called SNAPa, which is a statewide organization of school  nutrition professionals.   SNAPa works to advance quality child nutrition programs through  education and advocacy. Organized in 1955, SNAPa is an all-volunteer  board of directors elected by its member, which currently stands at  more than 2,300 individuals.   As chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition and a senior  member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I know the  essential services that SNAPa works to provide. Students throughout the  Commonwealth receive high-quality, low-cost meals thanks to SNAPa.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember that, for some students, the  only meal that they receive is at school. This organization works to  keep our children healthy and ensure that they have healthy food  options through school meal programs. SNAPa is recognized as the  authority on school nutrition in Pennsylvania.   I sincerely thank SNAPa for advancing the availability, quality, and  acceptance of school nutrition programs as an essential part of  education in Pennsylvania for more than 60 years.                            ____________________
