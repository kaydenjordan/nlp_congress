 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the House Cut Flower Caucus,  I rise today in recognition of July as American Grown Flower Month.   Every year, U.S. consumers spend billions of dollars on cut flowers,  but I think most would be surprised to hear that just 20 percent of  these flowers are grown in the United States. The vast majority are  imported from Colombia and other countries in South America and Africa.   The U.S.-grown flower industry has shrunk considerably in the last 30  years, but recently it has had a resurgence. As consumers have bought  more food from local farmers, they have begun to ask where their  flowers come from as well.   The growth in consumer interest has been an opportunity for many  farmers I represent to diversify and boost their income. For example,  Broadturn Farm in my district has had so much success selling flowers  that it now has four acres under cultivation and even offers a flower  Consumer Supported Agriculture, or CSA, share.   So, this month, I ask my fellow consumers to ask themselves an  important question before their next flower purchase: What better way  to celebrate a wedding, offer condolences, or show your appreciation  than with flowers that are not only beautiful but also meaningful in  their connection to the places where they grow and the people who grow  them.                            ____________________
