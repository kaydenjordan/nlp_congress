 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment which  would provide the USDA the tools it needs to quantifiably measure  conservation outcomes.   These provisions are substantively the same as a bipartisan bill I  introduced earlier this year with Representative Marcia Fudge.   If included in the farm bill, my amendment would have the USDA  measure, evaluate, and report on various conservation programs across  the Nation. This information is necessary to help define, evaluate, and  justify taxpayer return on conservation investment programs.   Right now, the USDA can provide information on the impact of our  conservation programs in terms of contracts and acres, but they lack  the ability to provide the actual impact of these programs on important  resource concerns. By ensuring that the USDA has all of the tools  necessary to collect this information, we can better protect and  preserve these programs into the future.   The USDA's voluntary conservation programs are consistently helping  farmers in initiatives that protect natural resources while also  increasing farm productivity. This amendment would ensure that the USDA  can continue to improve existing conservation programs and practices  while also supporting our Nation's farmers.   Mr. Chairman, we will also seek, in response to concerns that have  been raised by the Farm Bureau, to, in conference, further refine the  privacy provisions relating to the research activities that would take  place under this bill to ensure that any personally identifiable  information that would be contained within the analysis of conservation  programs is further protected by the United States Department of  Agriculture.    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I am encouraged by the support for my  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the impetus behind the gentleman  from California's amendment, but I think this amendment, if it were  adopted, would threaten to destroy the carefully constructed efforts  that we have endeavored to engage in in the committee to create  something that was realistic and achievable.   Lowering the age from 6 to 3 will make it much more difficult for  many SNAP families to comply with the work requirements, and reducing  the ability of a State to have a waiver of up to 15 percent of the  population will also make it extremely difficult, by reducing that  number down to 5 percent.   So I think what the committee did was have a finely balanced effort  to try  [[Page H4188]]  to move more able-bodied people into work and into training. While the  gentleman's motivations are certainly fine in this regard and he is  attempting to get at the right thing, we think that the amendment, if  it were adopted, would actually destroy the carefully constructed  effort that we have made to try to encourage work and responsibility.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made in order  by the rule.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my amendment, which  would provide States additional flexibility to administer the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.   If included in the farm bill, this amendment would provide States the  option, not a mandate, to determine the appropriate mix of government  staff and service provider staff for all administrative SNAP functions.   It would build on existing SNAP administrator flexibility within  employment and training programs as well as technology initiatives like  electronic benefits transfer.   This barrier, currently in the SNAP law dating from the 1970s,  prevents the implementation of commonsense administrative solutions  that include integrated call centers, leveraging investment to  modernize programs, and incorporate best practices and the ability to  address periodic peaks in enrollment activity that accompany times of  economic distress.                                time  1700    Mr. Chairman, I know that at least a dozen Governors sent a letter to  the leadership of the House and Senate today saying that States across  the country have been calling for administrative flexibility to  implement various government programs, and it is time that we provide  each State the choice to decide what is best for them in their overall  effectiveness in running these programs.   Mr. Chairman, I would also like to thank my partners in this  amendment, Representatives Hartzler, Poliquin, Marshall, and Goodlatte,  who are supportive of this policy change.   I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense  amendment and provide the States with added flexibility, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in response to the distinguished gentleman  from Massachusetts' comments, I would simply suggest that what this  amendment is trying to do is: number one, give the States the option to  utilize modern management techniques in terms of the operation of the  SNAP program. It is an option. It is not a mandate.   Number two, I would point out that various programs such as TANF, and  such as the Children's Health Insurance Program also have the ability  to do precisely what I am suggesting in this amendment. This is not  unusual. This is not sending jobs overseas. That is an absurd notion, I  believe.   The fact of the matter is, we are trying to make it possible for  States to seamlessly run these programs, whether it is TANF, whether it  is housing assistance, whether it is the Children's Health Insurance  Program, or whether it is Medicaid. Those programs, States already have  the option and already have the ability to use social service nonprofit  organizations like Catholic Charities to assist them in eligibility  determinations, to assist States in assisting recipients in getting  into employment and training programs.   So what this amendment is seeking to do is to eliminate the exclusion  of that ability that is now only in the SNAP program. Mr. Chairman, it  is only in the SNAP program that we exclude the opportunity for States  to have these kind of abilities, to have these services performed by  nonprofit organizations and by other providers that can efficiently and  seamlessly coordinate the benefits and eligibility that exists for  TANF, that exists for children's health insurance, that exists for a  whole panoply of social services programs.   Mr. Chairman, I regret the gentleman from Massachusetts' opposition  to the amendment. I hope he would reconsider, given the fact that CHIP  and all of these other programs--which the gentleman supports already-- permit doing precisely what I am suggesting here, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, to close on the amendment, let me reiterate.  This amendment simply seeks to treat States' flexibility for SNAP the  same  [[Page H4194]]  as it does, as current law does, for TANF, for a host of other social  services programs, and for CHIP.   I would also point out, in response to the gentleman from  Massachusetts' concern, the States that do this for CHIP and use  nonprofit organizations to assist them in eligibility and other  determinations, explicitly prohibit the outsourcing of these jobs to  foreign countries, and many even prohibit the outsourcing of any job  out of State. So the gentleman raises a red herring that is not  appropriate in this context, and should not be considered.   This simply gives the States the flexibility to seamlessly manage the  SNAP program and coordinate the benefits as they might have for home  heating assistance, or they might have for CHIP, or they might have for  TANF.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
