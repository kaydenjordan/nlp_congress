 Mr. Speaker, this past week, we as a nation honored the  heroes of D-day.   Today, I rise to pay tribute, for the Congressional Record, to the  Honorable Patrick J. Solano as he nears his 94th birthday.   Pat Solano is a legend in Pennsylvania. In World War II, Pat flew 23  bombing missions over Berlin and was decorated for his service.   Since returning home from the war, Pat has been most instrumental in  building Pennsylvania and in creating opportunities for so many. And  Pat mastered--perhaps, originated--and continues to practice and preach  the politics of inclusion.   Pat was an official adviser to nine Pennsylvania Governors and  continues to serve as a senior adviser to his cherished Pennsylvania  State Senate.   Pat's smart, beautiful, kind wife of 65 years, Marie, is equally  outstanding and beloved; and they have six daughters and 11  grandchildren. Not a better friend or mentor could we ask for in our  State or our community.   Mr. Speaker, I simply ask that we wish Pat Solano a very happy  birthday and many more, and that we thank him for his great service to  our country.                            ____________________
