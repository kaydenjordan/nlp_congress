 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Grijalva for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I am excited to have the opportunity to speak on this  bill, and I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support this  important lands package.   Now, there is one section, the same as   Dan Newhouse's, that is  particularly near and dear to my heart and critical for my district and  for the State of Washington. It is the Yakima River Basin Integrated  Plan that you just heard about.   This forward-thinking legislation will ensure water security for our  farmers, rivers, salmon, and communities for the foreseeable future. It  allows Tribes to make important infrastructure improvements, protects  local salmon habitat, and, therefore, is also instrumental in saving  our dwindling Puget Sound orcas.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud my Republican colleague, Mr. Newhouse, and  also our Senators, Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray, and so many people  who worked hard on this plan to make it come true, for the effort they  have put in over so many years to see this legislation through.   The Yakima River Basin Integrated Plan is a model for the rest of the  country on how to address water scarcity in a changing climate.  Partners with very divergent interests all came together with a common  goal of protecting Washington's environment and wildlife and ensuring  our communities are resilient in the face of a changing climate.    This agreement will help Washington State for years to come.
