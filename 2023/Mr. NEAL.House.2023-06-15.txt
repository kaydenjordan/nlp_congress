 Madam Speaker, I wish to call attention to the passing of  the former speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, David  Bartley.   Speaker Bartley was one of the most talented and gifted legislators I  have known. His legislative prowess brought about Chapter 766, so that  the mentally and physically challenged might be guaranteed a sound  public education. His measured approach to public life meant that he  led through developing consensus and forging historic legislation.   Speaker Bartley went on to serve as president of Holyoke Community  College, where he brought the college to new heights of widely  acknowledged academic achievement. He was also a very successful  secretary of administration and finance who oversaw the State's  finances.   Born to a very modest background, Dave Bartley brought acclaim to the  city of Holyoke that he loved, and it returned its highest regards to  him.   Well-read and well-rounded, Speaker Bartley was a Renaissance man and  a really good guy. To his wife, Bette, and children, Myles, Susan, and  David, our best during this difficult time.   The United States of America thanks Speaker Bartley.                            ____________________
