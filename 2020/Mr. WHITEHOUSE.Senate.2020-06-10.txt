 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 20 minutes as in morning business.    Mr. President, this week we consider a measure for  permanent funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and for our  national parks.   I would support this measure joyously if there were a similar program  for America's coasts and bays and oceans. As it is, I support this  measure but with a heavy and frustrated heart as, once again, the  urgent needs of coastal communities go unaddressed. Put bluntly, the  Land and Water Conservation Fund massively favors inland and upland  States and projects, as indicated by the prevalence of advocates for it  here on the floor from landlocked States. It fails to meet the needs of  coastal communities.   Over the past decade, for every dollar the fund sent to inland  States, per capita, coastal States just got 40 cents. The imbalance  against coasts gets worse if you factor in that there is greater  coastal than inland economic activity, and the imbalance against coasts  worsens further when you factor in that much of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund's spending in coastal States is for upland, inland  projects. Coasts and saltwater are not treated fairly. The upland  freshwater imbalance is not justified, and we ought to make it right.   Look at Rhode Island. People from around the Nation and around the  globe visit our wonderful beaches and beautiful Narragansett Bay, and  they drive a huge amount of our economic activity. In 2018, Rhode  Island's Commerce Corporation reckons 25 million people visited our  State, supporting $100 million in State and local tax revenue and over  86,000 jobs. In total, travelers to Rhode Island generated $6.8 billion  in our economy. Our coast attracts that economic activity. It is a big  deal for us.   Rhode Island isn't alone. Over half of Americans live in a coastal  county. Nearly 60 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product  derives from coastal counties. According to the American Shore and  Beach Preservation Association, ``more than twice as many people  visited America's coasts as visit State and national parks combined;  consequently 85 percent of all tourism related revenue in the U.S. is  generated in coastal States where beaches are the leading attraction.  Beach tourism supports 2.5 million jobs, $285 billion in direct revenue  and . . . $45 billion in taxes annually.''   For all that, the Land and Water Conservation Fund gives 40 cents to  coastal States for every dollar that it sends to inland States. That 40  cents is per capita, not adjusted for the great coastal economic  activity and greater  [[Page S2847]]  coastal tax revenue, and it doesn't adjust for upland uses in coastal  States. Coasts are overlooked.   I wish it were just the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Look at the  inland-to-coastal disparity in the Army Corps' Flood and Coastal Storm  Damage Reduction Fund. Over the past 10 years, the Corps has spent out  of that fund, in various years, between 19 and 120 times more on inland  work than it has spent on coastal work. Let me repeat that: $19 to 1  coastal dollar was our coast's best year and 120 inland dollars to 1  coastal dollar was our worst.   Coastal communities are exposed to storms, to sea level rise, to  shifting fisheries, to all manner of other conservation and  infrastructure challenges, but across the decade, they received less  than 3 pennies out of each dollar spent from an Army Corps program that  has ``coastal'' in its name.   This persistent and unfair imbalance against coasts ignores the  massive and unique risks that coastal communities, coastal features,  coastal infrastructure, and coastal economies now face. Look at the  dire warnings of coastal property value crash. Freddie Mac, which is  not an environmental group, has estimated that somewhere between $238  and $507 billion worth of coastal real estate will be gone, below sea  level, by 2100. Freddie Mac warns about that: ``The economic losses and  social disruption [of that] . . . are likely to be greater in coastal  than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession.''   Are we listening?   Along the east coast, the First Street Foundation estimates property  values already took a $15 billion hit due to sea level rise. The  Providence Journal, using First Street and Columbia University data,  reported that Rhode Island lost over $44 million in relative coastal  property value from 2005 to 2017. First Street data show that Maine,  New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island lost a combined $403  million during that stretch. Hundreds of millions of dollars are gone  already, and the worst is yet to come.   Look elsewhere along the coast. Do you want to know why Senator  Cassidy is so motivated? His entire Louisiana coast is in a declared  state of emergency. A recent headline from the Times Picayune said: ``  `We're screwed': The only question is how quickly Louisiana wetlands  will vanish, study says.''   That Tulane University study says sea level rise will flood 5,800  square miles of Louisiana coastal wetlands. The report concludes:  ``This is a major threat not only to one of the ecologically richest  environments of the United States but also for the 1.2 million  inhabitants and associated economic assets that are surrounded by  Mississippi Delta marshland.''   That is obvious, but are we listening to Senator Cassidy?   In Florida, coastal communities already see flooded streets on sunny  days. Researchers project over 2\1/2\ feet of sea level rise in the  next 40 years affecting 120,000 Florida coastal properties in or near  rising seas. Some studies say Miami Beach's iconic South Beach has 2  decades left. Communities in southern Florida are considering  abandoning public infrastructure to the sea because of the sticker  shock of protecting it.   Fish, manatees, dolphins, sea turtles, and other sea creatures have  washed up dead on Florida beaches due to toxic algae as the oceans  there warm. The iconic Everglades are imperiled   Who is listening?   In North Carolina, the Outer Banks face erosion and sea level rise  such that the National Parks Service warns that swathes of the area  will be inundated. As the Outer Banks wash into the sea, there go  millions of annual visitors, thousands of local jobs, and a local  economy worth over $250 million.   Over 5,500 homes in coastal Texas are projected to flood in the next  decade. These homes are worth $1.2 billion.   Coastal South Carolina, just since 2017, has been hit by four  different billion-dollar hurricanes.   The list of what our coasts are facing goes on and on, and the  projected losses are enormous. Here is Moody's Investor Service's  warning for coastal communities issuing bonds:         The growing effects of climate change, including climbing       global temperatures, and rising sea levels, are forecast to       have an increasing economic impact on U.S. State and local       issuers. This will be a growing negative credit factor for       issuers without sufficient adaptation and mitigation       strategies.    I would like to ask my colleagues, if you are a small community on  the coast, where are you going to go to get sufficient adaptation and  mitigation strategies for Moody's? Where are we in helping those  communities?   Here is the Union of Concerned Scientists: ``By the end of the 21st  century, nearly 2.5 million residential and commercial properties,  collectively valued today at $1.07 trillion today, will be at risk of  chronic flooding.''   Chronic flooding makes those properties uninsurable and  unmortgageable, which is one of the reasons for Freddie Mac's warning  about a coastal property value crash. The Land and Water Conservation  Fund is not listening.   Our coastal public lands and resources, like coastal private  property, face enormous peril, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund  virtually ignores that peril. That is why I am offering a commonsense,  bipartisan amendment--not a spoiler amendment, not a partisan  amendment, not a ``gotcha'' amendment, not a poison pill. It is a  commonsense, bipartisan amendment. My amendment takes nothing away from  the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It leaves the Land and Water  Conservation Fund and its upland bias intact. It separately provides  coastal revenues dedicated from offshore wind and renewable energy  development to support coastal States, coastal resiliency, coastal  infrastructure, and coastal adaptation.   Unless we do this, millions of dollars in offshore wind energy  revenues will bypass coasts and go straight to the Federal Treasury,  unlike offshore oil and gas energy revenues, which go in significant  part both to Gulf Coast States and, ironically, to the predominantly  upland and inland projects of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   Don't get me wrong. I don't begrudge our landlocked colleagues their  funding. I do begrudge them refusing me the opportunity to add  something for coasts. There should be a coastal and saltwater program  to balance the upland and freshwater bias of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   Our landlocked colleagues are wrong to stop this amendment. It does  them no harm. The situation along our coasts is dangerous and  worsening. Let me repeat that. The situation along our coasts is  dangerous and worsening. I am going to vote for this bill, but I will  do so, as I said, with a heavy and frustrated heart.   I will continue pushing as hard as I can for the day when we get  parity for coastal communities because what we are doing here by  refusing this amendment is both shortsighted and unfair.   This is not my first rodeo on this subject. I have to tell you that I  am sick to death of people telling me: You are right; we need to do  something for coasts. And then, as soon as the Land and Water  Conservation Fund passes, they are gone--``zippo,'' vanished.   My environmental friends say: You are right, Sheldon. Just help us on  this, and we will help you with coasts.   And then you don't.   My colleagues say: You are right, Sheldon. Just help us on this, and  we will help you with coasts.   And then you don't.   And now, by making the Land and Water Conservation Fund permanent, we  are permanently baking in its inland and its upland bias, and there is  nothing added for coasts, and everyone is saying: Yes, you are right,  Sheldon, but just help us on this, and we will help you with coasts.   Well, my friends, bitter experience tells me otherwise. But you will  have my vote, and you will have my help to protect your inland and  fresh water resources, as we should, and we from coasts and saltwater  States will, again, have to await our day. Today is not our day in  coastal States. Today is not our day, but maybe one day--and one day  soon, I pray--all this talk will finally turn into action for our  coasts. A sense of decency and a sense of urgency would both seem to  demand that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
