 Mr. Speaker, several years ago, I had a conversation with  one of my constituents that I think about often.   She told me about when she sent her 5-year-old son off to his first  week of kindergarten in the Loudoun County Public Schools. He came home  from school one day, and he told her: Mommy, we had an emergency drill  today. My place to hide is behind the backpacks.   Like a backpack is going to stop a round from an AR-15.   And she decided right then and there that we need to do better for  our kids and that she needed to do something. Her way of doing  something was to start the Loudoun chapter of Moms Demand Action.   Now she and millions more like her have sent us here to do something  about gun violence.   We may not be able to stop every school shooting, every act of gun  violence, but shouldn't we at least try to stop some? Because if we  won't do that we shouldn't be here.   Today, for the first time in decades, the United States Congress will  vote on meaningful gun violence prevention legislation. We will vote on  and pass H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, and I  will proudly vote ``yes'' because these checks will save lives.                            ____________________
