 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1177 is a bill that will allow the city of Old  Town, Maine, to move forward with economic development plans that have  been hampered by Federal red tape. H.R. 1177 removes the current deed  restriction on the land surrounding the Old Town airport. This will  allow the city to implement economic development initiatives that will  create jobs and spur economic activity in the area.   As a pilot, I am glad to see that the airport will not be impacted by  this change and will continue to meet the region's air transportation  needs. Again, H.R. 1177 is common sense, reasonable legislation. I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) for supporting this legislation.   I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who  actually was the one who brought this bill to the attention of the  House Agriculture Committee and to the floor here today. It is his hard  work, and there are not many in this institution who work harder than  Representative Poliquin in addressing the needs of rural America.

H.R. 2154 recognizes former U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary  and former North Dakota Governor Ed Schafer by renaming the Red River  Valley Agricultural Research Center in his honor.   The research center serves the region, including my district in  Minnesota, by coordinating five research units in two Fargo  laboratories. The center does a wide range of work with a focus on  animal metabolism-agricultural chemicals, cereal crops, insect genetics  and biochemistry, sugar beet and potato, and sunflower and plant  biology research.   I worked closely with Ed Schafer when he was at USDA and also during  the time he was North Dakota's Governor. We worked on many things  together. Some of them were pleasant and some of them not so pleasant,  such as floods and so forth.   I think it is a fitting recognition for an outstanding career in  government, and I am happy to be here to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
