 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Placer County,  California, Sheriff's Office Lieutenant Andrew Scott and his 30 years  of dignified service.   Since joining the sheriff's office in 1990, Lieutenant Scott has  worked in nearly every capacity. I personally saw his outstanding  leadership and dedication as a Placer County Deputy Sheriff's  Association president.   Over the decade I have known him, I have witnessed his love and  passion for the public safety of his community. He is a shining example  of what a warrior, a man of God, embodies: a true friend, defender of  the weak, devoted to truth, dedicated to his loved ones, and strong in  his faith and love of the Lord.   Andrew has gone above and beyond to provide support for his fellow  law enforcement officers through the 10-35 organization. His dedication  to never forget officers who have fallen in the line of duty should be  an example to all of us to remember those who have paid the ultimate  sacrifice on behalf of all of our freedoms.   Andrew's service as Placer County Sheriff's Office Lieutenant has  made our area a safe place to live, a better one, a better one to raise  our kids.   I consider Andrew a true friend, and I wish him the best during his  retirement.                            ____________________
