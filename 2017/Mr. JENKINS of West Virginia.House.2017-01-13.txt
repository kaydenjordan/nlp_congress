 Mr. Speaker, the ACA, ObamaCare, or  whatever you want to characterize it as, is broken, and we are here to  fix it. We want to empower patients. We want to bring health care back  to the American people.   Let me talk about access to insurance coverage. People have less  access today to insurance coverage than at actually any time in the  past. Instead of competition to bring down and drive down insurance  costs, one-third of the counties in the United States have only one  choice of an insurance carrier, which is no choice at all. No  competition. Insurance carriers are pulling out of the exchanges en  masse, citing unsustainable costs because of ObamaCare.   The American people are demanding change. Enough is enough. They want  relief. They want competition. They want lower costs. They want better  quality.   We are here to fix ObamaCare and honor the promise to the American  people to empower the patients of America to give them the choice, the  quality, and the cost control they so desperately need and that  ObamaCare robbed them of.                            ____________________
