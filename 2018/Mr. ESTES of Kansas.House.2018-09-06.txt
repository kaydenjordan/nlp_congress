 Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer thanks to the  Wichita Police Department, FBI, and ICE for making a series of arrests  last month to help end human trafficking in my community in Wichita,  Kansas.   On August 23, several raids began after an investigation into  possible child sex trafficking led to a tip from a 15-year-old female  victim. Information this brave young girl provided led to the arrest of  eight people for charges of aggravated human trafficking, as well as  illegal firearms, drug possession, and rape. This would not have been  possible without the partnership between the local Wichita police, the  FBI, and the Homeland Security Investigations unit of ICE.   People may not be aware, but human trafficking is one of the most  heinous crimes investigated by ICE. Rather than disavow ICE and all law  enforcement, these brave men and women deserve our support for their  service.   So, Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, and  Representative from Wichita, I ask my colleagues to join me today in  thanking all law enforcement for keeping communities like mine safe.                            ____________________
