 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Inflation  Reduction Act.   For too long, Congress has refused to act while seniors like my mom,  who is a breast cancer survivor, endured price gouging on their  medicines while on Medicare.   Today, Democrats in Congress are changing that. We are going to stand  up to Big Pharma and let Medicare negotiate lower prices and cap out- of-pocket costs at $2,000, as well as capping the cost of insulin.   For too long, Congress has refused to address the climate crisis and  invest in clean energy. Today, Democrats in Congress are changing that.  Through the largest-ever investment to fight climate change, this bill  will cut emissions by 40 percent by 2030. It unleashes American and,  yes, Texas-made clean energy while creating 9 million jobs.   Thanks to President Biden, and Democrats in Congress, this historic  legislation will impact our Nation for generations to come, all while  reducing the deficit without raising taxes on folks making less than  $400,000 a year.   It is a big deal, and I cannot wait to vote ``yes'' for it. I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.
