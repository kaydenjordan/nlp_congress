 Madam President, I rise in support of Janet Yellen's  nomination to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. I've  known Janet since she became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  San Francisco in 2004. I believe she is an excellent nominee for this  position.   Janet has an impressive record. She served twice on the Federal  Reserve Board of Governors and was the first woman to chair the Fed  from 2014 to 2018. She became a professor of economics at the  University of California--Berkeley in 1980, she is now professor  emeritus. Dr. Yellen served as Chair of the Council of Economic  Advisors under President Clinton and has been very active as a  distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution.   As some have joked, Janet's husband of 42 years, George, won the  Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, yet he is only the second-most  accomplished economist in his own home.   All of these accomplishments did not come easily for a woman in the  male-dominated field of economics.   Out of the 24 students who received doctorates in economics from Yale  in 1971, Janet was the only woman. She has been a trailblazer her  entire career.   Now, Janet brings the experience and leadership needed at the  Treasury Department at this critical juncture.   I believe that Janet understands that the economy is not an abstract  series of charts and figures, but a collection of real individuals,  families, communities and businesses who need help now.   At the same time, she is pragmatic and recognizes the need for fiscal  discipline. I believe she made that clear in her confirmation before  the Finance Committee, where I had the honor of introducing her.   In short, she is the ideal candidate to head the Treasury Department  at a time when we can afford nothing less. I urge the Senate to confirm  her nomination. Thank you.    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of Tony  Blinken's nomination to be Secretary of State.   I support Tony for Secretary of State for three key reasons. First,  he has the diplomatic skills that our country needs at this pivotal  moment to regain our leadership on the world stage. From 2015 to 2017,  he served as Deputy Secretary of State, the Nation's second highest  ranking diplomat. In that position, he helped lead U.S. efforts to  combat terrorism, address rising concerns in Asia, and respond to  Russian regional aggression. He is a crisis-tested leader who will hit  the ground running at the State Department with critical knowledge and  relationships with leaders worldwide.   Second, Tony has a longstanding and trusted personal relationship  with President Biden that will enable him to advise the President on  key foreign policy issues. During President Obama's first term in  office, he was National Security Advisor to then-Vice President Biden.  Previously, Tony served as the Democratic staff director for the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee for 6 years when then-Senator Biden was  committee chairman. It is because of his relationship with President  Biden and his career as a public servant that Tony understands that the  job of Secretary of State is not just to serve the American people, but  to help improve the lives of people struggling all over the world.   Last but certainly not least, Tony has the experience of serving at  the State Department that will help him rebuild the Department,  recruiting needed Foreign Service Officers and civilians, ensuring  State personnel have the training they need to be effective in their  mission, restoring morale throughout the Department, and empowering our  diplomats to speak on behalf of him and President Biden.   Tony will help our country repair the damage of the last 4 years and  restore the United States as a leader and trusted ally. I look forward  to working with him to advance our mutual objectives of promoting peace  and security, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of his  confirmation.   Thank you.                            ____________________
