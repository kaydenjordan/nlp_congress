 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, for bringing up the subject and offering me the  opportunity to stand in support of his legislation, the RECORDS Act, to  let you know, what you have probably heard, that literally hundreds of  thousands--500,000 to 600,000 veterans are awaiting their care based on  the inability of the VA to get to their records.   They can't prove that they are due the care, that they have earned  the care, without the records. The VA has this backlog, which takes  them a year, maybe two, where they can't access their records to get  the care that they have earned. So I commend the gentleman for his  efforts with the RECORDS Act.   I have a similar bill, the WINGMAN Act, which allows congressional  staffers, given the appropriate approvals, to go in and help the  veteran do the same thing, get through the backlog.   Mr. Keller has a response. He has a solution. I am working on a  solution. Who is not working on a solution? The VA. It is not the  people down in the trenches, down doing the hard work. As usual, it is  the administration, the upper staff, that has failed in this endeavor.   If we can do anything in the United States of America--of all the  billions we spend, here and across the globe, anywhere, and all the  different programs that we have--the least we can do is take care of  those who have safeguarded our freedoms and have earned the care that  they deserve to get. The only thing that stands between them and that  care is accessing their records. They cannot right now because of this  backlog.   The good gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller) has legislation  that will fix that, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I urge  everybody that is a veteran or a family member supportive of a veteran  to write, to contact their Congressman, their Member of Congress, and  urge them to support this legislation.   Let's see if we can fix the circumstances at the VA for these  veterans.
