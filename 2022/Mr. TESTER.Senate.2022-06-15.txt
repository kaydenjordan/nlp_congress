 Mr. President, I want to start my remarks by expressing  my appreciation for Ranking Member Moran's leadership. It has been  stellar. If you combine him with Senator Boozman and Senator Heinrich,  it has been a great team. I just want to thank Senator Moran for his  leadership and his continued desire to do the right thing for the  servicemembers who have served this country in the military.   The Senate has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity today to make history  in passing the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise  to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act.   Let me be clear. This bill isn't about Democrats versus Republicans.  It is not about political posturing. It is about Americans standing up  for those who have served and sacrificed on behalf of this country and  the freedoms that we have today. In fact, it is even more than that. It  is about righting a wrong that has been ignored for too damn long.   It is about Will Thompson, who served our country for 23 years in the  Army on Active Duty as a West Virginia National Guardsman.   After his second tour in Iraq in 2009, Will developed pulmonary  fibrosis from the effect of his exposures to burn pits, and he endured  two double-lung transplants. He testified in front of our committee,  less than a year ago. He lost his battle with his illnesses this last  December.   It is about SFC Heath Robinson, who answered the call of duty and was  deployed to Kosovo and Iraq with the  [[Page S2951]]  Ohio National Guard--a picture of Heath right here and his daughter.   While deployed, he was exposed to potent toxins, and 13 years after  his deployment--13 short years after his deployment--he lost his life  to a rare autoimmune disease and stage IV lung cancer, conditions  absolutely and unequivocally caused by burn pits.   Sadly, it is too late to do right by Will and Heath and so many  others for them personally, but today this body has a chance to do the  right thing by their families and future generations of our All- Volunteer military by advancing the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson  Honoring our PACT Act.   I want to talk a little bit about this plaque right here, see the  picture of Heath in uniform? But you also see what is the most  important thing to Heath, and that is his daughter. His daughter was at  a press conference that the ranking member and I were at a little over  a week ago. And I said this when I first spoke on this bill a little  over a week ago, the first words out of her mouth were: ``I love my  daddy. Daddy's not around anymore.'' But because of, hopefully, the  work that we are going to do here today, she will have a future.   This is not only about our service men and women--the people who  served in our military--it is about their families because when folks  go to war, it is just not the service person who does it; it is  everybody in their family.   And what this bill will do, is it will address decades of inaction  and failure by our government, expanding eligibility for VA healthcare  to more than 3.5 million combat veterans exposed to burn pits. It  supports our post-9/11 and Vietnam-era veterans by removing the burden  of proof for 23 presumptive conditions caused by toxins.   These conditions include cancers to lung disease, and it establishes  a framework for the establishment of future presumptions and service  connections related to toxic exposure, giving the VA the tools it needs  to bolster its workforce, establish more healthcare facilities, and  improve claims processing.   There is always a cost to war, and that cost is never fully paid when  the war ends. Our country didn't live up to its promise to veterans  like Will Thompson and Heath Robinson, but if we do what Senator Moran  and I have done, and that is put politics aside, if we put our American  men and women's bravest first, if we can begin settling our debts to  millions of other veterans and their families by getting this bill  across the finish line, we will have done something great.   And I would urge my colleagues to support this final procedural vote  and a vote that is critical to moving this bill forward.                             Amendments Withdrawn    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining pending  amendments be withdrawn, with the exception of the substitute amendment  No. 5051.    I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5051     I ask for the yeas and nays.
