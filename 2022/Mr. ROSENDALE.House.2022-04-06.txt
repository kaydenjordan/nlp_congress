 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Army  veteran, Mr. Lynn Lipps, from Roundup, Montana, for being awarded the  Army Good Conduct Medal.   The Army Good Conduct Medal is awarded for exemplary behavior,  efficiency, and fidelity in active Federal military service.   Mr. Lipps demonstrated exceptional skills and was a reliable and  conscientious worker during his service as a medic in the emergency  treatment clinic at Irwin Army Hospital at Fort Riley.   In addition to his skills, Mr. Lipps displayed a genuine concern for  the well-being of the patients that he tended to.   Mr. Lipps worked long, arduous hours to ensure that the best possible  medical care was provided to the soldiers and their families, and he  was always willing to serve above and beyond that which was required.   Mr. Lipps' accomplishments not only reflected well upon himself but  also upon his unit.   Congratulations, Lynn, on receiving this noble achievement, and thank  you for your service to our country.                            ____________________
