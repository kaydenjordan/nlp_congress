 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R.  [[Page H4730]]  10, the Financial CHOICE Act. For 7 years now, Dodd-Frank has stalled  our economic growth. While community banks and credit unions did not  cause the recession, they have carried most of the burden following the  crisis.   These smaller financial institutions are the lifeline of local  businesses, farmers, entrepreneurs, and anyone striving for true  financial independence. The Financial CHOICE Act will bring relief from  onerous rules and regulations that have hamstrung the ability to loan  and to borrow money.   Once businesses can access more capital, they will be able to grow,  hire more employees, contribute more to their communities.    I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and this committee for working  tirelessly to bring the American people the relief that they need.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
