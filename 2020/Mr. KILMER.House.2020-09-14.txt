 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of John Henry  Turpin, a distinguished U.S. Navy sailor and a lifelong resident of  Bremerton, Washington.   John's 30-year career in the Navy included service during the  Spanish-American War, the Boxer Rebellion, and World War I. He is  believed to be the first Black American to qualify as a master diver  and was one of the first Black Americans to achieve the rank of Chief  Petty Officer in the U.S. Navy. John's outstanding legacy of service to  our country is made even more significant by the era of prejudice and  discrimination during which he served.   I am proud that today the House of Representatives unanimously passed  the bipartisan bill that I introduced to designate the U.S. Postal  Service facility on Pacific Avenue in Bremerton as the John Henry  Turpin Post Office Building in recognition of his achievements and his  service.   It is fitting that today Democrats and Republicans stood together in  honoring his lifelong and selfless commitment to the defense of America  and American values, and in ensuring that his accomplishments are  permanently remembered in the city of Bremerton.                            ____________________
