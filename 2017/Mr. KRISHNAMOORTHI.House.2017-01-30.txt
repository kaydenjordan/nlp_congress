 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 66.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  President Trump's executive order against legal immigration.   I was sworn to uphold the Constitution and I was elected to grow our  economy and help unify our country.   Unfortunately, this order is an assault on the Constitution, it harms  the economy by harming working families, and it divides the country.   On Saturday night, I went to O'Hare International Airport to help  American, legal permanent residents be freed from detention. They are  people integral to the success of our community and our economy.   I ask my honorable Republican colleagues to stand with them and  oppose the executive order.
