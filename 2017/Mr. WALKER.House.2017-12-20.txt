 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the North  Carolina A&T State University football team, winner of the 2017  Celebration Bowl and the HBCU national championship. This win capped  off a historic year for the undefeated Aggies, a first in Mid-Eastern  Athletic Conference history, and marks their second championship in 3  years.   In the final minutes, the Aggies marched 56 yards in seven plays. The  drive was capped off with a fake spike and a quarterback sneak on the  goal line for the game-winning touchdown by Lamar Raynard.   MVP Marquell Cartwright, who followed the great Tarik Cohen, rushed  for 110 yards and two touchdowns. With the guidance of Coach Broadway  on the field and the leadership of Chancellor Harold Martin in the  classroom, North Carolina A&T is leading the way in showing the great  value and the importance of our Nation's HBCUs.   I am proud to represent this distinguished school of academic and  athletic excellence, leaving only one question remaining, Mr. Speaker:  Can I get an ``Aggie Pride''?                            ____________________
