 Mr. Speaker, Biden's team of neighborhood, basically,  disturbers, showed up at a constituent's house this past weekend  demanding that they reveal their vaccine status, after asking for them  by name.   Our agents on the border cannot test the tens of thousands that are  being released into the country on a monthly basis, and tens of  thousands are going in without COVID testing and without vaccines. But  Biden-Harris, the first President with a hyphenated named, is going  door-to-door in an Orwellian fashion to pester Americans about  vaccines.   Welcome to the authoritarian turn of the new Democrat party.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
