 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a hero of the Sierra and  mourn his tragic loss.   Braden Varney, age 36, gave his life Saturday night fighting the  Ferguson Fire, which continues to ravage the forests near Yosemite  Valley and threaten the communities of Mariposa County.   A second-generation bulldozer operator with CAL FIRE, he was all  alone that night, cutting firebreaks to stop this monster fire, when  his dozer overturned in treacherous terrain. He was well-known to the  people of Mariposa, being involved in many civic activities. Braden  leaves behind a grieving widow, Jessica, and two small children,  Malhea, age five, and Nolan, just 3 years old.   Our firefighters face mortal peril when they leave the safety and  comfort of their homes and families to put themselves in harm's way.  They literally place their lives between our communities and the fires  that can consume them. They know the danger better than anyone. Yet,  they do what they do anyway.   Mr. Speaker, to the Varney family, I can only express our profound  respect, admiration, gratitude, and sympathy on behalf of all of those  who Braden died to protect                            ____________________
