 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, speaking of running roughshod, no President-- Republican or Democrat--is above the law, but some have tried to be.  The previous President and his sad followers ignored subpoenas,  punished whistleblowers, and invited foreign interference in our  elections. Congress--Republicans and Democrats--must act to protect our  democracy from any future reckless Presidents, which is why the  Protecting Our Democracy Act is crucial. This bill will strengthen our  institutions against future Presidents who seek to abuse their power.   January 6 showed us that Presidential abuse can find its way to a  joint session of Congress in a deadly way--140 police officers injured;  several police officers dead; desecration; trauma. That is why the work  of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the  United States Capitol is so critical. Their subpoenas cannot be  ignored.   My Congressional Subpoena Compliance and Enforcement Act, which is  included in this bill, will standardize and streamline the process so  that no one can ignore a subpoena with impunity.   The previous President's abuses reveal the dangerous fault line.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, another week, another week of gun deaths.   No matter where you live--Oxford, Michigan; Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania; or, most recently, in my district, Pottstown--no matter  where you are--a school, a place of worship, or your parked car--gun  violence hunts down far too many innocent Americans and, quite frankly,  can find any one of us.   Our inaction on gun safety, ghost guns, and gun violence has created  a tragic version of Groundhog Day. Too often we and our children wake  up to another headline about senseless, needless gun violence; one  slaughter bleeding into the next.  [[Page H7618]]    Last week, Oxford High School became the 30th school shooting in  2021, with four dead and seven injured. Thirty times this year alone.   These are not isolated incidents. They join a long history of our  Nation's failure to have an honest discussion about guns and gun  violence.   Lawmakers have the responsibility to legislate and to protect our  children and our neighbors from gun violence.   When will we wake up to a new day?                            ____________________
