 Mr. President, I wish to begin this morning by sharing  the shock and sorrow that all of us in this body felt as we learned of  yesterday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in  Parkland, FL. To say that such brutal, pointless violence is  unconscionable is an understatement. Schools should be places where  children can learn, and faculty and staff can work without fear of  violence.   My colleagues from Florida will carry home the prayers of the whole  Senate for victims and their families, for the community of Parkland,  and for the first responders who bravely charged into harm's way on  behalf of others.   For the information of all Senators, the Senate will observe a moment  of silence at 12 noon.   Now, Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, the entire week  has been set aside, as I assured it would be, for votes on the DACA  issue, border security, and other issues pertaining to the subject of  immigration. At this point, we should be wrapping up a lively week of  debate, amendments, and numerous votes, but that is not what has  happened. Instead, we are here on Thursday morning and have yet to vote  on a single amendment--not one amendment all week on what was offered:  an open debate.   Remember, our Democratic friends wanted this debate. They actually  shut down the Federal Government for 300 million Americans,  unnecessarily, to guarantee that we could have this debate and at this  particular time--this week.   They have spent months insisting that DACA is a top priority for them  [[Page S1132]]  and telling their constituents they would do everything they could to  resolve it. But when the rubber meets the road, they have yet to bring  forward a single proposal that gives us a realistic chance to make law;  that is, to pass the Senate, pass the House, and earn the President's  signature. All they have done so far is to slow the process as much as  possible. It turns out that they didn't want a fair, open, freewheeling  amendment process after all.   Yesterday evening, I filed cloture on all four pending amendments. At  a minimum, under regular order, we could make sure that at least they  receive a vote by Friday morning. I hope the Democratic leader will  finally consent to hold these votes on amendments today.   Our Democratic friends say they want resolution for illegal  immigrants who were brought into the country as children. The President  put forward a framework that would do exactly that. His reasonable  proposal offers a more than generous resolution for 1.8 million  individuals in that category.   But the DACA issue is just a symptom of our broken immigration  system. So the President has made clear, and I strongly agree, that any  legislation must also treat the root causes and reform legal  immigration, and it must also include commonsense steps to ensure the  safety of the American people.   Several Senators, led by Senator Grassley, the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, have crafted legislation that accommodates the  major interests of all sides. It fulfills the stated goals of our  Democratic colleagues and--and--conforms to the President's  requirements.   Their bill provides funding to secure the border. It reforms extended  chain migration and the visa lottery program. It fixes the loophole  that forces us to release thousands of criminal aliens who were  rejected by their own home countries. It enacts Kate's Law to put  criminals who illegally and repeatedly cross our borders behind bars.  It gets tougher on violent and dangerous criminals such as drug  smugglers, human traffickers, repeat drunk drivers, gang members, and  sex offenders. And, yes, it offers a generous--extremely generous-- resolution to the DACA issue.   The President, in my view, has gone more than half way to meet the  Democrats and resolve this matter. If they are actually interested in  finding a solution, it is time they take yes for an answer so that 1.8  million people are eligible for citizenship.   Because my Democratic friends were stalling for time, they spent 3  full days making political points instead of making law. I hope today  can be different.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, on a final subject, it has only been 55 days since the  President signed historic tax reform into law. Already, it has led to  bonuses, raises, and new benefits for millions of American workers, and  the long-term signs are just as promising. Hundreds of companies have  announced significant commitments to plant deeper roots in the American  economy.   We know the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is pro-worker and pro-business, but  tax reform is also, at its core, pro-family. It doubles the standard  deduction, meaning a young married couple effectively gets a new zero- percent tax bracket for the first $24,000 they earn. If that couple  decides to purchase a home, their mortgage interest will be eligible  for a deduction. Contrary to what many predicted, the historic tax cuts  we delivered didn't jeopardize the middle-class deduction. We preserved  it.   When that couple starts a family, they will benefit from the fact  that we doubled the child tax credit, thanks to the fine work of  Senator Heller and others throughout the committee process.   At its new level, that credit will save a two-child household $4,000  every year--$4,000--to help them with back-to-school costs, to kick off  a college fund, or to help them afford summer camp tuition and a family  vacation instead of choosing one or the other.   Thanks to the tireless work of my colleague from Nebraska, Senator  Fischer, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act encourages more employers to provide  paid family leave. That is good news for millions of American families  who will welcome a child this year.   My Democratic colleagues like to speak about the importance of paid  leave, but not a single one of them voted with us--not one. Every  Democrat in the House and in the Senate voted against the bill that  included Senator Fischer's paid family leave incentives. Every one of  them voted against a bill that included a bigger standard deduction and  the doubling of the childcare credit and lower income tax rates.  Fortunately, we passed this historic achievement despite their efforts  to stop it.   Thanks to every Republican who voted for tax reform, both Walmart and  Lowe's have announced expansions of both maternity and paternity leave.  CVS is creating an entirely new parental leave program. In Wisconsin,  where only one of two Senators voted for reform, American Family  Insurance is expanding its family leave benefits. So is Broadridge  Financial Solutions in New York, despite both Senators from New York  voting against it. This is only the beginning.   My Democratic colleagues said tax reform would bring about  ``Armageddon.'' They said nothing in our bill would help American  workers. But the proof is in the pudding. The evidence is piling up.  Middle-class families all over the country are glad their Congress and  their President made tax reform a reality.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motions filed during yesterday's  session of the Senate ripen at 2:30 p.m. today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now  be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to each remaining vote  in this series; finally, that any further vote in the series be 10  minutes in length.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I think it is safe to say it has been a  disappointing week. I kept my commitment and set aside the entire week  for a broad and productive debate over DACA, border security, and other  important immigration issues. My friend the Democratic leader, the  assistant Democratic leader, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus-- everyone agrees that I held up my end of the bargain.   Back in December, I stated that if a bill that stood a chance of  becoming law were ready in January, I would bring it to the floor. No  such proposal was produced.   Then, in January, when Democrats shut down the government over this  issue, I offered to dedicate this week--this week that we have been  in--to an immigration debate and a fair amendment process. I just did  that, but the same Democrats failed to produce a solution and, instead,  spent the better part of the week objecting to any votes in the Senate.   I thought we might be able to resolve this. I was hoping we could  reach a bipartisan solution that could pass the Senate, pass the House,  and earn President Trump's signature. But, once again, when the hour  came to actually make law instead of just making political points, our  friends across the aisle were either unable or unwilling to get  something done. After all the talk--all the talk--they hardly came to  the table at all.   I supported the plan introduced by Chairman Grassley and several  other cosponsors. It fleshed out the President's framework, pairing a  more than generous solution for 1.8 million illegal immigrants with  commonsense steps to reform legal immigration, secure the border, and  help law enforcement keep Americans safe.   In my view, the President came a very long way--clearly, more than  halfway--to meet the Democrats on this issue. In exchange for a pathway  to citizenship--not just legal status, but a pathway to citizenship-- for nearly 2 million individuals, he sensibly wanted to reform pieces  of our broken immigration system, secure our border, and make it harder  for violent criminals and repeat offenders to prey on American  citizens. That is more than a fair bargain--more than a fair bargain.   I thought our friends across the aisle would jump at this opportunity  to fulfill what they say is their top priority, but they just couldn't  take yes for an answer. They turned away from a golden opportunity to  solve the issue. They decided they would rather come away emptyhanded,  with no resolution whatsoever for the 1.8 million individuals they say  they are championing, than accept a reasonable compromise with the  President of the United States.   Even though this week has been squandered, this does not have to be  the end of our efforts to resolve these matters. I would encourage  Members to put away the talking points and get serious about finding a  solution that can actually become law.   I remain eager to improve our immigration policy. If a solution is  developed in the future that can pass both the House and the Senate and  be signed into law by the President, it should be considered. But for  that to happen, Democrats will need to take a second look at these core  elements of necessary reform.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 623, Elizabeth Branch.
