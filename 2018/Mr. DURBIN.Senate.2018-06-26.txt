 Mr. President, last Friday, I visited Heartland Alliance,  a nonprofit organization in the city of Chicago, which, for more than  two decades, has provided care for immigrant children who are  classified as unaccompanied children.   The day I visited last Friday was my second visit to one of their  nine facilities in the city of Chicago. Very few, if any, people in  that city--a great city, and I am proud to represent it--even know that  Heartland Alliance exists. The children are kept in residential  neighborhoods, in places that look like ordinary homes. The only  giveaway is the security fence around the building is a little higher  than most of the  [[Page S4387]]  fences in the neighborhood. That is the only difference. In the busy  neighborhood, there is a house with dozens of children inside.   On the day I was there, Heartland Alliance of Chicago had 66 children  under their care who had been separated from their parents by our  Federal Government over the last several weeks. They were separated  under President Trump's zero tolerance policy. Two-thirds of these 66  zero tolerance children were under the age of 13. Twenty-two of the  children--zero tolerance children, separated from their parents--were  under the age of 5.   I went into the facility's nursery, where the infants and toddlers  were being held, and I couldn't imagine for a moment what it must have  been like when someone reached over and took that infant out of the  arms of that mother and decided to transport that baby thousands of  miles away. That is what has happened.   I met two little girls. I will not use their names, but their ages  are 5 and 6. When these tiny, little girls walked into the room  together, holding hands, I thought immediately they were twins. They  had a Bamm-Bamm hairstyle--maybe somebody will remember what I am  referring to from the old television show--and they were as cute as can  be. They were holding hands as they walked into the room. I thought, at  first, they were twins, and then I realized one was a little bit older  than the other. So I started asking them questions: their names and  their ages and where they were from. They were answering for one  another.   At the end of it, we asked: Are you sisters?   They said: No, ``amigas''--friends.   They, like so many other kids in this situation, were clinging to  anything that created a connection in their desperate little lives.   I brought with me some handmade cards that kids from my staff and  friends had made to give to them. They were just pieces of construction  paper with stickers inside, the kind kids love to make and love to  receive. I went around, and I asked each of them if they would like to  take one. They took them like they were Christmas toys, and they hung  on to them--another connection in a life that, sadly, has become  disconnected from the reality of their family.   I asked the staff at Heartland Alliance about these zero tolerance  kids. I said: Could you find the parents of these kids if you needed to  for a medical emergency?   They replied: Well, we could try. In some cases, we could, but in  many cases, it is like a scavenger hunt.   You see, their parents may be moved from place to place, and if  something happened, a medical emergency, it would be difficult to find  that parent. I thought about that.   My little granddaughters and grandson are 6, 7, 8 years old. If they  were brought into a hospital with some serious medical condition, the  first thing the doctor wants to know is, what is the history? Has this  child had a problem before?   These people don't know. There are no files that are coming with the  children that have their medical history, and, in many cases, there is  no way to contact their parents in an emergency situation.   This was a gut-wrenching visit. It is still with me today. It is just  hard to imagine that the Government of the United States of America  would forcibly take children away from their parents--parents who are  seeking a chance at asylum and safety from violence and persecution.   I am angry too. I am infuriated that not only have these families not  been reunited, but there doesn't seem to be an effective plan in place  to bring these kids back to their parents.   How did we reach this point? How, in the history of this country, did  we reach the point, where, on April 6, Attorney General Jeff Sessions  announced the Trump administration had created a new zero tolerance  policy for prosecuting border cases?   There is no requirement in law to prosecute every border case  criminally--none. These cases could be handled under civil law and  families can be kept together under the law, but this administration  chose to call every person at the border a criminal, even those who are  fleeing violence and death threats and seeking a chance at asylum. As  soon as they allege that the adult at the border is a criminal, then  they can rationalize separating the children from these possible  criminals, but, in most cases, the overwhelming majority of cases, the  only possible crime was the fact that they showed up at the border.   As far as we know, more than 2,300 children have been taken away from  their parents by the U.S. Government as a result of the zero tolerance  policy. They have been transferred to facilities in places far away,  sometimes thousands of miles away, like Chicago.   If the Federal Government separates children from parents while the  family is in custody, I believe the government has the solemn  obligation to ensure that each child can be located and properly  reunited with their parents. Isn't this basic? But what we hear from  advocates and the media is that the administration's handling of the  reunification process is a mess.   We are at a real risk of lost children, lost in a bureaucratic  system, adrift in a bureaucratic sea, who are delayed for who knows how  long from seeing their parents again. That is because this was done so  quickly, without any real thought to the impact it would have on the  children, the impact it would have on the mothers and dads, and the  impact it would have on the image of the United States around the  world.   The Trump administration needs to make it an immediate priority to  ensure that children who are separated from parents are brought back  together again quickly.   Over the weekend, the Department of Homeland Security said the  Federal Government ``knows the location of all children in its custody  and is working to reunite them with their families.'' I question that,  but I accept it. If it is true, there is no excuse for delay.   No law required the administration to separate these families, and we  don't need any new laws to be passed in this Chamber to reunite them.  We just need this administration to act, and we need Congress to exert  its oversight to verify that the administration is doing what it  promised.   I have worked for most of my Senate career to pass bipartisan  legislation to fix our broken immigration system. Time and again,  bipartisan efforts, supported by a majority of Americans, have been  blocked by a minority of vocal Republicans.   I worked for 6 months with John McCain and six other colleagues to  write a comprehensive immigration reform bill, which we brought to the  floor of the Senate and passed with an overwhelming vote. It would have  cured this problem and many others, but the House of Representatives  refused to even consider it.   Yesterday I sat down with several of my colleagues--Republicans and  Democrats--to discuss whether we can find a way to pass a law or state  of policy to stop the administration from separating families in the  future. I am always happy to sit down, on a bipartisan basis, roll up  my sleeves, and try to write a law that might serve the purpose of  making this a better country, curing the problems we face, and doing it  with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, but Pennsylvania Avenue  is a two-way street, and over the past few days, President Trump has  made statements about immigration reform that do not help at all and I  believe are contrary not only to the law and the Constitution but the  values of our country.   Last Friday, President Trump said Republicans should stop ``wasting  their time on immigration until after we elect more Senators and  Congressmen/women in November.''   Also, on Friday, he said the stories of children separated from their  parents were ``phony''--``phony.'' I have seen these kids. These aren't  phony kids, and they aren't phony stories.   On Sunday, the President tweeted:         We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country.       When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no judges       or court cases, bring them back from where they came.    That was the President's tweet. Statements like that and the  President's tweet make a mockery of our Constitution and its solemn  guarantee of due process of law.   The due process clause of the Constitution doesn't just apply to  citizens; it applies to all people in the United States. The idea of  abandoning due process when people seek asylum at  [[Page S4388]]  our borders and having, as the President said, ``no judges or court  cases,'' is antithetical to the Constitution and its principles.   I will continue to work in good faith with my colleagues to see what  Congress can do, but as long as President Trump is listening to  advisers like Stephen Miller and making statements like these, it is  hard to see how any bipartisan agreement can be reached on immigration.   While Congress works on this issue, the administration has a moral  obligation to immediately reunite all families they have separated  under that zero tolerance policy. They also have to make it clear that  the President's Executive order last week will continue to be followed,  and they will not separate any more families.    The third thing that we clearly need to do is to find a way for those  who present themselves at the border to be brought to their hearings in  a timely fashion to determine whether they are eligible for asylum. It  is that basic. We don't have to detain them for long periods of time to  achieve that.   We know there are three ways to get over 90 percent of these people  to the hearings as scheduled: No. 1, provide them with the advice of  legal counsel; No. 2, provide them with case management, such as those  provided by Lutheran services, Catholic services, and others, which are  willing to counsel them and work with them and tell them what the legal  system in America requires; No. 3, in extreme cases, ankle monitors.  Over 90 percent of the people show up for hearings with those three  basic things. We don't need to build multimillion dollar detention  facilities and internment camps for these families. For goodness' sake,  we can do this in a humane and constitutional way.   Then, we need to address some root causes of this issue. On Friday,  in Chicago, the regional head of the Drug Enforcement Agency came by to  sit down with me, and we talked about the flow of opioids, the flow of  heroin, and the flow of fentanyl into my State of Illinois. I am sure  it is as true in Ohio as it is in Illinois. There is no town too small  and no suburb too wealthy not to be hit by this drug epidemic that we  are currently facing.   I was shocked to learn that in any given month, 2,000 pounds of  fentanyl come into the city of Chicago--2,000 pounds--and the Drug  Enforcement Agency is lucky to intercept 20 or 30 pounds. The rest of  it is going to be consumed and distributed from that city.   Where is a lot of it coming from? It is coming from the cartels in  Mexico. It isn't the people from Honduras at the border that pose the  threat to America's security--not nearly as much as this drug epidemic.   Keep in mind that it is a two-way street in this drug epidemic. Not  only are these Mexican cartels sending these drugs to the United  States, killing our kids and killing our neighbors and friends, but we  are sending back to them laundered drug money and guns so these cartels  can take control in Mexico, in Honduras, in El Salvador, and in  Guatemala. When these gangs take control and threaten the lives of  people, they flee to the United States looking for protection. It is an  endless circle that should be broken by breaking the supply of drugs  coming into this country.   Any other President would be sitting down with the leaders of Mexico,  El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, addressing this drug issue head- on. We have seen the tweets about kids who he calls ``phony'' coming to  our border. We need to truly have a meeting of Central American and  North American leaders to discuss this drug problem and all of the  problems it is creating not only in their countries but in ours.   We also need to move forward and pass the Dream Act. I have been  trying for a long time here--almost 17 or 18 years now--to pass the law  that will allow those who were brought to this country as children a  chance to earn their way into legal status. Almost 90 percent of  Americans support it. We need to pass it here.   Finally, I haven't given up on comprehensive immigration reform. For  goodness' sake, we see these problems every day--piecemeal problems,  one at a time, trying to address one here and one there. Isn't it time  that we take a look at the whole immigration system and concede that we  cannot accept everyone from all over the world who wants to come. We  just can't open our borders for everyone. We need security on our  borders. We also need a clear and humane system when it comes to  dealing with the current border crisis.   I hope this is a goal that even some Republicans can agree on, and it  doesn't take a new law to first reunite these kids with their parents  and to take a positive step forward.   Let's get this done before the Fourth of July. Let's reunite all  2,300 of these children with their parents so we can have the peace of  mind that we are dealing with this in an American way.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
