 Madam Speaker, included in this en bloc are my  amendments to protect indigenous communities in Brazil and to remove  negative perceptions and stereotypes about pregnant military members  that lead to ill-treatment that disadvantage their careers and well- being.   In the 1950s, my mother was forced from the Navy because she was  pregnant. Though times have changed, Active Duty mothers are  experiencing microaggressions and subtle forms of discrimination.   Madam Speaker, with this amendment, the DOD must develop and  implement policies to end pregnancy discrimination. This change is long  overdue and will allow women serving in my district and across the  country to have long, successful military careers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this en bloc,  and I thank the chairman for his leadership and support.
