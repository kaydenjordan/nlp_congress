 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse), my friend,  for yielding the customary 30 minutes.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I will be submitting a longer statement  for the Record, so I will be keeping my floor remarks today fairly  brief.   Mr. Speaker, I intend to support this farm bill. This farm bill is  not perfect. It is not the bill that I would have written. But this  conference report, unlike the farm bill that the House produced, is a  good, bipartisan product.   I want to thank Chairman Roberts and Ranking Member Stabenow for  their tireless efforts to protect SNAP benefits throughout this  process. Because of their work, hungry people across this country will  have access to the modest benefits they need to feed their families. I  thank as well Chairman Conaway, who recognized the importance of  getting a farm bill over the finish line this year.   I especially want to recognize the efforts of Ranking Member  Peterson. He is truly an amazing guy who presides over a committee that  is very diverse with rural, suburban, and urban Members of Congress. It  has conservatives, moderates, and liberals like me. Yet, he has managed  to bring us together and not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Farmers, consumers, and hungry people all across the country owe him a  debt of gratitude.   I also want to thank the staff of the minority and the majority who  put in endless hours trying to negotiate a compromise. I want to thank  Kaitlin Hodgkins, who was my point person on these ag issues, for all  of her work.   Mr. Speaker, the issue of hunger and food insecurity has been my  primary cause in Congress. I have been proud to work on these issues as  a member of the Agriculture Committee and to oversee the SNAP program  as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Nutrition.   As members of this House well know, I have been very critical of the  legislation that the Republican majority in this House initially  produced. It included more than $20 billion in SNAP cuts that would  have disproportionately harmed the most vulnerable among us--kids,  disabled, and the elderly--the very people who are often left to wonder  where they will get their next meal. Many would have been cut off from  assistance altogether if the House version actually prevailed.   The Senate, however, took a much different course. Their Agriculture  Committee chairman, Senator Roberts, actually consulted with Ranking  Member Stabenow. There were no disastrous work requirements, no  partisan policies cooked up in some extreme conservative think tank  somewhere. It largely continued proven policies that both sides have  traditionally agreed on.   Thankfully, the conference committee took the same course. This final  bill does not include any SNAP benefits cuts. No one is getting kicked  off the rolls, there are no changes to categorical eligibility or  severing of the link between SNAP and LIHEAP. And importantly, there  are no additional burdensome work requirements.   In fact, this conference report makes a number of administrative  improvement and efficiencies, saving $1 billion. These are reinvested  into nutrition programs. As a result, more Americans will have access  to healthy food and SNAP employment and training programs will be  strengthened.   Mr. Speaker, I hope the Secretary of Agriculture and the President  are tuning in to this debate. Right now, we have heard rumors that they  are trying to work behind the scenes to circumvent the will of this  Congress by  [[Page H10117]]  instituting more onerous work requirements administratively. Such a  move, I believe, will likely lead to legal action.   In the next Congress, when Democrats are in the majority, we will use  every legislative tool available to block such a move at every turn. We  will not tolerate more of their disrespect and callousness toward the  most vulnerable in this country. No more beating up on poor people,  period. We will be watching them very closely, and if they do  anything--and I mean anything--to increase hunger in America, we will  fight them. And that is a promise.   When a Congress as polarized as the 115th can negotiate and arrive at  a bipartisan agreement, we should be celebrating it. It is mind- boggling to think there are some on the other end of Pennsylvania  Avenue working to overturn it even before it is signed into law.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to be able to vote for this rule today,  since I said I was going to support the underlying legislation. But my  Republican friends screwed it up again. Tucked inside this rule is  language that turns off fast track procedures for all Yemen resolutions  through the end of this Congress. That is right. The Republican  leadership has declared that the worst humanitarian conflict in the  world, where the U.N. has just announced famine is taking place due to  the war, is not worth the time and attention of the people's House.  This is an offensive abdication of our responsibility. We should not be  sitting idly by, waiting for the start of the next Congress, as this  conflict rages on. We should be doing something today.   Mr. Speaker, it is because of this Yemen language that I strongly  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.   Mr. Speaker, this Farm Bill isn't perfect. It's not the bill that I  would have written. But very rarely do we get the chance to vote on  professionalism in this body. And this conference report is the product  of a professional process that was made better by deliberative,  bipartisan debate.   The issue of food insecurity has been my primary cause. As members of  the House know well, I have been very critical of the Farm Bill that  House Republicans initially produced. It included more than $20 billion  in SNAP cuts that would have disproportionately harmed the most  vulnerable among us. Kids. The disabled. And the elderly. The very  people who are often left to wonder where they'll get their next meal.  Many would have been cut off from assistance altogether.   These cuts were put forward to try and hoist an unproved and  drastically underfunded state-based workforce bureaucracy experiment on  the entire nation. Without any evidence or any study proving its  effectiveness, House Republicans wanted to disadvantage poor parents.   The Senate, however, took a much different course. Their Ag Committee  chairman, Senator Roberts, actually consulted with their ranking  member, Senator Stabenow. There were no disastrous work requirements.  No partisan policies cooked up in some extreme conservative think tank  somewhere. It largely continued proven policies that both sides have  traditionally agreed on.   Thankfully, the conference committee took this same course. This  final bill doesn't include devastating SNAP benefit cuts. No one is  getting kicked off the rolls. There are no changes to categorical  eligibility or severing of the link between SNAP and LIHEAP.   The conference committee rejected the House's onerous child support  enforcement proposal, and instead required a study of the current child  support option. This study will only be useful in improving policy if  USDA includes the experiences of grandparents, victims of domestic  violence, and others who may avoid participating in SNAP out of fear  that the provision.   This conference report rejects many provisions of the House bill  including the state option to privatize SNAP operation. Current law and  the administration's standards around merit systems personnel was the  appropriate course.   And importantly, there are no additional work requirements.   That's because the existing flexibility that states have to respond  to local labor conditions works. And as the conference report notes, we  expect states to continue to be able to identify the areas that they  wish to include in their areas and to be able to use the labor surplus  definition of unemployment for the area having to be twenty percent  above the national average for a two-year period. This has worked well  for over twenty years. While the flexibly to waive this harsh and  unfair rule does not go far enough, we do not wish to make it more  restrictive or limiting for states.   While the Farm Bill does clarify that state agency-drafted waivers  need the governor's support, this does not require additional steps in  the waiver process or interfere with the discretion and authority that  a chief executive may have in place. The conference committee does not  intend this provision to interfere with state operations by changing  the waiver process that states have relied on for twenty years.   This conference report makes a number of administrative improvements  and efficiencies, saving a billion dollars. One provision requires  state participation in the National Accuracy Clearinghouse, which is a  database that allows for checks of participation across state lines.  Let me be clear: a data match does not mean an individual is committing  fraud by intentionally seeking benefits in more than one state. A match  can also mean that a participants first state of residence has failed  to act on the individuals' reported move.   The National Accuracy Clearinghouse can play an important role in  cleaning up state caseloads. This is important because even if a  household requests a closure of the case due to a change in residency,  the state may not act on it in a timely manner, and there's little a  household can do to prove they tried to close their case. States have a  duty to assist individuals in the application process and that means,  to me, that a state must help individuals who have recently moved.  Without evidence of an individual's intent to defraud the program,  state agencies should assume dual enrollment is unintentional.   The conference report sets up a reasonable approach to dealing with  matches from external data sources. This provision codifies recent USDA  regulations that identify the limited number of circumstances in which  a state must follow up with most households to verify information it  obtains that is likely to impact eligibility or is not required to be  reported by the household. There is no change to current policy.   The conference report also supports and codifies recent efforts by  USDA to establish clearer and more consistent quality control measures.  I expect USDA to develop clear and consistent review standards but not  to change what is meant by an error, nor to change the essential  quality control review process.   The conference report, as I mentioned earlier, saves a billion  dollars. These savings are directly reinvested into nutrition programs.  Because of this, more Americans will have access to healthy food. The  investments also help to improve SNAP employment and training programs,  reinforcing the requirement that states properly assess clients and  assign them to programs appropriate to their needs and skills, and  asking states to build programs with a demonstrated impact on improving  outcomes.   We addressed a long-standing problem--when a SNAP participant is  referred to a training program, and the program determines that the  services they provide are not well-matched to the need of the  participant. States have long been required to do meaningful  assessments in order to properly assign clients. The expanded  investment in case management should improve this capacity. And this  bill emphasized that reassessment is important as well. If a client  fails to be successful in a program it is often the result of an  inability to comply versus a refusal to comply with what's needed.   The bill and report make clear that states must reassess and reassign  the partisan if appropriate. Participants will no longer lose benefits  because states are doing a poor job of assigning them to programs that  don't work for them.   The conference report also includes an improvement to ensure all  states use a standard homeless shelter allowance. When implemented,  this provision must maintain the current flexibly that states have  around documenting the household circumstances. People experiencing  homelessness may now be able to obtain and track receipts or records of  their expenses--that is why a standard allowance is such a useful  policy. It allows states to deduct modest shelter costs for homeless  individuals who have no way of documenting those costs. In addition, a  homeless individual may have costs that exceed the standard allowance  and they must be able to claim the higher deduction. The standard  allowance does not preempt the individuals' rights to deduct actual  costs.   I have long argued that we should be increasing SNAP benefits, which  currently average a mere $1.40 per person, per meal, to help hungry  Americans afford nutritious food. While the bill unfortunately does not  provide any additional increase in SNAP benefits, it does require USDA  to revise the Thrifty Food Plan on a regular basis. Prior revisions to  the Thrifty Food Plan were done in a way that did not increase costs  despite food prices increasing and decreasing time available to prepare  many foods at home. This provision allows for  [[Page H10118]]  future revisions to increase the cost of the plan to more accurately  reflect the reality of food purchasing for most Americans. If the cost  of the plan goes up, we expect the Secretary to adjust the plan.   Mr. Speaker, I hope the Secretary of Agriculture and the president  are tuning into this debate. Right now, they are reportedly working  behind the scenes to circumvent the will of this Congress by  instituting more onerous work requirements administratively. Such a  move, I believe, will likely lead to legal action. And next Congress  when Democrats are in the Majority, we will use every legislative tool  available to block such a move at every turn.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to say for the Record, in  response to my colleague who just spoke, that the average SNAP  recipient is on the benefit for less than a year, and the majority of  SNAP recipients who can work, in fact, do work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Kind).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Wisconsin an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, as I said, some of us who support this  farm bill wanted to support the rule as well. But, again, the  Republicans thought it was important to basically tuck inside this rule  language that turns off fast track for procedures for all Yemen  resolutions through the end of this Congress.   This is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world right now, and we  don't have time to talk about it. In fact, the Republican leadership  takes the extraordinary step of doing everything they can to block  debate. It is unconscionable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Khanna), who has been a leader on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), who has been one of the leaders in this  Congress, fighting on behalf of the most vulnerable in our country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, for those of us who support the farm bill, we  want to be able to support the rule for consideration of the farm bill;  but, unfortunately, the Republican leadership decided to mess things up  by inserting language that would prevent this Congress from debating  the war in Yemen, one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.   The gentleman from Washington states: Well, we are going to have a  briefing tomorrow. It is not timely.   Well, the bottom line is, in this rule, it not only prohibits us from  debating the war in Yemen with regard to the War Powers Resolution, it  prohibits us from debating it for the rest of the Congress. What if we  learn something tomorrow that prompts action on the other side of the  aisle? You basically have said, ``No. No.''   This is ridiculous.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means  Subcommittee on Tax Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from the State of Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from the State of Vermont.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I am here to support the farm bill.  Unfortunately, my Republican friends made the rule controversial.   But another reason to support the farm bill, in addition to the  strong nutrition title for those who are vulnerable here in the United  States, the conference report also provides strong support for  international food assistance programs, like Food for Peace, Food for  Progress in McGovern-Dole, which is a program that I helped write  several years ago, which provides food to some of the most vulnerable  and poor children in the world in school settings.                                time  1300    So this farm bill, in addition to helping our farmers, in addition to  providing food security for people here in the United States, I think,  also contributes to our national security around the world. And I point  that out so my colleagues understand that this farm bill covers a  whole, wide range of areas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Tonko).    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the ranking member of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on my side.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. I think  I am the final speaker here, so I will let the Republicans go ahead.    Mr. Speaker, if I can inquire of the gentleman from  Washington whether he has any additional speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I know that the gentleman has additional  speakers over there. Would it be appropriate to ask unanimous consent  to give the gentleman an additional 2 minutes? I have 3\1/2\, but I am  going to use that, but could we give them an additional 2 minutes?    Mr. Speaker, I don't want to yield 2 minutes. I ask  unanimous consent for the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) to  have an additional 2 minutes. If there is no objection, is that----    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse) to control.    Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman have any more speakers?    Mr. Speaker, do I have 2\1/2\ minutes remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 7264, a continuing resolution to  fund the remainder of the government and extend the National Flood  Insurance Program, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families Act until September 30.   I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the  Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote.    Mr. Speaker, I hope people will vote ``no'' on the  previous question so we can debate this and vote on keeping our  government open. But I would just close by again saying to my  colleagues that this farm bill is not a great bill, but it is a good  bill. It is the result of bipartisan negotiations at a conference  committee that produced something that I think both Democrats and  Republicans can come together and support.   I am supporting this bill because it is good on the nutrition title.  As you know, I have spent a lot of time in this Chamber talking about  the issues of hunger and food insecurity in this country.   There are 40 million Americans who don't have enough to eat, who are  hungry, and this is in the richest and most powerful country in the  world. I am ashamed of that fact. Every Member of this House should be  ashamed of that fact.   Hunger is a political condition. We can fix it, if we had the  political will.   This farm bill is not as robust as I would like it to be under the  nutrition title, but it does no harm. It doesn't increase hunger. It  doesn't throw people off of SNAP. It doesn't make hunger worse in this  country. It is deserving of bipartisan support, so I hope all of my  Democratic colleagues will vote in favor of this farm bill.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank all those who came together to  construct this compromise. It is a much, much better product than what  came out of this House, and this is a vote that we can be proud of. I  hope that everybody will support it.   Finally, I regretfully have to say I urge my colleagues to vote  against the rule, because the Republicans couldn't help themselves and  had to insert this Yemen issue into this rule.   This issue has been going on for years. This is not a new phenomenon,  what is happening in Yemen. It is a tragedy that has gone on for years.  We know it is happening. We know it is long time past since we should  act.   Mr. Speaker, we should defeat the rule, have another rule that is  just on the farm bill, and we ought to be debating this issue of Yemen.   Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on the previous question, vote ``no'' on the  rule, and vote ``yes'' on the farm bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
