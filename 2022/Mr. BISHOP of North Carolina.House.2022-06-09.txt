 Madam Speaker, the Fifth Amendment  states: ``Nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due  process of law.''   It is the paradox of the American experience that so many who swear  to  [[Page H5428]]  preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, the supreme law  enshrining our fundamental rights, are so often predisposed to strip  those rights, always with noble motive.   Weeks ago, the Biden Department of Homeland Security formed a  Disinformation Governance Board to become the arbiter of right think,  even since disbanded. Bad idea.   In 2020, State Governors ordered the healthy to stay out of their  churches for fear of the virus. Do you remember?   In 1971, the Department of Justice obtained a TRO, a prior restraint,  to abridge freedom of the press by forbidding The New York Times to  continue publishing the Pentagon Papers. Lower courts approved that,  too.   In February 1942, another progressive Democrat, FDR, issued an  executive order to intern U.S. citizens and residents of Japanese  descent. It was greatly popular; 60 percent of Americans polled  supported sending their fellow American citizens to concentration  camps. It was approved not just by lower courts but by the United  States Supreme Court in Korematsu, 1944. It took until 2018 for it to  be repudiated. Look again at what you justified.   The long-existing Baker Act provides due process. New York had a red  flag law and did not detect the Buffalo shooter.   The fierce urgency of now meets the protections of fundamental rights  in the United States Constitution, and they must be vindicated.
