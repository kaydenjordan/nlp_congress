 Madam President, I rise today with a heavy  heart to pay tribute to Quentin ``Q'' Williams, a dedicated public  servant, advocate, and friend to many. Tragically, State Representative  Williams passed away on January 5, 2023, at the age of 39. He will be  remembered for his commitment to Connecticut and passion for helping  others.   A lifelong resident of Middletown, CT, Q was killed in an automobile  accident just one day after being sworn in for a third term as State  representative, a beautiful life cut tragically short, a bright light  extinguished.   Raised by a single mother in Middletown, Q accomplished so much in  his short career. After graduating from Middletown Public Schools, he  earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from Bryant  University, and a master of public administration from Villanova  University--excellent preparation for a professional career dedicated  to serving others.   Q began his career in community banking in Hartford before pursuing  nonprofit management. In 2012, he was named executive director of the  Middletown Downtown Business District and launched the community's  first ``Middletown Restaurant Week,'' enhancing the community and  economic vitality of the city's Main Street. Q served as director of  advocacy and policy for Excellence Community Schools, a charter school  network, and cofounded EquityCT, an education nonprofit. He was also  active in many charitable and service organizations with a generous  spirit that served him well in public service.   In 2019, Q was elected as the first Black State legislator from  Middletown. As State representative, Q took great pride in championing  social and racial equality, human rights, and accessible housing. He  supported youth programs to help the next generation prepare for  successful futures. There is no telling where Q's energy and passion  could have taken him and how much good he would have continued to do  for his community and the state of Connecticut.   At two recent church ceremonies, in Middletown and Bloomfield,  friends and colleagues of Q's spoke of his love and loyalty, his jovial  spirit, and deeply genuine generosity. At the time of his death,  Representative Williams was looking forward to serving as the new house  chair of the labor and public employees committee. Over the last  several weeks, at ceremonies honoring him, I have spoken to his  wonderful family. I have been among scores of people paying their  respects to Q--a stirring testament to his positive impact.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Q's family  during this difficult time, particularly to his wife Carrissa and  mother Queen. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Q's life  and legacy, both large and lasting.                            ____________________
