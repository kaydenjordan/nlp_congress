 Mr. Speaker, as America has been  shocked at the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, I agree with  Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York that 99.9 percent of police are  dedicated public servants.   Reaffirmation of appreciation of law enforcement has been provided by  Senator Tim Scott with the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate  Communities Everywhere, JUSTICE, Act. This reform legislation will  provide more resources and de-escalation training.   Senator Scott has correctly identified that the police department is  a part of our community. I am grateful to cosponsor the House companion  legislation, led by Congressman Pete Stauber, a veteran police officer.   Now is the time for Republicans and Democrats to work together to  restore trust in our police and reduce divisions which destroy  families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   I am grateful to Chief Andrew Richburg and Chief Dennis Tyndall.                            ____________________
