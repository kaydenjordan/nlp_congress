 First, I thank my friend and colleague for his  outstanding words on DACA. No one has fought more for the DACA kids  than he has, not just in the last year but over the last decade. The  fact that so many of them are here is, in good part, due to his great  work and effort. Thank you.     Thoughts and Prayers for the Victims of the Congressional Baseball                             Practice Shooting    Mr. President, we are still all a bit shaken by the horrors of  yesterday's shooting. It was a senseless act of violence, made even  more chilling by the circumstances at a baseball practice for a  bipartisan charity event. I understand that Representative Scalise is  still in critical condition following surgery last night. When we hear  the word ``critical'' attached to his condition, it sends shivers down  our spines. We hope and pray for a quick and full recovery. I know that  all of his House colleagues are wishing him well right now, and I want  him to know his friends in the Senate do as well.   The same goes for the other four who were injured in the attack,  including two members of our Capitol Police Force. Our thoughts and  prayers go with them as well. We remain grateful for their service and  bravery and for the service and bravery of all of our Capitol police  officers. Their presence at the field yesterday--the presence of those  two Capitol police officers at the field yesterday prevented a bad  situation from getting worse and undoubtedly saved lives. Had the two  brave police officers not acted or if they had not been there, it might  well have been a massacre.   We would all be wise to reflect on the importance of civility in our  Nation's politics this morning. We disagree vehemently at times in  Congress and folks out in the country do, too, but the level of  nastiness, vitriol, and hate that has seeped into our politics must be  excised. Let us all strive at all times--whatever our disagreements--to  respect those who disagree with us, to seek a greater understanding of  them, to walk in their moccasins--as Native Americans have always said.  Let us strive always to conduct our politics with civility.   I was heartened to hear that the congressional baseball game will  still be played this evening. Let it be a symbol that hate and violence  do not cast too long or too great a shadow, that we can and will come  together this evening, and the game will go on. I will be going to the  game with the three congressional leaders as a show of solidarity.   Mr. President, last evening, the Senate showed it can come together.  Last night, we voted, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion, to  strengthen a package of sanctions against Russia. It was the product of  diligent weeks of bipartisan negotiations. I saw the Senator from  Maryland behind me a few minutes ago. He deserves lots of credit, as do  the Senators from Ohio, Tennessee, and Idaho. The final result is a  very good one for our country because yesterday the U.S. Senate said to  Mr. Putin, in no uncertain terms, that when he violates international  norms and interferes with our election, he will not escape reproach.   Not only did we pass a new round of tough sanctions for Russia's  meddling in our election, we codified existing sanctions into law,  making them harder to lift, and we moved to make the Congress--not the  President--the final arbiter of sanctions relief when necessary. Any  ideas of the President that he can lift sanctions on his own, for any  reason, are dashed by this legislation.   The House of Representatives should take notice that 97 Senators  voted in favor of this package. I hope Leader Ryan will move with the  same haste to pass this package of sanctions through the House. I hope  the President will sign it. The months-long effort to forge bipartisan  consensus on Russia sanctions--an issue that gets to the vital  interests of our country, the wellspring of our democracy--gives me  hope that Democrats and Republicans can come together and work together  on a number of big issues this year.   There are several issues coming before this body soon where we can  come together: another budget--passing another budget; reauthorizing  flood insurance and children's health insurance; raising the debt  ceiling. Each of those issues will, by definition, demand bipartisan  effort.   A lesson that all of us have learned here in the Senate is that  legislation is made better and much more likely to pass when both  parties are involved in crafting it.   I have noticed the media has been questioning all morning why  Congress isn't more bipartisan. We should be. But when the Russia  sanctions agreement passes and the budget deal passes, both major  bipartisan efforts, they are proof that we can get things done  together. If those agreements were given a little more recognition by  the media--the fact that we can at times, at least, work in a  bipartisan way--that would help. For too many of us on both sides of  the aisle, it seems as though when there is divisiveness, it gets far  more attention in the media than when there is comity between the  parties.                            Healthcare Legislation    Mr. President, finally, I would suggest to my colleagues that the  most immediate place where we can translate the rhetoric calling for us  to come together into reality is on healthcare. A goal many of us share  on both sides of the aisle is to improve the law, bring costs down for  consumers, stabilize the marketplace, and make it easier for older  Americans to afford the ever-rising out-of-pocket costs of prescription  drugs.   I would conclude by stating that we can make the rhetoric of  bipartisanship not empty by both parties coming together and working  together on healthcare. We have shown thus far in this Congress with  the passage of the budget and Russia sanctions that significant  legislation can best be served by bipartisanship. Opening up the  process and having us all come together on healthcare would be a very  good, concrete reaffirmation of bipartisanship and would translate the  rhetoric--not bad at all--that we have heard here today into reality.   In conclusion, the rhetoric about bipartisanship can be strengthened.  Hopefully healthcare is a place where we can strengthen it, by opening  up the process, having hearings, and having open discussion.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the  quorum calls on S. 722 be charged equally to both sides.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1376         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
