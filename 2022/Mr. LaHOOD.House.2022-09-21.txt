 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Morton High  School in Morton, Illinois.   At Morton, classes past and present have achieved tremendous success  and a legacy of excellence carried on by the students that followed  them.   As the Morton High School athletics department has grown, so has the  prominence of their girls' basketball team, known as the Lady Potters.  In an unprecedented record of success in eight seasons from 2015 to  2022, the Lady Potters won four Illinois State championships, three in  succession. In that time, they have won 244 games and only lost 23.   Coach Bob Becker has been awarded Coach of the Year multiple times by  the Illinois High School Association and was named to the Illinois  Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame in 2020. This year, the class of 1972  also celebrates their 50th anniversary as graduates of Morton High  School.   Morton continues to honor the legacy of the classes before them and  their tremendous achievements throughout the year. Congratulations to  classes past and present of Morton High School. The school pride is  worthy of celebration. Keep up the great work, Potters.                            ____________________
