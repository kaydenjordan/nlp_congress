 Mr. President, I wish to honor former Senator Pete V.  Domenici of New Mexico, who passed away September 13 in Albuquerque. It  was a privilege to call Pete a friend and to work with him as a Senate  colleague and member of the Appropriations Committee.   Senator Domenici had a great ability to bring people together to work  on solutions to complicated challenges like the budget deficit,  national security, and energy policy. His passing closes the book on a  life well-lived as a public servant dedicated to his family, his State,  and our Nation.   My condolences go out to his lovely wife, Nancy, and their family.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
