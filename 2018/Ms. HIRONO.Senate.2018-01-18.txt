 Mr. President, Republicans control every level of the  Federal Government. They hold majorities in the House and the Senate.  They have the Presidency. Yet the very people--the Republicans--who set  the agenda in Washington and have majorities in both the House and the  Senate are desperately trying to convince the American people that a  government shutdown should be blamed on anyone else but them. Give me a  break.   Nobody wants a shutdown except, maybe, the President, who seems to  relish a government shutdown as a way of ``shaking things up,''  regardless of who gets hurt. Members of Congress should know better,  and Republicans should get down to business and negotiate with  Democrats in good faith.   Republicans in the House and Senate have brought us to the brink of a  shutdown because they are terrified of the ideological extremists in  their own party who reject even the most reasonable bipartisan  compromises. They are terrified of a mercurial President, who changes  his mind on a whim, who explodes at even the most minor slights, and  who has repeatedly said that maybe we need a good government shutdown  so he can get his vanity wall. Donald Trump and the Republicans will be  held responsible for any government shutdown. They have created this  situation, and the American people will hold them accountable.   Democrats have been open and transparent about the things we are  fighting for. We are fighting to reauthorize the Children's Health  Insurance Program, CHIP, so 9 million kids across the country can  continue to access the lifesaving healthcare they need. We are fighting  to restore funding to community health centers that serve millions of  underserved Americans in rural communities, whether they live in  Kansas, Ohio, or any of the other States Trump won. We are fighting to  protect the Dreamers who could be deported to countries they know  little of because the President unnecessarily and cruelly ended the  DACA Program. We are also fighting for parity in funding for defense  and domestic spending in any budget deal.   These are not partisan Democratic priorities. If one were to put each  of these priorities up for a vote, they would all pass with bipartisan  support in the House and the Senate. In fact, we could have passed each  of these bills a long time ago. Yet, instead of doing something that  would actually help people, the Republicans spent months working as  hard as they could behind closed doors to give the wealthiest 1 percent  of the people in our country and corporations huge tax cuts. Now they  are trying to convince the other 99 percent of the American public that  this tax bill was a good deal for them, but that is another story and  is another example of misplaced priorities.   In getting back to the matter at hand, which is the urgency of  preventing a government shutdown, the House is trying to pass another  short-term spending bill that only includes a reauthorization for  children's health and not the other important priorities we need to  support. The Republicans in Congress are trying to pit communities,  children, families, and Dreamers against one another in an attempt to  divide and conquer. They are hoping we will support yet another  government funding bill that kicks the can down the road because they  will have funded children's health, even as, in their bill, they  abandon the Dreamers and the rural communities that depend on community  health centers.   We cannot allow this cynical Republican ploy to succeed. We need to  keep fighting for children's health, for community health centers, for  Dreamers, and for parity. I will not vote for any government funding  bill that does not include all four of these important and urgent  priorities. We cannot leave anyone behind because it is clear Donald  [[Page S284]]  Trump will not keep his promise to protect those we call the DACA kids.   I was at the White House last week when the President looked us in  the eye and said on national TV that he would sign a bipartisan  compromise on the Dreamers. He barely waited for us to leave the White  House before reneging on that promise. Then we all know what happened  last week during the meeting with Senators Durbin and Graham at the  White House when he was presented with a bipartisan compromise.   We cannot let the President's irresponsible behavior stop us from  fighting for Dreamers who deserve our support and protection, Dreamers  like Getsi from Beaverton, OR, whom I met late last month when she  traveled to Washington, DC, to fight for the passage of the Dream Act.  Getsi's parents brought her to Oregon from Mexico when she was only 4  years old. The journey was long and hard, and Getsi's sister was left  behind.   While growing up, Getsi's parents warned her not to talk about her  immigration status because even mentioning it to the wrong person could  result in their deportations. She lived in constant fear. While growing  up, Getsi's parents always emphasized the importance of her obtaining a  higher education, and while her mom and dad only completed the 5th and  12th grades, respectively, they instilled a love of learning in their  daughter and a deep desire to go to college.   After working hard in high school, Getsi enrolled in Western Oregon  University, where she is studying to become a gerontological nurse.  Getsi works incredibly hard. She is taking 20 credits a semester. I  remember, when I was in college, 15 credits was a lot. She is taking 20  credits a semester, is working full time at an assisted living  facility, and has recently become a certified rock climbing instructor.  Getsi is scheduled to graduate a year early, in May, from Western  Oregon University. After graduation, she is planning to enroll in an  accelerated nursing master's program so she can realize her dream of  becoming a gerontological nurse practitioner.   When I asked what inspired her to pursue such a selfless career,  Getsi talked about wanting to care for people like her grandmother back  in Mexico and for her parents as they got older. Without the  protections DACA provides, Getsi will lose her work authorization, and  if she is not able to work, she will not be able to pay for school and  will be unable to pursue her dreams.   When I asked her why she traveled for days to come to Washington to  share this message with Congress, her response was very moving. She  said:         I have so many dreams and aspirations, and I urge people       here to understand how much these Dreamers have to give to       the U.S. We were brought at such a young age, we don't know       anything about our homelands. I want to be able to stay in       the U.S., to stay with my friends and family--my nieces and       nephew--everyone who is looking up to me. I want to prove       that my parents' sacrifice meant something.    This is a pivotal moment for Congress. Are we going to do more than  pay lip service to Dreamers like Getsi by doing our jobs to protect  them and provide healthcare to millions of children and families across  the country or are we going to bend to the whims of an unpredictable,  mercurial, and unreliable President?   Rather than waiting for the President to make up his mind, I call on  the majority leader to recognize that as a separate branch of  government, Congress should be a check on the excesses of the executive  branch. It is about time the majority leader and Republicans in  Congress stepped up to do their jobs.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
