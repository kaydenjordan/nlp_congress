 I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion     Mr. President, when these ill-conceived tariffs were  announced last week, I said I would introduce legislation that would  immediately nullify this very unfortunate exercise in protectionism  before it could wreak havoc on our economy.   If implemented, these tariffs will do just what tariffs have always  done. They will lead to job losses and will stymie economic growth.  What is worse, the President's attempt at flexibility in the form of  poorly defined exceptions only serves to harm the economy further by  creating uncertainty. Tariffs are bad enough on their own; tariffs  married with uncertainty are even worse.   Can you imagine the President saying one day, ``Well, I think that  Australia is moving in ways that we think are good in this area or  that, so I am going to lessen the tariffs that we impose on steel and  aluminum for Australia''? The next day it is Brazil. ``If it does this  or that that is unrelated to these tariffs, I might lift tariffs or  lessen the burden of tariffs on that country.'' Yet, a week later, if  Brazil makes another move, the President might seek to reimpose or to  make the burden heavier. That simply doesn't work if you are trying to  achieve economic growth and if you are trying to convince countries to  enter into trade partnerships with you. Particularly when you are  dealing with our allies, that is no way to treat your allies.   I understand free trade is sometimes a challenge. I understand that  it is a challenge on the campaign trail, certainly. It is often easier  to point to a shuttered factory and blame trade or immigration or some  other convenient scapegoat other than what is usually the case-- modernization or mechanization or something that has meant that we have  increased productivity or simply the best allocation capital in order  to facilitate trade.   We have to aggressively negotiate both bilateral and multilateral  trade deals if we are to catch up. If we fail to do this and continue  to withdraw from the global marketplace, we are going to be left far  behind. We saw this with regard to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We  pulled out of those negotiations, and the other 11 countries involved  simply went on their own and left us behind. That has meant, in  particular, countries in Southeast Asia, which would like to be a part  of our trade orbit, have had no choice but to be more reliant on China.  That doesn't serve our interests at all.   We have to remember we represent just 20 percent of the world's  economic output. We represent just 5 percent of the world's population  or just less than that. If we don't trade, we don't grow. You can be  pro-growth or you can be pro-tariff, but you can't be both.   Those who have reservations about these tariffs ought to support this  legislation that I am introducing today to  [[Page S1633]]  nullify the tariffs. Those who have expressed admiration for free trade  or supply-side economics ought to support this bill as well. Those who  are happy with the economic growth that we have recently achieved and  are interested in seeing it continue ought to support this bill. We now  have a better climate for economic growth on both the regulatory side  and the tax side. If we enter a trade war, we risk reversing those  gains we have made.   We in Congress cannot be complicit as this administration courts  economic disaster in this fashion. I urge my colleagues to join me in  exercising our constitutional oversight and to invalidate these  irresponsible tariffs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, when these ill-conceived tariffs were  announced last week, I said I would introduce legislation that would  immediately nullify this very unfortunate exercise in protectionism  before it could wreak havoc on our economy.
