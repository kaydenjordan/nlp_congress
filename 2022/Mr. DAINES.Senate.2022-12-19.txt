 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing and congratulating Montana West Economic Development for  its 25 years of service to the communities of northwest Montana. As a  small, private nonprofit, MWED has spent the last quarter century  working to attract, launch, and grow businesses.   From their launch in the late 1990s, MWED has worked to help  diversify local economies and attract capital investment. Their vision  has always been the long-term health of the northwest Montana economy.  From maintaining and growing economic drivers such as rail and timber,  to growing new businesses in the manufacturing, tech, and service  sectors, their work has provided substantial support and opportunities  to grow northwest Montana's economy. They have also provided loans and  services to launch dozens of local small businesses and run the Montana  Procurement Technical Assistance Center to help local companies with  the government contracting process.   I have had the pleasure of working with MWED on a number of projects  including the construction of the Kalispell Bypass and the Kalispell  CORE and Rail project. They believe in their community and advocate  strongly for its needs. Despite facing obstacles, MWED staff always  maintains a can-do attitude and works to find solutions while  maintaining the trust of community leaders.   Congratulations to Montana West on their 25th anniversary. I look  forward to working with them on more projects for years to  come.                            ____________________
