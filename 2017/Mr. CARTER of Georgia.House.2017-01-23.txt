 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Wiley  Anderson Wasden, Jr., from Savannah, Georgia, who passed away on  January 18, 2017, just a few days shy of his 80th birthday.   Born in Millen, Georgia, to his parents, Wiley Senior and Katherine,  Mr. Wasden moved to Savannah after graduating from high school in 1953.  He then began studies at the University of Georgia, where he joined the  Phi Delta Theta Fraternity and ignited his interest in government.  Throughout his life, Mr. Wasden continued this interest in government  and used it to make the State of Georgia a better place to live,  eventually serving as chairman of the Georgia State Republican Party  and as a Georgia State senator. Outside of government, Mr. Wasden  worked hard for his community. He was a well-respected local Realtor in  Savannah while he also served as chairman of the board for Savannah  Country Day School.   I am proud today to recognize Mr. Wasden's outstanding life and the  positive impact he made on the State of Georgia. He will certainly be  missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 587, the Fair RATES Act.   This bill would amend the Federal Power Act so that those who are  adversely affected by inaction of the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission on utility rate changes will have the right to a rehearing.  Under current law, a court challenge to a FERC order may only be  brought about petitioning the Commission for a rehearing.   But if the panel is deadlocked and no order is issued by FERC on a  utility rate increase, affected parties cannot bring an action because  there was no final order. Meanwhile, the utility rate increase moves  forward without the ability of affected parties to be heard.   Under the Fair RATES Act, FERC's inaction on a utility's notice of a  rate increase within 60 days will be treated as an order accepting the  change. Affected parties will then be able to petition for a rehearing  on the utility rate change.   This bill will ensure that consumers and other affected parties are  able to have their concerns heard by Federal regulators. The Fair RATES  Act will hold Federal regulators accountable to ensure utility rate  increases are reasonable by increasing transparency in the process.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 590, the Advanced  Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017.   This bill would require the Department of Energy and the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission to work together to further the development of  advanced nuclear technology. By directing the Department of Energy and  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enter into a memorandum of  understanding, this bill will reduce bureaucratic barriers to advanced  nuclear technology research and development.   Growing a closer partnership between the Department of Energy and the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission will help to chart an energy independence  path for our Nation as we seek new possibilities and alternatives to  power our way to a better future. Energy independence is critical to  both our national security and to the continued growth of our economy.   There has been a considerable amount of research and development that  has gone into nuclear energy, and it accounts for 60 percent of the  clean energy produced in the United States. This legislation will knock  down those walls to innovation and will provide an opportunity to  develop advanced reactor designs that could be vital to our energy  infrastructure.   I applaud my good friend, Mr. Latta, for his leadership on this  issue, and the Energy and Commerce Committee for their work on this  bill.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  423, the Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017, because it addresses the issue of  call spoofing and the impact that these deceitful callers are having on  Americans.   Every day, millions of Americans are hit with calls using a  fraudulent caller ID profile and with impersonators on the other end of  the line. These con artists are able to disguise their real number in  an effort to convince unsuspecting victims that they are a  representative from a government agency, financial company, healthcare  system, or other organizations that may request information to contact  someone. An example of a common call is someone saying they are calling  from the IRS and are asking for personal information over the phone.  This has got to stop.   Representatives Meng, Barton, and Lance have again introduced this  legislation to prevent these criminals from further victimizing  hardworking Americans.   We have a real opportunity to combat this growing tactic and protect  those in our communities who are the most vulnerable.   I applaud the Energy and Commerce Committee for their continued  effort to protect Americans from criminal behavior and in updating such  important policy measures. Last Congress, this legislation passed the  House with an overwhelming vote of 382-5 in support.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 423 because we have an  opportunity to fix a growing problem in our country and to cut down on  fraud.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  588, the Securing Access to Networks in Disasters Act because it will  help to strengthen and reinforce our networks during times of  emergency.   Representing the entire coast of Georgia, I am no stranger at what a  working network means for the coordination of rescue and recovery  efforts. Hurricane Matthew made landfall and had a significant impact  on multiple States along the Southeastern seaboard, including Georgia.  I personally toured many of the hardest-hit areas in my district and I  have seen devastation that natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can  inflict on areas such as ours.   Of course, just this past weekend, Mr. Speaker, we witnessed  tornadoes in south Georgia, tornadoes that brought about tremendous  devastation and the loss of life.   However, our first responders and emergency specialists are there to  heed the call and assist in helping people who are most in need.   Ranking Member Pallone's legislation would direct the Federal  Communications Commission to conduct a  [[Page H581]]  study on network resiliency during times of emergency and distress.  Under this bill, the study done by the FCC would be made publicly  available on their Web site and would include public safety benefits  and the costs of implementing new alternatives that will aid in  contacting and coordinating emergency services during those difficult  times.   I urge my friends and colleagues to support this legislation because  I have seen firsthand not only what disasters can do to an area, but  the importance of our emergency services in having the networks and  communication means to coordinate relief.   Strengthening our network resiliency is a benefit to everyone across  our great country.                                time  1645
