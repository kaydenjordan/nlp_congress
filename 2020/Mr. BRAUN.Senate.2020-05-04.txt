 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to honor and recognize the life and  contributions of Mr. Jim Cummings to the countless Hoosiers whose lives  he touched over nine decades.   Jim was a giant in Indiana. His long and rich life left many  indelible marks on our State. We look to people like Jim Cummings as an  example of a life well lived in service to others. His role in founding  the Indiana Black Expo in 1970 made him a leader to all Hoosiers during  a time of great change in our State and our Nation. As a lifelong  servant to those in his State and community, his dedication to  conservative principles guided his thoughts and actions for many years.   His life of service extended beyond his work with the Indiana Black  Expo. It included serving his community in public office on a number of  boards in Indianapolis and working as the Deputy Assistant Secretary  for the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President  Ronald Reagan.   Indiana has lost one of its most distinguished Hoosiers of this  generation.  [[Page S2203]]  The Cummings family has lost a father, a grandfather, and a great- grandfather. I join them in mourning the loss of Jim Cummings.   In closing, I personally thank the Cummings family for the vast  contributions he made to Indianapolis and the Hoosier State. Both are  better because of him. On behalf of me and Maureen, my wife, we extend  our sincere condolences to all of his family and friends at this time.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
