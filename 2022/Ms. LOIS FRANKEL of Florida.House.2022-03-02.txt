 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I am blessed that my son, Ben, a Marine war veteran,  returned safely from tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ben is now a small  business owner, and he has even given me two beautiful grandsons. And  listen, not every family is as lucky.   Our servicemen and -women put their lives on the line for our Nation,  and yet for too long, countless veterans have unknowingly been exposed  to environmental hazards and toxic waste, like burn pits, during their  duty. And then they come back home with long-term health impacts like  cancer, infertility, and breathing issues.   Mr. Speaker, they deserve better. We owe them better. And here is the  thing: If we are willing to send our troops to war, we must also be  willing to care for their health upon return, and this includes the  80,000 veterans in my home area of Palm Beach County.   It is time for Congress to honor this commitment and pass the  Honoring our PACT Act to provide access to VA healthcare to millions of  veterans exposed to toxic substances.   The best way to thank our veterans for their service is with action.  I urge my colleagues to pass this important bill.
