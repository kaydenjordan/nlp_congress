 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a great American  patriot, Pete Peterson, who passed away at the age of 91 last month.   Born to Greek immigrant parents in America's heartland of Nebraska,  Pete rose from humble beginnings to contribute to our Nation as a  public servant, statesman, business leader, and especially through his  philanthropic and policy work.   Pete was a clarion voice for fiscal responsibility and a strong moral  conscience in Washington, working tirelessly and always reaching across  party lines.   For Pete, building a bright economic future for the next generation  was his patriotic duty. He understood that he was so fortunate to have  lived the American Dream, and he wanted that same opportunity available  for every man, woman, and child in our Nation.   Economic policy leadership was a defining thread running through his  life, including in his roles as Secretary of Commerce, the head of  major American corporations, and the founder of respected policy  organizations, including the Peterson Institute for International  Economics and the Peterson Foundation.   Pete's prophetic voice on the importance of fiscal sustainability  brought together generations of policymakers, no matter their political  background, to find common ground and effective solutions. His strong  moral leadership to ensure our children and our grandchildren inherit a  healthy fiscal future leaves a remarkable legacy.   Mr. Speaker, anyone who knew Pete will attest to his wit, generous  spirit, and personal warmth that made him a pleasure to be around.   Pete signed The Giving Pledge and committed the bulk of his personal  fortune to philanthropic causes. His legacy will endure in many ways,  but especially through the work of the Peterson Foundation, which  continues to focus on solutions to America's fiscal and economic  challenges, now under the leadership of his son Michael.   The loss of Pete will be deeply felt in Washington, in the Nation,  and around the world. May it bring some measure of comfort to his wife,  Joan Ganz Cooney; his children, John, Jim, David, Holly, and Michael;  and all his loved ones that so many grieve with them during this  difficult time.   I knew and loved Pete Peterson, and I know he loved his family above  all. He was a great American, who loved our country as well.                            ____________________
