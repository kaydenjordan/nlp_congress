 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record support for this  bill from the National Electrical Contractors Association.   [[Page H417]]                             [From NECA, February 1, 2021]       Media Contact: Matt Kraus, Director, Communications National           Electrical Contractors Association.         The National Electrical Contractors Association issued the       following statement in support of the National Apprenticeship       Act of 2021:        ``The National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 is a direct       investment in our workforce, the trades, and the entire       electrical construction industry. It will invest more than       $3.5 billion toward expanding opportunities and access to       apprenticeships in the United States in the next five years,       totaling nearly 1 million new apprenticeship opportunities.       NECA supports the National Apprenticeship Act and encourages       Congress to push this legislation forward to help grow       America's skilled workforce.''            ABOUT THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION         NECA is the voice of the $171 billion electrical       construction industry that brings power, light and       communication technology to buildings and communities across       the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for H.R. 447, the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.   In the middle of this global pandemic and economic crisis, Americans  need hope and they need work. Today's legislation is a meaningful step  to increase access to registered apprenticeships. Apprenticeships  remain one of the most successful workforce development programs for  new entrants and those seeking a new career.   According to the Department of Labor, 94 percent of people who  complete apprenticeships are employed upon completion and earn an  average salary of over $70,000. As a Representative for the cities of  Toledo, Lorain, Sandusky, Cleveland, and Parma, all of which boast a  strong automotive heritage, it is difficult to overemphasize the value  of these apprenticeships for young people and adults starting careers  in the automotive trades.   So whether it is the expertise to rebuild an engine, replace a  battery in a hybrid vehicle, perfect biofuels, or TIG weld the rear  quarter panel of an old Wagoneer, there will always be a market for  skilled craftspeople who can repair or restore modern and classic  vehicles, and invent the vehicles of the future, as happened with my  own brother, Steve, who did it for many years as a race car driver and  a patent holder.   I strongly support this legislation for over a million apprenticeship  opportunities over the next 5 years to strengthen this economy and  bring people the skills that are needed to operate successful  enterprises.
