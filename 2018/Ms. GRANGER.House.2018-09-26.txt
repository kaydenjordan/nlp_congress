 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the  FY19 Defense and Labor-HHS Appropriations conference agreement.   Congress' number one responsibility is to provide for the defense of  this Nation. This agreement enables us to fulfill that most fundamental  constitutional duty.   Since becoming chair, it has been my goal to ensure that this bill  reflects the needs of our defense and intelligence experts so that they  have the resources needed to combat the threats of today and in the  future.   I want to thank Members for their participation throughout this  process. Their input on how we can best address the needs of our  military has been invaluable. This agreement includes many of their  ideas and priorities by taking into account the over 6,600 requests  submitted by Members.   With this agreement, we will be able to do something that has not  been done in a decade: provide our military with the funding they need  on time so we can rebuild our Armed Forces.   This is an agreement we can all be very proud of. It provides  Secretary of  [[Page H9042]]  Defense Mattis with the resources he needs to implement the new  National Defense Strategy and restore our military.                                time  1500    This conference agreement includes major investments in air  superiority, shipbuilding, and the ground forces, including strong  support for the National Guard.   This bill provides 18 C-130 aircraft, including 8 for the Air  National Guard; 24 F-18 Super Hornets; 58 Black Hawk helicopters; 66  Apache helicopters; 93 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters; 13 V-22 aircraft; 13  Navy ships, including 2 Virginia-Class submarines, and 3 Littoral  Combat Ships; upgrades for 135 Abrams tanks, and $1.3 billion for  additional National Guard and Reserve equipment.   This agreement also invests in the research and development needed to  maintain our technological superiority, including critical investments  in space, hypersonics, nuclear forces, and missile defense, including  the Israeli cooperative programs.   Finally, this agreement strongly supports our servicemembers and  their families by funding the largest pay raise for our troops in 9  years;   Growing the force by fully funding the authorized increase in end  strength; and,   Investing in the defense health program, including critical medical  research.   I would like to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen. This is his last  defense bill, and we are thankful for his leadership on our national  security.   I would like to thank Ranking Member Visclosky for being a great  partner on this bill.   I would also like to thank the members of the Defense Subcommittee,  as well as the staff, for their many hours of work on this bill.   On our majority staff: Jennifer Miller, Walter Hearne, Brooke Boyer,  BG Wright, Allison Deters, Collin Lee, Matt Bower, Jackie Ripke, Hayden  Milberg, Bill Adkins, Sherry Young, and Barry Walker.   On our minority staff: Becky Leggieri, Jennifer Chartrand, and Chris  Bigelow.   On my personal staff: Johnnie Kaberle and Spencer Freebairn; and on  Mr. Visclosky's staff, Joe DeVooght.   In closing, I, again, urge my colleagues to support this agreement  and fund our national security. It is vital that we pass this agreement  this week and have it signed into law. The men and women of our Armed  Forces deserve no less.
