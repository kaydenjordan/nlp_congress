 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J.  Res. 40.   As part of our bold agenda for the American people, we are reining in  the out-of-control bureaucracy in Washington. We are taking action to  roll back 8 years of Obama administration overreach.   Today we are stopping an egregious violation that flies in the face  of the Constitution. This regulation, finalized in the final days of  the Obama Presidency, would deny certain Social Security recipients  their Second Amendment rights without due process.   If you receive Social Security disability payments and someone helps  you manage those payments, this regulation stops you from being able to  purchase a firearm, your name gets added to a Federal database, and the  burden is on you to prove it doesn't belong there. This is absolutely  outrageous.   This regulation discriminates against individuals with disabilities  by denying them their Second Amendment rights and violating their  rights of due process. And it gives far too much power to bureaucrats  at the Social Security Administration, who should be focused on making  sure people get the benefits they deserve, not deciding who can own a  gun.   This is why we are standing up for the Second Amendment rights of all  disabled citizens. Being disabled doesn't make you a danger to society,  and getting help managing your benefits doesn't mean you forfeit your  constitutional rights.   Mr. Speaker, I want to absolutely thank Congressman Sam Johnson and  Congressman Ralph Abraham for their leadership on this issue. I  strongly support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record additional letters of support.           National Association of County Behavioral Health &             Development Disability Directors,                                  Washington, DC, February 1, 2017.      Re NACBHDD and NARMH Letter of Support for the CRA on the SSA           NICS Rule.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Office of the Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: NACBHDD and       NARMH urge you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA)       resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social       Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016,       ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of       2007. This rule would require the Social Security       Administration to forward the names of all Social Security       Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income       (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to       help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the       National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).        NACBHDD is a national organization that represents county       mental health, substance use, and developmental; disability       directors in Washington, DC. NARMH represents rural mental       health in the Capital.        Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, NACBHDD and NARMH       conveyed our opposition to the rule through a letter to the       Obama Administration and through the public comment process.       We join many of our  [[Page H901]]       mental health coalition members and advocates who--opposed       the rule for a number of reasons, including:        The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public       dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people       with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there       is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed       by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.        The absence of any data suggesting that there is any       connection between the need for a representative payee to       manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a       propensity toward gun violence.        The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior       to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.       Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to       transmit the names of individuals who have been       ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own       affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication       and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly       unable to manage their own affairs.        Based on similar concerns, the National Council on       Disability, an independent federal agency charged with       advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies       regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the       Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.        We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to       disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it       inflicts on the disability community.            Sincerely yours,                                             Ron Manderscheid, PhD,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                   National Alliance                                               on Mental Illness,                                    Arlington, VA, January 31, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Office of the Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The       National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) writes to urge you       to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to       disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security       Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation       of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule       would require the Social Security Administration to forward       the names of all Social Security and Supplemental Security       Income (SSI) disability beneficiaries who use a       representative payee to help manage their benefits, and who       have been found eligible by meeting or equaling an SSA mental       impairment listing, to the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS).        NAMI is the nation's largest grassroots mental health       organization dedicated to building better lives for the       millions of Americans affected by mental illness, with more       than 1,100 state and local affiliates nationwide. NAMI       recognizes and supports the need to prioritize reducing gun       violence in the U.S. However, we are gravely concerned that       the rule, as adopted, perpetuates unfounded stereotypes about       people with mental illness and other mental disabilities that       have no basis in fact. Moreover, we believe that the rule may       have unintended negative consequences, including deterring       individuals from seeking or receiving help when they need it.        Our specific concerns about the rule are the following:        There is no evidence supporting the proposition that people       who are assigned Representative Payees on the basis of mental       illness or other mental disabilities pose increased risks for       gun violence or threats to public safety;        Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies       to transmit the names of individuals who have been       ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own       affairs, the assignment of a Representative Payee to a       recipient of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social       Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is not equivalent to an       adjudication. Rather, it is a unilateral determination by the       SSA that a person may need help in managing his or her       benefits. There is no hearing, the beneficiary is afforded no       oppornmity to testify or provide evidence why he or she       should not be assigned a Representative Payee, and there are       no other due process protections typically associated with       formal adjudications.        The new rule reinforces unfounded perceptions associating       mental illness and other mental disabilities with violence.       Scientific studies that have assessed risk factors for       violence contain no evidence linking difficulties with       managing benefits with increased risks for violence.        SSI and SSDI provide vital links to medical benefits for       people with mental illness. The rule may deter individuals       from applying for these benefits for fear that their names       will be added to a public database maintained by the FBI.       Without such benefits, access to mental health treatment and       services will be impeded.        Mr. Speaker and Madam Leader, NAMI asserts that the       adoption of this misguided rule in the aftermath of       Congressional adoption of a comprehensive bill to improve       mental health care in America is exactly the wrong step to       take. We therefore urge Congress to act, through the CRA       process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage       it inflicts on people with mental illness and other       disabilities.        Thank you for your prompt attention to these concerns.            Sincerely,                                              Mary Giliberti, J.D.,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                     National Association for Rights                                         Protection and Advocacy,                                   Huntsville, LA, January 31, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       The National Association of Rights Protection and Advocacy       (NARPA) urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA)       resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social       Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016,       ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of       2007.'' NARPA was formed in 1981 to provide education and       advocacy in the mental health arena. Members are attorneys,       people with psychiatric histories, mental health       professionals and administrators, academics, and non-legal       advocates. Central to NARPA's mission is the promotion of       those policies and strategies that represent the preferred       options of people who have been diagnosed with psychiatric       disabilities.        This rule requires the Social Security Administration to       forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance       (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit       recipients who use a representative payee to help manage       their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National       Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The rule is       inconsistent with the statute it implements, has no       evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate       inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental       disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too-      scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the       agency's longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits       applications toward a mission in which the agency has little       expertise.        First, there is no statutory basis for the rule. The       National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)       statute authorizes the reporting of an individual to the NICS       database on the basis of a determination that the person       ``lacks the capacity to contract or manage his own affairs''       as a result of ``marked subnormal intelligence, or mental       illness, incompetency condition or disease.'' The appointment       of a representative payee simply does not meet this standard.       It indicates only that the individual needs help managing       benefits received from SSA.        Second, the rule puts in place an ineffective strategy to       address gun violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis,       targeting individuals with representative payees and mental       impairments as potential perpetrators of gun violence. In       doing so, it also creates a false sense that meaningful       action has been taken to address gun violence and detracts       from potential prevention efforts targeting actual risks for       gun violence.        Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association       of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important       efforts to promote community integration and employment of       people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people       with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or       services, or from applying for financial and medical       assistance programs.        Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA       without providing any additional resources. Implementation of       the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work       of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to       overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are       waiting for months and years for determinations of their       benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to       make the determinations about safety that it would be called       upon to make as part of the relief process established by the       rule.        Based on similar concerns, the National Council on       Disability, an independent federal agency charged with       advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies       regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the       Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge       Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this       new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the       disability community.

NCIL represents people with disabilities, Centers for       Independent Living (CILs), Statewide Independent Living       Councils (SILCs), and other organizations that advocate for       the human and civil rights of people with disabilities       throughout the country.

We--and many other members of CCD--      opposed the rule for a number of reasons, including:        The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database.

NDLA is a national cross-disability coalition that       represents the authentic voice of people with disabilities.       NDLA is led by 14 national organizations run by people with       disabilities with identifiable grassroots constituencies       around the country. The NDLA steering committee includes:       ADAPT, the American Association of People with Disabilities,       the American Council of the Blind, the Association of       Programs for Rural Independent Living, the Autistic Self       Advocacy Network, the Hearing Loss Association of America,       Little People of America, the National Association of the       Deaf, the National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery, the       National Council on Independent Living, the National       Federation of the Blind, the National Organization of Nurses       with Disabilities, Not Dead Yet, Self Advocates Becoming       Empowered, and the United Spinal Association.        Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, NDLA conveyed its       opposition to the rule through letters to Vice President       Biden, to President Obama, and to Congress. NDLA members also       raised concerns through letters to the Obama Administration       and through the public comment process.

Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Office of the Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: On behalf       of thousands of New Yorkers with psychiatric disabilities,       the New York Association of Psychiatric Rehabilitation       Services (NYAPRS) urges you to support a Congressional Review       Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by       the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19,       2016, ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act       of 2007.''        By way of reference, NYAPRS is a 36 year old statewide       coalition that has brought together New Yorkers with       psychiatric disabilities and community recovery providers to       advance policies, programs and social conditions that advance       recovery, rehabilitation, rights and community inclusion.        This rule would require the Social Security Administration       to forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance       (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit       recipients who use a representative payee to help manage       their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National       Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).        The rule is inconsistent with the statute it implements,       has no evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate       inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental       disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too-      scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the       agency's longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits       applications toward a mission in which the agency has little       expertise.        First, there is no statutory basis for the rule. The       National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)       statute authorizes the reporting of an individual to the NICS       database on the basis of a determination that the person       ``lacks the capacity to contract or manage his own affairs''       as a result of ``marked subnormal intelligence, or mental       illness, incompetency condition or disease.'' The appointment       of a representative payee simply does not meet this standard.       It indicates only that the individual needs help managing       benefits received from SSA. Second, the rule puts in place an       ineffective strategy to address gun violence, devoid of any       evidentiary basis, targeting individuals with representative       payees and mental impairments as potential perpetrators of       gun violence. In doing so, it also creates a false sense that       meaningful action has been taken to address gun violence and       detracts from potential prevention efforts targeting actual       risks for gun violence.        Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association       of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important       efforts to promote community integration and employment of       people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people       with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or       services, or from applying for financial and medical       assistance programs.        Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA       without providing any additional resources. Implementation of       the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work       of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to       overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are       waiting for months and years for determinations of their       benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to       make the determinations about safety that it would be called       upon to make as part of the relief process established by the       rule.        Based on similar concerns, the National Council on       Disability, an independent federal agency charged with       advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies       regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the       Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge       Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this       new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the       disability community.        Please feel free to contact me at any time.            Sincerely,                                                  Harvey Rosenthal,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                        Safari Club International,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2017.      Re Safari Club International Support for House Joint           Resolution 40.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: Safari Club       International (Safari Club) supports House Joint Resolution       40, which provides for Congressional disapproval under the       Congressional Review Act of the final rule submitted by the       Social Security Administration (SSA) relating to       ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of       2007,'' adopted on December 19, 2016, 81 Fed. Reg. 91702.        Safari Club seeks Congressional disapproval of the rule for       several reasons. It deprives an individual of the ability to       receive or possess a firearm, including for recreational       hunting, due to that individual's inability to manage his or       her financial affairs (Firearms Rule). Under the Firearms       Rule, the prohibition would apply when the SSA designates a       representative payee because of the individual's mental       impairment. A mental impairment that makes an individual       incapable of handling his/her financial affairs does not       necessarily equate to an inability to properly abide by the       law in the use of firearms. The Firearms Rule unfairly       attributes illegal conduct to law abiding citizens.        In addition, the Firearms Rule fails in its attempt to       rectify its unfair treatment of individuals with mental       impairments through its program for individuals to request       relief from Federal Firearms prohibitions. This program       places on the individual with a mental impairment the costly       and burdensome task of collecting and presenting data to       overcome the presumption that he or she is incapable of       abiding by the law. This program forces upon law-abiding       citizens the task of confronting a federal bureaucracy just       to prove that they should not be unfairly treated as a       criminal due to a mental impairment.        For these reasons, Safari Club supports a joint resolution       stating ``that Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the       Social Security Administration relating to Implementation of       the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, and such rule       shall have no force or effect.''            Sincerely,                                                     Larry Higgins,                              President, Safari Club International.
