 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4790, the  Volcker Rule Regulatory Harmonization Act. I appreciate the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) for his leadership on this issue.   At over 930 pages, section 619 of Dodd-Frank, otherwise known as the  Volcker rule, is as lengthy as it is complex and confusing. The Volcker  rule is framed as a solution to a problem that never existed in the  first place. Right now there are five different agencies responsible  for overseeing the implementation of the Volcker rule. These five  agencies all have different legal mandates and regulatory missions,  which have led to duplicate and concurrent reviews into U.S. banks.   In the 25th District of Texas, community banks are struggling to get  by and wonder why they have five different regulators knocking on their  doors about the same issue. Only in Washington would that kind of  backwards thinking be rewarded.   H.R. 4790 would streamline regulatory authority over the Volcker rule  by giving the Federal Reserve exclusive rulemaking authority. In other  words, banks won't have five different regulators coming to them about  the same regulation. As a result, Main Street will be able to breathe  again.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this: This is a commonsense way of  governing that we should see more of in this Chamber. I am proud to  support this piece of legislation that passed the committee with wide  bipartisan support just last month, and I encourage the whole House to  vote in favor of it today.   Now, we have had a lot of quotes. I have a quote. ``Business is good  and business is getting better. H.R. 4790 moves our economy to new  levels like we have never seen in years. Roger Williams, small business  owner. Thank you very much.''
