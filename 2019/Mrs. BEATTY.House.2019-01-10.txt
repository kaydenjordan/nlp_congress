 Madam Speaker, I rise today on the 20th day of the Trump  shutdown, and I can only shake my head and ask why.   Why are 400,000 public servants being denied the opportunity to do  their jobs?   Why are 420,000 more working without pay, many of them who put  themselves in harm's way?   Why are 1.6 million Ohioans at risk of losing their SNAP benefits?   Why are first-time home buyers being kept from their new homes?   There is only one answer to those questions: Because Trump insists on  wasting $5 billion of the people's tax dollars on a vanity wall, a wall  that will do little to address illegal immigration.   Democrats are for the people. Democrats want to protect our borders  and reopen our government and put government workers back to work.   I urge the Senate to take up the bills that the House has passed and  put our government back to work. Let's end this ridiculous shutdown.                            ____________________
