 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   I respect the intent of the author of this amendment, Mr. McClintock,  who I respect very much. I agree with his desire to cut wasteful  government programs, but we have a fundamental disagreement on the  value of this program.   Speaking for my community, and I do represent Lancaster Airport, this  service allows my constituents to connect with Pittsburgh and other  major airports where they can link with routes to take them across the  country.   Every dollar invested into the program yields a great return.  Lancaster Airport is the third busiest airport in Pennsylvania, behind  Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. This is an important link to keep it a  strong commercial hub and to service our community.   EAS also serves 172 airports across the country. If this amendment  gets adopted, many of those communities would lose their airports.  Losing EAS eligibility would not only disconnect communities in rural  areas from the national air service, but it would also have a ripple  economic effect.   Again, I commend the author of this, and I commend the chairman for  the changes that have been made to this program. It is important that  we keep it.                                time  1545
