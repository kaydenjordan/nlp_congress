 Thank you, Mr. President.   I appreciate the majority leader allowing us to do this.   To the present Presiding Officer, thank you very much for trying to  fix a difficult problem called immigration.   I am going to start with what drives my train the most. I want to fix  a broken immigration system. There are 700,000, 800,000 DACA recipients  who are going to go into chaos on March 5 if we don't do something.   As to the President, I think you were right to end this program and  to give Congress the chance to fix it through the legislative process.  I thought President Obama overreached through Executive action. You  said March 5, we are going to replace DACA with legislation. The only  way that works, Mr. President, is for you to help us and lead us to the  right answer.   The one thing I can tell you that drives my train the most is  rebuilding a broken military. We have an opportunity here to fix these  problems: help the men and women in the military who have suffered  mightily from sequestration, to get them more money at a time when they  need it; to provide certainty to 800,000 young people who have no other  country to call home than America; again, to repair a broken border,  start transforming a broken immigration system, and marching to  comprehensive reform in phase two.   The reason I am here tonight is I see an opportunity to do something  we should have done years ago--increase defense spending consistent  with the threats we face.   Here is what Defense Secretary Mattis said on June 12, 2017: ``No  enemy in the field has done more to harm the combat readiness of our  military than sequestration.'' Congress has shot down more planes and  sunk more ships by denying the military the assets they need to build  new equipment, to replace old equipment, to keep people in the field in  the fight, and other people trained and ready to go in the fight.   General Milley, the Chief of Staff of the Army, said: If we return to  sequestration, the Army will be required ``to draw down end-strength  even further, reduce funding for readiness, and increase the risk of  sending under-trained and poorly equipped Soldiers into harm's way.''  So this is the head of the Army saying: If we can't get our act  together and increase military funding in a more permanent way, if we  go back into sequestration, you are requiring me to increase the risk  of sending undertrained and poorly equipped soldiers into harm's way.  If that doesn't motivate you, what will?   General Goldfein said: ``[P]ermanent relief from the Budget Control  Act--with predictability funding--is absolutely critical to rebuilding  Air Force capability, capacity, and readiness.'' We have lost a lot of  capacity. Our readiness is at an alltime low because we are having to  rob Peter to pay Paul to keep the planes in the air in the Air Force.   Navy Secretary Spencer said on October 28: The ``Budget Control Act  and cap sequestration has cost us between $4 and $5 billion dollars due  to the starting and stopping of acquisition programs, the inability to  start programs.''   I could go through line by line what has happened under  sequestration. Sixty-two percent of the F/A-18s in the Marine Corps and  the Navy can't fly because we don't have enough spare parts. We have a  chance here to fix that problem.   To my Democratic colleagues, I am convinced you care about this too.  I am convinced you will work with President Trump to increase military  funding.   To the majority leader, Senator McConnell, I want to thank him for  putting a number on the table consistent with the problems we face in  the military. It is $130 billion over 2 years.   To my Democratic friends, I do expect you to get some nondefense  spending increases because sequestration has hurt across the board. The  NIH has been kept alive because of bipartisan efforts. The FBI will  have less agents this year than they did in 2013 because of  sequestration. The CIA, the NSA, all of these defense programs under  the nondefense portion of the budget have suffered, and they need help  too.   What I would like to do is to ask the Congress to stop the s-show and  grow up. Act consistent with the greatness of this country. Find a way  to work together on the layup.   If you are looking for political cover to deal with increased  military funding, 70 percent-plus of the people believe we would need  more military funding. If you are looking for political cover to deal  with the DACA population, 82 percent of the public supports a pathway  to citizenship for the DACA population. I can't find too many issues  that poll like that.   This is a FOX News poll, which means it is true: 79 percent of  Americans and 63 percent of Trump voters favor granting citizenship to  illegal immigrants under 30 who were brought here as children. Sixty- three percent of Trump voters understand that we need border security,  but they have no animosity toward these young people who came here at  the age of 6, on average, and literally have lived their lives here  with no place else to go.   Here is the good news. We would be crazy to want them to leave. If  you have met any of these Dream Act kids, the last thing you would want  them to do is to leave. There are bad people in every population. There  are 900 people in the population of Dream Act, or DACA, kids who are in  the military, and there are 20,000 teachers. So on March 5, I don't  want someone to have to deal with the fact that a fifth-grade teacher  who everybody likes has to leave the country. That is insane.   I know my Democratic colleagues will support more defense funding  with the understanding that the Congress, through legislation, deals  with the DACA problem. They are willing to put money into the system  for border security. They are willing to make a down payment on  changing our immigration system to more merit based.   At the end of the day, there is a deal to be had. It just needs to be  done. The  [[Page S257]]  reason this bipartisan group that I am a part of came about is because  nobody was doing much of anything. I am not getting in anybody's way.  We have had months to figure out what to do. Just a couple of weeks  ago--less than a couple of weeks ago--the four whips of the House and  the Senate began to work on this. To be honest with you, that is a bit  late.   As for the President, we can't do this without you. This was one of  the centerpieces of your campaign--immigration. President Obama tried  and failed, and I appreciate his effort. President Bush tried and  failed, and I appreciate what he did. I worked with both of them across  the aisle to pass bills that went through the Senate with 60-plus  votes, to only go to the House and die. I am tired of that scenario.   To my House colleagues, I know this is tough politics for you. But if  President Trump can find a way to lead us to a solution, I think it  will allow the House to finally act.   On Tuesday, we had an unusual meeting with the President of the  United States for about 40 Members of the House and the Senate, from  both sides of the aisle, and we spent 55 minutes on national TV,  watching President Trump listen, cajole, and urge us to find a  bipartisan solution. This is what he said Tuesday:         This should be a bill of love. Truly, it should be a bill       of love and we can do that. . . . But it also has to be a       bill where we are able to secure our border.    You are right, Mr. President, security and compassion are not  inconsistent. As a matter of fact, you cannot have one without the  other. Let's do phase one and go to comprehensive tomorrow. He urged us  to come up with a bipartisan product, and he wants to sign it.   President Trump on Tuesday showed a command of issues, the right  approach to a difficult problem, urging us to work together in a  bipartisan fashion. He talked about security being essential, but he  understood that compassion and love have to be part of this because  these kids literally have no place to go. They have put their roots  down in America. They were brought here by their parents. I don't  believe President Trump wants to kick them out March 5.   To my friends at the White House, on January 4, we had a meeting of  Republicans with the President, and I went over the bipartisan proposal  that I was working on with Senators Durbin, Gardner, Flake, Bennet,  and, later, Senator Menendez. Nobody was surprised as to what we were  doing. I said: This is a good position to start from. Can it be made  better? Yes.   Senators Tillis and Lankford have the SUCCEED Act. We met with them,  and I think we adopted a lot of their good ideas. So at the end of the  day, the Dream Act by Senators Graham and Durbin became more like the  SUCCEED Act.   On Thursday at about 10, I get a phone call from Senator Durbin: I  just talked to the President to let him know that we have reached an  agreement.   On January 4, I said: We are 99 percent there.   Senator Durbin called me and said: I had a good conversation with the  President. He wants to hear what we have done. He is encouraged by it.  I made a request to go to the White House.   General Kelly came over at about 11. I went through the proposal,  which had been shared numerous times, and he said: What about this?  What about that?   I said: It is all about getting the process started. General Kelly,  we are not going to get comprehensive on our side for DACA. We are not  going to give 11 million legal status and hope that someday we will  deal with border security and merit-based immigration. We have to have  a phase one that is a down payment on all four areas outlined by the  President.   By the time we got there, at noon, there were more people at the  meeting, and all I can say is that what happened between Tuesday and  Thursday, I don't know, and between 10 and 12, I don't know, but it  took us in the wrong direction.   The President whom I saw on Tuesday is the man who can close this  deal and lead this country to get an answer that Obama and Bush could  never get. We are where we are.   To my good friend, Senator Perdue: I share your desire to replace  chain migration with merit-based immigration. One day we will have a  system where the nuclear family gets green cards, which will free up  millions of green cards for a workforce we desperately need. The only  way you will get that is to deal with the Democrats and give them what  they are wanting out of this deal. They are not going to give us what  we want the most--which is legal immigration, a secure border, and a  merit-based immigration system, based on DACA--and let me tell you why.  What leverage would they have with the 10 million illegal immigrants  that they would like to see have a better life, too? Almost none.   To my colleagues on the other side, from the very first day that I  sat down and talked to you, what did I tell you? I have no animosity  toward the 11 million. I just don't want any crooks or bad people.  Let's get them right with the law. Let's transition to a system where  we do not do this every 20 years. Let's secure our border, increase  legal immigration, have an E-Verify system that works, and put people  in jail who are illegals in the future. Let's give the 11 million who  can come out of the shadows and are not criminals a chance to get right  with the law, by paying a fine, passing the English proficiency exam  over time, getting at the back of the line of the country where they  come from, and 10 years later they can apply for a green card--a  pathway to citizenship that I think could be earned.   How did 11 million people get here? They did not sneak up on us. If  you know anything about the economy in South Carolina, there is a lot  of tourism, and it is a heavy service industry. If you go to a golf  course in South Carolina, you will see beautiful golf courses  maintained by good people, and you are going to see mostly Hispanics.  If you go to a meatpacking plant in South Carolina, you are going to  see people doing a job you wouldn't want, making a decent living,  working really hard, and most of them are Hispanic.   How did this happen? Most of us looked the other way as people came  to our country trying to better their lives--some crooks, some rapists,  some drug dealers, but mostly really good people trying to improve  their lot in life. All that I ask is that we fix this system once and  for all so we don't have a third wave 20 years from now but that we  deal with the reality that these people are here, and they have been  here for a long time. And America always needs good people--not just  from Norway but from all over the world.   We need a reliable partner at the White House. General Kelly I admire  greatly. He lost his son in service to our Nation. He has been leading  Marines in combat for decades. He is new to being chief of staff. He  did a heck of a job creating order out of chaos. But at that meeting,  he said something I take exception to: You have got to stop fiddling.   General Kelly, as much as I admire you, for 10 years I and many  others in this body have been trying to find a way forward to fix an  immigration system that is broken, to turn it into a merit-based  immigration system over time, to get the 11 million right with the law,  to increase legal immigration so employers don't have to cheat, and to  make our Nation better and stronger. So I haven't been fiddling.   What I asked the White House is this: Find out what you are for. I  can't read your mind.   This proposal just picked up support from more Republicans. We didn't  write the Bible, but we gave the President his funding for fiscal year  2018 for the wall and security outside the wall. I don't believe we are  going to get $10 billion or $20 billion funded in 1 year. I don't think  that is possible.   We begin to break chain migration within the DACA population. We  limit green cards to nuclear families, which is a down payment on a  merit-based immigration system. We eliminate the diversity lottery  because it is a bad way to give out visas, and we took those 50,000  visas and said: Why don't we do the following: Create a merit-based  program for underserved countries, which are mostly in Africa. Here is  what I believe: merit-based immigration all over the world, not just in  Europe.   What has made us special and unique is that we come from everywhere.  We are nobodies where we came from, and we can be a somebody here.  [[Page S258]]    I have said a couple of times, and I will say it again: Norway is a  great place. If your are from Norway, you are a Norwegian. If you are  from America, what are you? You will not know us by the way we look.  You will not know us by the way we talk, because Dick Durbin has an  accent. We talk differently, we look differently, but we have a lot in  common, and out of the many we have become one.   In an effort to decide who comes to America in the future and to fix  a broken immigration system, one thing I will never give in to is  changing what it means to be an American. There are people from all  over the globe dying to get here. We can't accept everybody, but we  need to make sure that, as we go forward in the future, we do not  forget our past.   Out of every country all over the globe, we have created something  special here. Everybody has a story. My grandfather came from Scotland,  Lindsey Graham, and could barely read or write. Neither one of my  parents finished high school. And I am in the Senate, thanks to the  good people of South Carolina. Everybody has a story. I don't want  those stories to end. I want new chapters, one after another.   So to the President, what I saw Tuesday was a man that understood  what America was all about, a leader who understood that bipartisanship  must occur and understood that love and security are not mutually  exclusive. What I find today is complete chaos.   To think that our Democratic colleagues are going to give us  everything we want on the fence and hope that one day we will deal with  the DACA population is a bit unrealistic--and count me in for being on  your side there. I don't want to put these kids through any more hell.  I don't want to wait until March 4. I want to go ahead and get it done  now. We should have done it years ago.   I want to get a down payment on border security and change our  immigration system, but we can't do it all at once, because everybody  tells me comprehensive will not work. So let's figure out a way to chop  it up in two parts. You have to start somewhere.   So here we are, trying to figure out what the hell to do. Let me tell  you what we should do. We should listen to the American people. We  should do what they want us to do, which is to take care of the DACA  population, rebuild the military, and start fixing the broken  immigration system.   If we just did what 70 percent of the American people want us to do,  we would have figured this out. As to the 30 percent, you have your  right to think what you want. Along with other Republicans, I have been  called every name under the Sun, and I am still standing. There are  people who will never let us get to yes because they have an irrational  view of what it takes to fix this system.   There are voices in the White House that we all know very well that  have been telling us for years: You have too much legal immigration,  and everything is amnesty. Don't listen to that voice or those voices  because if you do, you are going to be right where Obama and Bush were.  They tried, and they failed.   We don't have the luxury of failing anymore. March 5 will be here  before you know it. I am not going to sit on the sidelines and watch  these young DACA recipients have their lives turned upside down,  because we are better than that as a nation. Equally but more  importantly, I am not going to go any longer in allowing sequestration  to destroy the military at a time we need it the most.   Look through the eyes of a soldier, and you will find out what to do  on the military. Look through the eyes of a DACA recipient, and you  will find out what to do there. Don't be blinded by loud voices and  hateful people.   We owe it to this great Nation to fix hard problems. We owe it to  those who are in the fight to give them the equipment they need to win  a war we can't afford to lose. We owe it to the families of military  members to have more certainty, not to be deployed so much. We owe it  to ourselves to get these DACA kids right with the law because they  will add value to our country.   To my Democratic colleagues, now is the time. Give us the space.   To my Republican colleagues, this is a defining moment for our party.  Are we going to continue to be the party that can't get to yes? Are we  going to continue to be the party that always has a reason not to do  DACA, or are we going to be the party that finally realizes that these  young men and women add value to our country and we welcome them with  open arms and that they have to work to stay and they will?   To the defense hawks, the only way you are going to get your money is  to deal with immigration rationally.   Senator Durbin, we don't agree on a lot. I bet if you looked at our  votes, we are 90 percent one way versus the other. But for 10 years,  you have been a very good partner on comprehensive immigration reform.  You have given. You have made people mad on your side.   To those who think they are going to deal Senator Durbin out, you  know zero about this issue.   To Senator Menendez, you know the story of America better than I do  because your family came here because they had to. America allowed you  to leave a place that was horrible, and, boy, is that a great  experiment in how things can turn out well. You cancel out my vote most  of the time, but I appreciate your being here in this body trying to  find a way forward for future immigrants. Your voice on this issue has  meant a lot to me because I have not walked in your shoes.   Senator Bennet, thank you for being calm when a lot of us get hot.  Thank you for caring about the meatpackers because that is important to  Colorado. Thank you for trying to push your party to yes.   To the people who have worked with me in the past on the Democratic  side, some may say you have given nothing. I think you have given a  good bit. I think we have too.   Senator Flake, you are from Arizona. You and Senator McCain know this  issue better than I do. He knows what it takes to secure the border,  but he also understands the benefit of illegal immigration being fixed  for the good of the country.   Senator Gardner, I didn't know you much at all. You are the NRC  chairman trying to make sure we hold on to this body, and, God, I hope  we do--nothing personal, but I hope we do. I am amazed at how strong  you have been. You have been under a tremendous amount of pressure to  get out of this dealmaking business, and you have withstood that  pressure. The people of Colorado should be very proud of you and  Senator Bennet. We don't agree on a lot, but on this, you have been  champions.   To the other people who came on board supporting the concept, the  proposal, either in totality or the idea that we need to move forward,  on my side of the aisle, I cannot thank you more. The well is pretty  poisoned.   To the White House, I want to help you, but you have to help  yourself. There is a way to do business around here that has stood the  test of time. There are some things that will hurt you over time. When  people want to help you--you may not agree with them, but you know they  want to help you--take the help. When people disagree with you,  understand there is always tomorrow.   To President Trump, you won the election. You beat me. Only you,  quite frankly, Mr. President, can fix this problem because you have  credibility others don't. Don't let this moment pass. Don't take us  backward; take us forward.   Thank you all for trying really hard for a long period of time to do  the right thing.   With that, I yield.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Illinois.
