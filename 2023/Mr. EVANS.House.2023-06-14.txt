 Madam Speaker, America is experiencing a gun violence  epidemic, both in mass shootings and everyday gun violence.   More and more of our fellow Americans have to deal with mental health  and physical injury in the aftermath of shootings. In many cases, they  come out of the hospital with long-lasting disabilities.   The residents in my hometown of Philadelphia have become much too  familiar with gun violence. In a poll taken 6 months ago, two-thirds of  residents reported having heard gunshots in their neighborhoods.   Over Memorial Day weekend alone, 32 people were shot in Philadelphia.  Seven of them died, including a 16-year-old boy. Those 32 families are  changed forever.   The toll of gun violence on the victims is enormous. It is emotional,  mental, and financial. It is not just borne by those who are shot but  also by family and friends, as well as witnesses, first responders, and  countless others.   I believe in prevention. That is why I signed the discharge petitions  for the three gun safety bills. I also believe in helping those who  have already been affected.    We are becoming a nation of victims and survivors. As a country, we  must not forget those who are struggling in the aftermath of gun  violence. That is why I, along with Senator Casey, introduced the  Resources for Victims of Gun Violence Act, H.R. 3962. This bill would  create a council to assess the resources that are available and  determine how we can ensure victims are getting the assistance they  need.  [[Page H2894]]    It is important for all of us to realize that this affects everyone,  that we must address this question of violence and must not take it for  granted. It can affect any family throughout this Nation, and it is  important that we do all that we can to send a message that this is  just not acceptable.   Surely, we all agree on helping victims of crimes. The time to help  victims is now. We must help victims. We must send a message that this  is unacceptable, no matter where we live, no matter where we are, no  matter where in this Nation.   For the victims who are being affected, we must rise up and send a  message that this behavior is no longer accepted. It will take us all  working together to make a difference.   I share with you, Madam Speaker, that it is important during this  moment, like never before, that we come together and focus. No matter  what city, no matter what State, no matter where in the United States,  it is unacceptable.                            ____________________
