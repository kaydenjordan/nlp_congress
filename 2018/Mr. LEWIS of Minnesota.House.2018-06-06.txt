 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, let me start by thanking my  colleague from Pennsylvania, the chairman of our committee, for his  leadership in getting this bill to the floor.   The U.S. Army Corps plays a pivotal role in the transportation of all  of our goods and services in the United States. They are tasked with  maintaining navigation channels in our most active and commercial  waterways. Unfortunately, carrying out this important work brings about  challenges my constituents know all too well.   Last spring, the Corps released a 40-year dredged material management  plan in an effort to identify placement sites for almost 11 million  cubic yards of dredged material. Regrettably, the proposal was drafted  by bureaucrats in Washington with very little community input.   Without knowledge of the local impact, the Federal plan would take  300 acres of pristine land from a third generation family farm, 30  acres in a residential neighborhood in my district, as well as 73 acres  from a farm in Congressman Kind's district.   My own family lost their business through condemnation, so I am  acutely aware of the damage the eminent domain process can sometimes  have on families and communities. After several discussions with the  Corps and letters from myself, they agreed that more public comment was  needed and that a better solution may possibly exist.   I was pleased that the Corps scheduled several public meetings on the  topic, and that the Corps worked with us to extend the open comment  period several times. This process proved successful, and a number of  innovative and thoughtful alternatives were submitted for  consideration.   Yesterday, the St. Paul District Office of the Army Corps and the  city of Wabasha, Minnesota, signed a memorandum of understanding for  this 40-year plan. The memorandum of understanding describes a process  by which the Corps can use existing authorities to collaborate with a  non-Federal entity in order to allow for greater flexibility of  material placement.   This proposal has the support of the district office, our local  community, and the State of Minnesota. It is also environmentally  friendly, as it could allow the dredged material to be used in a manner  that benefits society, rather than taking up space on a pristine  farmland. It also spreads the burden of a public benefit to everyone  who benefits.   My amendment encourages the Army Corps' headquarters to fully  consider this alternative plan, and alternatives like this, in the  future. In its history, the Corps has rarely approved innovative plans  such as this. Federal, local, and private partnerships are something  that we should encourage, instead of putting roadblocks in the way.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I ask that the Army Corps fully consider inventive, but effective  projects across the country it would affect.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4836]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.
