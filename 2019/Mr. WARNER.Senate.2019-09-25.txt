 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here today because our elections are  still not secured against the threat of foreign interference.   After 3 years of our intelligence community, our congressional  committees, and some of our closest allies sounding the alarm about  foreign election interference, we are right back here where we started  because this body has failed to act. To me, it is pretty remarkable.   No one in this body would think that the appropriate protections  against foreign interference into our power grid should be a partisan  issue. No one would advance a theory that protecting our financial  system against foreign cyber attacks should be a partisan issue. So why  would anyone think or allow the basic protections of the machinery and  system of our most essential component of our democracy, our voting  system, in any way to become a partisan issue? My hope is we can avoid  that.   Some may point to the fact that additional money has been  appropriated for State and local election authorities, funds that have  been used to upgrade part of our election infrastructure. I am proud to  have been part of the initial efforts to secure these funds ahead of  the 2018 elections, and I am genuinely supportive of additional funding  to secure the 2020 elections. But we need to make one thing absolutely  clear. Additional funding for election security is a necessary part of  securing our elections, but it is not a sufficient defense against  foreign attacks on our democracy. Money alone will not solve this  problem.   Moreover, the funding we are talking about in the CR comes with no  guidance or direction for State and local election officials. Listen, I  have no interest in trying to federalize what has traditionally been a  State and local function, but it is absolutely a tradition that this  body sometimes makes voluntary Federal funding available only to  jurisdictions that meet certain criteria or guidelines. The truth is,  right now, with no guidelines, if a State or locality wants to use  these so-called election security funds to upgrade their machines or  systems to the latest, more secure models, they can do that. But they  can also buy machinery and equipment that lacks proper security  features--that could lack a paper ballot backup. Heck, they could even  use these funds to buy the ``vote here'' signs and those stickers we  all proudly wear on election day.   The truth, unfortunately, is that the problem is not with our State  and local election officials. In fact, the decentralized nature of our  local elections system is actually one of our best defenses against  election interference.   The problem is not a lack of policy solutions. Frankly, I think a lot  of us on both sides of the aisle, including very good work by folks  like the Presiding Officer, know exactly what we need to do to secure  our election infrastructure.   We need a voter-verified paper trail for every vote. Everyone should  have the confidence that no matter where they vote in America--God  forbid, if there were ever a hack into a machine or a machine doesn't  work--there is a paper ballot backup so that every vote will be  accurately counted.   We need to make sure, as well, just as in any major operation, that  we have postelection audits.   We can and must do more to secure our voter registration systems.  None of this is Democrat, and none of this is Republican; it is about  the integrity and mechanics of how Americans vote. The problem is the  lack of political will in the U.S. Senate and the lack of interest from  the White House to actually secure our elections.   The truth is, until the majority leader allows this kind of  bipartisan election security legislation to proceed, our elections will  remain vulnerable to manipulation by foreign actors. I also firmly  believe that these bipartisan bills--which, for example, Senator  Lankford has been one of the leaders on--would get 75 or 80 votes even  in our divided Senate.   You don't have to take my word on the nature of the threat. Every one  of our intelligence agencies is continuing to warn us that Russia will  be back in 2020, and we are running out of time to do something about  it. As a matter of fact, Robert Mueller, who led the special counsel's  investigation efforts, testified under oath that Russia is attempting  to undermine the 2020 elections ``as we sit here.''   For almost 3 years, Senators from both parties have worked on  legislation to make sure we are ready for the threats our democracy  will face in 2020--both from Russia, and unfortunately from other bad  actors who are adapting Russia's playbook because they saw how  successful Russia was in 2016. They were both successful in a  relatively inexpensive way to disrupt our system and, in many ways, to  pit us against each other. Yet the Senate has not brought up a single  piece of election security legislation--not a single vote, not a single  markup.   (Mr. LANKFORD assumed the Chair.)   The bills we are proposing are largely bipartisan. We are talking  about straightforward, low-hanging fruit that in normal times would  have overwhelming, if not unanimous, support. We need to pass  legislation that secures our election infrastructure with the tools I  just laid out: paper ballots, post-election audits, and enhanced cyber  security for election systems.   We are saying that the Department of Homeland Security and local  election officials should be able to talk to each other in a classified  setting so they can know the threats they are facing. We are saying  that if local election officials have reason to suspect that a serious  cyber security incident has occurred, they need to alert the  appropriate Federal officials and, if true, appropriate congressional  officials need to know as well.   I also believe we need online ads to follow the same rules as TV,  radio, and print advertisement. If you are seeing an election ad that  was produced or bought in St. Petersburg and paid for in rubles, I  think Americans have a right to know. We are saying that if  [[Page S5680]]  Russia attacks our elections again--or any other foreign power--they  should immediately face sanctions. Of all things, you would think the  President would be willing to punch back against an attack on the  sovereignty and integrity of the U.S. electoral system.   Finally, we are saying that if a foreign party reaches out to your  campaign offering dirt on a fellow American, the appropriate response  is not to say thank you; the appropriate response is to call the FBI.  The DHS motto, ``If you see something, say something,'' needs to apply  in terms of interference in our Presidential elections.   The truth is, what happened in 2016 will happen again in 2020 if we  are not prepared. That is why we cannot allow election security to  become a partisan issue. I spent a lot of time working with my  Republican colleagues on these bills. I want to particularly recognize  the Presiding Officer, who has really been one of if not the leading  voice on these bipartisan efforts to secure elections. I know he has  been working relentlessly to find a way to help get this legislation to  the floor, and I thank him because these are commonsense, substantive  proposals that will make our democracy more secure against foreign  attack.   We should hold hearings, if necessary, offer amendments, and vote on  this critical legislation while we still have time. That is what we  were sent here to do, and that is what we must do if we are going to  secure our democracy in 2020.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, I want to turn to protections for people with  preexisting medical conditions because these protections are under  threat by this President.   Under the pretext of so-called short-term plans, the Trump  administration is pushing healthcare plans that, once again, allow  insurance companies to discriminate against Americans based on their  medical history. These skinny plans--or I refer to them as ``junk  plans''--also undermine the Affordable Care Act's requirements that  insurance cover things like emergency room visits, maternity care, and  other essential benefits.   Let me be clear. The reason this market has suddenly been flooded  with these junk plans--in many cases advertising in low-income markets  that these are ACA or ObamaCare plans--is not because Congress passed  any law. The President tried and failed twice to pass legislation  ending these protections for folks with preexisting conditions. Since  they couldn't get their way in Congress, now they are using Executive  action to try to undermine the Affordable Care Act.   I have introduced a resolution under the Congressional Review Act  which would stop this deliberative effort to destabilize the health  insurance market and weaken protections that Americans count on. Today  I am filing a discharge petition so that it will bring this resolution  to the Senate floor for an up-or-down vote. The truth is, every Member  of this body knows someone--either in their family or close relatives-- with a preexisting condition. The fact is, many Members themselves have  preexisting conditions. In Virginia alone, more than 1 million people  live with preexisting conditions.   Before the Affordable Care Act, an insurance company had every right  to deny these individuals coverage, charge them unaffordable premiums,  or when they got that condition, terminate their plan. I think we all  agree we can't go back to those days. The administration knows  perfectly well that these junk plans don't offer real benefits. They  have been warned repeatedly by hundreds of patient groups, physicians,  hospitals, and insurance, including the American Heart Association,  AARP, the American Academy of Pediatrics--just to name a few of the  organizations that have come out against these plans. All of these  stakeholders are telling us the same thing: The Trump administration's  plan will weaken consumer protections and disproportionately hurt sick  and older Americans.    My Republican colleagues insist that they actually support  protections for folks with preexisting conditions. OK. With this CRA, I  think there is a chance to prove it. This resolution we are introducing  today will force an up-or-down vote on these junk plans that explicitly  undermine protections for preexisting conditions. If my colleagues  truly support these protections, they should vote yes. It is that  simple. Instead of abiding or going along with the administration's  effort to undermine the stability of the healthcare market, let's not  do that. Let's go back to the ACA. Let's look at fixes where there were  mistakes made. Let's look at how we can work together on better access  to Affordable Care Act. I serve on the committee, and I know the  Finance Committee has taken, I think, at least a first step--I hope  there will be more--in terms of putting some reasonable constraints on  drug prices. It is not fair or right that Americans pay more for drugs  than anyone else in the world and, in a sense, subsidize the R&D for  the whole world.   There are a host of areas where we can find agreement. Let's make  sure the one part of the ACA that I think everyone agreed to was this  notion that folks with preexisting conditions should not be  discriminated against. I think the CRA would allow the Senate to go on  record on this critically important issue. I look forward to the  opportunity to have this voted on and debated when we come back from  the break.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
