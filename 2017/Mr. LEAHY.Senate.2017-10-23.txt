 Mr. President, let me just speak for a few minutes on the  emergency supplemental appropriations for disasters.   No one in this Chamber is immune from disaster. Six years ago, I  remember, in Vermont, Marcelle and I watched as communities around  Vermont felt the devastating impact of Tropical Storm Irene. That storm  washed away entire communities in our State, tearing down homes, local  landmarks, and bridges alike. I watched the devastation from a  helicopter with the Governor and the head of our National Guard the day  after the storm hit. I saw bridges washed away. The only way we could  get into the towns was by helicopter because all of the roads were gone  that led into them. I saw homes that had been on the north side of a  river that were now upside down and destroyed on the south side of the  river.   Do you know the one thing that occurred to me as I traveled around  the State of Vermont? It is that I had heard from my fellow Senators,  both Republicans and Democrats, saying that they would help us rebuild.  I had heard the same thing from the President of the United States.  They stood by Vermont's side to help us rebuild--again, Republicans and  Democrats alike--because that is who we are as Americans. We lift each  other up in times of disaster. We are one country.   Today, in California and across the West, families are returning to  the charred ruins of their homes--those who were able to get out alive.  In Florida and Texas, communities are trying to put their lives back  together after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma--again, those who were able  to get out alive. In Puerto Rico, hundreds of thousands are still  without potable water, electricity, cell service, or adequate medical  supplies following Hurricane Maria. The Virgin Islands are also facing  devastation that I can never remember. Millions of Americans all over  the country, as well as the Americans in Puerto Rico and the Americans  in the Virgin Islands, need us to work together to help lift them up,  just as we have seen in past disasters. This is not a Republican or a  Democratic issue; this is an American issue. This is who we are as a  country. We hold together.   I have been privileged to serve here since the time of President  Ford. In times of disaster, I have seen every single President,  Republican and Democrat, work to help Americans and do it out of  concern for Americans, not for themselves. That is why it is so  disappointing that President Trump  [[Page S6704]]  seems more concerned with claiming credit for a job well done than the  actual situation on the ground deserves, particularly in Puerto Rico.  President Trump has given himself a 10 out of 10 as though this were a  game show for the administration's response to the devastating  hurricane, but let's look at some numbers that really matter for the  people who have lost everything.   It has been 48 days since Hurricane Irma made landfall in Puerto Rico  and 34 days since Hurricane Maria tore through the island. These storms  wreaked havoc on those who live there. They destroyed houses and killed  at least 49 people. Yet, 48 days later, nearly 80 percent of the island  is still without power, and 30 percent of the population is without  clean drinking water--some having to resort to drinking contaminated  water. Roads are impassable. Bridges are down. The few hospitals that  are operating are operating on generators.   Frankly, the administration was slow to respond to the disaster. So  to claim that it gets a 10 out of 10 for its response is to ignore the  facts, especially the facts that the people who have been hit know so  well. As I said before, this is not a reality TV show. It is not where  the participant with the highest score advances to the next round. This  is not fiction. These are people's lives--real people. They are  people's homes. This is the hard part of governing. This is where we  roll up our sleeves and dig in for the long haul. We stop patting  ourselves on the back. Instead, we use that hand to give a hand to the  people who are hurting.   Today we are going to advance a disaster package that contains $36.5  billion in additional emergency relief. It includes $18.7 billion for  the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, Disaster Relief Fund,  $16 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program debt forgiveness,  $1.2 billion for nutrition assistance, and $576.5 million to address  these devastating wildfires in the western part of the United States.   As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I support this  bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the  same. If we do not act, the Disaster Relief Fund and the Flood  Insurance Program will run out of resources in a matter of days. This  money, if we pass it, will help FEMA, the Department of Defense, the  Army Corps of Engineers, and other agencies to continue their work in  all of the devastated communities and to start catching up with the  work that needs to be done and to help families begin to rebuild their  homes and their lives--those who did not die in the disaster. This is  just the next step. This is a multistep process. This is the next step  on the road to recovery.   Last week, I met with Governor Ricardo Rossello, of Puerto Rico, and  his staff. I have been to Puerto Rico many times, in happier times, but  here he detailed the unique challenges that face Puerto Rico. He was  telling us what is happening to our fellow Americans. The electric grid  was almost completely destroyed. Its infrastructure, itself, was  demolished. Houses were flattened. At the same time, Puerto Rico faces  a fiscal situation that will make it nearly impossible for it to  provide the Federal match that is required for most disaster assistance  programs. It faces a Medicaid funding crisis that may leave nearly 1  million people without healthcare in just a matter of months, assuming  that we restore their healthcare.   This tells us that our response cannot be business as usual. We need  to tailor disaster assistance to meet Puerto Rico's unique challenges.  We may need to consider legislation to address its unique needs. Most  importantly, we need to think long term. To simply replace and repair  what was destroyed would be shortsighted. We have to help our fellow  Americans who are in Puerto Rico to recover, to rebuild, and to be more  resilient and better prepared. We should invest in the 3.4 million U.S.  citizens in Puerto Rico and invest in their infrastructure so that the  next disaster is not a humanitarian issue and crisis.   Some like to say that the situation is unique in Puerto Rico. It is  not. We have to acknowledge that historic-sized storms are now annual  occurrences, and we have to respond accordingly. Even with the help  from our own citizens and from the U.S. Government, we are just now  fully rebuilding in Vermont, and we were not hit as badly as these  other places were. Across the country--from wildfires in California to  the flood damage in Florida, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as  what I said about Puerto Rico--we can invest in technology, and we can  invest in conservation and infrastructure. That would mitigate further  damage.   Do you know what? It would also make these communities more resilient  because we cannot speak about ``once in 100 years'' storms. Sometimes,  as we have seen this year, they have been ``once in 2 months'' or  ``once in 3 weeks'' storms. This requires a commitment from the U.S.  Government. It is not measured by days or weeks or months but in  years--a commitment that does not waver, a commitment that does not  depend on whether you live in Texas or Florida or Puerto Rico or the  Virgin Islands.   Today, I urge all Senators to support this emergency supplemental  bill that will provide much needed assistance for disaster relief  across the country, but it is still just the next step on the path to  recovery. The Trump administration is committed to putting forward a  third, more comprehensive disaster package in the coming weeks. As vice  chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I intend to hold the  administration to that commitment.   In conclusion, even in the years since Irene, this Vermonter still  takes comfort in the number of Republican and Democratic Senators who  called me during that storm and pledged support and, along with the  pledge, came through with the support.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.                          The Budget and Tax Reform    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, the Senate took an important  step for the fiscal and economic future of our country with passage of  the budget for fiscal year 2018.   The comprehensive, responsible budget we passed marks out a clear  vision for the future. It will put the Federal Government on a path to  balance, and it sets out a new course after the long years of the Obama  economy, when paychecks stagnated, steady work became harder to find,  and retirement for many slipped further away. The budget we passed  isn't just about getting our fiscal house in order--though it is  certainly about that--it is also about getting our economy going again  and growing again.   Perhaps the most important way it does so is by authorizing  legislative tools to advance tax reform, and passing tax reform is the  most important thing we can do today to get our economy reaching for  its true potential.   Tax reform is all about helping the middle class succeed. It is about  making it easier to create jobs in America and keep them right here. To  summarize the effort in one phrase, it is this: Tax reform is about  taking more money out of Washington's pocket and putting more in  yours--more for workers, more for small businesses, and more for the  middle class. After all, as the President wrote over the weekend, ``we  are not talking about the government's money--we are talking about your  money, your hard work.''   If you look back a few months, many doubted our ability to get a  budget done or to advance tax reform. They didn't see the path forward.  Those skeptics underestimated our resolve. The Senate has delivered on  the budget, and we will soon have the tools to deliver on tax reform.   We now look forward to our House colleagues' continued consideration  and passage of the budget. Once they do so, we can move forward with  tax reform for American families.   For Americans who have suffered through years of uncertainty-- everything from a recession to outsourcing to unemployment--we are  ready to deliver for you. For those who watched opportunity recede  while the personal wealth of coastal elites grew beyond comprehension,  help is on the way. We want to put more money in your pocket, we want  to make retirement a reality for you, we want to get this economy  moving the way it should, and tax reform is the key to helping us get  there.   I would like once again to thank Chairman Enzi and the members of the  Budget Committee for their important work to get this budget resolution  passed.  [[Page S6705]]    I also would like to thank the cloakroom staff, the Parliamentarians,  the clerks, the pages, and the officers of the U.S. Capitol Police who  worked into the evening to make sure, as they always do, that the  Senate runs smoothly.   Thanks also to Chairman Hatch and the members of the Finance  Committee. We now look forward to their continued good work on  development of the kind of tax relief that will get our economy truly  moving again.   Mr. President, on another matter, the Senate remains committed to  doing its part to support the ongoing hurricane relief efforts, and, to  that end, today we will take a vote to advance the administration's  most recent supplemental funding request. These resources will ensure  that FEMA and the rest of the administration have the ability to  continue their crucial support to help those impacted by devastating  storms.   Like many colleagues, I have been engaged on this issue from the very  start. Through several meetings with leaders from Puerto Rico and the  U.S. Virgin Islands, I have had the opportunity to hear firsthand how  the government can support their relief efforts. I met with Puerto  Rico's Governor last week to get another update on the funding request  and to hear about the continuing recovery.   In addition, I have continued working with the administration as it  responds to these storms. For instance, after the devastation of  Hurricane Harvey, I met with the Department of Homeland Security's  Acting Secretary to learn more about what would be needed. I also met  with President Trump's eminently qualified nominee to lead that  Department.   The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a supplemental  funding request with strong bipartisan support, and now it is our turn  to act. As we all know, the administration will continue to actively  review hurricane relief and recovery needs. As it does, we can expect  the transmittal of additional supplemental requests for our  consideration in the near future.   The victims of these hurricanes continue to count on our support, and  I look forward to the Senate continuing to do its part to help.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.                                 Nominations     Mr. President, I just want to address very briefly one  other issue that surfaced last week.   Press reports indicate there are multiple nominees of President Trump  awaiting Senate confirmation, but even though they haven't been  confirmed--there has not been a vote maybe even in committee, I  understand; certainly they have not been confirmed by the Senate. Yet  they are engaged in the very duties of the positions for which they  have been nominated. That includes nominees showing up to work, even  though they are not yet confirmed. It means they attend White House  meetings, even though they are not yet confirmed. They show up for  photo ops, even though they are not confirmed. This includes officials  with at least three different agencies.   If accurate, this is nothing but an end run around our constitutional  system. It directly flouts the Senate's constitutional role to check  and balance the enormous power wielded by the executive branch. It is  our obligation to advise and ultimately consent, vote up or down, the  appointment of high-level agency officials. Their decisions impact  millions of Americans. I hope that all of us--both Democrats and  Republicans--will speak up and defend the prerogatives of the Senate if  the Trump administration continues to insist it is above the law.   I have been here a half dozen times when Democrats were in the  majority and a half dozen times when Republicans were in the majority.  We have always insisted that these kinds of nominees await a vote  first. Back in my time during the Ford administration, the Carter  administration, the Reagan administration, the Bush administration--the  first Bush administration--the Clinton administration, the next Bush  administration, the Obama administration, we actually followed the law  and the Constitution. It was something that both Republican leaders and  Democrat leaders insisted on, and I agreed with it. Although I may have  hated to wait sometimes, we insisted on it. So I raise that point.   It raises a real question. I am told that it may be a violation of  the law. It certainly raises a question if they make decisions based on  their responsibilities in a position that requires confirmation and  they haven't been confirmed. We may be facing lawsuits--taxpayers  paying to defend lawsuits--when all they have to do is wait a few days.   Republicans are in charge of the Senate. They can bring up these  nominees. Bring them up and vote on them, but don't just pretend the  Senate is not here. Let's not pretend the advice and consent part of  the Constitution doesn't exist.   Let's actually obey the law and the Constitution. It can be  refreshing to do things the way the law and the Constitution requires.  In the long run, the country will be better off.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, in correspondence with officials of the  Government of Bangladesh over a period of several years and in  conversations with officials of our own State Department, I, like many  others, have raised concerns about enforced disappearances, arbitrary  arrests, unfair trials, extrajudicial executions, and other flagrant  violations of the rule of law by the government of Prime Minister  Sheikh Hasina Wajed and particularly by the Rapid Action Battalion,  RAB.   Like the inquiries and appeals of others, my concerns have been  responded to by Bangladeshi officials with blanket denials,  obfuscation, and even falsehoods.   Despite such attempts to deflect responsibility, it is beyond a doubt  that the rule of law is often violated by Bangladeshi law enforcement  agencies. This conduct has become so ingrained that it is not an  overstatement to describe Prime Minister Wajed's government as one that  condones state-sponsored criminality.   Of course, the government would vociferously reject such a  characterization, insisting that individuals who have disappeared were  kidnapped by militants or joined extremist groups or simply claiming  that their whereabouts are unknown to the government. The problem is  that there is often credible eyewitness testimony to the contrary or  those responsible for the abductions have identified themselves as  members of one of the security forces, the RAB being the most  notorious.   The State Department's latest Country Reports on Human Rights  describes the situation in Bangladesh as follows: ``Human rights groups  and media reported that multiple disappearances and kidnappings  continued, some committed by security services. The government made  limited efforts to prevent or investigate such acts. The United Nations  Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances contacted the  government on March 9 concerning the ``reportedly alarming rise of the  number of cases of enforced disappearances in the country'' and had 34  outstanding cases under review as of May 18, but the working group did  not receive a response. Following alleged disappearances, security  forces released some individuals without charge, arrested some, some  were found dead, and others were never found.''   The State Department also cited the practice of torture of detainees  in Bangladesh: ``Although the constitution and law prohibit torture and  other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment, local and  international human rights organizations and the media reported  security forces, including RAB, intelligence services, and police,  employed torture and physical and psychological abuse during arrests  and interrogations. Security forces reportedly used torture to gather  information from alleged militants although members of political  opposition parties claimed that security forces also targeted activists  within their parties. Security forces reportedly used threats,  beatings, kneecappings, and electric shock, and law enforcement  officers sometimes committed rapes and other sexual abuses. Two  prominent human rights organizations stated that security forces  tortured eight persons to death in the first nine months of the year.''   The situation has not improved since the State Department published  that report earlier this year. Just last week, seven senior  representatives of an opposition political party were arrested in  Dhaka. Their whereabouts, conditions of confinement, and the evidence  against them remain a mystery.   This egregious situation has been cited by the European Parliament,  the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, and other reputable human  rights monitors; yet the government of Prime Minister Wajed rejects  such admonishments out of hand as fabrications or an infringement of  sovereignty. Not only do these practices violate the rule of law, they  threaten democracy itself. Bangladesh does face a serious problem of  violent extremism, which must be effectively addressed, but if peaceful  expression and association that challenges government policies or that  condemns corruption and police misconduct are equated with terrorism  and responded to with threats, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances,  extremism will increase, and democracy will suffer.   Other international organizations and governmental bodies have urged  the Government of Bangladesh to respond to calls regarding dozens of  cases of disappearances and to permanently dismantle the RAB and  suspend other law enforcement agencies that have engaged in such crimes  until credible investigations of such cases are conducted and those  responsible are appropriately punished. I echo those calls and do not  support further U.S. assistance for such agencies until the necessary  steps are taken.                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to speak briefly about the  situation in Uganda, which should concern all Senators.   Uganda, located on the Equator in East Africa, has been a friend and  partner of the United States for many years, particularly in the fight  against HIV/AIDS. Twenty years ago, Uganda was the epicenter of AIDS in  Africa. Thousands were dying, testing was nonexistent, condoms were  outlawed, and the future was bleak. Since then, dramatic progress has  been made in controlling the disease, although more remains to be done.  [[Page S6712]]    The United States has also joined in the fight against the Lord's  Resistance Army, which ravaged northern Uganda for many years. I  remember a time, not so long ago, when thousands of young children,  called ``night commuters'' would walk each evening from their remote  villages into towns where they were protected from being kidnapped by  the LRA and forced into servitude as child soldiers.   Throughout that period and to this day, President Museveni has  remained in power, for five consecutive terms, solidifying his control  increasingly through repression, including the arrest, imprisonment,  and even alleged assassination attempts of political opponents and  social activists. In 2016, at his most recent inauguration after an  election marred by fraud and intimidation, Sudan's President Bashir,  indicted by the International Criminal Court, was an invited guest.   In 2012, President Museveni announced that he would ``certainly not''  seek to remain in office after age 75, consistent with article 102(b)  of Uganda's Constitution; yet today, with the next Presidential  election scheduled for 2021, an effort is underway in Uganda's  Parliament, presumably with President Museveni's blessing, to amend the  constitution to eliminate the age limit. If successful, Museveni could  remain President for life, in the tradition of other African strongmen  like Robert Mugabe.   There is no law against amending the constitution. Our own  Constitution poses no such age limit on Presidents or Members of  Congress, but doing so for the obvious purpose of perpetuating the  increasingly autocratic rule of a serving President, who has used the  security forces to silence his opposition and who has systematically  undermined the possibility of a free election, is wrong.   Such an outcome would be a tragedy for democracy and the rule of law  in Uganda, at a time when corruption, economic stagnation, and internal  strife are propelling Uganda backwards. The United States and the  international community have provided Uganda with billions of dollars  in aid since 1986 when President Museveni first came to power. I  supported that investment in Uganda's social, economic, and political  stability, and President Museveni deserves credit for many positive  developments in Uganda since the horrific years of his brutal  predecessors, Idi Amin and Milton Obote; yet today much of that  investment is at risk of being squandered.   Ultimately this is a decision for the representatives of the Ugandan  people, but I hope the Ugandan Parliament recognizes what is at stake,  not only for the people of Uganda and for the future of democracy and  stability in that country, but for future support from the United  States and the international community.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
