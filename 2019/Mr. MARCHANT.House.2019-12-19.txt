 Madam Speaker, the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement is a revolutionary trade deal that will usher in a new era of  economic prosperity and growth for Americans across the country.   Texas, in particular, stands ready to thrive under this agreement.  Our State exports more to Mexico than any other and is second in  exports to Canada. Each year, over $135 billion worth of Texan goods  are sent to our two closest trading partners, supporting over 114,000  jobs in Texas.   The reforms in the USMCA will ensure that we continue to have free  and fair access to international marketplaces, keeping prices low for  Americans and business booming for business and workers.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member, my good  friend, for shepherding this through. Members on the other side of the  aisle, I have been in legislatures for a long time, and I always  believed that, on this bill, you were trying to get to ``yes'' on it. I  appreciate the hours that you met, and Texas will appreciate every vote  that is cast for this bill.
