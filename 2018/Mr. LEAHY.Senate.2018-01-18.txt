 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, to paraphrase a Republican President I  enjoyed knowing, here we go again.   In 1995 Republicans shut down our government. They wanted to  recklessly cut education programs and environmental programs, and they  even wanted to raise Medicare premiums on millions of senior citizens,  and they were willing to shut down the government to do it.   Of course, more recently in 2013, Republicans once again sought to  strip the healthcare of millions of Americans. They wanted to shut down  the government in a failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Actually, that is an effort they continued this summer instead of  negotiating a bipartisan budget deal that could have averted the  situation we find ourselves in today.   In 2015 Republicans continued their attack on healthcare by bringing  us to the brink of yet another government shutdown in an attempt to  defund Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood is the source of  healthcare to millions of Americans in rural America. Millions of  American women, men, and young people--certainly, tens of thousands of  Vermonters in my little State--trust and depend on Planned Parenthood  for their basic healthcare needs, including annual health exams,  cervical and breast cancer screening, and HIV screenings--terrible that  they might provide that care to Americans.  [[Page S291]]  They tried to shut down the government because of it. It was also in  2015 that the Republicans began their attack on Dreamers. They  attempted to shut down the entire Department of Homeland Security,  which protects our skies, our borders, and everything else, and they  were risking our national security because they wanted to block DACA,  the Dreamers bill.   If these were just talking points and political ploys, it would be  one thing, but they have real consequences.   The 2013 Republican shutdown dealt a devastating blow to economic  growth amounting to $1.5 billion per day. For a State the size of  Vermont, $1.5 billion is a lot of money. It was an estimated $1.5  billion for each of the days of the shutdown, and there were 16 of  those days. That is economic growth we lost that we never get back.  Hundreds of thousands of Federal workers were furloughed through no  fault of their own for a combined total of 6.6 million days. Lifesaving  research on cancer, on diabetes, on heart conditions ground to a halt.  The doors and fences of our iconic national parks and monuments that  Americans have always relied on to go and see were shuttered.   Now, in 2018, President Trump wants to shut down the government over  a cynical and misbegotten ``big, beautiful wall.'' And he wants that  ``big, beautiful wall''--whatever it might be--to be paid for by U.S.  taxpayers, not Mexico. He is using the Dreamers as negotiable  commodities, as though they are some kind of money, instead of people,  to meet his unreasonable demands to spend $18 billion on last century's  technology. President Trump is making these demands after he promised  taxpayers it wouldn't cost us a cent because Mexico would pay for it.  Well, if he really believes that, open a bank account, and let Mexico  send the money. When they send the money, we will build the wall. I  mean, be serious. He said they will build it. Now he wants the American  taxpayers--who are strapped on so many things--to build last century's  technology. Let Mexico send us the money. When they do, we will build  it. If he is telling the truth, they will send it. If he is not telling  the truth, of course, they will not.   But he is also just continuing the Republican tradition of being the  ``shutdown party.'' We have some very responsible Republicans and  Democrats in the House and the Senate. I have not heard a single one of  them say we need a good government shutdown. I take it back. One  Republican has: Donald Trump. Donald Trump has said that our country  needs ``a good shutdown.'' That is the only person, Republican or  Democrat, I have heard say that they want a shutdown.   I wonder if that is what he has asked his own party to angle for--a  manufactured crisis to distract from the fact that they are not doing  their job. I can say, as the vice chairman of the Appropriations  Committee, I know the Democrats have been ready and willing to  negotiate a spending agreement since last June. Instead of working  toward that goal, congressional Republican leadership has spent the  last year overturning consumer protections. They stripped healthcare  from millions of Americans. They passed a massive tax cut for big  corporations and wealthy Americans, paid for by middle-class Americans  and future generations because it adds trillions to the deficit. But  during that time, they continued to kick the can down the road.   They have failed to do their jobs to pass sensible spending bills to  keep our government open. They have cast aside Congress's fundamental  responsibilities in pursuit of a hyperpartisan agenda. As a result, we  haven't reached a bipartisan budget deal that would allow us to  strengthen our military--something both Republicans and Democrats want.  We haven't reached a bipartisan budget deal to allow us to invest in  our communities--something I believe both Republicans and Democrats  want.   We all agree that the consequences of sequestration have been  devastating. We have to lift the spending caps set into law by the  Budget Control Act. Every Republican and Democrat I talked with has  said they do, but we have to invest equally in our military and our  communities because our national security is intrinsically linked to  the investments we make in our communities. We are the greatest country  in the world exactly because we make a commitment to invest in  education and infrastructure. If we back off of that commitment, we are  no longer great. We aim to provide the necessary resources to combat  the opioid epidemic, and we strive to ensure that no child goes to  school hungry, but if we don't have defense and nondefense parity in  spending, we can't achieve these goals.   We have not passed a comprehensive disaster relief package that takes  into consideration the unique needs of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands. These are American citizens. They have been living without  power and without access to clean drinking water, and communities,  devastated by natural disasters for months, are without adequate help  from their own country--the U.S. Government--and people are dying.   The Dreamers, who are American citizens in every way but on paper,  have been thrown into crisis, a crisis of President Trump's own making,  a crisis that threatens to tear them from the only lives they have ever  known. Remember, the President is solely responsible--not Members here  on this floor--for creating this untenable situation faced by the  Dreamers. The President, all by himself--actually he is a party of  one--rescinded the DACA policy.   Now we have a path forward, put together by Republicans and  Democrats, which meets the requirements the President laid out himself.  But instead he continues to favor governing by chaos. He continues to  move the goal posts. He continues to push the agreement further out of  reach. He continues to say that our country needs a good shutdown. So  much for the ``Art of the Deal.'' I would never hire someone to make a  deal like that.   The latest effort to kick the can down the road, which Republicans  passed out of the House this evening, does not address any of these  issues. Its attempt to address the needs of the Children's Health  Insurance Program is public relations, but it is inadequate, and based  on the President's own twitter feed--which I get dizzy trying to  follow--goes in and out of favor with the President hourly. Why does  the bill extend CHIP for 6 years when extending this bipartisan program  for 10 years would actually save the taxpayers $6 billion? Why are  community health centers--which millions of Americans and CHIP  recipients depend upon for their primary care--not extended? Why don't  we protect Americans and our taxpayers? Most importantly, why was this  program allowed to expire and to be used as a negotiating part in the  first place?   Republican leadership, led by the President, has brought us to the  brink of a government shutdown. I have been here a long time. I have  looked at a lot of good legislation and bad legislation. I do not want  to say the most terrible thing possible about the House bill because I  know the respect we show back and forth. But the House bill is a joke  and does not have my support. It leaves too much in doubt. What it  attempts to address is woefully inadequate.   The majority now wants bipartisan support. Why not do as we always  used to and work with Democrats, instead of appealing for our support  only after they have written a mishmash, laughable bill crafted behind  closed doors?   I have been here over 40 years. I understand reality. Republicans  control the House; Republicans control the Senate; Republicans control  the Presidency. If Republicans want the government to stay open, it  will stay open. If Republicans want the government to shut down, it  will shut it down. I wish they would stop kicking the can down the road  and start negotiating in good faith, as so many Senators in both  parties have been willing to.   It is time to stop kicking the can down the road and time to start  negotiating in good faith. Keep our government open, and show respect  to those who live here in this country who consider themselves  Americans.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
