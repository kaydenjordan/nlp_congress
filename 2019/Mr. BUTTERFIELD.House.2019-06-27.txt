 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair of our committee  for yielding me time this morning.   Madam Speaker, I rise this morning in strong support of H.R. 2722. It  is past time that this Congress act boldly in response to the foreign  interference that took place in our 2016 elections, and that is exactly  what this bill does.   The gentleman from Ohio, the ranking member of the committee, I say  to him it is disingenuous to point the finger at the Obama  administration. That may or may not be accurate, but let us look  forward.   This legislation provides $600 million in grants to State and local  officials to secure election infrastructure and replace aging voting  machines with voter-verified paper ballot voting systems; $175 million  to States every 2 years to maintain elections infrastructure. It  requires States to implement risk-limiting audits; it prohibits  internet accessibility or connectivity for devices on which ballots are  marked or tabulated; and it sets long-needed cybersecurity standards  for vendors.   I ask my colleagues, let us look forward. Let us protect the right to  vote. Let us protect the ballot of every American citizen.
