 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service  of Sergeant Neil Horn, who dedicated 8 years of his life to service of  his country in the United States Marine Corps.   Sergeant Horn spent most of his career in the U.S. Marines traveling  the world as a security guard to defend the U.S. embassies where he was  stationed.   In 2002, Neil served in antiterrorism capacities in North Africa, and  part of his job was to train marines in door-to-door combat and  enhanced marksmanship. He was also an instructor for combat water  survival.   Sergeant Horn spent 14 years working in diplomatic security for the  State Department, where he was engaged in a wide array of  investigations, including human trafficking, terrorism,  counterintelligence, the location and return of U.S. fugitives, large  scale visa fraud, and passport and identity fraud. Most notably,  Sergeant Horn played an integral part in reestablishing the United  States Embassy in Cuba.   His country is forever grateful for the sacrifice that he and his  family have made for this great Nation. May he rest in eternal peace.                          Congratulating Ava Lowman     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Ava Lowman of Cambridge-Isanti High School for being selected as a 2023  Triple A Award State scholarship recipient.   This prestigious award, established in 1988, highlights high school  seniors across the State of Minnesota for their hard work and  dedication to their academics, art programs, and athletic endeavors.   Ava has earned an impressive GPA of 4.36 while participating in the  band and choir, being the speech team captain, and a member of the  tennis and track and field teams.   Additionally, Ava is considered a leader in her school's Link Crew  program, where she and other students assist ninth graders with the  transition into high school.   Ava plans on going to college while continuing to participate in  tennis, speech, and music.   It is with great honor that I recognize Ava's achievements thus far,  and it makes me proud to have such a distinguished young lady represent  the great Eighth District of Minnesota.   I congratulate her and wish her good luck in her future endeavors.                    Recognizing the Life of Carol Alstrom     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Carol  Alstrom, who dedicated 34 years of her life to teaching our youth.   Carol received her teaching degree in physical education and health  from Bemidji State University where she competed in track, volleyball,  softball, and hockey and was inducted into BSU's Athletic Hall of Fame.   She was known for her larger-than-life personality and her generous  and  [[Page H1920]]  caring demeanor. Her style of teaching was ahead of her time. Carol  understood the importance of teaching her students valuable skills that  could be transferred into the real world. She wanted to help her  students become model citizens and would monitor their progress  throughout their life.   Carol was an athletics enthusiast and true pioneer in women's sports,  starting Tower-Soudan's girls' volleyball, basketball, swimming, and  track programs. She introduced countless students to cross-country  skiing, Rollerblading, and pickleball.   Carol went above and beyond to make sure her student athletes always  had the equipment they needed. From buying new Adidas sneakers for the  volleyball team to collecting golf clubs for the golf team, no one was  underequipped.   It takes a special kind of person to draw over 200 attendees to honor  their life. Carol was that kind of special person. Former students, the  children of former students, coworkers, and friends gathered to  celebrate the life of Carol Alstrom and to exchange lasting memories  that she imprinted on each one of them.   The Tower-Soudan School gym was decorated in purple and gold to  commemorate Carol's love for the Minnesota Vikings and her Tower-Soudan  Golden Eagles.   A permanent memorial will be installed outside of the Tower-Soudan  School in her honor.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Carol for her lifetime of service, and may she  rest in peace.                            ____________________
