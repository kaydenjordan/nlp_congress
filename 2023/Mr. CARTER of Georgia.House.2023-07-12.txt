 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Robert ``Bobby'' Smith, a close friend of mine, who was tragically  killed in an airplane crash.   I knew Bobby well. In fact, he was my pilot for many years. He also  flew for my predecessor, Congressman Jack Kingston.   Bobby's greatest passion was always aviation, and he also served as  the chief flight instructor for MidCoast Aviation where he provided  flight education for the VA and later served as  [[Page H3475]]  vice chairman of the Reidsville Airport Authority board.   Since 2012, Bobby volunteered as an Angel Flight pilot, arranging and  piloting free flights for families in need of travel to and from  healthcare services.   His generosity, his kindness, and willingness to help others through  his passion for flight was unparalleled.   I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend, but I know his  legacy will live on for generations to come. Thank you, Bobby.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.
