 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I wanted to start, before I get to the amendment, to  actually talk about why all of this is so important here today.   You see, I hold prescription drug roundtables all across the  district, and there is a recent one that comes to mind and a story that  I want this body to hear.   We were doing a roundtable in Dubuque, where we invited folks to come  and talk about their issues with drug prices and how that is impacting  their lives personally. And there was a family that came, a young woman  who was in her teens, with her mom and her dad. You see, she has  diabetes, and they struggle every month to try to figure out how they  are going to keep affording insulin and her meters, and different  meters with different insurances happen almost every single year.   And they are telling me these stories, and in the middle of the  roundtable, the young woman and her mother had to leave to go to a  doctor's appointment, and it was her dad that stayed for the rest of  it. And as I am going around saying ``thank you for coming and sharing  your story today,'' I shook the dad's hand, and he looked at me and he  said, ``Please do everything you can to fight for my daughter and fight  to make sure that she is going to be able to afford the care that she  needs.''   He told me he is very worried about when she turns 26, and if she is  not on their insurance what does that look like. Is she going to be  able to keep affording it? And he told me that he wanted to be able to  walk his daughter down the aisle one day at her wedding, not her  funeral.                                time  1215    I will never forget that conversation, and I will never stop fighting  to make sure that we lower the costs of these lifesaving medications  that so many folks across our country and in my district need and rely  on.   It is why I am so proud to support the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug  Costs Now Act of 2019, which puts measures in place to make sure that  drug companies aren't charging us double, triple, or quadruple what  countries like Canada and Australia currently pay.   However, H.R. 3 is currently missing a bipartisan drug pricing reform  that has been supported by Senator Grassley, by President Trump, and  Members of both parties alike. It is requiring drug companies to  disclose pricing information on prescription drugs when they advertise  directly to consumers like us and folks in my district.   We have all seen the TV commercials that promote prescription drugs.  What we may not realize is that pharmaceutical companies spend billions  on this advertising. Last year, they spent over $6 billion, and a lot  of that was actually to encourage people to get expensive, brand-name  drugs.   My amendment would require TV advertisements for prescription drugs  to include the list price for a 30-day regimen or a typical course of  treatment. With this transparency, we can all be empowered to make  informed choices  [[Page H10215]]  and bring down costs to our healthcare system.   When drug companies use advertising to boost demand for drugs whose  prices just keep going up, the American people deserve to know what  these drugs cost. My amendment will ensure that we get a complete  picture of the prescription drug options we see on TV.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues today to support this amendment,  support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I check the balance of my time?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I am happy to hear that my colleagues across the aisle will be  supporting this important amendment, and I would like to end with  another story that I heard at another roundtable, one from one of our  farmers in our district who came to our Waterloo roundtable and came  with his wife, Heidi, who is battling MS, and was so concerned about  how he was going to continue to make it with the ongoing trade war with  China that has been taking his soybean markets, and the attacks on  renewable fuels that have been hurting him every single day as a corn  grower as well, and the $80,000 every 6 months that they were going to  have to pay for the MS medication that he went to his lawyer and asked  his lawyer how is he going to keep the farm and make sure his wife gets  what she needs. His lawyer looked at him and said: If you want to keep  your farm, you should consider divorcing your wife.   That is another story that I will never forget. These are the reasons  we are here today, that we fight for legislation like this, that we get  these things done, and that we put our constituents and people over the  politics that we continue to see here from folks who like to divide us  instead of unite us.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
