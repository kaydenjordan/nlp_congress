 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding and for his support on this issue.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 987. We must  reverse the administration's attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care  Act.   Healthcare should not be a partisan issue. It doesn't matter if you  are a Democrat, Republican, or unaffiliated. If you get sick, you need  to see a doctor. Your body certainly doesn't make the distinction about  what your politics are.   The ACA has given millions of Americans, including 500,000 in my home  State of North Carolina, access to quality and affordable care. That is  huge because people need healthcare.   No one should worry about losing access to quality, affordable health  insurance because of a preexisting condition. We all have them.  [[Page H3865]]    Black women shouldn't have to worry about dying in childbirth because  they don't have equal access to healthcare.   I am proud to support H.R. 987 to invest in quality healthcare for  the American people, a healthcare system that works for everyone.                                time  1415
