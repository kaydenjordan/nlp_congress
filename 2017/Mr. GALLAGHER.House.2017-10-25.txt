 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3342, the  Sanctioning Hizballah's Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields  Act.   First and foremost, I would like to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking  Member Engel for their steadfast support of this effort and their  broader leadership, not only in the Middle East and as it pertains to  rolling back Iran's influence in their terrorist proxies, foremost  among them Hezbollah, but also as it pertains to making the case  [[Page H8181]]  for American leadership in the world, making the case for why American  leadership, buttressed by its strong alliances, is a sound investment  in our safety here at home.   I would also like to thank my friend and colleague, Tom Suozzi, for  his tireless work to make this bill a reality. He and his staff have  been a pleasure to work with every step along the way, and I think he  is a perfect example of someone who is here and unafraid to reach  across the aisle when it comes to doing what is right for the country.   Mr. Speaker, this bill comes at an extremely important time, when  Iran and its proxies, such as Hezbollah, are making a concerted push on  the ground in the Middle East against the United States, our allies,  and our interests.   This isn't a new phenomenon, of course. Since its founding in the  early 1980s, Hezbollah has been one of the most dangerous and  destructive forces throughout the greater Middle East. With the  exception of al-Qaida, no foreign terrorist organization has killed  more Americans than Hezbollah.                                time  1515    With the support of the Iranian Government and the Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hezbollah has engaged in a sustained  campaign of terrorism and violence, including against the United States  and Israel.   Congress, along with the United Nations, has repeatedly documented  Hezbollah's numerous violations of international law, including  employing human shields throughout the 2006 conflict; concealing an  arsenal that has grown to over 150,000 missiles and other destabilizing  weapons provided by the Syrian and Iranian Governments in southern  Lebanon, often beneath civilian infrastructure; and maintaining an  armed military force within Lebanon's sovereign territory in direct  violation of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions, thus  preventing Lebanon from exerting its lawful control over its  internationally recognized borders.   The State Department designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist  organization in 1997, leading to the creation of a sanctions regime  against the group. Despite these sanctions, Hezbollah has continued to  expand its military capabilities due in large part to extensive Iranian  financial support. The State Department has continually expressed alarm  at Hezbollah's capabilities and influence, describing the group in 2010  as ``the most technically capable terrorist group in the world.'' In  2013, State Department noted the increasing tempo of Hezbollah's  terrorist activities.   Despite its extensive track record of terror, Hezbollah has yet to be  specifically sanctioned by the United States for its barbaric practice  of using defenseless civilians as human shields. The Shields Act  finally changes that and finally punishes Hezbollah for these  atrocities.   Just a few of the measures included in the Shields Act include:  identifying and sanctioning Hezbollah members and those acting on  behalf of Hezbollah who are complicit in or responsible for ordering or  directing the use of human shields; identifying and sanctioning foreign  persons, agencies, or instrumentalities of foreign states who have  provided, attempted to provide, or facilitated provision of material  support to identified individuals; and invoking financial penalties  blocking real estate transactions, and leveraging powers ascribed by  the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.   In short and in sum, the Shields Act is a vital and bipartisan bill  that advances American interest, punishes those who support and enable  the barbaric practice of using human shields, and protects our allies  in the region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this critical legislation, and I thank the chairman again for  his help and leadership.
