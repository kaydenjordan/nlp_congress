 Mr. Speaker, one of my most important responsibilities as  a Member of Congress is helping the residents of Michigan's 12th  District get through everyday challenges and issues that their families  are going through.   Creating Neighborhood Service Centers has been the most effective way  to change the lives of our residents immediately. From the moment I  took office, I made a commitment to be accessible and responsive to  those everyday challenges and needs. The way I have done it is my team  and I now operate what we call our Neighborhood Service Centers in both  Wayne and Oakland Counties.   Through the Neighborhood Service Centers, we have returned over $5.2  million in constituent services directly back into the pockets of our  neighbors.   Because of this incredible work of our casework team and Neighborhood  Service Centers, a senior veteran in Detroit, for instance, was able to  come into our office to apply for assistance to stop the garnishment of  his Social Security payments and receive assistance to wipe out an  outstanding debt of $8,161 that was being garnished.   Another family in Inkster was under a threat of losing their home,  but due to the work of the Neighborhood Service Centers they were able  to receive over $5,000 in property tax assistance to keep them in their  home. Again, the Neighborhood Service Center was able to change their  lives immediately.   Recently, my team and I also ran a constituent services fair in Wayne  County and had the opportunity to help more than 50 residents directly  with constituent casework.   We are humbled by the opportunity to serve each of our residents in  the 12th Congressional District every single day. I will continue to  fight for a thriving, inclusive, and prosperous community for all of us  through the Neighborhood Service Centers. I will always have their  back.                       Recognizing Joseph Deichelbohrer     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Joe Deichelbohrer for his  25 years of service with the Dearborn Fire Department in Michigan's  12th District Strong.   Our captain began his career as a firefighter with the Dearborn Fire  Department in 1998. Over the years, he rose steadily through the ranks  from fire engineer to lieutenant, and ultimately, captain. Captain Joe  has been steadfast in his service and commitment to the community.   Throughout his career he has earned many awards for his outstanding  service. He has been recognized multiple times, Mr. Speaker, for his  service, bravery, and working to truly change people's lives, and also  save them.   Over the past nearly three decades, Captain Joe has put his life on  the line for others to serve our community, and we commend him for his  service and wish him a happy retirement.                        Support for the Yemeni People     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the recent progress  made toward peace in Yemen and highlight what we need to be doing right  now to support the Yemeni people.   The recent progress and statements from those involved offer new hope  that peace in Yemen is possible, but obstacles remain that require  careful, thoughtful engagement from this Congress and our President.   This is why today, Congressman Ro Khanna and I are leading over 30 of  our colleagues in a letter to the President and his Yemen team  outlining how the U.S. should engage with the peace process to maximize  the chance at success.   Now more than ever, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. must push hard to ensure  that the blockade is completely lifted. While peace negotiations are  ongoing, it is critical that the U.S. must not obstruct peace by  offering further military assistance, weapons, or security guarantees  to any country while trying to maintain its support for the U.N. arms  embargo.   The message needs to be crystal clear, no aid of any kind will be  considered while Yemen starves. If this diplomatic process breaks down,  my colleagues and I are prepared to introduce new legislation to end  this awful war.   As always, we cannot allow our hope for current peace talks to  distract us from the massive humanitarian crisis.  [[Page H2382]]    Mr. Speaker, 14.8 million Yemenis are on the verge of starvation and  cannot wait for lifesaving humanitarian aid from the international  community. A month ago, I led two dozen of our colleagues in requesting  at least $1.2 billion in U.S. humanitarian aid to Yemen in the upcoming  budget. I repeat that call here today.   Mr. Speaker, this is our moment. Let's call for peace and stretch out  a helping hand and be there for the Yemeni people when they need us  most.                            ____________________
