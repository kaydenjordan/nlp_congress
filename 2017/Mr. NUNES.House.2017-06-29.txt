 Mr. Speaker, on the legislative day of Thursday, June 29,  2017, I was unable to cast a vote on a number of rollcall votes. Had I  been present, I would have voted:   Rollcall 341--``Nay.''   Rollcall 342--``Yea.''   Rollcall 343--``Nay.''   Rollcall 344--``Yea.''                            ____________________
