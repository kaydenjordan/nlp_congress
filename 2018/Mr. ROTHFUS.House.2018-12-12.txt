 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Air Force Staff  Sergeant Dylan James Elchin, who gave his life for our country on  November 27, 2018, while serving in Afghanistan.   Dylan was born in 1993 and raised in western Pennsylvania, graduating  from Hopewell High School in 2012. Military service was already calling  him at a young age as he read of special operations when he was 14  years old. He enlisted upon graduating from high school.   The commanding officer of Dylan's 26th Special Tactics Squadron said  Dylan ``had an unusual drive to succeed and contribute to the team. He  displayed maturity and stoicism beyond his years and was always level- headed, no matter the situation.''   Dylan leaves behind a grieving fiancee and family, and we as a  nation, more than 300 million strong, must now stand behind them and  all who have fallen for our country.   May Dylan rest in the peace of God, and may his fiancee and family  know his tender mercies.                     Honoring Army Sergeant Jason McClary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Army Sergeant Jason  Mitchell McClary, a western Pennsylvania native who gave the ultimate  sacrifice while serving in the line of duty.   Sergeant McClary grew up in Export, Pennsylvania. He and his wife,  Lillie, graduated from Kiski Area High School in 2013. A true patriot  as a student, Jason dreamed of serving his country.   In January 2014, he achieved his dream and enlisted in the Army.  Jason went on to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, earning two Purple  Hearts and three Army Commendation Medals, including one for valor and  one for combat.   Tragically, this courageous soldier was taken from us too soon. On  November 27, 2018, Jason was injured from an IED explosion and died 5  days later, leaving behind two little sons, a heartbroken wife, and a  grieving community of family and friends.   Jason is fondly remembered as a loving father, devoted husband, and  hardworking soldier.   May the good Lord welcome home this son of western Pennsylvania with  open arms, and may He bless Jason's family with peace and consolation.                            ____________________
