 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Cole for the  manner in which you all are shepherding us through this difficult  process.   Madam Speaker, it is time for the American people to see how the  administration put our national security on the auction block in  exchange for political favors.   At the heart of this scandal is the White House's decision to slam  the brakes on nearly $400 million of military aid for Ukraine, military  aid for a vital partner, military aid that was desperately needed to  beat back Russian aggression, military aid that was key to our own  national security and essential in keeping an adversary at bay.   We know what our Ukrainian friends thought about this. They were  horrified. The facts are clear. Our top national security experts  viewed it as a grave and dangerous mistake. And as we have seen time  and time again from the Trump administration, this decision played  right into Vladimir Putin's hands.    Madam Speaker, I support pushing ahead with this  inquiry because I swore an oath to defend the Constitution against  America's enemies. The American people deserve the facts about how this  abuse of power betrayed our national security and put our country at  risk.
