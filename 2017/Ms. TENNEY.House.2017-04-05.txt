 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize families across  this great country who have been tragically affected by the growing  opioid epidemic plaguing our communities.   All too often, we hear the heart-wrenching stories from families who  have lost loved ones to this pernicious scourge. We have heard from law  enforcement officers and healthcare providers who have chronicled the  growing influx of crime and addiction in our society.   In 2016, in Broome County alone in my district, 76 people died from  drug overdoses. Ninety percent of those deaths were opioid related.   We have kicked the can down the road for far too long. Now, Congress  must act swiftly and work to provide resources for those struggling  with addiction by supporting rehabilitation centers, as well as  educational and preventative programs.   That is why I am taking the lead on the national level by supporting  the funding of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in the 2018  budget. This is only a start, but I will continue to fight across all  sectors to find comprehensive and caring solutions to this tragedy in  our communities.                            ____________________
