 Madam President, I also want to extend my congratulations  to four individuals, four friends, both former colleagues and folks I  have known for a long time, who have just been confirmed by the Senate  of the United States. Their confirmations will be conveyed to the  President, and they will begin their service.   I wanted to briefly thank the Members of this Senate for acting  quickly and appropriately to confirm the nominations of Senator Flake  to represent us in Turkey, of Senator Udall to represent us in New  Zealand, of Vicky Kennedy to represent us as Ambassador to Austria, and  of Mrs. Cindy McCain to represent us at the U.N. agencies in Rome. All  four of these incredibly talented individuals are deserving of  confirmation, and I am encouraged by this progress.   I remain gravely concerned, however, at just how many nominees await  action here. There are dozens of countries where there is no confirmed  American Ambassador, and I hope that this moment of progress will be a  predictor of other progress to come soon in terms of other  confirmations.   (The remarks of Mr. Coons pertaining to the introduction of S. 3075  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak to the fiscal  year 2022 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill.   Every year as December approaches, we finally roll up our sleeves and  get serious about passing the critical appropriations bills that fund  our government for the new fiscal year, and this year should be no  different. We are, in fact, already a month into fiscal year 2022.  Until we complete our work on the Appropriations Committee, Federal  Agencies are compelled to run on autopilot--something they can manage  for a few weeks, even a few months, but it creates immense problems for  Agencies and has grave consequences for every State and county and  municipality in this country if it goes on too long.   What I am talking about today is the grave risk that we will end up  with a continuing resolution. Now, a continuing resolution doesn't  sound that scary, but it is appropriations-speak for doing nothing, for  a zombie government, for conducting business as if time has stopped and  nothing has changed.   As the relatively new chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  State and Foreign Operations, I am acutely aware that running our  government on autopilot undermines the ability of the United States to  be a global leader, to defend and advance our national security and  foreign interests, and to counter the influence and aggression of our  competitors and adversaries.   If we were to continue month after month through this entire fiscal  year with no appropriation, what are the things that have happened that  we would fail to respond to?   Well, tragically, in Ethiopia and in Afghanistan, there are  humanitarian crises unfolding before our eyes, where millions are at  risk of starvation. In Haiti, due to the recent earthquake and  political changes, armed gangs have taken over much of the capital, and  tens of thousands are homeless. In Venezuela, the ongoing crisis with  the Maduro regime continues to worsen, putting enormous pressure on its  neighbors as millions of Venezuelans flee to other regions seeking  refuge.   We are also continuing to work to vaccinate the world to stop further  the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the development of even more deadly  variants than the Delta variant.   Last year's State and Foreign Operations bill included a small  fraction of what is now widely recognized as being essential to prepare  for the next outbreak of a deadly virus, which could be  [[Page S7371]]  even more lethal than COVID-19 or Ebola and more transmissible.   A continuing resolution would deny the U.S. Government the resources  included in this year's bill to lead the global pandemic response.   Now, Mr. President, I will not attempt to go through the entire  roughly 320 pages of this year's nearly $60 billion State and Foreign  Operations appropriations bill, but I do want to talk about, at the top  level, some of the most important provisions and some of the most  significant ways in which it deals with ongoing challenges in our  world.   Last year's bill included almost nothing to help nations deal with  the worst impacts of climate change, impacts that are occurring with  greater frequency and intensity than previously predicted. Rising  temperatures, severe droughts, food shortages, flooding, fires, and  other extreme weather events are more and more common here in our own  country and around the world.   Last year's bill continued the counterproductive practice of failing  to meet our assessed dues at the United Nations, adding another $200  million in our arrears, arrears that today are nearly a billion  dollars. If we continue this another year with a CR, who benefits the  most from our delinquency, from our absence at the world stage and at  all the different organizations and entities within the United Nations?  China.   China has been methodically paying what it owes, expanding its  influence, and has already surpassed us as the largest donor to several  different U.N. agencies. If you think that doesn't matter, imagine a  world in which China is the largest contributor, supporter,  shareholder, influencer of United Nations organizations and has the  largest number of employees and sets the rules and standards at the  dozens of U.N. entities that are critical to global commerce, to global  society, and to the rules-based international order.   Last year, our SFOPS bill shortchanged U.S. public diplomacy and  broadcasting, and we saw an emboldened Russian Government expel Radio  Free Europe and all of its staff.   Last year's bill did positive things. It rejected the Trump  administration's proposed deep cuts to State Department operations and  personnel, but it did little to fill the yawning gap caused by a hiring  freeze and steady attrition due to a loss of morale.   Practically all of our Embassies, our consulates, and USAID missions  are today operating at below--and in some cases far below--their  authorized staffing, their critically needed capacity.   Over the last 4 years, I will say that our reputation as a stalwart  defender of democratic values and of human rights, a reputation earned  over decades, was tarnished. Reaffirming those values and rebuilding  our reputation requires more than brave speeches and good words. It  requires investing in the staff, in the personnel, in the organizations  and the programs that support human rights and that fight for democracy  around the world.   I know Senators of both parties recognize the imperative of our  maintaining our reputation as the world's leading democracy, of fully  staffing our Embassies, of strengthening our alliances, of countering  growing Russian and Chinese influence, and of maintaining our world  leadership role in public health by responding to the COVID-19  pandemic.   But what also needs to be recognized is that none of this is possible  if we simply continue funding these requirements at last year's level.  The fiscal year 2022 State and Foreign Operations bill was posted on  the Appropriations Committee website Monday, and I am introducing it as  a bill in total today.   I urge our Republican colleagues to work with us to arrive at a top  line for fiscal year 2022 appropriations, to complete work on this and  the other appropriations bills, and to avoid a yearlong continuing  resolution that is in no one's interest.   This year's State and Foreign Operations bill was drafted with input  from leaders in both parties, which has been our longstanding practice.  Senator Graham of South Carolina, the former chairman and now ranking  member, has been an invaluable partner. He and I have traveled to a  number of countries together, and I value his ideas, his input, and his  priorities and those of his staff.   Many of his ideas are reflected in the fiscal year 2022 bill, as are  requests of many Senators of both parties. Every draft of this bill was  shared and edited by both sides. Neither Senator Graham nor I got  everything we wanted, nor should we expect to. There are things that  his side opposes; there are things that my side wanted that are not  included because of his objections.   Contrary to what some have suggested, this was not a partisan  process. Does this bill differ from what the Republicans would have  drafted if they were in the majority? Of course. But it is, in fact, a  compromise, the result of disciplined and thorough negotiation between  both parties.   We did our best to incorporate the requests of other Senators,  regardless of party. And if we had included every dollar that was asked  of us, we would need a budget allocation five times the amount we were  given to spend. That alone tells you a great deal about the strong  bipartisan support for global leadership and engagement.   The budget allocation our subcommittee was given is, in fact, $1.75  billion below President Biden's budget request, and that made us make  even tougher budget choices than we initially imagined. The entire  SFOPS budget amounts to only 1 percent of the Federal budget, contrary  to the mythology many of us hear out on the stump, in townhalls, and in  campaign events.   Folks come to us all the time who imagine that if we just eliminated  foreign aid, we would cover the entire Federal debt. One percent--1  percent--of the Federal budget is dedicated to our State Department,  our USAID professionals, our engagement in world organizations--all of  the good that is done on behalf of the United States and that  strengthens our role in strategic and, I would say, moral leadership in  the world at a time when our allies are under unprecedented pressure.   The fiscal year 2022 State and Foreign Operations bill provides  critically needed funds to rebuild the muscles of the State Department  and USAID, to fill vacant personnel positions, to allow for diplomats  and aid workers to serve as professional and dedicated representatives  to the United States around the world.   I will remind you, many of them serve in dangerous and remote posts,  from the Horn of Africa to South Asia and Central America. But unlike  our men and women in uniform, they don't carry weapons to defend  themselves. They, instead, carry the full faith and credit of the  United States, our reputation and our support, and our thanks. And  there are provisions we should be adding to future bills to ensure they  have the full support they need and deserve to have successful careers  representing us overseas.   As I mentioned earlier, the clarity with which we all see the urgency  of combating climate change has become sharper and sharper as natural  disaster after natural disaster imposes billions of dollars of costs on  the American people. This bill provides nearly $2 billion in proactive  investments in key climate programs to support clean energy  technologies and help other countries adapt to climate change. This  should be a priority for the Senate and the United States.   There are parts of the world already experiencing temperatures that  make life unbearable, where water scarcity is an existential threat,  food insecurity is increasing, and there is a risk of widespread  hunger.   In coming years, projections are the number of migrants driven from  their home countries by climate change will increase dramatically to  tens of millions of people moving across the face of the world, driven  by climate change. It is not too late for us to act, but it nearly is.  And this significant investment, meeting the President's budget  request--in fact, in some areas exceeding it--is, I think, an important  signal of our commitment to combat climate change.   This bill also provides a billion dollars to support global health  security, an $800 million increase in the current level, recognizing  the global pandemic in which we are currently struggling to provide  vaccines and public health support for the rest of the world.   It also provides support for a wide range of sustained and bipartisan  long-term global health investments: combating malaria, polio,  tuberculosis; for  [[Page S7372]]  nutrition, water, and sanitation programs; and maintaining strong  support for the PEPFAR Program to combat HIV/AIDS, first initiated by  President George Bush and sustained by his successor administrations.   This bill also maintains critical support for vital allies and  partners, for the nations of Israel and Jordan and other allies  throughout the world, and it pays our commitments to international  organizations like NATO and the IAEA. It provides funds to continue our  leadership role as the world's largest contributor to the U.N. World  Food Programme, which won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for the  critical, lifesaving difference they have made in feeding the world's  most vulnerable people and in responding to the current global  humanitarian crisis.   This bill includes a nearly $150 million increase for vital programs  in Central America to address poverty, violence, and other root causes  of migration while also attempting to address the rampant corruption  and impunity within the governments of the countries of Central America  with which we look to partner.   There is also a critical new investment here I want to point out  briefly. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation,  something a number of us have a hand in crafting, will have an  increased budget by more than $100 million to support private-sector  investment in development overseas with standards that are higher, that  are more transparent in terms of labor, environment, and fiscal  soundness and transparency. I think this is critical for us to combat  rising Chinese influence through the Belt and Road Initiative and for  the United States to have a new tool to partner with our closest allies  in development finance.   This also provides $900 million to the Millennium Challenge  Corporation, another initiative of the Bush administration sustained by  its successors, that has demonstrated that long-term compacts with  clear standards and clear metrics can contribute meaningfully to  development in the Third World.   The bill supports programs to protect and promote internet freedom,  religious freedom, and freedom of expression, all of which are critical  ways that we don't just talk about but we show our values in the world.   And it increases funding for programs to support free and fair  elections, human rights, and democratic institutions at a time when  authoritarianism is gaining ground in nearly every region of the world.  No country has the ability to match the United States when it comes to  standing up to ruthless dictators, whether in Burma, in Russia, or in  Iran, and people everywhere are counting on us to do so.   This bill also prioritizes funding for programs to combat  transnational crime and corruption and to hold accountable foreign  officials who enrich themselves at the expense of their own people, and  it provides funding to help countries--especially those hardest hit by  the pandemic--to reform and strengthen struggling economies. And, for  the first time, it highlights the need for greater engagement through  diplomacies and specific programs in the Arctic region, which is  rapidly becoming an area of focus and of strategic competition.   Whether it is investing in rebuilding the professional staff at the  State Department and USAID or whether it is shoring up our alliances  and our partnerships with key allies or reasserting U.S. diplomatic  leadership in international organizations, it is the funding and the  authorities in this bill that will enable us to remain and to  strengthen our role as a global leader.   As President Biden leaves to go to the G20, to go to COP26, the  global climate summit in Glasgow, we should be sending a strong signal  of support. We should be taking up and passing this bill.   If we simply remain on autopilot, if we doom the Agencies I have  spoken about in my brief remarks today to a zombie year on autopilot,  we will weaken our standing in the world. We will take a critical tool  out of the toolkit of our President, who I believe many of us supported  because of his ability to represent us well on the world stage and in  recognition of the many crises that confront our world today.   Appropriating funds for the Federal Government is among our most  important responsibilities under article I of our Constitution. It is  not something to be casual or blase or nonchalant about. It is  something to take up, to seriously debate, and to act on.   With just 6 weeks before the continuing resolution runs out, it is  time for us to act on the State and Foreign Operations bill and all the  other fiscal 2022 appropriations bills so we can avoid a zombie  government under a continuing resolution and demonstrate that the  Senate of the United States can still legislate in the best interests  of the American people.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak to the fiscal  year 2022 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill.
