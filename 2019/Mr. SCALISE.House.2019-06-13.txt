 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for next week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the  House majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I know we have been starting and going  through the appropriations process. I would like to ask the majority  leader about the conversation we have been having for weeks and weeks,  going back to May 1, when the President submitted a supplemental  emergency spending bill to address this serious humanitarian crisis at  our southern border.   We have had this conversation multiple times in the colloquy. I  continued to ask the majority leader when we are going to see a bill on  this House floor to address this serious crisis. Each week, we have not  been given an actual timeline. In fact, as the majority leader just  went over the schedule, there is still no mention of a supplemental  bill to deal with this crisis.   I know we have been seeing multiple attempts by Members from our  party. I would hope that there are some from the gentleman's party that  have recognized that we have to deal with this. We can't keep putting  it off.   If the gentleman would look at The New York Times just this week, the  headline is: ``When Will Congress Get Serious About the Suffering at  the Border?''   I want to read a couple of statements from it because it contains  some things that we have been saying that are just not getting enough  coverage across the country. More and more now, we are seeing how  serious this is. This is about to come to a head, not in months, not in  years, but in days.   We are talking about young children who are right now in the custody  of the Department of Homeland Security, many of whom are coming over  with health diseases, serious diseases, who they are able to turn over  right now to Health and Human Services to care for their needs.   They are about to completely run out of money. This isn't a new  development. They have been saying this over and over for weeks.   The Presidential supplemental request came out on May 1. On May 3, at  our colloquy, I inquired of the majority leader: When will this happen?  We never got a timeline. On May 10 in our colloquy, I asked the  majority leader: When will Congress address this? Still no timeline.  Just last week, I brought it up again.   I want to read what The New York Times said in their description of  how serious this is, they said: ``It's time to cut the squabbling and  pass an emergency relief package.''   Here is a comment from John Sanders, who is the Acting Commissioner  of Customs and Border Protection, ``We are in a full-blown emergency,  and I cannot say this stronger: The system is broken.''   Just in this fiscal year, HHS has taken charge of nearly 41,000  unaccompanied children. On average, every single day, over 200 young  children are referred to HHS for medical needs.   HHS is about to run out of money in a matter of days, and Congress  has still not taken action.   There is a letter that I will be happy to enter in the Record.          U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and U.S.             Department of Homeland Security.        Dear Member of Congress: We continue to experience a       humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border of       the United States, and the situation becomes more dire each       day. On May 1, 2019, the Administration requested $4.5       billion in emergency appropriations for the Department of       Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS), the Department of Defense, and the Department       of Justice to address the immediate humanitarian crisis at       our southern border. We write today to ask that you       appropriate this funding as soon as possible.        We cannot stress enough the urgency of immediate passage of       emergency supplemental funding. This funding will provide       resources that our Departments need to respond to the current       crisis, enable us to protect the life and safety of       unaccompanied alien children (UAC), and help us to continue       providing the full range of services to the children in our       custody.        While Congress has been considering the request, the       average daily number of UAC in U.S. Customs and Border       Protection (CBP) custody has grown from nearly 870 on May 1       to more than 2,300 today. This is because the number of       arriving children greatly exceeds existing HHS capacity. As       of June 10, 1,900 processed UAC were in CBP custody awaiting       placement in HHS care. However, HHS had fewer than 700 open       beds in which to place them. HHS has significantly increased       the rates at which we are discharging children to sponsors,       but UAC are waiting too long in CBP facilities that are not       designed to care for children.        This is a direct result of the unprecedented number of       arriving children. As of June 10, DHS has referred over       52,000 UAC to HHS this fiscal year (FY), an increase of over       60 percent from FY 2018. Preliminary information shows nearly       10,000 referrals in May--one of the highest monthly totals in       the history of the program. If these numbers continue, this       fiscal year HHS will care for the largest number of UAC in       the program's history. HHS continues to operate near       capacity, despite placing UAC with sponsors at historically       high rates. HHS is working diligently to expand its bed       capacity to ensure that it can keep pace, and based on the       anticipated growth, HHS expects its need for additional bed       capacity to continue.        On May 17, the Administration notified Congress of an       anticipated deficiency in HHS's Office of Refugee       Resettlement's (ORR) UAC program, as required by law. Absent       an emergency appropriation, HHS anticipates running out of       funding as soon as this month. The Anti-Deficiency Act, which       is a criminal statute, requires HHS to take actions to       minimize the deficiency and only to fund operations that are       essential for the safety of human life and protection of       property--similar to those activities allowed during a       government shutdown. In the last few weeks, because of       rapidly depleting funds caused by the border surge, ORR was       required by law to scale back or discontinue awards, and had       to instruct grantees that new awards cannot be used for UAC       activities that are not directly necessary for the protection       of life and property, including education services, legal       services, and recreation. This was done solely to ensure full       compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act and stretch existing       funds as far as possible for the life and safety of children.  [[Page H4671]]         ORR would not have had to take these actions to preserve       essential operations if requested supplemental funding had       been provided. lf Congress acts quickly to provide the       requested supplemental funding to address the border surge,       ORR will be able to restore these services. Until such       funding is provided, ORR will only be able to pay for       essential services to protect life and safety.        It is unprecedented for a critical child welfare program to       run out of funding, and ORR is in close contact with grantees       about expected impacts. Once the UAC program is entirely out       of funding, grantees will have to care for children with no       federal reimbursement until an emergency appropriation is       enacted. It is unclear if grantees would be operationally       able to continue caring for UAC, as many are small nonprofit       organizations. This funding lapse could also negatively       impact grantees' willingness to care for UAC over the longer       term and ORR's immediate ability to add new child care       facilities to address the overflow of children in DHS border       facilities that were not designed for children. Our valued       federal employees in ORR who care for children and place them       with sponsors would be required to work without pay.        It is not only the UAC program that will be impacted. On       May 16, HHS notified Congress that the Anti-Deficiency Act       requires HHS to reallocate up to $167 million from Refugee       Support Services (RSS), Victims of Trafficking, and Survivors       of Torture to the UAC program if activities do not meet the       criteria in 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1515(b)(l)(B). Last week, HHS       informed the state refugee coordinators and refugee       resettlement grantees in 49 states and the District of       Columbia that ORR was withholding third quarter funding for       those programs. The RSS program addresses barriers to       employment for refugees such as: social adjustment,       interpretation and translation, day care for children, and       citizenship and naturalization. Again, this was not a       decision that ORR wanted to make, or took lightly. HHS's hand       was forced by the current funding situation and the law. HHS       must ensure that it is fully compliant with the       AntiDeficiency Act and that HHS stretch its existing funds as       far as possible to protect the life and safety of children       who are presently, or should be, in HHS care.        While the primary concern of both of our Departments is the       safety of children in our care, DHS faces changing dynamics       at the border that continue to stress its ability to respond.       For example:        More groups are illegally entering the United States, and       they are getting larger.        On May 29, U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) agents apprehended       over 1,000 migrants illegally crossing from Mexico as one       group, overtaxing border operations. Over 400 migrants were       apprehended within five minutes only two weeks before.        The number of migrants has escalated. with more vulnerable       populations arriving.        In May 2019, an average of more than 4,650 people daily       illegally crossed into the United States or arrived at ports       of entry without proper documentation. In May 2017, the daily       average was under 650 illegal crossings per day.        May 2019 experienced more than 144,000 total enforcements       on the southern border, a 32 percent increase over the       previous month and the highest monthly total since March       2006. This follows two months exceeding 100,000--sustained       levels not seen in over 12 years.        As of June 10, 2019, more than 17,000 people are in CBP       custody, including over 2,500 UAC.        The USBP apprehended nearly 85,000 individuals in family       units in May 2019 along the Southwest border. An additional       4,100 individuals in a family unit were deemed inadmissible       at Southwest border ports of entry. The vast majority of       these individuals have been released into the country due to       a lack of space and authority to detain them. By comparison,       in all of FY 2012, USBP apprehended just over 11,000       individuals in a family unit.        Border Patrol agents are spending more than 50 percent of       their time caring for families and children, providing       medical assistance, driving buses, and acting as food service       workers instead of performing law enforcement duties.        Border Patrol agents are making on average 70 trips to       hospitals every day to urgently get care to these       individuals, further diminishing their ability to perform       their official duties.        The Centralized Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, and       other CBP facilities have experienced outbreaks of flu which       has required standing up separate quarantine facilities to       reduce the risk of further exposing children and other       vulnerable populations to infectious disease. While agents       are providing the best care possible, these groups need more       appropriate care, and they need it now.        If DHS does not receive additional funding, it will be       forced to take drastic measures in August that will impact       other critical programs that support DHS missions throughout       the country. All DHS components, including the Transportation       Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management       Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,       the Coast Guard, and portions of CBP supporting legal trade       and travel will be required to redirect manpower and funding       to support measures to address the crisis.        In addition to the supplemental, it is clear that we need       bipartisan legislation to address the causes of this crisis.       We urge Congress to take swift action to provide the       necessary funding to address the severe humanitarian and       operational impacts of this crisis and to enact reforms to       the root causes of these problems so that they do not persist       into the future.        Thank you for your most immediate attention to this matter.       A copy of this response will also be sent to your state's       executive leadership.            Sincerely,      Alex M. Azar II,        Secretary, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.      Kevin McAleenan,        Acting Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security.     Mr. Speaker, I know the majority leader received this  letter, as has the Speaker, from the Secretary of HHS and the Secretary  of Homeland Security earlier this week, saying: ``We cannot stress  enough the urgency of immediate passage of emergency supplemental  funding. This funding will provide resources that our Departments need  to respond to the current crisis, enable us to protect the life and  safety of unaccompanied alien children, and help us to continue  providing the full range of services to the children in our custody.''   They are trying to take care of health and life needs. This is life  and death we are talking about.   In a matter of days, they will run out of money. This has been going  on for weeks and weeks, and Congress hasn't taken action.   I would ask the majority leader if we can get a commitment that this  House will take up this legislation that has been sent weeks ago. The  majority has had time to review it and hasn't addressed this serious  problem. When are we going to see action from the House?   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I would reiterate the urgency of acting  next week, not trying to act next week.                                time  1400    I don't have an opportunity to do this often, so I will quote The New  York Times again because it is not something I am normally used to  doing. But to quote them: ``It's time to cut the squabbling and pass an  emergency relief package.''   I know there might be differences over some of the details. There is  no wall funding in the request for the President.   The big battles that we had last year, this year, I am sure, will  continue on how we can actually secure the border. I would hope we,  over the next few months as we debate the appropriations bills, keep  coming to an agreement on how to secure America's southern border.   The magnitude of this problem can't be overstated. Just in the last  month, over 144,000 people came across illegally that we apprehended.  Those are just the ones we know about. This is 3 months in a row now we  have had more than 100,000 people coming across illegally. The average  is over 3,000 people per day.   And when we look at the amount of young children who are coming  across sick, again, more than 200 children every single day are being  referred to HHS for healthcare needs. That is the crisis that we want  to address today.   This isn't the bigger debate on wall funding, and so I hope we can  separate those two, but recognize the President's request did not  include a dime for wall funding for this humanitarian crisis. I would  hope we would treat it in an isolated way, as it was submitted.   I would just refer to the gentleman when Barack Obama was President  and we were in the majority. While we had differences with President  Obama, including on immigration, he sent out a request in 2014. His  request was for $3.7 billion for an additional border supplemental to  address the crisis at the border.   We still had a crisis back then. We have a worse crisis today. But  when President Obama submitted that request for $3.7 billion, we didn't  squabble over it. I am sure we might have had some disagreements, but  in less than a month, we, this Republican House, passed the full amount  that Barack Obama requested when he was President and sent it back out  of the House. That was quick action. I am just urging we have the same  kind of quick action.   We can disagree on the wall funding. Again, this isn't that  disagreement. This is a request from the President that was made in May  and that is literally coming to a head in days, where HHS has told all  of us--nobody is disputing it--HHS completely runs out of money and has  no ability to take, safely, any more children who are being sent to  them.   And they are coming over at more than 200 kids a day not who are  coming across illegally, but as Homeland Security receives them, over  200 a day have serious enough health needs that they are sending them  to DHS or HHS. HHS has told us clearly that they will run out of money  in a matter of days. I hope it is in a matter of days that we take up  the request.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I know when we talk  about the broader immigration problem, President Trump has been very  clear that he wants to work with Congress to solve the problem, the  bigger problem, not just a wall, but full border security and closing  those loopholes.   In fact, Mexican officials have even pointed out that America's  broken asylum law is one of the biggest magnets that is drawing people  through their southern border, up to our southern border, and into our  country. They even acknowledge it. We need to fix that. We need to work  together as a Congress to fix that problem.    President Trump offered to solve the DACA problem. He still hasn't  found a willing partner. We need to keep working at that.   We have just had testimony in a committee earlier this week where it  was pointed out that, as people come over, unfortunately, they abuse  children over and over again because young children are a ticket into  the country much quicker than other illegal means, and so they abuse  these children over and over again. It is one of the many reasons why  we need to solve that problem.   But when they get that asylum ticket, then they are sent into the  interior of the country and are told to come back and see us in years,  sometimes, for their court date. Ninety percent of those people who get  that court date don't show up. We don't know where they are. That is  how broken the asylum law is. We need to fix that.   Again, that is not this request. We can have that debate another day.  We need to have that debate another day.   When my friend's party was in the majority last time, when Barack  Obama took office and when Speaker Pelosi was first Speaker and there  was a supermajority in the Senate on the Democratic side, there was  never an attempt to bring a bill through Congress to solve the  immigration problem. I would like to see us come together and do that.  We need to do it. But today, we need to solve the immediate crisis. We  will have that broader debate later. Hopefully, by next week we can get  that done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, hopefully, we can continue that work  through the weekend and get that done next week. I know there is other  work the House is getting ready to take up on the appropriations bills.   On one final note, as we approach Father's Day on Sunday, I would  also like to wish the gentleman from Maryland a happy birthday  tomorrow. So, hopefully, the gentleman has some fun events planned this  weekend, maybe go eat some Maryland crabs. If my friend is really  lucky, we will give him some gulf crabs from the Gulf of Mexico. I  won't sing ``Happy Birthday'' to the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to give the gentleman a  review of the restaurant. I am sure it will be really good.   I wish the gentleman well, and I wish all fathers a happy Father's  Day this weekend.   I look forward to seeing the gentleman back in a few days, and with  that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
