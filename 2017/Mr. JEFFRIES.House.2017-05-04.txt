 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  SEIU, which states:         This legislation will leave millions without health       insurance, and decimate the Medicare program.                                                            SEIU,                                                        May 2, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of       the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), America's       largest healthcare union, I write to voice strong opposition       to the American Health Care Act (AHCA). New provisions in the       legislation manage to make a bad bill worse. Not only does       the bill cause millions to lose insurance coverage, face       higher costs, and end Medicaid as we know it, but now it also       strips essential protections for those with pre-existing       conditions. The AHCA will leave millions of men, women, and       children without access to high quality, affordable health       care. The AHCA legislation unequivocally jeopardizes working       families' safety, health, and financial security.        The AHCA will leave millions of Americans without health       insurance and therefore without access to healthcare. The       last available estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional       Budget Office (CBO) estimated about 14 million fewer people       will have health insurance in 2018, and by 2026, 24 million       fewer people will have coverage compared to the current       baseline under the ACA. Unfortunately, we do not have more up       to date information. Despite the importance that healthcare       plays in the lives of working families, Congressional leaders       have indicated that they intend to hold a vote on the       legislation without knowing its impact.        The AHCA also decimates the Medicaid program, rationing and       endangering healthcare for children, seniors, people with       disabilities, and their families as well as for those who       have gained coverage as a result of the Medicaid expansion.       According to CBO, the legislation will cut federal funding       for Medicaid by $880 billion over ten years. Americans know       that Medicaid is working and realize the key role that the       program plays in helping families afford care--including       nursing home care and home and community-based services for       elderly and disabled individuals. Nearly 1 in 5 Americans are       covered under Medicaid and rely on it to get health services       Under the AHCA, those Americans would lose access to vital       care that may mean the difference between life and death.        Additionally, the AHCA would cap the amount of money states       receive in Medicaid funding from the federal government each       year, regardless of the cost of providing healthcare to those       who qualify. Medicaid is already a lean program especially       when measured on a per capita basis, and cuts from capping       federal funding will quickly force states to cut services,       limit enrollment, and decrease payments to hospitals and       other providers. Also, Medicaid is the largest payer for long       term care in the country. The program pays for more than 60       percent of all nursing home residents and for more than 3.2       million Americans with home- and community-based care, which       allows many older Americans and people with disabilities to       remain in their homes rather than move to a more expensive       institutional setting. States--which must balance budgets and       already face fiscal pressures--will not be able to make up       the lost federal dollars and will be forced to deny care. The       inevitable result will be that the AHCA will make it much       harder and more costly for older Americans, people with       disabilities, and their families to get services they need.        In addition, the legislation will effectively end the       Medicaid expansion, which provides health coverage to       millions of people earning low to moderate incomes. While the       bill purports to allow states to maintain the expansion,       states will only receive an enhanced match, or additional       funding, for people who enroll before 2020 and maintain       continuous coverage. It is widely understood that there is       significant churn on and off the program in this coverage       category, and thus over time the reimbursement rates for       states will drop. The resulting large cost shift to states       may lead them to eliminate coverage for this group       altogether. In fact, seven states have triggers that would       end the Medicaid expansion in their state if federal       reimbursement decreases.        Lastly, Medicaid provider rates are already extremely low       in most states. Cuts to Medicaid, capped funding, and       elimination of the Medicaid expansion would lead to further       reductions in rates for providers, leading to job and other       spending cuts in the health care industry that will have       ripple effects on the broader economy. We have serious       concerns that hospitals, especially those that serve       communities that may not have access to many providers, could       be forced to close or cut back services, further reducing       access to care in underserved areas.        Those who purchase coverage in the individual market do not       fare much better under the proposed bill. The AHCA provides       tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 to individuals to       purchase private insurance--substantially lower than the       ACA's current levels for the majority of those who receive       them. Unlike the ACA, it is unclear that people with access       to employer insurance that is unaffordable or inadequate will       be eligible for credits, which would mean that they will be       left without access to coverage and care. The bill also       creates an age tax on older Americans by letting insurance       companies charge people over 60 as much as five times what       they charge others for the same coverage. CBO found that       under the initial bill introduced, premiums for those between       age 50 and 65 would sky-rocket. Moreover, it is unclear what       coverage will be available on the individual market or if the       current healthcare marketplaces will even still exist under       this scheme. Between premiums and out of pocket costs like       deductibles, especially for those most in need of care due to       pre-existing conditions, illness, or age, the result could be       higher costs for less coverage.        A bad bill has managed to have been made even worse by the       ``MacArthur-Meadows Amendment.'' The amendment guts essential       protections for those with pre-existing conditions. It would       allow states to charge those with pre-existing conditions       higher premiums by allowing states to very easily waive       community rating requirements, which currently prohibits this       practice. Furthermore it would grant states, through a waiver       that is approved by default, the ability to opt out of       essential health benefit requirements, a core set of medical       services, like hospitalizations, mental health, maternity       care and prescription drug coverage, which all insurers are       required to cover under the ACA. If states waive       requirements, insurers could leave those who are sick or with       pre-existing conditions out to fend for themselves and face       exorbitant costs to get life-saving care they need. Experts       agree that the funding included in the ``Upton-Long       Amendment'' is completely inadequate to protect those with       pre-existing conditions. The Administration and Congressional       Leaders promised to the American people that those with pre-      existing conditions would remain protected--this bill even       with added amendments defaults on that promise.        Another failure of the AHCA is that it hurts women by       freezing funding to providers like Planned Parenthood,       risking the health and well-being of the 2.5 million people       who rely on the organization for basic care. One in five       women in the United States has visited Planned Parenthood       clinics and for many low-income women of color, including       many of our members, Planned Parenthood is their essential       health provider. For these individuals, healthcare is not an       ideological struggle or about the politics of one policy       versus another; it is a necessity that could mean the       difference between sickness and health.        The real winners of the AHCA appear to be special interests       and the wealthy. The legislation repeals most if not all of       the ACA tax provisions for special interests like the       pharmaceutical and insurance industries, offsetting these       costs with the massive cuts to Medicaid described above. The       bill also maintains the so-called ``Cadillac tax,'' which       places a tax on workers who have robust health coverage,       merely delaying implementation to 2026. Implementation of the       tax will punish people who have decent insurance, and will       encourage employers to further shift health costs to workers.       Furthermore, the incentives for health savings accounts,       which encourage wealthier people to shelter pre-tax income,       are of little use to working households earning low-to       moderate incomes.        The AHCA is not care, it is chaos. The legislation creates       an environment of uncertainty and unaffordability for       Americans and is a bad deal for working families. The bill       radically restructures Medicaid as we know it and cuts       funding for the program significantly, endangers women's       health, and further enriches corporations, special interests,       and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working       families' access to healthcare and financial stability. The       American people will hold you accountable for how you proceed       in this moment. We therefore respectfully ask you vote no on       the American Health Care Act and the proposed amendments to       the legislation when it comes to a vote in the House of       Representatives. We will add this vote to our legislative       scorecard. If you need any additional information please       contact Ilene Stein, Assistant Legislative Director.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,                                           International President.     Mr. Speaker, the House majority has once again made  clear that, under Republican rule, the system is rigged. The fix is in.  The deck is stacked against hardworking Americans, and exhibit A is  your reckless Republican healthcare plan. Under TrumpCare, 24 million  Americans will lose access to health insurance. Under TrumpCare, a  draconian age tax will be imposed on people between 50 and 64. Under  TrumpCare, costs will go up, premiums will go up, copays will go up,  deductibles will go up. Under TrumpCare, tens of millions of Americans  who are living with preexisting conditions will be screwed.   House Republicans are out to destroy the American healthcare system  as we know it, but you will be held accountable for the cruel and  unusual punishment that you have decided to inflict on the American  people.   Vote ``no'' against this draconian piece of legislation.
