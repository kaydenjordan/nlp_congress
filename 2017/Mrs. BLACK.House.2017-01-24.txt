 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule  to provide consideration of H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act. This bill is,  quite literally, the least we can do for American taxpayers and our  voiceless unborn.   Frankly, the fact that we are even here discussing this, and that  there is opposition to this bill at all, really does break my heart,  and it speaks to the depths of the entanglement with the big abortion  industry that exist in some corners of this Chamber. Because, at the  end of the day, you know what this bill really is about? The right to  choose.   We hear our friends across the aisle use the phrase a lot. But what  about the other right to choose, the right of the taxpayer to choose  not to pay for the practice that violates everything that they believe?  That is what we are here to protect.   The American people support this policy, with 6 in 10 surveyed saying  that taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund abortions. And these  are both pro-life and pro-choice.   So today, Madam Speaker, I am asking my colleagues across the aisle  to honor the will of their constituents. I am asking them to remember  the good old Democratic rallying cry of safe, legal, and rare abortion.  Obviously, abortion is not rare today when over 330,000 abortions are  performed in 1 year.   If my colleagues still believe these words, they will join us in  supporting this modest solution to keep unsuspecting taxpayers off of  the hook for this practice. And if they can't vote for this bill then  there is truly not a single limit on abortion that they will accept,  and that is a sad commentary on the state of politics.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 55, I call up  the bill (H.R. 7) to prohibit taxpayer funded abortions, and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   H.R. 7         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H634]]            SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on H.R. 7, currently under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong support of the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, and I thank the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for his unflinching leadership on  this issue.   It was just a week ago that groups of women marched in the streets of  D.C. and other cities across the country apparently ready to write off  this Presidency as it just began.   There were millions of pro-life women who were explicitly told that  they were unwelcome at this event. So today, the people's House is  giving them and the more than 60 percent of Americans from all  political persuasions who oppose taxpayer funding of abortions a voice.   The legislation before us will protect Americans' conscience rights  by ensuring that their hard-earned tax dollars are not used to fund the  destruction of innocent life. That is a principle that Members of both  parties have supported in this Chamber before.   Every year, Democrats and Republicans alike have come together to  support funding bills that maintain the law called the Hyde amendment,  which prohibits the direct Federal funding of abortion, with limited  exceptions. This 40-year-old law has saved an estimated 2 million  lives, but it is not permanent, meaning that this time-honored  protection could be taken away on a whim. What is more, the law, in its  current form, has clear loopholes.   A 2014 GAO study found that taxpayer-funded insurance subsidies could  be used to pay for abortions on over 1,000 ObamaCare plans nationwide.  That is why today we have the opportunity to make this life-affirming  law permanent and governmentwide.   As a mother, a grandmother, and a nurse for more than 40 years, this  measure is especially meaningful to me. During my years in the  healthcare industry, I saw the joy in young parents' eyes when they met  their newborn for the very first time. I held the hands of grieving  spouses and children as they said good-bye to their loved ones. And,  sadly, I witnessed a young woman lose her life due to the effects of a  botched abortion.   These experiences informed my view that all life is a precious gift  from God. I pray that in time this truth will be reflected in our  Nation's laws. Until then, can't we at least do this much.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and  Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), who is the chair of the Judiciary Committee  and a longstanding supporter of pro-life.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Dakota (Mrs. Noem), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I referenced in my opening remarks that  there has been bipartisan support for this measure, the Hyde amendment,  on a yearly basis. I just want to make mention that the former  gentlewoman from California who just spoke did vote for this measure in  the fiscal year 2016 omnibus bill.   Madam Speaker, it is my honor to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the sponsor of the bill and is a  champion for the unborn. It is really an honor for me to have served  with him on this particular issue.    Madam Chair, it is my honor to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), one of my Ways and Means  colleagues and a long-time supporter of pro-life.    Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks), who has been a longstanding  supporter of life.    Madam Speaker, I want to once again mention that there  has been longstanding bipartisan support for the support of the Hyde  amendment.   As a matter of fact, the gentlewoman from California who just spoke  voted for this on three different occasions;  [[Page H638]]  most recently in the MACRA that was passed in 2015; the omnibus, which  was passed in December of 2015 and also in December of 2016; and in the  fiscal year 2017 CR.   It is now my honor to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama  (Mrs. Roby), a member of the Appropriations Committee and a strong  supporter of pro-life.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady), who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, once again, I want to talk about the  longstanding bipartisan support for the Hyde amendment. The gentlewoman  from Florida has supported this measure in the omnibus bill and also  the CR of 2017.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner), who is a member of the Financial Services Committee. She  and her family have been fighting for pro-life issues for many, many,  many years.    Madam Speaker, once again, I want to say that there has  been longstanding bipartisan support for the Hyde amendment, and the  gentlewoman from Florida supported this measure back in 2015 on the  H.R. 2 MACRA bill and the 2015 omnibus bill, H.R. 2029.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs.  Love).    Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I want to remind everyone of the  longstanding bipartisan support for the Hyde amendment. The gentlewoman  from New York voted for this measure in the omnibus bill, H.R. 2029, in  2015, and then on the MACRA bill, also in 2015.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Russell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) one of our newest Members.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LaHood).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), a gentleman who has been a champion of  life.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, today I am simply asking my colleagues  across the aisle not to flip-flop on this issue. This legislation isn't  just the right thing to do; it also has broad support.   Polling shows that 6 in 10 Americans agree that taxpayer dollars  should not fund abortions. Despite this fact, a nonpartisan government  study found that abortions could be funded with taxpayer dollars  through ObamaCare, and this demands a response.   Today we have an opportunity to invest in women's health over  abortion by passing H.R. 7 and making the Hyde amendment permanent and  governmentwide.   I urge my colleagues to reject this motion to recommit and to vote  ``yes'' on H.R. 7.   I yield back the balance of my time.
