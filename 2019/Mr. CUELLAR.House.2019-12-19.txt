 Madam Speaker, I support the USMCA, NAFTA 2.1, because  we are doing this in a bipartisan way.    I thank Speaker Pelosi and the working group and Chairman Neal and  his staff for working so hard; my Texas colleague Kevin Brady and his  staff for working so hard; Ambassador Lighthizer and our friends to the  south, the Mexicans, for working together.   My district is the epicenter of trade between the U.S. and Mexico. My  city of Laredo handles 14,000 to 16,000 trailers every single day. The  Laredo customs district handles 60 percent of all the trade between the  U.S. and Mexico.   That means more than $1.7 billion of goods flow between the U.S. and  Mexico every day. That is over $1 million every single minute. Trade is  good. It means jobs, jobs, jobs.   I thank the committee for adding the signature environmental  safeguard, the North American Development Bank. That is total, with the  EPA, over $500 million for drinking water and for waste treatment  plants.   Members, pass USMCA. It means one thing: jobs, jobs, jobs.
