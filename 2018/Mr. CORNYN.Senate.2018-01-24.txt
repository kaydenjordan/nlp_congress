 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Monday, Democrats relented after 3 long  days and allowed the government to reopen. They agreed to pass a  continuing resolution to reopen the government until February 8.   I am glad they finally decided to fund the Children's Health  Insurance Program on which 9 million vulnerable children rely as well  as fund our military and essential government entities  [[Page S480]]  that could not operate during the shutdown. Now we have to work on  other items that have been stalled and held hostage too.   The first is disaster aid, which has been held up for months. The  House of Representatives passed an $81 billion disaster relief bill  back in December, but so far that package has gone nowhere in the  Senate. That is incredibly disappointing and exacerbates the hardships  to the victims of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey, as well as the  folks out West who suffered extreme wildfires, floods, and mudslides.  They need to get access to that $81 billion of disaster relief funding  the House passed last December, but that too has been held hostage in  the U.S. Senate.   It is especially disappointing in my home State of Texas. I just got  off the phone talking with Governor Abbott, who is perplexed--the  kindest word I can think of--as to why we would continue to delay  disaster relief to the people who suffered as a result of Hurricane  Harvey.   I am sure Governor Scott in Florida feels the same way. I am sure  Governor Brown out in California feels the same way. I am sure the  Governors of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands feel the same way. What  is wrong with Congress? Why can't they take up and pass an $81 billion  disaster relief supplemental that the House sent the Senate in  December?   Last August, Hurricane Harvey devastated 28,000 square miles on the  Texas coast. It has been called the most extreme rain event in history,  certainly in the history of the United States. Highways were flooded.  Thousands of homes were gutted. Places like Port Arthur, Beaumont, and  Houston have not returned to normal. Routines are disrupted, shops and  businesses remain closed, and houses are being renovated or rebuilt.  But because of the size and the scope of the devastation, it is hard to  get building supplies and it is hard to get the workers to rebuild  these damaged homes and businesses.    In Rockport, where I visited over Thanksgiving, Harvey made landfall  with 150-mile-per-hour winds and a 13-foot storm surge. As of the end  of December, 284 families were reported to still lack permanent  housing. Some people are even living in tents.   Rockport Mayor C.J. Wax said that 70 percent of businesses in  Rockport remain closed--70 percent. According to the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, one-third of Rockport is so badly damaged that it  will be impossible to rebuild. Think about that. Think if this hit your  hometown. One-third of your hometown is so badly damaged by a natural  disaster that it will not be rebuilt, and 70 percent of the businesses  in your hometown are closed and haven't reopened. Think of how you  would feel.   Over in Nueces County, meanwhile, which includes Corpus Christi and  Port Aransas, officials have been frustrated because they haven't  received the temporary housing assistance they need. Although FEMA--the  Federal Emergency Management Agency--continues to marshal the full  extent of its resources to help some people, for various reasons, many  people are still living in motels and, as I said, even tents. This is  completely unacceptable in the United States of America, especially  while the House of Representatives has acted to produce a disaster  relief bill, but it has been held hostage here in the Senate. This  isn't a Democratic issue or a Republican issue; this is something we  should be clamoring to solve--and not only clamoring, we should be  acting to vote on that disaster relief today.   Stories like these are why we need to move additional funds for  disaster relief without delay. It is not just Texas, as I said, it is  Floridians, Puerto Ricans, and people who live in the Virgin Islands  and the wildfire-ravaged parts of California as well. The Senate has  been dragging its feet long enough, and the longer we wait, the more  people forget.   I remember when the President and Mrs. Trump, along with the  President's entire Cabinet, came down to Texas after Hurricane Harvey.  The Speaker of the House, the majority leader of the House, and leaders  on both sides of the aisle came down to Texas and said: We want to  help. And the House has. The House passed an $81 billion disaster  relief bill. But this unrelated immigration issue shut down the  government. This is another one of the hostages that need to be  released.   June 1 is the beginning of hurricane season, and it is imperative  that flood mitigation and storm surge protection projects begin without  further delay. With support from Harris County, the city of Houston and  members of the engineering community have identified the necessary  projects, but we can't get started until we pass a disaster relief  supplemental similar to the one the House passed in December. I talked  to Mayor Turner of Houston, TX, one of the largest cities in the United  States. He is beside himself, knowing that the House has passed this  appropriation but that the Senate doesn't seem anywhere near to taking  it up. It is hard for me to explain to him why the Senate has not  acted. The simple fact is, this disaster relief should not be held  hostage any longer.   Amidst the disaster, I do want to mention one piece of good news on  the hurricane front. I am glad that FEMA has responded to Members of  Congress who asked that they accept applications for relief from  nonprofits, like houses of worship, that were affected by Hurricane  Harvey.   This is a picture of one of the synagogues I attended in the  Meyerland community in Houston, TX, which shows some of the devastation  the synagogue there experienced. The rabbi asked me: Would you please  go back to Washington and see whether, on a nonsectarian basis, you can  get FEMA to expand its relief efforts to respond to houses of worship,  many of which use or volunteer their facilities for community meetings  and the like. So it is good to know that churches, synagogues, and  other houses of worship will be able to get that sort of relief.   This is the United Orthodox Synagogue that I visited after Harvey,  where, as I mentioned, I saw this firsthand and had that discussion  with the rabbi.   The other issue we have to address is budget caps. This is another  issue which has been held hostage by this unrelated immigration issue  known as DACA, which everybody has heard so much about now. In  conversations regarding the budget caps--these are the spending levels  for this current fiscal year.   The fiscal year of the U.S. Government lasts from October 1 to  September 30, and we are already well into the fiscal year. We are in  January. So we have already been on continuing resolutions because the  spending caps have not been agreed to, and we all know why by now-- because our Democratic colleagues refuse to agree to the spending caps,  so we can get a spending bill that funds the military and the rest of  government, until they get a solution for the DACA issue. This is  another hostage that has been taken. I am very worried about its impact  on our military because we already know that our military is in dire  straits when it comes to readiness, and they can't operate on a 3-week  continuing resolution, which is the one we are on now. Even if the  spending caps were agreed to today, it would take the Appropriations  Committee a matter of additional weeks to come up with a bill we could  vote on.    As a result of the shutdown, the Democratic leader--who said he voted  against the 4-week continuing resolution because he didn't like  continuing resolutions--has guaranteed us at least two more continuing  resolutions even if the spending caps were agreed upon in the next few  days. This is terrible for the Pentagon, the people we depend upon to  defend us and keep our country safe. This is an impossible situation  for them to manage and to be as effective and efficient as we want them  to be.   The Defense Department has been operating under continuing  resolutions for more than 36 months since 2010--36 months since 2010.  By way of comparison, in the previous 8 years, the military was funded  that way for less than 9 months. The consequences are clear, and they  are deadly. Many of the mishaps that have involved our naval vessels,  such as the McCain and the Fitzgerald, are the result of sailors spread  thin, budgets spread thin, not enough training, and not enough  preparation for the challenges they face. So these mishaps occur, and  people die.   The Wall Street Journal reports that only 5 of 58 brigade combat  teams in the Army are prepared to fight. Only 5 out of 58 are prepared  to fight. Now, I  [[Page S481]]  don't think our adversaries should take any comfort from that because I  know Americans well enough to know that if there were an imminent  threat, we would rise to the occasion and make sure that all 58 of them  were prepared to fight, but right now, 5 out of 58. The U.S. Air Force,  which provides the airpower, is short 2,000 pilots.   Our military dominance across the globe is never guaranteed, and we  know there are many signs that our military dominance is eroding. When  American power erodes, when we retreat, either for policy or fiscal  reasons, there are other people more than happy to fill the void. When  that happens, the world becomes a more dangerous place, miscalculations  occur, and conflict breaks out.   Defense Secretary Jim Mattis put the matter succinctly last year when  he said: ``For all of the heartache caused by the loss of troops during  [our recent] wars, no enemy in the field has done more to harm the  combat readiness of our military than sequestration.'' He might have  said ``Congress'' because Congress is responsible for sequestration.  Unfortunately, General Mattis is right. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen,  and marines who so bravely serve our country deserve all of the  political and financial support we can muster.   We need to quit fooling ourselves into believing that our security  won't be negatively impacted by our current funding approach. We need  to quit dawdling and raise the defense spending caps without further  delay. It is dangerous not to do so, and lives have been lost as a  result of the lack of readiness caused by underfunding our military.   Yesterday when the Senate Democratic leader spoke, he said that  common sense and bipartisanship won and the government reopened. As  conversations addressing spending caps and disaster relief continue, we  need to make sure that those two things continue to prevail--common  sense and bipartisanship--particularly when it comes to funding our  military and other critical government functions, and to make sure they  are no longer held hostage to an unrelated immigration issue that we  are working on as hard as we know how to do. We understand the clock is  ticking, and both political parties are demonstrating their good faith  in working to solve that problem. So let's let these other hostages go.
