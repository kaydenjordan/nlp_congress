 Madam President, I would like to  congratulate and honor the city of Greenville in South Carolina for  their opening of Unity Park on May 19, 2022.   Harlan Kelsey, a nationally known landscape artist commissioned by  the Municipal League of Greenville, published recommendations for  improvements to Greenville more than a century ago in 1907. His  recommendations identified what is now the site for Unity Park. The  transformative 60-acre park will help bring people together to  celebrate the diversity of the Greenville community.   The park comes after 22 months of construction, nearly $13 million in  private donations, and countless hours of community engagement. With  this addition, the city has committed to bringing more affordable  housing to nine acres near the park, created a location to celebrate  the community, built a place to continue highlighting the rich history  of Greenville, and is transforming one of our State's designated  Opportunity Zones: Unity Park will feature playgrounds and splashpads,  a welcome center, numerous trails and bridges, and an observation  tower.   I commend the city of Greenville on the park's opening and their  commitment to growth, success, and community.                            ____________________
