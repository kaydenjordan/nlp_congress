 Mr. President, there is a rather complicated issue that  is out there that not many people are aware of. It emanates from back  in 1996 with the passage of something called the Communication Decency  Act.   Just a few weeks before the 2020 election, Twitter did what was  previously unthinkable: It suppressed a longstanding, legitimate news  outlet--that was the New York Post--from sharing an article either  publicly or privately it deemed unfavorable to Presidential candidate  Joe Biden. Obviously, they were concerned about Joe Biden, and they  were using this act to suppress information that may not have been  favorable. That is not what is supposed to happen, what it is supposed  to do. To make it worse, they suspended an account of the Post--that is  a major news outlet--for over 24 hours.   While other big tech entities suppressed the story as well, the  depths of Twitter's censorship reached new heights, telling users that  sharing the article could be ``potentially harmful.'' There is no  criteria to determine what is potentially harmful; they just decided-- it is a liberal mindset, and they want to punish people who are not  sharing their mindset.   Contrast that with the refusal to moderate any comments made by  Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who called Israel a  ``cancerous growth'' to be ``uprooted and destroyed'' and for the  ``elimination of the Zionist regime'' through ``firm, armed  resistance'' despite having a policy against hateful conduct and  glorifying violence. That is what they did. Those are the words. That  is what they did.  [[Page S7172]]    Yet it proves what President Trump has been talking about for a long  period of time on social media. Look what they have done to him over  the last 4 years.   It is time to make sure that Twitter and other social media platforms  are held accountable for engaging in censorship by repealing section  230 of the Communications Decency Act. Now, that sounds a little  complicated. The Communications Decency Act--we know why it was  started, but we know times have changed, and now it has turned into a  very liberal political organization.   For over 20 years, social media platforms have benefited from  protectionism unprecedented in the modern era--a complete liability  shield protecting them from how they moderate or censor content posted  for their users. To add insult to injury, there is no one to check the  partisan censorship of these social media platforms. Instead, they are  coddled by section 230's ``Good Samaritan'' provision, which allows  ``good-faith'' efforts to restrict objectionable material. But the  problem is, they are the ones who decide what is objectionable.   We all know Jesus's parable of the Good Samaritan. The moral  imperative that comes from the parable has guided many legislative  protections for those seeking to do good--doctors responding to  problems with people in midair. I can remember many times I was  involved as a volunteer pilot helping to get people medical care.  People who are trying to do the right thing. We know that is  significant. We know that is what the history was supposed to be on  this section, section 230. It was intended to make sure that Twitter  could flag and remove unquestionably harmful content, like ISIS and  their propaganda videos.   In the case of the social media platforms, however, it amounts to  nothing more than the fox guarding the henhouse. Instead of focusing on  moderation to protect users from death threats or harassment and to  prevent criminal behavior, Twitter is allowed to determine what is  ``otherwise objectionable'' and censor it from the platform, with no  right to appeal and no transparency. I mean, where else can you go in  America and find someone who is totally immune from that type of  behavior? You can't. It doesn't exist.   This is a case in point. Last year, they kowtowed to the Chinese  Communist Party by removing the accounts of more than 100 dissidents  ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. I  remember that well. I remember where I was when that happened. But they  didn't want people to know that type of thing actually went on, and  that was somehow objectionable.    Twitter's censorship and actions over the past few years make it  clear it has decided that President Trump is objectionable, and they  decide that they are just going to act accordingly. That is not  surprising when you look at the employee culture they have in that  media.   Here is the problem with section 230. According to a strict  interpretation of the 1996 law, that is allowed. Partisan censorship is  allowed. Senator Ron Wyden even admitted that, when written, section  230 wasn't about neutrality or protecting the free marketplace of ideas  on platforms.   Clearly, we need to completely overhaul section 230, and the best way  to do it is just repeal it. Repeal the whole thing. That is what the  President wants to do. Then you could start over again and build up.   Times have changed. The argument we hear against reforming alone or  repealing would be that any changes to section 230 would give social  media platforms like Twitter greater control over content on their  platforms. They are not wrong, but that argument ignores the fact that  censorship is already happening for Americans due to their political  beliefs, in violation of the First Amendment--it is supposed to protect  people--without any transparency or recourse.   Others believe in the need to reform 230 incrementally, but those  solutions are merely bandaids on a bullet wound. We have seen the  negative impact of incremental reforms. They just don't work. A good  example: Efforts to hold users accountable for information by requiring  a ``real name'' associated with an account has seen Native Americans  blocked from platforms for using their legal names.   Social media platforms and supporters of section 230's last-ditch  argument is to tell conservative voices to create their own social  media platforms since they clearly aren't welcome in those that are  existing today. That sounds good, except that the problem is that  Twitter and others have a de facto monopoly on social media. House  Democrats agree. They wrote a 400-plus page report arguing Big Tech  constitutes a monopoly.   Just remember the internet, what it was like back in 1996. In 1996,  only 20 million Americans had access to the internet--only 20 million  Americans in 1996. Today, 313 million Americans have access. So now it  is a way of life.   The reality is that section 230 is simply outdated for today's usage  and is a strong case for why all laws should sunset. One of the  problems I have with laws that are passed is that they can be passed,  the problem is corrected that caused the laws to be passed, but the  laws stay on the books. That is exactly what has happened with this.   Section 230 is outdated and needs to be changed. Otherwise, we will  find ourselves here time and again, forced to rectify decades-old laws  with modern technology and ideas.   Let me simplify. Section 230 allows Twitter and other liberal social  media companies to be exempt from liability--there is no accountability  whatsoever--for what their users say. For example, Twitter can't be  held responsible for someone who posts a death threat against me, and I  understand that. That is where we are today. But they are also  protected from what they censor even if it is in violation of the First  Amendment or it is protected speech. No one else has this shield. No  one else in society has this, which is why President Trump is right. We  need a total repeal.   If you look at what they had done to President Trump over the last 4  years, you will know exactly what I am talking about. But the place for  repeal is not the Defense authorization bill.   There is an idea that the Defense authorization bill for 60 years in  a row now has passed, and so everybody who has something that doesn't  pass normally, they try to put it on as an amendment--having nothing to  do with the military and having nothing to do with our defense system  for the ensuing year. So that is how this one was decided. They put  this on. The problem is, if it had that language repealing it, we would  not have a defense bill. So there is not a choice in this case. We need  a place for repealing section 230, and we need to do it.   The NDAA is about making sure that our troops are cared for. It is  for our kids in the field. They are the ones we are supporting. They  are the ones who need us. If we don't have this Defense authorization  bill passed by December 31, our pilots are not going to get flight pay;  the kids are not going to get hazard pay. The whole thing will fall  apart.   Just think about the problems we are having in the military. One of  the big problems is--and the Presiding Officer recognizes this because  he is on this committee--right now, our big problem is how to get more  pilots into the Air Force, into the services. They can't do it because  of the competition out there. We can't compete with the private sector.  Now, if we take away their flight privileges, then it could be goodbye  to most of our pilots.   We just need to get this thing done. It should not be on the Defense  bill. I want to make this appeal to make sure that no one has the idea  that the National Defense Authorization Act is the place to have it.   I give the President and my colleagues my commitment that I will do  everything possible to work toward a complete repeal of section 230  through other means. It has to happen. President Trump is right. Total  repeal is the only answer if we are going to make sure we get this  thing done--not on the bill, not on the Defense authorization bill, but  in any of the other vehicles that come along. It has to be done.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S7173]]     Mr. President, I think it is important that we  acknowledge what is going on right now. What is going on is that the  most significant vote of the year is taking place. It is called the  Defense authorization bill, the NDAA. It has passed every year for 60  years now. This will be the 60th year it is passed. Nothing else has a  record like that.   Yet there is always trauma at the tail end, and the reason there is  trauma is that everyone knows it is going to pass--and it is going to  pass--so anything they can't pass during the normal process of the  year, for any number of reasons, they try to put on this as an  amendment. Some things are not acceptable because they have the effect  of killing the bill.   Now, we have two people who have been working with the committees  putting this thing together. I know that the Presiding Officer knows  this, but these people have worked an entire year and many, many more  than half the weekends. People have this idea that people don't work in  Washington on causes. They do on this one.   John Bonsell in my office has been the director, the support of the  bill, with Liz King on the Democratic side. They have worked hand in  hand together. People talk about how Democrats and Republicans fight  with each other. Not on this bill. We all support it. We all want it.  We all want to make sure it is done and it is done right.   So we have a defense authorization bill. It will be the largest one  that we have had in the history of the Defense authorization bills. It  is one that, without it, we are not going to be able to take care of  our kids in the field.   We have to remember that, while there are a lot of hitchhikers on  this bill on causes that we have determined to be worthwhile causes, we  don't do it if it is going to be something that will take down the  bill. So we want to make sure that nothing would jeopardize passing the  Defense authorization bill.   Now, the key is December 31 of this year. If we don't have the bill  passed by December 31 of this year, I mentioned that we have problems,  that any of the specialist groups--and I talk about the pilots; I talk  about those involved in hazard occupations--the SEALs--the individuals  who are out there risking their lives to a greater extent than others  do in the military. And they are out there doing it for this reason,  and we want to make sure that they are willing to take these risks. We  want to make sure that we are taking good care of people.   I run into people all the time who say: You are always so concerned  about our military. Yet the chief competition that we have is with  whom: Russia and China? Russia and China actually, after the last  administration--that was the Obama administration. In the last 5  years--that would be from 2010 to 2015--he knocked down the military  budget by 25 percent. It had never happened before--not since World War  II anyway. Yet we found ourselves in a situation where we couldn't  compete.   Now, they will argue with you, and they will say: Well, we spend more  money on defense than Russia and China put together. That is true, but  there is a big difference, and that is that in Communist countries they  don't care about taking care of their troops. Our job is to make sure  that our kids have a prosperous career. They want to defend their  country, but they also have families. They have to take care of their  families.   Housing has been a huge problem in the military, so we want to make  sure that we have good housing for our troops--not just here in the  United States but around the world--and we are doing that.   Now, in Communist countries they give them a gun and say: Go out and  kill people. They don't care about the troops. They don't spend any of  that money.   So the largest expense, the largest ticket on running a military  operation is taking care of the people. So that is why it is important  that people understand this.   There is also a document that nobody reads anymore. It is called the  Constitution. You read that and say: What are we supposed to be doing  in Washington? We get involved in so many different things. Yet, when  you read the Constitution, it says that our primary concern should be  to defend against an outside enemy, and then other areas-- transportation and a few other areas--are mentioned. But the No. 1  concern is that we have to have a military that is second to none. We  want to make sure.   Let me say this about our President. When he first came into office,  President Trump recognized what had happened to our military and had  recognized that there are things like hypersonic--that is a very  recent, modern technology that they are working on in China and Russia  and other places, and we are actually behind them at this time.   People assume that America has better everything in the military than  China has and Russia has, and that is not true. They have artillery  systems that are better than the artillery systems that we currently  have.   So we have a job that I consider to be the most significant job-- significant job for the defense of our country, and it is just that: to  defend our country.   I want to applaud all of these people who work long hours. We are now  to the point where they are what they call turning the page. We are  ready to pass a bill. We are in the process of getting signatures from  the committees.   There are a lot of people who don't like the idea of having to sign a  bill and sign on to a bill, yet they know that in order to maintain a  superior position over China and Russia, we have to do that, and we  have to show our superiority, and we have to make it last. That is what  we are doing right now. It is a very significant time.   I anticipate that we are going to be able to get this done, and I  applaud the President for the time that he has spent and the money that  he has spent on rebuilding our military. You hear him say all the time  that we now have the strongest military that we have ever had and we  are in great shape. But we are still rebuilding. We still have areas  where our adversaries have better equipment than we do.   So that is what is going on today. That is what is taking place. It  is a very proud time that we can say that we are now addressing those  things that are the most significant things going on in Washington  today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.
