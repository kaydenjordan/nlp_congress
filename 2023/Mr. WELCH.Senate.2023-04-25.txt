 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 30th  anniversary of the U.S. Green Building Council--USGBC--founded in April  1993. This member-led, nonprofit organization has helped schools,  businesses, cities, and even countries build and operate better  buildings that transform lives. USGBC's LEED certification program,  short for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, has grown to  become the world's most acclaimed and  [[Page S1339]]  widely used green building system, with 105,000 projects in more than  185 countries.   In the United States, over 400,000 housing units and more  nonresidential projects have applied this system to achieve LEED  certification. In Vermont, we have achieved more than 120  certifications, and at least 91 professionals have LEED credentials.  These sustainable projects include K-12 schools and higher education,  offices, multifamily housing, retail, manufacturing, and additional  building types. More than 5 million square feet of space have received  LEED certification.   As Americans contend with rising prices and energy costs, more green  buildings mean more dollars back in the pockets of small business and  families. That is because research has repeatedly found that energy- efficient, lower-waste green buildings benefit the bottom line. LEED- certified buildings reduce day-to-day costs year-over-year while  benefiting our climate. They help building owners lower vacancies.  Plus, they improve staff well-being and productivity.   When USGBC started, there was no agreement in the marketplace on what  constituted ``green building,'' let alone any kind of accepted,  codified mechanism to certify it. Now, 30 years later, USGBC has primed  the market to value better-performing buildings that lower costs and  waste, mitigate climate impacts, and improve health.   Congratulations to this incredible, member-led organization. Here is  to another impactful 30 years.                            ____________________
