 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B  Improvement Act of 2017.   I am pleased that Chairman Brady, along with Health Subcommittee  Chairman Tiberi, Ranking Member Levin, and I worked in a bipartisan  manner to draft this legislation. It brings together a number of  important measures to improve Medicare part B. I encourage all of our  colleagues to support it.   As I said during the bipartisan Ways and Means Committee markup of  H.R. 3178, I hope the committee will be able to hold more meetings like  this. This is what the American people want and expect from their  Members: to get things done in a bipartisan manner.   The bill before us today is pretty straightforward. It makes  important changes to Medicare part B in a number of ways. It includes a  commonsense transitional policy for home infusion services, cosponsored  by Mr. Tiberi and Mr. Pascrell.   Our colleagues Mr. Bishop and Mr. Mike Thompson are cosponsors of  language to streamline Medicare rules to improve access to medically  necessary prosthetics and orthotics.   Mr. John Lewis cosponsored language to help dialysis facilities  improve backlogs so they can more efficiently treat end-stage renal  disease.   Ms. DelBene and Mr. Mike Thompson are cosponsors of a bill that  allows telehealth so patients can receive dialysis in the comfort of  their own home.   Finally, the measure includes clarification language to Stark laws  that Mr. Kind led to provide more certainty for Medicare providers.   Our colleagues on both sides of the aisle worked hard on these bills,  and I am pleased we can move them forward in a bipartisan manner.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3178, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), who is a coauthor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), whose husband served with great distinction as  a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the staff for their hard work on this  bill, including Amy Hall, Sarah Levin, Melanie Egorin from the  Democratic staff; Emily Murry and Nick Uehlecke from the Republican  staff; Jessica Shapiro from the House Legislative Counsel's office; Ira  Burney, Jennifer Druckman, and Lisa Yen from CMS; and the staff of the  Congressional Budget Office, Tom Bradley, Rebecca Yip, and Lara  Robillard. I want to thank them all for their very, very hard work.   We have this rare opportunity, this rare moment where we have broad  agreement on this legislation, and I hope all Members of the House can  find their way to be supportive of this legislation, and I hope the  path of bipartisanship that we have chosen here can serve as a reminder  of what we can get done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
