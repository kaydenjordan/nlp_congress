 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, on Friday, the U.S. job market got  another monthly checkup. Hiring in May was up from the previous month  but still fell short of the level experts and American employers had  hoped for.   Of course, the highest expectations for our economic recovery under  Democratic control were set by none other than the Democrats  themselves.   Back in February, the Biden administration pointed to projections  that its so-called American Rescue Plan would boost job creation in  2021 by 4 million over existing expectations. Meeting that new higher  goal meant the economy would have to grow by over 900,000 new jobs a  month. Needless to say, the job market is nowhere close--nowhere  close--to meeting this target. In fact, hiring is falling short of  where nonpartisan experts forecasted it would be even if--even if-- Democrats hadn't rammed through a multitrillion-dollar liberal wish  list this spring.   I have been clear on the dangers of that bill from the beginning, and  the data is now spelling it out very clearly. Democrats' bloated  additions to unemployment insurance haven't just failed to help our  recovery, they have actually hurt it, and the consequences on Main  Street are now in full focus.   As hiring lags, employers are struggling to entice workers to rejoin  and keep their facilities staffed. After a year that already tested  budgets to the breaking point, small business owners are having to dig  even deeper to attract staff, offering bigger bonuses and flexible  hours. But even that hasn't been enough. For the fourth straight month,  one survey of small businesses came back with record-high reports of  unfilled job openings. As one small business owner in London, KY,  reported to me, ``The current labor shortage is by far the worst'' he  has ever seen. In fact, his short staff has had such a hard time  keeping up with orders that ``customers are already considering moving  business from this facility to other states.''   Unfortunately, this situation isn't unique. As I traveled the State  last week, I heard the same story from employers of all sizes.  Kentucky's labor force is still 90,000 workers below prepandemic  levels. Nationwide, workforce participation has remained stagnant for  nearly a year. All the while, prices for consumers are continuing to  creep up.   This is exactly what Republicans and nonpartisan experts had warned  against months ago. We urged Democrats not to force our country's  promising early recovery into a permanent defensive crouch. Now, as  States and business owners grapple with the consequences, I hope  Democrats in Washington are paying attention and learning from this  costly mistake                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on another matter, after a week  of work with our constituents, the Senate reconvenes with a chance to  refocus on the most important issues facing our folks back home.   Already on multiple occasions this year, we have demonstrated that  even a narrowly divided Chamber is capable of taking productive,  bipartisan steps on serious issues. Wide majorities have come together  to extend access to the critical PPP loans, invest in drinking water  infrastructure, and equip the justice system to better combat hate  [[Page S3945]]  crimes against Asian Americans. This week, the Senate is set to do the  same on legislation regarding competition with China, and many of our  colleagues are working hard to make further consensus possible on  issues that have historically enjoyed bipartisan support, like  transportation infrastructure.   Remember, this sort of collaboration on serious priorities is what  the American people insisted upon just last November. They elected a  50-50 Senate, shrunk Democrats' majority in the House, and took  President Biden up on a promise to unite the country. So the question  at the outset of this work period is how Democrats will use their  razor-thin majority over the next few weeks. Unfortunately, the  Democratic leader already signaled his answer a week ago by laying out  a June agenda that is transparently designed to fail.   As I understand it, Senate Democrats intend to focus this month on  the demands of their radical base: exploiting the cause of pay fairness  to send a windfall to trial lawyers; saddling hospitals, schools, and  small businesses with crippling new legal burdens if they fail to keep  pace with ``woke'' social norms; and opening an unprecedented new front  in the left's war on the Second Amendment.   As written, these are not proposals aimed at earning bipartisan  support. They are not designed to clear the Senate's necessarily high  bar for ending debate. Bizarrely, it appears they are being floated in  order to illustrate that the bar is too high.   After a spring in which the Senate has repeatedly passed mainstream  legislation by wide margins, Democrats have decided that now--now is  the time to argue that the legislative process is somehow broken.   Let's not forget the Democrats' poster child for why the Senate  should change its rules is a bill that would forcibly change the rules  for elections in every State in America.   Let me say that again. Democrats' poster child for why the Senate  should change its rules is a bill that would forcibly change the rules  for elections in every State in America.   Their marquee bill, S. 1, is such a brazen political power grab that  the question isn't whether it could earn bipartisan support; the  question is how wide the bipartisan opposition will be. This is the  bill the Democratic leader has placed at the vanguard of his campaign  to destroy the filibuster, even though multiple Members of his own  majority are now on the record objecting to it.   So make no mistake: Failing to sell reckless, wholesale changes to  our democracy isn't proof that the guardrails should be removed; it is  a reminder that they are there for a reason.   The American people rightly expect a 50-50 Senate to spend its time  finding common ground, but our Democratic colleagues seem to believe  that the most important expectations are those of their far-left  fringe. They put forward an agenda that is designed to fail, and fail  it will.                            ____________________
