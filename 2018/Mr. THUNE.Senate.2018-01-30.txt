 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the good news about tax reform continues to  roll in--wage increases, better benefits, increased investment, and  employee bonuses. So far, more than 250 companies have announced good  news for their employees--pay hikes, increased retirement  contributions, or bonuses, and the list continues to grow.   Last week, JPMorgan Chase, Disney, Starbucks, and FedEx all announced  increased investment in American workers. JPMorgan Chase announced that  it will raise wages for 22,000 workers, add thousands of new jobs, and  open 400 new branches in the United States. It also plans to increase  its lending to small businesses. Disney will invest in employees'  education and provide employee bonuses. Starbucks is raising wages,  increasing benefits, and rewarding employees with company stock. FedEx  announced plans to expedite raises and invest $1.5 billion to expand  its FedEx Express hub in Indianapolis. It is also making a $1.5 billion  contribution to its pension plan. To top it off, yesterday ExxonMobil  announced that, thanks in part to tax reform, it will invest an  additional $35 billion into the U.S. economy over the next 5 years.  That means a lot of new jobs and opportunities for American workers.   Stories like this are why we made business tax reform a key part of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Obviously, a huge priority was immediately  lowering Americans' tax bills, which is why we lowered rates across the  board, nearly doubled the standard deduction, and doubled the child tax  credit. But our other priority was creating the kind of economy in  which Americans can thrive for the long-term--an economy that would  create good jobs, higher wages, and more opportunities.   So how do we go about doing that? Well, the only way for individual  Americans to thrive is for American businesses and the American economy  to thrive. So we took action to improve the situation for American  businesses.   Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, American businesses, large and  small, were weighed down by high tax rates and growth-killing tax  provisions. Plus, our outdated international tax rules left America's  global businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed all that. We lowered tax rates  across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses,  farms, and ranches. We expanded the business owners' ability to recover  investments they make in their businesses, which will free up cash that  they can reinvest in their operations and their workers.   We lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate, which up until  January 1 was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We  brought the U.S. international tax system into the 21st century by  replacing our outdated worldwide system with a modernized territorial  tax system so that American businesses are not operating at a  disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts. Now, just a month into  the new tax law, we are already seeing the results.   Thanks to the new tax law, businesses are seeing a future of growth,  and based on those forecasts, they are making plans to invest in their  workers, raise wages, create new jobs, and invest in the American  economy: AT&T, Boeing, Fiat Chrysler, Bank of America, Home Depot,  Great Western Bank in my State of South Dakota, First Hawaiian Bank,  SunTrust Bank, Comcast, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Humana,  Visa, Nationwide Insurance, JetBlue Airlines. The list of companies  announcing good news for American workers thanks to tax reform goes on  and on and on.   Tech giant Apple announced that as a result of tax reform, it will  bring home almost $250 billion in cash that it has been keeping  overseas and invest it here in the United States. That is good news for  the American economy, and it is a direct result of the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act.   Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our Tax Code encouraged American  businesses to keep cash overseas. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ended that.  Now that we have altered the Tax Code to remove the penalty for  bringing profits home to the United States, we can expect to see more  companies bringing profits home and investing in the U.S. economy the  way that Apple is doing.   We have seen a tremendous amount of good news this month, but it  really is only the beginning. As the benefits of tax reform continue to  sink in, we expect to see more growth, more jobs, and more  opportunities for American workers, and we expect to see the kind of  economy that will provide security and prosperity for Americans for the  long term.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
