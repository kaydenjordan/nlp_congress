 Mr. President, I take the floor to urge an ``aye'' vote  on invoking cloture on the issue of Montenegro's admittance into NATO.  I would point out that 25 of the 28 nations in NATO have already voted  in favor of Montenegro's accession into NATO. Only the United States,  Spain, and the Netherlands have yet to weigh in.   I would like to point out that Montenegro's admittance into NATO is a  critical test of the alliances's open-door policy. I don't ask my  colleagues to take my word for it. I would just like to point out that  our Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Curtis Scaparrotti,  last week declared that Montenegro's accession into NATO is  ``absolutely critical,'' that they have had this desire. They have met  the map, and they understand NATO'S outreach and ability to bring  [[Page S1988]]  in those who want to determine their own means of government and become  part of NATO.   If we were to lose this, it would be a setback to many of the other  nations and peoples, particularly in Eastern Europe, who were looking  forward to and have their eyes on the West and becoming part of NATO.   I would point out to my colleagues that the Russians attach some  importance to Montenegro because they tried a coup to overthrow the  government. The Russians tried a coup to overthrow the government of  this small, beautiful, and strategically important nation.   I would just point out that our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson,  wrote a letter urging Montenegro's membership to be ratified, saying  that it was ``strongly in the interests of the United States.'' In his  letter he strongly emphasized that Montenegro's accession to NATO would  support greater integration, democratic reform, trade, and security and  stability in the entire Balkans region.   I won't take too much time in the Senate except to say that I think  this is more than an accession or non-accession of a small 750,000- person nation. It is a test in this contest that we are now engaged in  with Vladimir Putin, who has committed to extending the reach and  influence of the Russian Government and Russian influence to the point  where he attempted a coup to overthrow the freely elected government of  Montenegro. That coup failed, but I can assure my colleagues that if we  turn down Montenegro, it will not remain the democracy that it is  today.   General Breedlove, who is our former commander in Europe said:         Montenegro is a very strategic place. Can you imagine A2/AD       Bubbles in Montenegro?    I urge my colleagues for a resounding ``aye'' vote in bringing  cloture to an end and bringing Montenegro into the community of NATO,  which is needed more now than at any time since the end of the Cold  War. I, also, by the way, recommend to my colleagues a visit to,  really, one of the more beautiful countries on Earth.   I yield for the Senator from South Carolina.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina,  particularly on the issue of Russian sanctions.   Yesterday, we saw the people of Russia, particularly the younger  people, demonstrating peacefully in the streets of the cities and towns  throughout Russia in order to protest the corruption and dictatorship  of Vladimir Putin. At the time, the leader of the opposition was  jailed. He was in the process of putting together a study that showed  that Medvedev, who was Putin's puppet, was one of the wealthiest people  on Earth.   I was heartened by the willingness and the courage of the people of  Russia to stand up and protest a corrupt, dictatorial, and brutal  government that, unfortunately, they are saddled with.   I yield the floor.
