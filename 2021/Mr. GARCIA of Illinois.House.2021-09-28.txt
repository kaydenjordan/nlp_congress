 Mr. Speaker, I want to honor the life of a  community icon, an incredible storyteller, and a powerful voice of the  Latino and labor rights movement, my dear friend Jesus ``Chuy''  Negrete.   Chuy was born in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, but grew up in Chicago's  southeast side.   Through his corridos, or folk songs, Chuy elevated the work of Cesar  Chavez's United Farm Workers and national Farm Labor Organizing  Committee.   Whether he was in the back of a pickup truck or in a parking lot, he  would be there and he would play his heart out.   His music resonated with the Mexican-American community because it  reflected the daily struggles of workers and immigrants.   Chuy loved to add humor to his lyrics, because he understood the  power of making people laugh, especially during the toughest times.   He believed in the importance of honoring your roots and heritage,  encouraging youth to learn about their culture and history, reminding  them of its riches.   I thank Chuy for his music, for always conveying a sense of courage,  giving us animo, giving us resolve, and encouraging us to stick  together.   Rest in power, my friend.                            ____________________
