 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, a continuing resolution to March 10 is  short-sighted and wholly unnecessary. It imperils our national  security, and it ignores the real pain and consequences of inflation.   Without funding from a full-year omnibus appropriations bill, the  NDAA we passed this evening is a broken promise, the bipartisan PACT  Act goes underfunded, and VA medical care falls at least $7.5 billion  short.   While some of my colleagues are quick to raise the alarm about our  southern border, a CR into March does nothing to address the influx of  migrants at our border now. It does nothing to help communities ravaged  by drought, hurricanes, flooding and fire. While families feel the pain  of inflation, a CR into March does nothing to provide them with relief.   We have a bipartisan, bicameral framework in place that should allow  us to complete an omnibus appropriations bill early next week. A CR  into March asks us to abandon our work without offering a different or  viable alternative. I urge my colleagues to reject that proposal and  allow us time to complete our work.                           Vote on Motion to Concur
