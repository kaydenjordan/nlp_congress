 Mr. Speaker, at about 2 a.m. this morning, our HPD,  Houston Police Department, faced a tragic incident of one of our  officers who was participating in a stop along with other officers on  I-59 South. Unfortunately, a driver who paid no attention to the  flashing lights and the work of these officers sped through and hit  Nestor Garcia.   My last word was that he was in surgery, with his family, and that  all of those who could be there--the chief and the mayor--were at the  hospital with him.   So I simply stand to ask for prayers for Nestor Garcia and his family  and indicate that we are well aware of the work of the outstanding  police and fire departments during Hurricane Harvey and all of the  time. I wish him the best and strongest recovery as a young man who  just entered the police department and just graduated. I know that our  prayers will help him and his family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  New York for her leadership. I thank my fellow Texan on this effort.   I am not on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, but I do  believe the FAA should have this extension. I do believe I should  advocate for the many employees and consumers of aviation needs, that  the air traffic controllers should not be privatized. And I understand  that this particular bill does not have that provision.   The focus should be on extending a number of these health matters  that are very important to us, and particularly, the inspiring health  programs dealing with the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical  Education Program, the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, and the  Medicare Intravenous Immune Globulin Demonstration project, a number of  these.   I do take concern with the diminishing of the Medicare Improvement  Fund by $50 million and, frankly, I believe that we should move forward  on these emergencies, particularly as it relates to hurricane victims  or areas.    Let me, however, focus on what is of devastating need in the areas of  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and make mention of the fact that  the U.S. Virgin Islands is included in these tax benefits, and Puerto  Rico, agreed to by the Members representing that area.   It is important that people do not have a penalty on their account  tax provisions. I hope this can move quickly through the Senate. The  employee retention credit for employees: the bill provides a tax credit  for 40 percent of wages, up to $6,000 per employee, paid by a disaster- affected employer to an employee from a core disaster area.   Charitable deductions: the bill suspends limitations on charitable  contributions.   In our community, there are people who don't have the gap to survive.  They are working. Their job is closed down because of Hurricane Harvey.  I imagine in other areas they may be receiving charitable moneys. Those  who give the charitable contributions need to be helped.   The disaster-related personal casualty losses and the special rule  for determining the earned income tax credit is extremely important.   We want more. We are desperate, and we need more, Mr. Speaker. I hope  that we will be able to work together to get more for those who are  desperate from these hurricanes.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from New  York for a very thoughtful and, really, a crucial element to justice.   Allow me to acknowledge Mr. Jeffries for his leadership, Mr. Conyers  and Mr. Goodlatte for working in a bipartisan manner, and the manager  of the bill for his support, and indicate that this has evidence that  we wish we did not have to see or could not document.   I know that in my own State just a couple of years ago, the Federal  judge in San Antonio was attacked and, in my recollection, lost his  life. So we realize that justice requires us to eliminate impediments  of fear and danger that may come to the Federal judiciary.   This thoughtful legislation to redact addresses and other personal  information from financial disclosure forms of all of the judiciary,  magistrates, and appeals courts, district courts, obviously, and the  Supreme Court, is crucial for the courts that represent the third  branch of government and really represent a need of the kind of  stovepipe to allow them to render justice.   So on the financial disclosure forms, they are important for  transparency, but I want to acknowledge that, unfortunately, there are  individuals who would take out their disgust or contempt for the  Federal Government and take that contempt out on the courts.   For that reason and for the reason that it has been reported that  there are terrorist cells in every State, that we don't know from where  that threat will come, and the fact that we have this very important  bill, I want to congratulate the author of the bill. I hope that we  will pass this bill as quickly as possible, which protects our Federal  judiciary by allowing their personal information and that of their  family members to be redacted because justice has to be kept safe and  secure.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts for his leadership. He has been particularly helpful in  thinking through how we can work together on the multiple crises that  Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico are facing.   Let me thank the manager of the bill for working on these issues as  well.   Let me first of all indicate, as I have done earlier today, that I  understand that the FAA extension is a clean extension which I will  support, recognizing the international airport that is in my district.  But again, I will seek the important leadership on the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, and particularly, the ranking  [[Page H7563]]  member, when it comes to dealing with not supporting privatization of  air traffic controllers.   I want to speak specifically to the hurricane tax relief. As I do so,  let me particularly make mention that I had hoped this bill would have  an extension of the CHIP program and the community health centers.  Maybe we can work on that, because I know in many of our communities  impacted by the hurricanes, those elements are important, community  health centers, and, certainly, the Children's Health Insurance  Program.   I do want to make a point to say that I wish we could have gone  further. I know that there were at least 21 different tax credits or  exemptions that we could have had to help those who are impacted by the  hurricanes, but these, I want to cite and say that I appreciate them  being utilized for my constituents now.   The bill would provide tax credit deductions and other relief to  taxpayers in disaster areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria. Most measures would apply to taxpayers in parts of Florida,  Puerto Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   In particular, access to one's retirement funds, the bill would waive  the 10 percent penalty on each distribution from retirement accounts  for taxpayers in affected areas. Individuals will be eligible to make  the withdrawal if their primary residence was in one of the disaster  areas as of the date of the storm and they sustained an economic loss.    Mr. Speaker, the bill would increase the size of a  loan an individual can take from their employee retirement fund under  the retirement plan loans. It would also provide a credit for  businesses that were rendered inoperable by the hurricanes but that  retained employees, and on the charitable deduction for those who are  giving dollars between the 23rd and December 31.   What I would like to do, Mr. Speaker, is to look at some form of a  disaster relief tax scheme, if you will, to enhance what we are doing  now and to listen, where we can do this in a bipartisan way, working  with Mr. Neal, working with the chairman of the committee, and really  making sure we have a long-term response to the journey that my  constituents and others will have to take.   I close by saying that now we are up to 185,000 homes that have been  severely damaged or damaged. We have got problems with mortgage  deductions and a number of other issues, and, therefore, I am hoping we  can work together.
