 Madam Speaker, it is unbelievable to the few Americans  who are going to be watching this because they know what the outcome  is. We all know what the outcome is.   They are wondering: Why are we trying to negate the vote of 63  million Americans instead of talking about the things that Americans  care about: prescription drug coverage, the high cost of prescription  drugs, the high cost of healthcare, securing our borders, keeping our  economy going? These are the things we should be talking about.   No, instead, we are going to pass this resolution tonight and then go  home for Christmas vacation instead of doing the job of America.
