 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, after nearly 2 weeks of Democrats and  Republicans working together, the Senate is going to take a final vote  on the anti-Asian hate crimes bill later this morning. The vote today  on the anti-Asian hate crimes bill is proof that when the Senate is  given the opportunity to work, the Senate can work to solve important  issues.   In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans across the  country have been victims of the surge of discrimination and racially  motivated violence and bigotry. In New York, I attended rally after  rally and heard one story after another about Asian Americans who were  afraid to ride the subway, afraid to go to work, afraid to walk down  the streets, and having to adjust their daily lives for fear of being  spat upon, glared at, or even worse. This was not an occasional  occurrence. It is occurring every day in just about every corner of  America.   Now, racism has always existed in America, unfortunately and sadly,  and the legacy of anti-Asian sentiment goes back centuries to dark  chapters in our history like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the  internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War II.   Now, we have made great strides since those days, but over the past  several years, the forces of hate and bigotry seemed to have gained  strength, too often encouraged by our former President. It is time for  all of us to stand up.   By passing this bill, the Senate makes it very clear that hate and  discrimination against any group has no place in America. Bigotry  against one is bigotry against all, and I believe that passage of this  bill will send two--two--very important messages.   One important message is to the Asian-American community. By passing  this bill, we say to the Asian-American community that their government  is paying attention to them, has heard their concerns, and will respond  to protect them; and, second, by passing this bill, we will send a  message to the country that should be all too obvious by now. Hate  crimes will not be tolerated, and Federal law enforcement will do  everything in its power to detect, deter, and, if necessary, prosecute  crimes to the full extent of the law.   So this bill has a one-two punch, to assure the Asian-American  community we are going after the bigotry against them and to tell the  American people, particularly those bigots, we are going after you in a  legal way, of course.   Now, yesterday, we reached an agreement to consider three more  Republican amendments to the bill before a final vote. The legislation,  as is, already includes significant bipartisan input, including  modifications from Senator Collins and bipartisan legislation called  the No Hate Act developed by Senators Moran and Blumenthal and modified  by Senator Scott of Florida. Senator Warnock has also made sure the  bill recognizes the recent tragedy in Atlanta in which six women of  Asian descent were killed.    Through it all, Senators Durbin, Duckworth, and especially the bill's  sponsor, Senator Hirono, have demonstrated exceptional leadership; the  same for Representative Meng in the House.   Over the past 6 years, we have had too few opportunities to work  together on timely, bipartisan legislation. Let this be a reminder that  when Senators of good will work with each other, at the end of the day,  we can achieve a good result. We can do it again in the next few weeks  with a bipartisan water infrastructure bill, which will be on the floor  next week, and soon thereafter, another bipartisan package of  legislation concerning American competitiveness.  [[Page S2138]]    Let's continue the bipartisan momentum as we move into next week, but  today I want to thank my colleagues who have worked together to bring  this bill to the finish line. I look forward to seeing the anti-Asian  hate crimes bill passed by this Chamber today and move one step closer  to reaching the President's desk.                            ____________________     Madam President, on DC statehood, another matter, today  the House of Representatives will pass a bill granting the District of  Columbia official statehood. I applaud my House Democratic colleagues  for taking this important step toward recognizing the full citizenship  of more than 700,000 residents of the District of Columbia.   This is a matter of just representation. Our system of government is  designed to give everyone in our country a voice in forging their own  destiny. Most citizens do that by voting for Members of Congress and  Senators from their States to represent them in this temple of  democracy to advocate for their interests and to voice their concerns.   The District of Columbia has more residents than Vermont and Wyoming  and nearly the same as Delaware, Alaska, and several other States, and  they bear the full responsibilities and duties of citizenship, like  residents in all those other States. DC residents can be summoned for  jury duty. They have served in every war since the American Revolution.  They pay Federal income taxes, just like residents from every other  State. You can learn that from any license plate outside this building.  Yet they are denied real representation in Congress--in the words DC  borrowed from the Founding Fathers, ``taxation without  representation.''   Sadly, the debate over DC statehood has taken a rather dark turn.  Some of my colleagues on the other side, rather than fashion any  argument on the merits, have taken to denigrating the basic worth of  residents of the District of Columbia--a part of our country that is 47  percent African American.   One Member of the minority party went so far as to say lawmakers  should ``go out to where the real people are across the country and ask  them what they think [about DC statehood].'' ``[Get] out to where the  real people are.'' Bigotry, bigotry, bigotry. I shouldn't have to  remind my colleagues that it is shockingly inappropriate to imply that  lives and occupations and rights of DC's residents are somehow less  than their fellow citizens in other ``more real'' and almost always  more White parts of the country.   We all know that the minority party opposes DC statehood because it  fears giving political power and representation to American citizens if  they might not vote for Republicans. It smacks of the effort going on  right now in Republican legislatures all across the country to pass  laws that overwhelmingly make it harder for minorities, poorer  Americans, and younger Americans to vote.   The far right, the hard right--which seems to be so dominant in the  party on the other side--is so afraid of losing political power and so  unwilling to appeal to anyone who doesn't already agree with them that  their strategy has become to restrict voting rights and deny equal  representation in Congress to hundreds of thousands of Americans. So DC  statehood, unfortunately, is part of a continuing thread of not  allowing people their right to vote, to representation, that seems to  be growing in the Republican Party, particularly here in the Senate and  in legislatures throughout the country, unfortunately.   Self-government, voting rights: These are not Democratic rights.  These are not Republican rights. They are American rights. They are  issues of fairness and democracy. It is not about right and left; it is  about right and wrong.   DC statehood is an idea whose time has come                            ____________________     Madam President, now on climate, this year's celebration  of Earth Day comes with an ambitious new goal from the Biden  administration: The United States should aim to cut its greenhouse gas  emissions in half by the end of the decade. It is a great goal. I fully  support it.   Not only is President Biden finally returning the United States to a  position of global leadership in the fight against climate change, but  he is showing that America is ready to ramp up our climate ambition  beyond--beyond--the Paris Agreement.   Now, it will take extraordinary action to meet the marker that  President Biden laid down, but he was exactly right to do it. If we  need any reminders about what America can achieve when it puts its mind  to something, President Kennedy committed to landing on the Moon over  the course of a single decade. If America could reach that lofty goal  in the name of ingenuity, in the name of exploration, surely we can  achieve this goal in the name of saving the planet on which we live.   Now, I believe the best way to achieve this ambitious goal is through  bold action by this Congress through legislation to reduce carbon  pollution while creating millions of jobs and economic prosperity in a  new clean energy economy. Any legislation without a serious and bold  climate component will make it much, much harder to achieve President  Biden's goal, and we must work to have a strong green climate component  in the American Jobs Plan.   The Democratic majority here in the Senate is eager to get to work.  One of the very first things I did when Democrats took the majority was  to instruct every committee chair--the new committee chairs--to hold  hearings on the climate crisis to begin preparing for landmark  legislation. I repeat once again that any infrastructure bill we  consider here in the Senate must include green infrastructure, create  green jobs, and make significant progress toward the reduction of  greenhouse gases.   Luckily, the Senate will have an opportunity to address another  serious climate-related issue next week. The Senate will consider a  Congressional Review Act bill before the end of the work period to  reimpose critical regulations concerning the release of methane into  our atmosphere.   Methane gets less attention than its big bad brother, carbon dioxide,  but in truth, methane is like carbon dioxide on steroids. Over 20  years, a ton of methane will warm the atmosphere more than 86 times as  much as a ton of carbon dioxide, but because it breaks down much faster  than carbon dioxide, the gains we make in the reduction of methane  emissions can reduce global warming even faster. Many of the things we  need to do to reduce methane emissions are fairly cheap and cost- effective, like plugging leaks in fossil fuel infrastructure. So this  made common sense, especially when our globe is at risk.   The Obama administration had instituted these commonsense rules of  the road to encourage that sort of activity. It was widely supported,  even by industry. The Trump administration, so typically and so  unfortunately, reversed those rules in an act of pure idiocy. The  Senate Democratic majority will soon put a bill on the floor to revert  back to the original policy, which should never have been tampered with  in the first place.   Reducing methane emissions will be only the first of many actions  this Senate will take to combat climate change.                            ____________________     Madam President, one final issue. It has come to my  attention that President Biden intends to have the United States  formally recognize the Armenian genocide, becoming the first sitting  U.S. President to do so. Great news. It is a long time coming and a  step that I have called on Presidents of both parties to take.   Each year, I gather with Armenian Americans in Times Square to  commemorate the annual anniversary of this atrocity. Every year, my  heart breaks for the victims of the genocide and their descendants.  There are very few left, but some very elderly people are sitting in  the audience each year, reminding us how painful and how real that  genocide was. The Turkish Government's idea of saying there was no  genocide just defies history. I have seen the victims. I have talked to  the victims.   Saturday marks the 106th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. I am  so relieved, grateful, and moved that we  [[Page S2139]]  can finally commemorate the anniversary with the knowledge that the  Government of the United States, led by President Joseph Robinette  Biden, has recognized the truth of the Armenian genocide at last.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I thank my colleague from Maine and my colleague from  Hawaii, as well as my colleague from Illinois, and so many others who  have led on this issue.   In a moment, the Senate will vote on final passage of the anti-Asian  hate crimes bill.   This long overdue bill sends two messages to our Asian-American  friends: We will not tolerate bigotry against you; and to those  perpetrating anti-Asian bigotry, we will pursue you to the fullest  extent of the law.   We cannot--we cannot--allow this recent tide of bigotry, intolerance,  and prejudice against Asian Americans go unchecked. A bedrock value of  our multicultural society is that an attack on any one group is an  attack on all of us.   By passing this bill, we tell our law enforcement agencies to  prioritize anti-Asian violence and wield the sword to detect, deter,  and prosecute hate crimes of all varieties. We send a clear message, a  unified message, that hate has no place in America. And so, by passing  this bill, we recommit ourselves to the most American of creeds, ``e  pluribus unum,'' out of many one.   I urge a unanimous ``yes'' vote on this legislation, and I ask for  the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 59.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 54.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 68.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 58.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 34, S.  914.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, April 22, be waived.    Thank you.
