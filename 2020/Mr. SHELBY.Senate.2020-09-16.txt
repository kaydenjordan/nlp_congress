 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service of  Commander Edward H. Murray of the U.S. Navy on the occasion of his  retirement after 20 years of Active Duty. I would like to briefly share  with my colleagues some of the highlights of his fine career.   For the past 20 years, Commander Murray excelled in leading Navy  Sailors as an E-2C naval flight officer. He served sea tours with VAW- 116, deploying on the USS Constellation and USS Abraham Lincoln in  support of coalition forces in Iraq and operations in the Western  Pacific. He also deployed to the Western Pacific with VTC-12 onboard  the USS Bonhomme Richard, providing airspace and diplomatic  coordination. Ashore, Commander Murray's assignments included a special  selection as aide-de-camp to the four-star commander of the U.S. Naval  Forces in Naples, Italy, during operations in Kosovo and Libya. He also  served my colleague, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, as a legislative  fellow and then continued his service in the Navy Office of Legislative  Affairs as deputy director of the Senate Liaison Office.   I have gotten to know Commander Murray over the past 2 years through  his assignment to the Navy's Appropriations Matters Office. As a  representative of the Chief of Naval Operations and Secretary of the  Navy, he provided valuable support to Members of the Senate and House  Appropriations Committees regarding the Navy's budgetary needs. His  efforts to provide timely and transparent information to the committees  contributed to the enactment of the Defense Appropriations Acts for  fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Commander Murray also provided superior  support to me and many of my colleagues as we traveled across Europe  and Asia conducting oversight of critical national security assets  abroad.   As Commander Murray departs the Pentagon, I want to take this  opportunity to congratulate him on his retirement; to thank him, his  wife Amanda, and his family for their years of service; and to wish him  the very best going forward.                            ____________________
