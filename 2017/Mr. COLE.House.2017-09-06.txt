Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule for consideration of H.R. 3354, the Department of the  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018,  also known as the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act  of 2018. The rule provides for 2 hours of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us is the second  installment of the House's effort to pass all 12 appropriations bills  on the floor for the first time since 2006. The overall package will  consider the remaining eight bills, covering $416.3 billion in total  spending. It represents many months of work by the Appropriations  Committee.   Today's rule covers four divisions of the bill: the Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act; the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations  Act; the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Appropriations Act; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.   Together, these four divisions encompass $168.2 billion of  discretionary Federal spending. This represents a decrease of $7.8  billion from fiscal year 2017, as Congress seeks to fulfill its  obligation to the American people to be fiscally responsible stewards  of the taxpayers' hard earned money.   Most importantly, it represents the next step in fulfilling the  greatest responsibility we have as legislators: to fund the Federal  Government and keep it open each year to provide our constituents the  services they deserve while ensuring that we appropriately prioritize  where and how to spend taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies division will provide  approximately $20 billion in appropriations, a decrease of $870  [[Page H6679]]  million from fiscal year 2017. The division will fund critical programs  for farmers and ranchers, which is of critical importance to my home  State of Oklahoma.   The bill also supports conservative priorities, including language  rolling back regulations that harm businesses, industries, farming and  ranching operations, and rural and urban communities alike. In  particular, the bill includes language allowing schools to get waivers  from particularly problematic Obama administration regulations  governing school lunches, and prevents the Commodities Futures Trading  Commission from imposing harmful de minimis levels of trading activity  that would force thousands of end users to comply with onerous  regulatory requirements.   The bill also includes language changing the Food and Drug  Administration's predicate date rules for premium cigars, e-cigarettes,  and vaping products, thereby preventing the FDA from regulating these  industries out of existence.   There is much to like in the Agriculture Appropriations division, and  I look forward to considering the bill on the floor.   On the security side of the ledger, the Department of Homeland  Security Appropriations division provides $44.3 billion, an increase of  $1.9 billion over fiscal year 2017. Of importance, the bill provides $7  billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an increase of $620  million. These funds will be used to enforce immigration laws and  combat illegal immigration, which our constituents have repeatedly told  us they oppose.   The bill provides $13.8 billion for Customs and Border Patrol, an  increase of $1.6 billion, to ensure the continued security of our  border. It also provides $1.6 billion for physical barrier construction  on the Southern border, thus fulfilling the first step of one of  President Trump's key promises. It provides $10.5 billion for the Coast  Guard and supports FEMA's disaster relief fund at $7.3 billion.   As with the earlier security appropriations package the House passed  at the end of July, the funds in this division will help ensure  America's national security and go a long way towards funding key  Member priorities.   The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations division provides  $47.4 billion, a decrease of $10 billion from fiscal year 2017. Even  with this decrease, the committee has funded key priorities. Security  assistance is funded at $8.8 billion, and full funding is provided for  battling international organized crime, antiterrorism programs, and  combating cybercrime. The bill also fully funds the $3.1 billion  Memorandum of Understanding with Israel.   The Appropriations Committee has prioritized programs of importance  and de-prioritized programs that are not in the best interests of the  United States, such as reducing funding for the U.N. by $939 million,  eliminating all funding for UNESCO, and eliminating funding for the  Global Climate Change Initiative.   In producing this division, the Appropriations Committee made  difficult choices about the Nation's priorities, and made them well,  and ensured that taxpayer dollars are going to the most important,  critical, and efficient programs.   Finally, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and  Related Agencies Appropriations division provides $56.5 billion, an  increase of $1.1 billion over fiscal year 2017. That number does not  include $45 billion also authorized to be spent by the highway trust  fund for America's highways. Of note, the bill provides $16.6 billion  for the Federal Aviation Administration, an increase of $153 million,  to maintain and promote air travel and security. This sum includes $1  billion for so-called NextGen for more efficient air traffic control,  and $162 million for the contract tower program, a crucial safety net  that covers many districts across the country, including facilities  like Westheimer Airport in Norman, Oklahoma, as well as towers in  Lawton and Ardmore in my own home district.    It provides $38.3 billion in net discretionary funding to Housing and  Urban Development. Critically, it sustains Section 8 and Public and  Native American housing programs at $27.5 billion. It also includes  increases in funding for programs benefiting vulnerable citizens,  including $573 million for housing for the elderly, an increase of  $70.6 million over fiscal year 2017, and $47 million for housing for  Persons with Disabilities, an increase of $800,000 over fiscal year  2017.   In all, T-HUD Appropriations covers important priorities and ensures  that our Nation's housing and transportation infrastructure will be  adequately funded to meet our needs.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and  the underlying bill. The package before us represents a fulfillment of  our most important responsibility as Members of Congress, and provides  appropriate funding in four areas: Agriculture; State and Foreign  Operations, Homeland Security, and Transportation and Urban  Development.   I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their  months of work in making this bill a reality, and I cheer their efforts  on moving forward to the completion of the fiscal year 2018  appropriations process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to begin by discussing process with my good friend from  Massachusetts, where I think he makes some good points, but I think he  fails to recognize the progress that this bill represents.   My good friend knows, because we have the privilege of working  together on the Rules Committee, I have thought for many years,  frankly, that we needed to get back to regular order. I remind this  House the last time we actually operated under it in an appropriations  process was in 2006. My friends were actually in the majority when we  got rid of open rules on appropriations bills. My friends never brought  all 12 appropriations bills to the floor and where they were subject to  amendments by various Members.   I would agree with my friend, this is not a perfect process that we  have. If I had my way, we would go back to the way we operated in 2006,  before the last Democratic majority, actually bring the bills down  individually and, frankly, give every Member an open shot at amendment.  I think that is the appropriate way to proceed.   Again, my friends thought differently when they were in the majority  and never made a move to restore regular order--quite the opposite. We  have actually fought to do that. We did have a period of open rules on  appropriations bills. We didn't get every bill down here, I regret to  say, but we got quite a few of them down. But my friends decided they  would engage in poison pill tactics.   I regret, honestly, personally, that my conference gave into that;  were more worried about casting tough votes. I think you are sent here  to cast tough votes.   So I will make this commitment to my friend. I will continue to work  with him and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who would  like to return to that process. However, I do recognize this is  significant progress toward doing that.   This is the first time, since 2006, that all 12 bills, in one form or  another, will reach this floor, and, frankly, every single Member has  been free to offer amendments on any portion of those 12 bills that  they care to. Now, not all of them were made in order by the Rules  Committee, and I would hope we get past that again some day.   But, again, before my friends decry that too much, they need to  remember the role they played in actually getting us out of that  process.   I also would like to talk just briefly with my friend about his  thoughts about DACA, and I am sure we will have a good discussion on  that in the course of the day, and, honestly, I think the discussion is  helpful.   But I think the President of the United States did the right thing  when, number one, he recognized that he does not have the  constitutional authority, something even his predecessor wondered  about, to actually engage in law and put this issue back in the hands  of the Congress. The Congress now has 6 months to deal with it. The  Speaker has assured us that we will do that.   I think the appropriate way to proceed is to have the committee of  jurisdiction actually hold hearings and move forward, but we will see  which way we go. But I think there is a better chance for a long-term  solution, as even my friend agrees, if we have a legislative fix to the  problem. I think that will involve some give-and-take, but my hope is  we will end up at a place where all parties are satisfied. But we will  see. That is what the legislative process is all about.   Final point to make, Mr. Speaker, I think we need to recognize that  what we are debating on here today, in terms of these four  appropriations  [[Page H6681]]  bills, and we will have another tranche of appropriations bills down  here later, is actually a process.   What we are really doing today is defining the position of the  majority party as to where it stands on funding the government. I don't  expect my friends to agree with that. There will be elements of these  bills that they agree with without a doubt. I don't think they will  oppose a lot of things that we do in regard to T-HUD, or in regard to  some of these other various programs that we will deal with.   But at the end of the day--and my side needs to recognize this--we  are going to end up in a negotiation with the United States Senate and  the administration some time probably after the 1st of October, and  that negotiation has to be bipartisan.   As my friends know, the other body requires 60 votes, and that would  mean there has to be Democratic participation. And quite frankly, the  appropriations bills that have moved across the floor here in fiscal  year 2015, fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2017, have all been  bipartisan. They have all been the product of negotiations.   At the end of the day--and I remind my friends, in May, a majority of  them actually voted in favor of the omnibus spending bill for FY 2017  in the House and in the Senate, as did, by the way, a majority of  Republicans in the House and Senate, and President Trump signed it. So  we know how this process ends, and we know how to make it work  appropriately. This is simply another step in the process.   It is my hope that, at the end of the day, we arrive at a bicameral,  bipartisan process that actually funds the government, and we are able  to accomplish, in concert with one another, things that we think are  important to the American people. I have a great deal of confidence we  will get there because that is what we have done the last 3 years. We  are actually doing it a little better this year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do not yield.    Mr. Speaker, I am reiterating my earlier announcement that  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only, and I will not  yield for any other purpose.  [[Page H6682]]     Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the chairman of  the full committee, the ranking member of the full committee, certainly  the ranking member of the subcommittee, and the staff for the  tremendous assistance they provided in putting together this rather  large and complex piece of legislation.   It is fair to note for the record that the allocation we received of  $156 billion is $5 billion less than we had last year. While our lower  allocation this year forced us to make some difficult decisions, I want  to remind my colleagues that the cuts we are making today amount to  barely 3 percent of what we spent last year and is essentially what we  spent in fiscal year 2016.   The bill before us today focuses on key national priorities:  investing in biomedical research to find cures for diseases like  Alzheimer's and cancer; ensuring our country is fully prepared and able  to protect our citizens from disease outbreaks or bioterrorism;  continuing to support early childhood education, particularly for those  at risk; helping first-generation college students prepare for, access,  and complete a postsecondary education; and continuing to support  people living with disabilities.   The bill also preserves funds for popular programs like career and  technical education, support for Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, programs to help Native Americans, the AmeriCorps  program, LIHEAP, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.   The National Institutes of Health, our Nation's premier biomedical  research agency, is funded at $1.1 billion above last year. NIH is  working to find cures for Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and develop the  next generation of medical treatment through the use of precision  medicine techniques.   We need to continue to build upon the $2 billion increase provided in  the omnibus last year. I view this proposal as a floor, not a ceiling,  for biomedical research funding. I am hopeful that this number can  increase as the process moves forward.   Biodefense and preparedness programs, including new funding to  prevent a pandemic flu from occurring, are increased across the bill.   We are all aware of the terrible toll prescription drugs and opioid  abuse is taking on our Nation. I am proud to say this bill includes  another $500 million to continue comprehensive grant programs to enable  States, localities, and tribes to develop anti-opioid initiatives  focused on prevention, education, and treatment and recovery services.   Head Start receives a $22 million increase in this bill. Preschool  programs are continued at $250 million. Childcare programs receive a $4  million increase. Special education programs for students with  disabilities are increased by $200 million, which will help local  school districts ease the financial burden of providing specialized  educational services. TRIO and GEAR UP, which help disadvantaged  students prepare for and complete college, receive increases of $60  million and $10 million, respectively, over last year.   The bill also includes $500 million for the Student Support and  Academic Enrichment grant program. These funds can be used flexibly by  school districts across the country, whether the need is in the area of  counseling, computer science instruction, or teacher training and arts  programming.   Pell grants are maintained at a maximum of $5,920.    I will also note that this is an initial allocation and the  beginning of the congressional funding process. As always, I look  forward to working with our counterparts in the Senate and my friends  across the aisle to see if there are additional areas where we can  cooperate.   Finally, I want to note that the bill protects human life by  continuing longstanding prohibitions against Federal tax dollars being  used to pay for abortions, including new provisions to ensure that no  tax dollars are used for research on human fetal tissue obtained by an  abortion.   This bill represents a balanced approach that will benefit every  American and maintain the appropriate stewardship of taxpayer dollars  that we have been entrusted with as Members of Congress.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins), my colleague, for the purpose of a colloquy.    I thank the gentleman for raising this issue. Along with  Congressman Woodall and Congresswoman Handel, you have been leaders in  this effort. I appreciate what you are doing and will stay in touch as  progress is made.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota  (Ms. McCollum) for the purpose of a colloquy.    I thank my colleague from Minnesota for speaking about the  importance of this program in her district. I agree that Community  Services Block Grant provides important services to help people escape  poverty. The program has broad bipartisan support.   As the gentlewoman knows, several challenging decisions have to be  made to meet overall spending priorities and allocation. I take to  heart the concern expressed by the gentlewoman and, as we move forward,  I will work to ensure funding for the Community Services Block Grant  reflects the priority of our Members.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman), my colleague, for the purpose of a colloquy.    I thank my colleague from South Carolina for raising this  important question. I agree that the National Emergency Grant program  is an important bipartisan program to train workers and help them find  new careers.   Current year funds for the Dislocated Workers National Reserve are  increased by $109 million and advance appropriations for fiscal year  2019 are eliminated, for a total of $130 million. Within that total,  the National Emergency Grant program is approximately $70 million each  year.   It is expected that, after fully funding the National Emergency  Grants, the Department of Labor will use additional funds from the  Dislocated Workers National Reserve for other authorized purposes, such  as technical assistance and grants to help workers dislocated from the  coal industry find new employment.   So the short answer to the question is, yes, the National Emergency  Grant program is fully funded in this bill.
