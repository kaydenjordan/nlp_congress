 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 155th anniversary of  the ratification of the 13th Amendment.   On December 18, 1865, the 13th Amendment was ratified, officially  ending more than 256 years of enslavement in the United States for  nearly 4 million enslaved African Americans.   The 13th Amendment provides that: ``Neither slavery nor involuntary  servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall  have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any  place subject to their jurisdiction.''   After the Civil War, the 13th Amendment was the first of three  reconstruction amendments adopted. The loophole sentence, however,  ``except as a punishment for crime,'' allowed for African Americans to  continue cruel, involuntary labor under what is known as the Black  Codes.   To be enslaved, specific laws were passed to ensure that African  Americans would be constantly arrested, and then the government would  lease human beings out. As African Americans continued to be viewed as  property, the government leased people out to businesses, farms, and  other types of profit-making ventures.   I would like to acknowledge the former chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus, and the CBC's resident historian, to lead this Special  Order hour acknowledging this very important anniversary.
