 Mr. Speaker, once again, I rise, proud to be  an American, proud to have the opportunity to speak for people who  cannot speak for themselves in this place.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mention the midterm elections of 2018,  said by many who count and who are supposed to know to be one of the  highest turnouts ever, exceeding 100 million voters, said to be  approximately 48 to 50 percent of those who are eligible to vote,  depending on how you count and who is counting.   In Texas, it is said that, on November 1, the number of Texans voting  early exceeded the entire turnout for 2014. The numbers indicate that  3.3 million or more 18-to-29-year-olds voted early, a 188 percent  increase over 2014. It was a record turnout.   Why was there a record turnout? is the question that we have to  grapple with. Yes, people turned out because they wanted better  healthcare. They turned out because they want better jobs. They turned  out because they want better schools, better education. They want  better housing.   But they also turned out because they were opposed to bigotry and  hate. Nobody can give you the empirical evidence to support entirely  the number that turned out because they were antithetical to bigotry  and hate. But we know by anecdotal evidence that many people turned  out, in addition to the other things, because they want to see bigotry  and hate not managed, but they want to see it eliminated in the  greatest and richest country in the world.   Many people turned out with the expectation that we would do  something about all of the things that I have named, including bigotry  and hate. Many people turned out because they want bigotry and hate to  become more than talking points. They want bigotry and hate in this  country to become action items.   They want to see us visibly do something about the bigotry and hate  that has found a means by which it can multiply, it can grow, in this  country.   We have seen evidence of it in elections, a Senator who says: I'd go  to a public hanging.   We have seen evidence of it in our places of worship, people killed  in a synagogue.   We have seen evidence of it in the streets with words and behavior  that are unacceptable. ``Jews will not replace us,'' they said in  Charlottesville.   We have to do something about bigotry and hate, and it has to be more  than simply talk. Talking points are good; action items are better. It  is time for the Congress of the United States of America to stand up  for the many people who suffer from bigotry and hate in this country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  allowing the time and commend her for her many years of service and her  efforts, in a bipartisan way, to establish the NFIP program such that  it would be responsible, such that it would take care of the needs of  the many people across the length and breadth of our country.   I also thank the chairperson of the committee for his years of  service. I know this is not the last time that he and I will be on the  floor together, but I do want to thank him now for his years of  service.   Mr. Speaker, the NFIP is important to families because if the family  cannot get the flood insurance, they cannot purchase the home. It is  important to Realtors because if the home can't be purchased, the  Realtors, obviously, cannot sell the home. It is important to the  builders because the builders are the people who rely on home sales to  make determinations as to what the market will bear and whether they  should construct homes in a given area.   So this really is about people in terms of their families, but it is  also about people and the economy. It is about whether this economy  will continue to grow. It is about whether or not we will provide a  program that will give builders some sense of stability such that they  can move forward with their construction projects.   My hope is that this 1-week extension will be granted. I pray that my  colleagues join us and vote for the extension. But my hope also is that  we will have a long-term program developed, because the Realtors are  depending on us; the contractors are depending on us; the families are  depending on us; and the country is depending on us.   The National Association of Realtors estimated that, if the program  lapses for 1 month, about 40,000 home sales might not close nationwide.  This is a significant number of homes in a market that currently needs  an additional shot in the arm.   Mr. Speaker, we are here for the families, the builders, the  Realtors, and the economy.
