 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce my guest for the  State of the Union, Marco Chavez. Marco Chavez is a veteran who served  this country honorably, came home, and was deported to Mexico.   Mr. Chavez was born in Mexico. He was brought to California as an  infant. He served in the Marine Corps as a lawful permanent resident  before being deported. California Governor Brown granted him a full and  unconditional pardon for a minor crime he had done, but he was  separated from his family for 16 years.   It is an injustice that our veterans can go and serve overseas and  that this is how we treat them when they come home after serving this  country, many of whom put themselves in harm's way. That is why I have  introduced the Veterans' Pathway to Citizenship Act, which will make it  easier for deported veterans to return to the United States and ensures  that Active-Duty servicemembers don't leave the military without  understanding their options for naturalization.                            ____________________
