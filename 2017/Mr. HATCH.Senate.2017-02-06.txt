 Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss a number of  ongoing efforts in the early days of the 115th Congress. It is a  strange time to be working on Capitol Hill, as strange as I have seen  in my four decades in the Senate. That is true for a number of reasons.  Let me give you an example. Republicans currently control the Senate,  the House, and the White House, and are in widespread agreement about  most major policy issues. Sure, there are details that need to be  worked out, both on the process and the substance on things like tax  reform, trade, and of course health care reform, but by and large  Republicans all have the same ultimate goals for these key areas. Yet  despite the overwhelming consensus that exists on most of these issues,  there seems to be an obsession with advancing a narrative of a deeply  divided Republican majority. According to this popular narrative, House  and Senate Republicans have completely different views on tax reform,  Republicans in Congress oppose everything President Trump wants to do  on trade, and Senate Republicans are deeply at odds on  [[Page S703]]  how to press forward on repealing and replacing ObamaCare.   As chairman of the Senate committee that is right in the middle of  all these issues, I get asked to comment on these matters, literally,  dozens of times every day. The questions take many forms. Senator X  says Congress should do ``blank'' with ObamaCare. What do you think?  Can the House's tax reform plan pass in the Senate? President Trump  said ``blank'' today. Is that going to fly in your committee?   These questions may seem straightforward. However, the underlying  question behind all of these lines of inquiry is: Will you publically  disagree with or criticize another Republican so we can write another  story about Republican divisions? Matters such as repealing and  replacing ObamaCare or reforming the Tax Code are certainly important  topics that are rightly under intense public scrutiny. However, given  that these monumental efforts are still in the early stages, the fact  that there are some relatively minor differences of opinion shouldn't  be all that noteworthy. The existence of these differences in the  initial stages of the process doesn't significantly jeopardize the  success of these efforts. The purpose of the legislative process-- particularly the process we use in the Senate--is to allow differences  to be aired and worked through so, at the end of the process, consensus  can be reached. Differing views on some issues at the beginning of the  process are to be expected. Once again, they are hardly noteworthy.   Case in point, Republicans are united in our desire to repeal and  replace ObamaCare. The vast majority of us want reforms that are more  patient-centered and market-driven. As far as I know, pretty much all  of us want to return most of the authority for regulating the health  care system back to the States. On some of the other questions, let me  make clear what my position is just so there is no confusion on these  points. I believe we should repeal ObamaCare--including the taxes--and  provide for a stable transition period. I believe the work to replace  ObamaCare should also begin immediately, meaning that our repeal bill  should include as many ObamaCare replacement policies as procedures  allow. A more complete replacement can and should be crafted in the  coming months as we work through some of the more complicated issues.  That has been my position since roughly March of 2010, when the final  pieces of ObamaCare were signed into law. I have repeated it numerous  times over the years. Moreover, I believe most Republicans in Congress  share that same view.   Do some Republicans have different views regarding the proper order  and procedure for this endeavor? I am sure they do. But I don't know of  a single Republican who does not want to get rid of ObamaCare. I  certainly don't know any Republicans who are fine with the status quo  in our health care system. That being the case, no one should be trying  to parse anyone's words or split hairs in order to manufacture  divisions in the Republican ranks on repealing and replacing ObamaCare.   I have little doubt that we can work through whatever differences do  exist, and, more importantly, I think we will. I am not going to  speculate today on the floor about what the final process or product  will look like, but I will say that at the end of the day, only 3  numbers matter: 218, 51 and 1. Those are the numbers of supporters we  need at each step to pass an ObamaCare repeal and replacement.   At this point, given what we currently know, I strongly believe that  the process I described earlier--a full repeal and a responsible  transition, coupled with a sizable downpayment on replacement, followed  by a committed effort to implement additional replacement policies in  the coming months--provides the best path forward to achieving those  thresholds. Like I said, most Republicans in Congress agree with me.   We can discuss other ideas, and I am happy to engage in that  discussion, but those numbers--218, 51, and 1--have to be the standard  by which we judge any alternatives. And while I would love to see the  final product pass with even larger numbers, and even with some  Democrats onboard with us, those numbers give us a clear picture as to  how much consensus is necessary.   Once again, I think we can get there, and I am continually working  with colleagues in both the House and Senate to make sure we do.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Committee on Finance has adopted rules  governing its procedures for the 115th Congress. Pursuant to rule XXVI,  paragraph 2, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I ask unanimous  consent that the accompanying rules for the Senate Committee on Finance  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            COMMITTEE ON FINANCE                           I. RULES OF PROCEDURE         Rule 1. Regular Meeting Days.--The regular meeting day of       the committee shall be the second and fourth Tuesday of each       month, except that if there be no business before the       committee the regular meeting shall be omitted.        Rule 2. Committee Meetings.--(a) Except as provided by       paragraph 3 of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate       (relating to special meetings called by a majority of the       committee) and subsection (b) of this rule, committee       meetings, for the conduct of business, for the purpose of       holding hearings, or for any other purpose, shall be called       by the chairman after consultation with the ranking minority       member. Members will be notified of committee meetings at       least 48 hours  [[Page S742]]       in advance, unless the chairman determines that an emergency       situation requires a meeting on shorter notice. The       notification will include a written agenda together with       materials prepared by the staff relating to that agenda.       After the agenda for a committee meeting is published and       distributed, no nongermane items may be brought up during       that meeting unless at least two-thirds of the members       present agree to consider those items.        (b) In the absence of the chairman, meetings of the       committee may be called by the ranking majority member of the       committee who is present, provided authority to call meetings       has been delegated to such member by the chairman.        Rule 3. Presiding Officer.--(a) The chairman shall preside       at all meetings and hearings of the committee except that in       his absence the ranking majority member who is present at the       meeting shall preside.        (b) Notwithstanding the rule prescribed by subsection (a)       any member of the committee may preside over the conduct of a       hearing.        Rule 4. Quorums.--(a) Except as provided in subsection (b)       one-third of the membership of the committee, including not       less than one member of the majority party and one member of       the minority party, shall constitute a quorum for the conduct       of business.        (b) Notwithstanding the rule prescribed by subsection (a),       one member shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of       conducting a hearing.        Rule 5. Reporting of Measures or Recommendations.--No       measure or recommendation shall be reported from the       committee unless a majority of the committee is actually       present and a majority of those present concur.        Rule 6. Proxy Voting; Polling.--(a) Except as provided by       paragraph 7(a)(3) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the       Senate (relating to limitation on use of proxy voting to       report a measure or matter), members who are unable to be       present may have their vote recorded by proxy.        (b) At the discretion of the committee, members who are       unable to be present and whose vote has not been cast by       proxy may be polled for the purpose of recording their vote       on any rollcall taken by the committee.        Rule 7. Order of Motions.--When several motions are before       the committee dealing with related or overlapping matters,       the chairman may specify the order in which the motions       shall be voted upon.        Rule 8. Bringing a Matter to a Vote.--If the chairman       determines that a motion or amendment has been adequately       debated, he may call for a vote on such motion or amendment,       and the vote shall then be taken, unless the committee votes       to continue debate on such motion or amendment, as the case       may be. The vote on a motion to continue debate on any motion       or amendment shall be taken without debate.        Rule 9. Public Announcement of Committee Votes.--Pursuant       to paragraph 7(b) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the       Senate (relating to public announcement of votes), the       results of rollcall votes taken by the committee on any       measure (or amendment thereto) or matter shall be announced       publicly not later than the day on which such measure or       matter is ordered reported from the committee.        Rule 10. Subpoenas.--Witnesses and memoranda, documents,       and records may be subpoenaed by the chairman of the       committee with the agreement of the ranking minority member       or by a majority vote of the committee. Subpoenas for       attendance of witnesses and the production of memoranda,       documents, and records shall be issued by the chairman, or by       any other member of the committee designated by him.        Rule 11. Nominations.--In considering a nomination, the       committee may conduct an investigation or review of the       nominee's experience, qualifications, and suitability, to       serve in the position to which he or she has been nominated.       To aid in such investigation or review, each nominee may be       required to submit a sworn detailed statement including       biographical, financial, policy, and other information which       the committee may request. The committee may specify which       items in such statement are to be received on a confidential       basis. Witnesses called to testify on the nomination may be       required to testify under oath.        Rule 12. Open Committee Hearings.--To the extent required       by paragraph 5 of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the       Senate (relating to limitations on open hearings), each       hearing conducted by the committee shall be open to the       public.        Rule 13. Announcement of Hearings.--The committee shall       undertake consistent with the provisions of paragraph 4(a) of       Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate (relating to       public notice of committee hearings) to issue public       announcements of hearings it intends to hold at least one       week prior to the commencement of such hearings.        Rule 14. Witnesses at Hearings.--(a) Each witness who is       scheduled to testify at any hearing must submit his written       testimony to the staff director not later than noon of the       business day immediately before the last business day       preceding the day on which he is scheduled to appear. Such       written testimony shall be accompanied by a brief summary of       the principal points covered in the written testimony. Having       submitted his written testimony, the witness shall be allowed       not more than ten minutes for oral presentation of his       statement.        (b) Witnesses may not read their entire written testimony,       but must confine their oral presentation to a summarization       of their arguments.        (c) Witnesses shall observe proper standards of dignity,       decorum, and propriety while presenting their views to the       committee. Any witness who violates this rule shall be       dismissed, and his testimony (both oral and written) shall       not appear in the record of the hearing.        (d) In scheduling witnesses for hearings, the staff shall       attempt to schedule witnesses so as to attain a balance of       views early in the hearings. Every member of the committee       may designate witnesses who will appear before the committee       to testify. To the extent that a witness designated by a       member cannot be scheduled to testify during the time set       aside for the hearing, a special time will be set aside for       the witness to testify if the member designating that witness       is available at that time to chair the hearing.        Rule 15. Audiences.--Persons admitted into the audience for       open hearings of the committee shall conduct themselves with       the dignity, decorum, courtesy, and propriety traditionally       observed by the Senate. Demonstrations of approval or       disapproval of any statement or act by any member or witness       are not allowed. Persons creating confusion or distractions       or otherwise disrupting the orderly proceeding of the hearing       shall be expelled from the hearing.        Rule 16. Broadcasting of Hearings.--(a) Broadcasting of       open hearings by television or radio coverage shall be       allowed upon approval by the chairman of a request filed with       the staff director not later than noon of the day before the       day on which such coverage is desired.        (b) If such approval is granted, broadcasting coverage of       the hearing shall be conducted unobtrusively and in       accordance with the standards of dignity, propriety,       courtesy, and decorum traditionally observed by the Senate.        (c) Equipment necessary for coverage by television and       radio media shall not be installed in, or removed from, the       hearing room while the committee is in session.        (d) Additional lighting may be installed in the hearing       room by the media in order to raise the ambient lighting       level to the lowest level necessary to provide adequate       television coverage of the hearing at the then current state       of the art of television coverage.        (e) The additional lighting authorized by subsection (d) of       this rule shall not be directed into the eyes of any members       of the committee or of any witness, and at the request of any       such member or witness, offending lighting shall be       extinguished.        Rule 17. Subcommittees.--(a) The chairman, subject to the       approval of the committee, shall appoint legislative       subcommittees. The ranking minority member shall recommend to       the chairman appointment of minority members to the       subcommittees. All legislation shall be kept on the full       committee calendar unless a majority of the members present       and voting agree to refer specific legislation to an       appropriate subcommittee.        (b) The chairman may limit the period during which House-      passed legislation referred to a subcommittee under paragraph       (a) will remain in that subcommittee. At the end of that       period, the legislation will be restored to the full       committee calendar. The period referred to in the preceding       sentences should be 6 weeks, but may be extended in the event       that adjournment or a long recess is imminent.        (c) All decisions of the chairman are subject to approval       or modification by a majority vote of the committee.        (d) The full committee may at any time by majority vote of       those members present discharge a subcommittee from further       consideration of a specific piece of legislation.        (e) The chairman and ranking minority members shall serve       as nonvoting ex officio members of the subcommittees on which       they do not serve as voting members.        (f) Any member of the committee may attend hearings held by       any subcommittee and question witnesses testifying before       that subcommittee.        (g) Subcommittee meeting times shall be coordinated by the       staff director to ensure that--        (1) no subcommittee meeting will be held when the committee       is in executive session, except by unanimous consent;        (2) no more than one subcommittee will meet when the full       committee is holding hearings; and        (3) not more than two subcommittees will meet at the same       time.        Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a subcommittee may       meet when the full committee is holding hearings and two       subcommittees may meet at the same time only upon the       approval of the chairman and the ranking minority member of       the committee and subcommittees involved.        (h) All nominations shall be considered by the full       committee.        (i) The chairman will attempt to schedule reasonably       frequent meetings of the full committee to permit       consideration of legislation reported favorably to the       committee by the subcommittees.        Rule 18. Transcripts of Committee Meetings.--An accurate       record shall be kept of all markups of the committee, whether       they be open or closed to the public. A transcript, marked as       ``uncorrected,'' shall be available for inspection by Members       of the Senate, or members of the committee together with       their staffs, at any time. Not later than 21 business days       after the meeting occurs, the committee shall make publicly       available through the Internet--  [[Page S743]]         (a) a video recording;        (b) an audio recording; or        (c) after all members of the committee have had a       reasonable opportunity to correct their remarks for       grammatical errors or to accurately reflect statements, a       corrected transcript.        Notwithstanding the above, in the case of the record of an       executive session of the committee that is closed to the       public pursuant to Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the       Senate, the record shall not be published or made public in       any way except by majority vote of the committee after all       members of the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to       correct their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately       reflect statements made.        Rule 19. Amendment of Rules.--The foregoing rules may be       added to, modified, amended, or suspended at any time.  II.

Each committee shall adopt rules (not inconsistent with       the Rules of the Senate) governing the procedure of such       committee. The rules of each committee shall be published in       the Congressional Record not later than March 1 of the first       year of each Congress, except that if any such committee is       established on or after February 1 of a year, the rules of       that committee during the year of establishment shall be       published in the Congressional Record not later than sixty       days after such establishment. Any amendment to the rules of       a committee shall not take effect until the amendment is       published in the Congressional Record.                                *    *    *         5. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the rules,       when the Senate is in session, no committee of the Senate or       any subcommittee thereof may meet, without special leave,       after the conclusion of the first two hours after the meeting       of the Senate commenced and in no case after two o'clock post       meridian unless consent therefor has been obtained from the       majority leader and the minority leader (or in the event of       the absence of either of such leaders, from his designee).       The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall not       apply to the Committee on Appropriations or the Committee on       the Budget. The majority leader or his designee shall       announce to the Senate whenever consent has been given under       this subparagraph and shall state the time and place of       such meeting. The right to make such announcement of       consent shall have the same priority as the filing of a       cloture motion.        (b) Each meeting of a committee, or any subcommittee       thereof, including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be       open to the public, except that a meeting or series of       meetings by a committee or a subcommittee thereof on the same       subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar days       may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to       go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters       enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) would require the       meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote       in open session by a majority of the members of the committee       or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be       discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or       meetings--        (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in       the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct       of the foreign relations of the United States;        (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff       personnel or internal staff management or procedure;        (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or       misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing       of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to       public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly       unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;        (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law       enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating       to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense       that is required to be kept secret in the interests of       effective law enforcement;        (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets       of financial or commercial information pertaining       specifically to a given person if--        (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept       confidential by Government officers and employees; or        (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on       a confidential basis, other than through an application by       such person for a specific Government financial or other       benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to       prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such       person; or        (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential       under other provisions of law or Government regulations.        (c) Whenever any hearing conducted by any such committee or       subcommittee is open to the public, that hearing may be       broadcast by radio or television, or both, under such rules       as the committee or subcommittee may adopt.        (d) Whenever disorder arises during a committee meeting       that is open to the public, or any demonstration of approval       or disapproval is indulged in by any person in attendance at       any such meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chair to       enforce order on his own initiative and without any point of       order being made by a Senator. When the Chair finds it       necessary to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear       the room, and the committee may act in closed session for so       long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.        (e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete       transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record       the proceeding of each meeting or conference whether or not       such meeting or any part thereof is closed under this       paragraph, unless a majority of its members vote to forgo       such a record.  *    *    *                            ____________________     Mr. President, I take umbrage with what the minority  leader said. I sat here and listened to the distinguished Senator from  Massachusetts, who went on and on and on. Many of her remarks were  criticizing a fellow colleague in the Senate. I don't know about the  other side, but I find it offensive for either side to be criticizing,  as was done here tonight, a sitting Member of the Senate.   I am absolutely astounded that the Democrats, my friends on the other  side, have taken to the war tables a desire to defeat Jeff Sessions. I  have been here a long time, and I have to say that I knew Jeff Sessions  even before he came here, and I have known him since he has been here.  And, yes, I differ with him on a number of issues, but I would never  say things about him as have been said by my colleagues on the other  side. I think that we all ought to take some stock in what we are doing  here.   Jeff Sessions is a very fine person. Think of his wife. She is a  really fine person. Jeff has been here 20 years. He has interchanged  with almost all of us. Sometimes you agree with him, and sometimes you  disagree with him, but he has always been a gentleman. He has always  been kind and considerate of his colleagues. I can't name one time when  he wasn't. Yet we are treating him like he is some terrible person who  doesn't deserve to be chosen by the current President of the United  States to be Attorney General of the United States.   I think we ought to be ashamed of ourselves--I really do--on both  sides. And frankly, we have to get to where everything is not an issue  here. I know some of my friends on the other side and I have chatted,  and they are not happy with the way this body is going with good  reason.   Everything doesn't have to lead to a gun fight on the floor, but that  is where we are going. And frankly, sometimes there is an awful lot of  politics being played here on both sides.   Look, I happen to like the senior Senator from Massachusetts. I think  she is an intelligent, lovely woman in many ways. But I have to tell  you, I listened to her for quite a while, and she didn't have a good  thing to say about a fellow Senator. Frankly, I don't think that is  right. If we don't respect each other, we are going down a very steep  path to oblivion.   I would hope that both sides would take stock of these debates. We  can differ. We understand that the Democrats are not happy with the  current President. We are happy with him. We can differ on that, and we  can fight over various issues and so forth. But to attack a fellow  Senator without reservation seems to me the wrong thing to do.   It may not have risen to the level of a violation of the rules, but I  think it comes close, and I have sat here and listened to most of it  and, frankly, I don't believe that the distinguished Senator from  Massachusetts was right in any respect. I have been here a long time  and I have seen some pretty rough talk, but never like we have had this  first couple of months here. We have gone so far on both sides that we  are almost dysfunctional.    I admit it was tough for the Democrats to lose the Presidential  election. Most people thought that Hillary Clinton would win. I was not  one of them. I thought there was a real chance because I knew a lot of  people would not say for whom they were going to vote. I think,  correctly, I interpreted that meant that they were going to vote for  Donald Trump, and the reason they were is that they are tired of what  is going on. They are tired of what is hurting this country. They are  tired of the picayune little fights that we have around here.   I think we have to grow up. I suggest that all of us take stock of  ourselves and see if we can treat each other with greater respect. I  have to say, I resented--as much as I like the distinguished Senator  from Massachusetts, I resent the constant diatribe against a fellow  Senator. Even if everything she said was true, it wasn't the right  thing to do. I don't think any of us should do that to them, either. We  can differ, we can argue, we can fight over certain words and so forth,  but I have been appalled at the way the Democrats have treated Jeff  Sessions. I have found Jeff Sessions--having worked with him for 20  years and having disagreed with him on a number of things--to be a  gentleman in every respect and to present his viewpoints in a  reasonable and decent way.   I would hope that my colleagues on the other side would consider  voting  [[Page S859]]  for Jeff Sessions or at least treating him with respect.   I admit that I think some of this comes from the fact that they are  very upset at Donald Trump, and it is easy to see why. He won a very  tough, contested election against one of their principal people. That  is hard to take, maybe. That doesn't justify what has been going on  against Jeff Sessions.   We ought to be proud that Jeff has a chance to become the Attorney  General of the United States, and he is going to be. That is the thing  that really bothers me. Everybody on the other side knows that we have  the votes to finally do this. Yet, they are treating it as though this  is something that they have to try and win--which they are not going to  win--and, in the process, treating a fellow Senator with disdain. It is  wrong.   We should all take stock of ourselves. I am not accusing my  colleagues of not being sincere, but they have been sincerely wrong. I  am personally fed up with it. If we want to fight every day and just go  after each other like people who just don't care about etiquette and  courtesy, I guess we can do that, but I think it is the wrong thing to  do.   I hope all of us will stop, take note of what has been going on, and  on both sides start trying to work together. I know it was tough for my  Democrat friends to lose the Presidential election. I know that was  tough. And they didn't think they were going to, and, frankly, a lot of  us didn't think they were going to. I did think that. But, then again,  I was one of two Senators who supported Donald Trump, in my opinion,  with very, very good reason. I am sure that doesn't convince any  Democrats on the other side.   The fact is that we have to treat each other with respect or this  place is going to devolve into nothing but a jungle, and that would  truly be a very, very bad thing.   I am not perfect, so I don't mean to act like I am, but I have to say  that all of us need to take stock. We need to start thinking about the  people on the other side. We need to start thinking about how we might  bring each other together in the best interests of our country and how  we might literally elevate the Senate to the position that we all hope  it will be.   I love all of my colleagues. There is not one person in this body  that I don't care for a lot. I disagree quite a bit with some of my  colleagues on the other side, and even some folks on our side, but that  doesn't mean that I have to treat them with disrespect.   I yield the floor.
