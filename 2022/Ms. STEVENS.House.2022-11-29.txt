 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 231) to direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency to develop guidance for firefighters and other  emergency response personnel on best practices to protect them from  exposure to PFAS and to limit and prevent the release of PFAS into the  environment, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 231         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Firefighters from       Adverse Substances Act'' or the ``PFAS Act''.       SEC. 2. GUIDANCE ON HOW TO PREVENT EXPOSURE TO AND RELEASE OF                     PFAS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in       consultation with the Administrator of the United States Fire       Administration, the Administrator of the Environmental       Protection Agency, the Director of the National Institute for       Occupational Safety and Health, and the heads of any other       relevant agencies, shall--        (1) develop and publish guidance for firefighters and other       emergency response personnel on training, education programs,       and best practices;        (2) make available a curriculum designed to--        (A) reduce and eliminate exposure to per- and       polyfluoroalkyl substances (commonly referred to as ``PFAS'')       from firefighting foam and personal protective equipment;        (B) prevent the release of PFAS from firefighting foam into       the environment; and        (C) educate firefighters and other emergency response       personnel on foams and non-foam alternatives, personal       protective equipment, and other firefighting tools and       equipment that do not contain PFAS; and        (3) create an online public repository, which shall be       updated on a regular basis, on tools and best practices for       firefighters and other emergency response personnel to       reduce, limit, and prevent the release of and exposure to       PFAS.        (b) Curriculum.--        (1) In general.--For the purpose of developing the       curriculum required under subsection (a)(2), the       Administrator of the United States Fire Administration shall       make recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland Security as       to the content of the curriculum.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on S. 231, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 231, the Protecting  Firefighters from Adverse Substances Act, or the PFAS Act, championed  by my Michigan colleagues and dear friends, Congresswoman Debbie  Dingell and Senator Gary Peters.   I profoundly thank them for their steadfast and dedicated leadership  on addressing PFAS contamination to protect our natural waters in the  Great Lakes, our air, and beyond.   Exposure to PFAS chemicals continues to harm the health and well- being of families across America. My home State of Michigan has the  most PFAS contaminated sites in the country, thus making it the State's  biggest environmental crisis in half a century. But we also have been  one of the very few States tracking it.   Although scientific knowledge regarding PFAS continues to develop, we  know PFAS chemicals are linked to serious adverse health effects in  human beings. The more we find out, the worse the picture appears.   Recently, the EPA sounded the alarm bell and asked its Science  Advisory Board, the SAB, to review new analyses and data that suggests  that two chemicals, which have been found in many drinking waters and  surface waters in Michigan and around the country, are far more toxic  than previously thought.   While officials in Michigan have taken steps to address this crisis,  there is so much more to be done at every level of government.   Our efforts in Michigan need to be strengthened by Congressional  action. In order to adequately address this threat, we need the Federal  Government to step it up. That is why I am proud to cosponsor the bill  we are considering today, Congresswoman Dingell's and Senator Peters'  Protecting Firefighters from Adverse Substances Act.   PFAS are human-made chemicals that have been manufactured since the  1940s and can be found in a wide range of both consumer and industrial  products, including firefighting foam and firefighter turnout gear.   While firefighters have dedicated their lives to protecting others in  keeping our communities safe, they have, unfortunately, been exposed to  these forever chemicals on the job.   The Department of Defense, the National Institute of Standards and  Technology, and the Federal Aviation Administration all conduct  research on PFAS-free firefighting foam or PFAS-free firefighter gear.   This promising work across our Federal Government is vital to  reducing exposure to PFAS, but more progress is needed. Until PFAS-free  alternatives are widespread, we must do everything we can to protect  firefighters, emergency medical responders, and the communities they  serve from unnecessary PFAS exposure.   This bipartisan legislation directs the administrator of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency to offer resources to help protect  firefighters, emergency response personnel, and the communities they  serve from PFAS exposure.                                time  1500    The bill also directs the administrator to provide resources that  identify PFAS-free alternatives for firefighting gear and equipment.  This  [[Page H8610]]  guidance would be developed in consultation with other Federal agencies  conducting research on PFAS-free alternatives, as well as a wide range  of stakeholders, including firefighting and emergency response  personnel, communities dealing with PFAS contamination, fire training  academies, manufacturers of firefighting tools and equipment, and  voluntary standards organizations.   This is America doing what America does best: innovating. This bill  is an important step to protecting our first responders in the line of  duty from exposure to harmful chemicals.   It has already passed the Senate with bipartisan support, and today I  urge my colleagues to join me in passing the bill here in the House and  sending it to the President.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Michigan an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we stand here today in strong support of S. 231, the  PFAS Act, and certainly recognize the leadership that has come from the  Michigan delegation here in the House with Congresswoman Debbie  Dingell, who has been steadfast, dedicated, and dogged. You don't  travel through Michigan without hearing Congresswoman Dingell talk  about PFAS.   We also appreciate the Senate leadership of Senator Gary Peters,  particularly in his chairmanship of the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee, in partnership with the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) who just spoke, along with our full  committee chair, Eddie Bernice Johnson, who has been a real role model  for leadership and support in this body for bipartisan, collaborative  legislation.   As I stand here with the last month of this term upon us in the 117th  Congress, I can't help but thank Ranking Member Lucas for his very  dedicated and remarkable leadership. One might say it is an anchor of  sorts as we move to be bipartisan. Over the course of this term, I have  had the privilege of sitting next to him in committee, and I will take  the time to let him know that he has taught me a few things this term,  which I greatly appreciate.   As we move forward, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle in this Chamber to continue to showcase the  best of what America can be, coming together to solve problems and  deliver for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
