 Madam President, I rise today with my colleague,  the senior Senator from North Carolina, to honor the life and work of  Sam Taylor, the president of North Carolina Biosciences Organization.  Sam was a giant in our State and a leading voice for our vital and  innovative life sciences and biopharmaceutical sector. A native North  Carolinian, his love for his home State and his commitment to its  future always shone through. He was a graduate of North Carolina State  University, and he received his law degree with high honors from the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.   Sam was a dedicated and energetic voice for the biosciences and a  terrific partner to those in government and the private sector  committed to promoting those industries. This sector has seen  remarkable growth in recent years: since 2016, increasing its  employment base by 10 percent to reach more than 83,000 jobs in 2018  across 4,210 business establishments. Between 2016 and 2019, the  biosciences has attracted more than $1.5 billion in venture capital  investment to North Carolina. These successes were in no small part due  to Sam and his tireless leadership and advocacy.   Sam was one of the founders of NC BIO in 1994, long before most  people grasped the industry's potential. His advocacy in the business  community, in Raleigh, in Washington, and around the world made a huge  difference. Whether promoting our world-class universities, our  startups, or more established companies, Sam was always there with the  facts, the vision, and the sheer force of will to move our State  forward. He worked for the creation of the NCBioImpact training  collaborative with the NC Community College System's BioNetwork  program, as well as the Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center  at North Carolina State University and the Biomanufacturing Research  Institute and Technology Enterprise program at North Carolina Central  University.   Sam's work was recognized by the North Carolina Council for  Entrepreneurial Development in 2005 with the Chairman's Service Award.  He received the Life Science Conference Leadership Award in 2012 and  the Life Science Award from Triangle Business Journal in 2015. Just  recently and most significantly, he received our State's highest honor,  the Order of the Long Leaf Pine. To say Sam was a giant among men is an  understatement. He was a leader and a visionary, someone who truly  wanted to make our State and world a better place.   North Carolinians have lost a loyal son and a tireless advocate. We  have lost a friend and colleague. Today, we ask every member of this  body to join us in honoring the life and amazing legacy of Sam Taylor.  Our State and the people of the United States are grateful for his life  of service, and we know that North Carolina will continue to be one of  our Nation's life science innovation hubs in no small part due to  him.                            ____________________
