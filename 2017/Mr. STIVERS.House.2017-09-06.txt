 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1258, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $28,375,000) (increased by $28,375,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Stivers) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would transfer funding for  the Private Enforcement Initiative at HUD to the Administrative  Enforcement Initiative. The amendment does not change the top line  appropriation.   I believe the Fair Housing Act must be strongly enforced, and I  believe this is best accomplished by strengthening HUD's Administrative  Enforcement Initiative and enhancing the role of State and local  agencies in finding and punishing bad actors.   The Private Enforcement Initiative has been abused by some nonprofits  that are more interested in winning attorneys' fees than finding and  punishing bad actors. The cost of these frivolous lawsuits ultimately  is transferred onto low- and middle-income Americans in the form of  more expensive rent and housing, worsening our country's affordable  housing crisis.   I don't believe this is fair or what was intended under the Fair  Housing Act. I believe there is a better way to more strongly and  effectively enforce fair housing protections, a similar amendment  passed 2 years ago, and I encourage my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H7054]]                                     time  2100    Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this  amendment. The Private Enforcement Initiative provides grants to  nonprofit organizations to prevent and eliminate discriminatory housing  practices.   These organizations receive complaints. They investigate them. They  work to educate landlords and property managers on their  responsibilities under Federal fair housing law. Their work ensures  that legitimate complaints move forward and that education is provided  to housing providers when that is appropriate.   Across the country, PEI grantees are working to ensure that families  with children have access to housing. Just this May, HUD and Project  Sentinel, an organization in California, announced a conciliation  agreement with a landlord who refused to rent to people with small  children and infants. Another PEI grantee in California worked to  ensure that a person with disabilities had access to a medically  required service animal. Another grantee in Illinois worked to ensure  that a mortgage lender did not discriminate on the basis of race. This  is the kind of work that PEIs do.   It may seem expedient to some to transfer the funding and  responsibility of investigating fair housing complaints to States and  local units of government, but we would lose a lot by doing that. What  we would lose is the organizational knowledge, the years of expertise  that the PEI program has developed.   Now, if the gentleman has specific issues with the program about how  it is run, you know, the authorizing committee can hear those  complaints, not the appropriations process. This is not the place to  refine the law under which the program operates, let alone to pull the  plug on funding.   Given all of the good work that PEI grantees do across the country  and in my district, I can't support eliminating this program, and I  urge colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, in some jurisdictions there  are many abuses. ``60 Minutes'' had a great story about this. Other  media outlets have featured the abuses as well.   The gentleman argues that, gee, we can't do this in the  appropriations process. We do limitation amendments every day.  Limitation amendments are germane and effective controls that we have  in place and we are allowed to put in place on these spending programs.   I simply believe that the administrative enforcement initiative is  more effective and will use the money to better help low- and moderate- income Americans.   I disagree with the gentleman, and I urge my colleagues to support  the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a pretty  good example, I must say, of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  There may be complaints here and there. There are ways to pursue those  complaints. But the good work that these organizations do, the  documented cases of discrimination, discriminatory practices, exclusion  that they have remedied, that they have made right, should be very  compelling to us.   Certainly, the blunt instrument of simply withholding of funding  isn't going to deal with that. It is going to likely do great damage to  organizations that, across the country, have had a very positive  impact.   This amendment would end their work. It would end the work of  nonprofits that use funding to ensure housing providers remain in  compliance with Federal housing law. It is a very bad idea.   Mr. Chair, let's oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would direct the gentleman, Mr.  Chairman, to a GAO report on this very program that talks about these  abuses, and I hope he takes a serious look at it.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).   The amendment was agreed to.           Amendment No. 49 Offered by Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 49  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
