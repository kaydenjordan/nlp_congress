 Madam Speaker, the media bias beat goes on.   Last week on PBS, columnist Mark Shields criticized Senate sponsors  of the new healthcare bill. He said that no Republican Senators have  credentials for working on healthcare, and added that Senator Cassidy  got to the Senate a year ago and is not exactly a long-term legislator.   In two clicks online, Mark Shields could have learned that Bill  Cassidy and his wife are both doctors who have provided healthcare for  people around the world. Those are called credentials. Senator Cassidy  also served in the State senate, three terms in the U.S. House, and is  now in his third year in the United States Senate. He is obviously an  experienced legislator.   Where is the balance? Where is the truth? And the liberal national  media wonder why their credibility with the American people is at a  record low.                            ____________________
