It is a theme  [[Page S3108]]  that definitely speaks to me. I am an outdoors guy through and through.  I love pheasant hunting, boating, swimming, running. I will shoot hoops  whenever I get the chance, indoors or outdoors, but this is nothing  better than doing it outdoors.   When I was a kid, my dad attached a basket to a pole in our backyard,  and there was nothing my siblings and I liked better than spending long  summer days and sometimes fall days and spring days shooting hoops in  our backyard in Murdo.   The outdoors was a huge part of my life as a kid. We spent the long  summer days outside, barring the hour every day my mother made us come  inside to read. On summer evenings, my dad would take us to get ice  cream cones, and then we would drive down to the White River to watch  the sunset.   Another outdoor pastime we embraced was hunting. My dad taught my  siblings and me to hunt, and I loved going out with him. Pheasant  hunting remains one of my favorite outdoor activities, and I get  excited every year as the third Saturday in October--the official start  to pheasant season--rolls around.   It is a tradition that I am happy to be able to share with the next  generation, as my dad shared it with me. There is nothing better than a  day spent outdoors with friends and family, followed by a communal  meal, sometimes involving pheasant.   Being in the outdoors isn't just enjoyable; I think it is a part of  the good life. The health benefits of time spent outdoors are well- established, and I know a day--or even an hour--out in the fresh air  always clears my mind and refreshes my spirit.   With more and more of our life spent in front of screens, I think  time spent outdoors and disconnected is even more important than ever.  I am grateful for all those hours we spent as kids running around  outside and for family activities outdoors, like our summer trip to the  Black Hills. We used to go out there for Labor Day, stay in this little  non-air-conditioned cabin and just enjoy the outdoors.   We would hike, and we would visit caves. We would go to Mount  Rushmore, head to the lake--I loved and still love visiting Sylvan Lake  in South Dakota.   I loved being there with my parents and siblings, and I loved taking  my daughters there on trips like the ones I took growing up. Nobody who  visits South Dakota should miss the Black Hills.   I am not sure there is a more beautiful place on Earth--the interplay  of light and shadow on the trees and rocks late on a summer afternoon,  the endless South Dakota sky reflected in the blue of Sylvan Lake and  other lakes in the Black Hills, the Milky Way carpeting the night sky  with millions of diamonds. There is no better place to spend time in  the great outdoors than South Dakota.   Our State is filled with natural wonders, the Missouri River, Jewel  Cave and Wind Cave, two of the longest caves in the world. Together,  they offer hundreds of miles of underground passageways to explore,  filled with glimmering crystals and remarkable rock formations.   We have the magnificent Black Hills National Forest in Custer State  Park, rolling prairies, and, of course, the Badlands. If you haven't  experienced the rugged beauty of the Badlands, you are missing out-- extraordinary layered rock formations that look like they might have  come from another planet, a wealth of fossils.   Everybody should see the sunset over the Badlands at least once in  their life, turning the tops of the rocks to a sea of fiery orange.   And, of course, no mention of South Dakota's great outdoors would be  complete without a mention of Mount Rushmore, one of our national  treasures. Nature got a little help from man here, and the result is  magnificent. You can't help but be awed when you see Mount Rushmore  soaring up in front of you. And you can't help but feel a little  prouder to be a citizen of this great land.   Our Nation's great outdoor spaces need to be cared for so that we can  preserve them for future generations--from wildlife enthusiasts to  hikers and runners to farmers and ranchers. I am a longtime supporter  of the Conservation Reserve Program.   Agricultural producers are familiar with the Conservation Reserve  Program, or what we call CRP, which provides incentives for farmers,  ranchers, and landowners to take environmentally sensitive land out of  production for 10 to 15 years.   The Conservation Reserve Program helps the environment by improving  soil health and water quality and providing habitat for wildlife,  including endangered and threatened species. I pushed for an increase  in the CRP acreage cap in the 2018 farm bill, and the final bill raised  that acreage cap to 27 million acres.   Currently, I am working on further improvements of CRP that I will  work to get included in the 2023 farm bill. Based on my conversations  with farmers and ranchers, I developed the Conservation Reserve Program  Improvement Act, which I introduced in March. This legislation would  make CRP grazing a more attractive option by providing cost-share  payments for all CRP practices for the establishment of grazing  infrastructure, including fencing and water distribution.   It would also increase the annual payment limit for CRP--which has  not changed since 1985--to help account for inflation and the increase  in land value.   This would enhance the appeal of CRP for farmers and ranchers,  improving their bottom line while helping to protect the environment  and increase wildlife habitat.   Another priority of mine is improving forest management in the Black  Hills National Forest to reduce the risk of wildfires and damaging  insect infestations.   I have introduced two pieces of legislation during this Congress to  help improve management of our national forests, including the Black  Hills. Currently on-the-ground management activities, including timber  thinning, are significantly lagging in the Black Hills National Forest  and other forests throughout the country.   My Expediting Forest Restoration and Recovery Act would require the  U.S. Forest Service to expedite treatment of more than 70 million acres  of National Forest System lands to reduce the threat of insect and  disease infestations and catastrophic wildfires.   My Black Hills Forest Protection and Jobs Preservation Act is also  designed to help expedite forest management projects in the Black Hills  and elsewhere. The bill, which I introduced with my Wyoming colleague,  Senator John Barrasso, would require the U.S. Forest Service to quickly  issue National Environmental Policy Act decisions that are necessary to  carry out forest management projects, including thinning of overly  dense timber stands in the Black Hills National Forest.   Our bill would also expedite timber production projects in the Black  Hills National Forest and neighboring national forests to help maintain  the timber sale program that plays a critical role in keeping these  forests healthy while also supporting the regional economy.   I am grateful to live in a State that has so much to offer when it  comes to the great outdoors. And I will continue to work to protect and  preserve our national treasures, and I hope every American will take  advantage of Great Outdoors Month to get outside and enjoy our natural  world.
