 Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished gentleman for  yielding, and I now look forward to entering into a discussion with Mr.  Poliquin for the purpose of a colloquy.    I yield to the gentleman from Maine.    Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman  from Maine for working with the committee to improve the provision,  while maintaining progress towards strengthening our fleet in the  critical ballistic missile defense mission and capability. Your  amendment helps us do just that, while ensuring that we maintain the  health and critical skill workforces at our two proven vital destroyer  shipbuilders, including Bath Iron Works in Maine.    I yield to the gentleman from Maine.
