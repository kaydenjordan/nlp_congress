 Mr. Speaker, I thought the Republican plan for repealing  the Affordable Care Act and dropping 24 million Americans from  healthcare coverage could not get any worse, but I was wrong. The  latest iteration of TrumpCare still drops millions from their coverage,  but will now make coverage worse and more expensive for those who can  get it.   I believe all Americans deserve protections for the coverage of  essential health services and preexisting conditions, not just Members  of Congress. Swiss cheese insurance plans that don't cover ER visits or  prescriptions and charge you more if you have ever been sick aren't  worth the paper they are printed on.   This bill undermines our healthcare system in so many damaging ways.  And for what?   Let's not forget that the bill includes nearly $600 billion in tax  breaks for drug companies, insurers, and the wealthy. Millionaires  would get an average annual tax cut of more than $50,000 while  hardworking families and older Americans would struggle to afford  meaningful coverage.   I won't stand for a bill that endangers the well-being of my  constituents to benefit the very wealthiest Americans. I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
