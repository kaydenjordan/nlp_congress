 Mr. Speaker, I rise, like most of the  delegation here, in memory of our longtime friend and colleague, the  late Jim Bunning, who was an indomitable force on the pitcher's mound,  a stalwart champion for the Commonwealth, and the proud patriarch of a  remarkable family.   Jim Bunning is the type of guy you always wanted in your starting  lineup. With his multilayered talent, Jim valued strategic offense as  much as staunch defense not only on the pitcher's mound, but in the  Halls of Congress, where he fervently stood for conservative values.   Jim once said: ``I have been booed by 60,000 fans at Yankee Stadium  standing alone at the pitcher's mound, so I have never really cared if  I stood alone here in Congress as long as I stood for my beliefs and my  values.''   Jim was bold and headstrong, but also fiercely loyal, a combination  that made him effective in every endeavor he undertook. He lived a  courageous life that was highlighted by his Hall of Fame record and  commitment to public service. Jim left an indelible mark on our State,  on our Nation, and his legacy will endure for generations.   My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our heartfelt sympathy to Mary and the  entire Bunning family. We are forever grateful for Jim's courage of  conviction to faithfully serve the people of the Commonwealth.   I had the pleasure of serving with Jim in the House before he was  elected to the U.S. Senate, and many times we would be on this floor  when Jim's indomitable spirit would surface. He held strong beliefs and  he had strong opinions, but, as Jim Host has said, you have never met a  straighter arrow than Jim Bunning.   We are going to miss you, Big Right-Hander.
