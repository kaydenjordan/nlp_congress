 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate President Biden and his administration following  February's job report.   678,000, that is the total number of jobs created last month. But  these are not just any type of jobs. These jobs are good-paying jobs  that are giving Americans the dignity of a good paycheck.   In the last 13 months, 7.4 million jobs have been created, and  unemployment has been slashed from 6.4 percent to 3.8 percent. When the  President took office, over 18 million people were receiving  unemployment benefits. Today, only 2 million people remain.   The bottom line, Madam Speaker, is we are seeing the best economy for  American workers in decades, with people getting higher wages, better  benefits, and better jobs across the board.   Our national deficit has also seen improvement. Under President  Biden's watch, the deficit fell by $360 billion last year. This is the  first deficit decline in more than half a decade. Better yet, our  Nation is on track to cut the deficit even more this year. Biden's plan  of action will make sure we continue our path to building a better  America.   But building a better America requires much more than only economic  success. It also requires healthy communities. I am proud to share that  America has had much success on the public health front during Biden's  first year.   In my home State of Texas, only 10 percent of the population was  fully vaccinated this time last year. Today, 60 percent of the entire  population is fully vaccinated in Texas. On top of that, 21 percent of  the population have received a booster shot.   In short, Madam Speaker, our Nation is recovering, and we are  powering through the challenges COVID-19 created.   As we continue to recover from COVID-19 and rebuild the economy, we  also must invest in our infrastructure. Investing in roads, bridges,  and public transportation is critical. Shockingly, in America, one in  three U.S. bridges need repairs or replacement. Biden has a plan for  that, too.   There are 4,000 infrastructure projects already planned, alongside  65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges scheduled to be repaired.   But it is not only highways and bridges that need repairs and  upgrades. Our ports need improvements as well. In my home area, the  Port of Houston secured $142,500,000 in new funding because of the  Biden boom.   In Houston, the transit authority, METRO, also received more than  $137 million in Federal funds to strengthen local public  transportation.   The best part, Madam Speaker, this is only the beginning. I am truly  excited that we are really accomplishing much for the American people  as we work in partnership with President Biden and his boom. We truly  are building a better America for generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, in January, 14 HBCUs received bomb  threats. Even worse, on the first day of Black History Month, 18 HBCUs  received bomb threats. That is more than 30 threats to our HBCUs in  only 3 months. That is simply appalling and unacceptable.   The numbers show threats to HBCUs are rising. These threats have no  place in our communities. These actions must stop now and should be  condemned by Congress now.   As a proud graduate of the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas  Southern University, an HBCU institution, and a proud member of the  HBCU Caucus, I am honored to cosponsor H. Con. Res. 70, which condemns  these threats to our HBCUs.   Students deserve to be free from fear. College is for learning, not  for bombing. I urge my colleagues to condemn these acts now and support  this resolution.
