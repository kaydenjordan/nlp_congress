 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Orange County Fire  Authority Chief Brian Fennessy for receiving the 2022 California Fire  Chief of the Year award.   As California continues to see worsening fire seasons, Orange County  families are fortunate to have a leader like Chief Fennessy, who is  dedicated to making our communities safer.   Since joining the Orange County Fire Authority in 2018, Chief  Fennessy has placed a strong focus on community outreach, fire  mitigation, and disaster preparedness. He has also equipped his  firefighters with the tools and training that they need to be safe and  to keep us safe.   I was honored to have Chief Fennessy join me for a townhall where we  discussed disaster preparedness measures and ways to stay safe from  wildfires.   I congratulate Chief Fennessy on this well-deserved recognition and  look forward to continuing to work with him and the wonderful Orange  County Fire Authority team.                            ____________________
