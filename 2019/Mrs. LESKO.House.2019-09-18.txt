 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Torres for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we all want to protect innocent people, we all want to  protect the little guy, and we all want to protect the elderly. That is  why I would remind my colleague that courts can and have overturned  unfair arbitration clauses, and, certainly, if criminal acts have been  done, criminal charges should be pursued.   Today, we consider a bill that disregards private contracts and  enriches the wealthiest trial attorneys. We consider a bill that my  Democrat colleagues intended to protect the American people, but really  it specifically carves out an application to labor unions. And why  would it do that? Because the labor unions and trial lawyers are the  Democrats' most ardent supporters and donors. We consider a bill that  will hurt businesses and the very consumers and employees it seeks to  protect.   The bill's proponents advance the idea that arbitration is unfair,  coercive, and harmful, but that is far from the truth. In fact, I would  like to read some of the things that the U.S. Supreme Court has said  about arbitration agreements in various cases. They have said: The  advantages of arbitration are many; it is usually cheaper and faster  than litigation, it can have simpler procedural and evidentiary rules;  it normally minimizes hostility and is less disruptive of ongoing and  future business dealings among the parties; it is often more flexible  in regard to scheduling of time and places of hearings and discovery  devices; and the  [[Page H7763]]  U.S. Supreme Court in multiple rulings also further recognized that the  informality of arbitral proceedings is itself desirable, reducing the  cost and increasing the speed of dispute and resolution. And in other  studies it has proven, over and over again in multiple studies, that  arbitration actually has better results for the small guy, for the  employee.    The bill's proponents advance the idea that arbitration is unfair,  coercive, and harmful. But again, I repeat, that is far from the truth.  Arbitration is an important option in our legal system. It allows us to  resolve disputes without costly litigation. It is easier, faster, and  cheaper.   Arbitration is well accepted and available to those who wish not to  bring their disputes before Federal or State courts. It is a way to  avoid the inflexibility, delays, and expenses of litigation. In fact,  an employee can often set times better with arbitration than they do  with a court hearing. It is especially useful in consumer disputes,  which typically involve smaller claims.   Aside from benefits in cost and time, studies show that the results  of arbitration are as good, or often better results than one would get  in court.   To be fair, I don't believe that arbitration is always appropriate.  For example, I, personally, do not agree with mandatory binding  arbitration in situations involving sexual assault. I would be willing  to work across the aisle with my Democratic colleagues on a tailored  bill addressing the issue of sexual assault, but this bill is way too  wide and targets arbitration across the board.   This bill would shut some Americans out of the justice system.  Eliminating arbitration means that Americans, who can't afford  courtroom lawyers' fees, may never receive justice. Allowing only those  who can afford attorneys to obtain justice is not justice.   While shutting out some Americans from the justice system, this bill  gives a massive handout to trial lawyers, who will greatly benefit from  the huge increase in litigation costs. Money-hungry trial lawyers  benefit from this bill, not everyday consumers and employees.   In fact, an amendment that was offered in Rules last night by  Congressman Sensenbrenner, who has been here for years and studied this  topic, would have said, okay, arbitration stays in place, the status  quo. But there is an option. If the trial lawyer can tell the consumer,  the client, how much money it is going to cost to take it to court--and  that is reasonable, and he had different ways that you would determine  if the trial attorney fees were reasonable--then you can go ahead. My  Democrat colleagues in the Rules committee rejected that amendment, a  reasonable amendment.   I believe if this bill passes, we will see a rise in class action  lawsuits and the abuse that comes from it. The rampant abuse in class  action lawsuits is why companies have chosen mandatory binding  arbitrations in the first place. If mandatory binding agreements are  invalidated, there will be substantially more class action abuses.   Mr. Speaker, arbitration is beneficial. It saves time and money for  both parties, and achieves just as good, if not better, outcomes for  those involved.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would also like to expand on several studies that have been done on  this  [[Page H7764]]  issue throughout the years. One is the Searle study, another one done  by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and another one done by  the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform. In all of these studies  with different cases, it was found that employees were three times more  likely to win in arbitration than in court. Employees, on average, won  twice the amount of money through arbitration. In this U.S. Chamber  Institute for Legal Reform report, it specifically said the employee  won in arbitration an average of $520,630 versus in court, where the  average was $269,885.   It also said arbitration disputes were resolved faster, on average:  569 days for arbitration; litigation, 665 days. Both seem long to me.   Mr. Speaker, 79 percent of arbitration cases were filed by employees  who made less than $100,000.   What I am saying is, let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  Arbitration has worked. It has worked for years. It has proven  repeatedly that it is more cost-effective. In the cases of these  studies, the employees actually got awarded more than they did, on  average, when they went to court.   Let's not forget all of those people who have used trial attorneys.  Mr. Speaker, you hear it over and over again, where the attorneys got  all the money and the victims got hardly anything.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, sometimes I don't understand why my Democratic  colleagues put forward certain bills and not other bills, and this is  not a bill that--I don't know about my colleagues, but I haven't had a  lot of constituents talk to me about this bill and the need for it.   In fact, I have in front of me a recent poll that was done. It was  conducted in March 2019. There were 1,000 registered voters who were  polled. In that poll, it asked: ``Is arbitration viewed much more  favorably than both class-action and individual lawsuits?''   On this, it said in all cases that arbitration was viewed more  favorably by our constituents than individual lawsuits.   It goes on to break this down among Republicans, independents, and  Democrats. In this case, Republicans thought that arbitration was a  better format by 47 percent; independents, 36 percent; and half and  half, another 36 percent. Democrats thought arbitration was better than  going to court, 44 percent, and then another 34 percent added to 10  percent. Our constituents--and I may not be reading this right because  it is in black and white instead of color. I will show it to the  gentlewoman later.   If you add the two together, it clearly shows that Republicans,  independents, and Democrats favor arbitration over going to court, and  it is probably because of cases like this.   In fact, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found numerous  problems in its study to be associated with reliance on class-action  lawsuits for recovery on consumer claims. In addition, class-action  lawsuits also have presented other problems, including scandal  involving fabricated testimony bought and sold to support false claims.   For example, multiple renowned class-action lawyers have been exposed  and convicted of such behavior. One of them, William Lerach of Milberg  Weiss, told The Wall Street Journal that illegal kickbacks to people  recruited to file class-action lawsuits is an industry practice. He and  fellow trial lawyer Melvyn Weiss engineered a $250 million criminal  scheme to pay people to sue companies, lied about it in court, and  became Federal prisoners.   Another of American's most prominent trial lawyers, Richard Scruggs  of Mississippi, pled guilty in March 2018 to bribing a State judge to  obtain more legal fees.   I have already talked about how the U.S. Supreme Court, through  multiple cases, has said that arbitration is a good practice, better in  many cases than going to court. I have already talked about multiple  studies that have studied the analysis between arbitration and court;  that employees, on average, get awarded more money through arbitration  than going to court; and that it helps employees and employers with  flexibility of scheduling of time instead of going to court.  [[Page H7765]]    This has been a practice that has worked successfully for many years,  and this is such a broad stroke that my Democratic colleagues are  doing.   I continue to oppose it, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I am.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to ensure that, if you like your contract, you  can keep your contract. My amendment would make this bill apply only  prospectively, because in this bill it is retroactive unless the  consumer chooses otherwise.   Americans enter into agreements with one another with the assumption  that the law will not change the deal they made. This amendment would  ensure that, if you like your contract and you are the small guy, you  can keep your contract.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, this bill will impose costly  litigation on employees and consumers since arbitration offers a  faster, cheaper, and easier way to resolve disputes. It also freezes  out Americans who can't afford expensive lawyer fees from our justice  system.   We should not be considering a bill that promotes injustice and  inequality in our system. This bill is nothing but a giveaway to  wealthy trial lawyers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
