 Madam President, the United States is a beacon  of democracy in the world, and our Nation was founded on free and fair  elections, but if the American people don't have confidence in our  elections, we don't have a sustainable democracy.   What we saw this past election was confusion and chaos caused by  inconsistent standards and last-minute changes to established election  laws by State officials and activist judges. Yet it is not just the  chaos from this past election that troubles Americans across the  country. For more than a decade, growing numbers of Americans have  become less confident that their votes were accurately cast and  counted. If we want to continue as a thriving democracy, we have to  reverse this trend and take action so Americans trust in free and fair  elections. There is no other option.   That is why I have joined my colleagues in introducing the Save  Democracy Act to restore faith in our Federal elections and guarantee  that voters decide the outcomes of elections, not the courts, and that  is why I am here today to ask my colleagues to join me in passing one  specific section of the Save Democracy Act--the Promoting Election  Integrity by Proving Voter Identity Act--to require voter ID.   It is pretty simple. If you want to vote in person, you will need to  bring your current and valid ID. If you want to vote by mail, you will  need to provide a copy of your ID. Like I said, it is pretty simple and  straightforward. We want 100 percent participation in our elections and  zero percent fraud. We want it to be easy to vote and hard to cheat.  Voter ID helps us to meet that goal.   Of course, the Democrats will do anything to fight against these  commonsense reforms. It is absurd. You have to have ID to drive a car,  board a plane, open a bank account, and pick up a prescription. Do they  object to that? Of course not. These are much needed, commonsense  reforms to our election systems.   Just look at what is happening in Georgia. Two recent news articles  show that President Biden and the Democrats spread lies to pressure  companies to boycott Georgia over commonsense voting laws even though  the Washington Post gave President Biden four Pinocchios for his lies  about the Georgia law.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the two  articles I have with me today which outline how much the Democrats have  been grossly misleading the public   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Mar. 30, 2021]     Biden Falsely Claims the New Georgia Law `Ends Voting Hours Early'                             (By Glenn Kessler)         ``What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole       initiative is. It's sick. It's sick . . . deciding that       you're going to end voting at five o'clock when working       people are just getting off work.''--President Biden, in       remarks at a news conference, March 25        ``Among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends       voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote       after their shift is over.''--Biden, in a statement ``on the       attack on the right to vote in Georgia,'' March 26        During his first news conference, President Biden became       especially passionate when discussing a law being pressed by       Republican lawmakers in Georgia that he said was intended to       make it harder for people to vote. He reiterated those       concerns the next day in a written statement after Gov. Brian       Kemp (R) signed the bill into law.        The law has come under fire for restricting the       distribution of food and water to people standing in line,       making it harder to cast absentee ballots, reducing drop       boxes for mail ballots, barring mobile voting places and for       making significant procedural changes that potentially give       more power to the GOP-controlled legislature in the election       process.        Biden has echoed many of those concerns. But there was one       line in both his news conference and his statement that has       kept us puzzling until our puzzler was sore. It also puzzled       experts who have studied the new law.        Let's take a look.                                  The Facts         On Election Day in Georgia, polling places are open from 7       a.m. to 7 p.m., and if you are  [[Page S1926]]       in line by 7 p.m., you are allowed to cast your ballot.       Nothing in the new law changes those rules.        However, the law did make some changes to early voting. But       experts say the net effect of the new early-voting rules was       to expand the opportunities to vote for most Georgians, not       limit them.        ``You can criticize the bill for many things, but I don't       think you can criticize it for reducing the hours you can       vote,'' said University of Georgia political scientist       Charles S. Bullock III. He speculated that Biden may have       been briefed on an early version of the bill--``there were 25       versions floating around''--and he did not get an update on       the final version.        For instance, at one point lawmakers considered nixing all       early voting on Sundays, thus eliminating ``souls to the       polls,'' a get-out-the-vote initiative popular with       predominantly Black churches. But that idea was scrapped in       the end.        ``One of the biggest changes in the bill would expand early       voting access for most counties, adding an additional       mandatory Saturday and formally codifying Sunday voting hours       as optional,'' Stephen Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting       said in an excellent and comprehensive report on the impact       of the new law. ``Counties can have early voting open as long       as 7 a.m. to7 p.m., or 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at minimum. If you       live in a larger metropolitan county, you might not notice a       change. For most other counties, you will have an extra       weekend day, and your weekday early voting hours will likely       be longer.''        Charles Stewart III, an election expert at the       Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: ``I had also       heard this generally reported as expanding early voting, so       I'm surprised by the characterization.'' He studied the       precise language changes at our request and said it indicated       an expansion of hours, especially in rural counties.        So where would Biden get this perception that ordinary       workers were getting the shaft because the state would ``end       voting at five o'clock''? We have one clue.        The law used to say early ``voting shall be conducted       during normal business hours.'' Experts said that generally       means 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The new law makes it specific--      ``beginning at 9:00 AM and ending at 5:00 PM.'' A Georgia       election official said the change was made in part because       some rural county election offices only worked part time       during the week, not a full eight-hour day, so the shift to       more specific times makes it clear they must be open every       weekday for at least eight hours.        But, as noted, the law also allows individual counties to       set the hours anywhere between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. So the       practical effect of the 5 p.m. reference in the law is       minimal.        During the 2020 election, for instance, vote-rich Fulton       County, with a substantial Black population, set early-voting       hours at 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on most weekdays and two       Saturdays, though the last weekdays had 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.       voting hours. Voting was allowed on two Sundays between 12       p.m. and 6 p.m.        Under the new law, Fulton County could set the exact same       hours for in-person early voting--or expand them from 7 a.m.       to 7 p.m. every day.        Bullock noted that one change in the law may impact early       voting in runoff elections. The law reduced the period       between the initial election and the runoff election, from       nine to four weeks, potentially shortening the period for       early voting.        We were curious what the early-voting rules were in       Delaware, Biden's home state. It turns out Delaware did not       allow any in-person early voting in 2020. A law signed in       2019 will permit early voting starting in 2022. (Voting hours       are 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.)        We sought an explanation from the White House for the       reason for Biden's remarks but did not receive an on-the-      record response.                              The Pinocchio Test         Biden framed his complaint in terms of a slap at working       people. The law would ``end voting at five o'clock when       working people are just getting off work'' or ``ends voting       hours early so working people can't cast their vote after       their shift is over.''        Many listeners might assume he was talking about voting on       Election Day, not early voting. But Election Day hours were       not changed.        As for early voting, the law made a modest change,       replacing a vague ``normal business hours''--presumed to be 9       a.m. to 5 p.m.--to a more specific 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. time       period. But that's the minimum. Under the new law, counties       have the option to extend the voting hours so voters can       start casting ballots as early as 7 a.m. and as late as 7       p.m.--the same as Election Day in Georgia. Moreover, an       additional mandatory day of early voting on Saturday was       added and two days of early voting on Sunday were codified as       an option for counties.        One could understand a flub in a news conference. But then       this same claim popped up in an official presidential       statement. Not a single expert we consulted who has studied       the law understood why Biden made this claim, as this was the       section of law that expanded early voting for many Georgians.        Somehow Biden managed to turn that expansion into a       restriction aimed at working people, calling it ``among the       outrageous parts'' of the law. There's no evidence that is       the case. The president earns Four Pinocchios.                                   ____                        [From Fox News, Apr. 12, 2021]   Warnock Admits to Signing Email With False Information About Georgia                                 Voting Law                              (By David Rutz)         Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., admitted to signing off on       false information in a third-party advocacy group's email       that went out about the Georgia voting law after it passed.        The Washington Post flagged an email Warnock signed from       the liberal nonprofit 3.14 Action as an example of Democratic       misinformation about the sweeping Georgia voting reforms, as       it claimed the new law restricted weekend early voting and       ended no-excuse mail voting.        ``Sen. Raphael G. Warnock, one of two new Democratic       senators representing Georgia, signed an email sent out by       the advocacy group 3.14 Action after the law passed, which       claimed it ended no-excuse mail voting and restricted early       voting on the weekends--also early proposals that did not       become law,'' the Post reported.        Those ideas were considered but did not make it into the       final bill, which actually expands early voting in Georgia to       17 days, including two Saturdays. It also still allows no-      excuse absentee voting, albeit with a shorter window of 67       days to apply.        The statement went out on March 30, five days after Georgia       Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the final bill into       law.        A Warnock campaign spokesperson told Fox News it approved       the text of the group's email before Kemp signed the bill,       while the provisions were still under consideration. The       spokesperson noted the Georgia Senate passed a bill to end       no-excuse absentee voting earlier in March, and the Georgia       House originally proposed restricting weekend early voting.        However, neither provision made it into the final bill, as       the 3.14 Action statement Warnock signed appeared to claim.        The law has been the subject of fierce controversy, with       President Biden and other Democrats likening it to racist       ``Jim Crow''-era restrictions. Kemp and other state       Republicans have pushed back on the criticism and said the       reforms strengthen voting integrity.        Biden has also disseminated false information about the       law, getting Four Pinocchios from The Washington Post's Fact-      Checker for claiming the law limits voting hours.        The firestorm around the law has already economically hurt       Georgia. Bowing to liberal pressure and outrage from Georgia-      based corporations like Delta and Coca-Cola, Major League       Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred pulled the 2021 All-Star       Game out of Atlanta's Truist Park, costing the area up to an       estimated $100 million in potential revenue.        Warnock said he was disappointed by MLB's decision but       framed it as the fault of Republicans, calling it an       ``unfortunate'' consequence of the voting bill.        ``It is my hope that businesses, athletes, and entertainers       can protest this law not by leaving Georgia but by coming       here and fighting voter suppression head on, and hand-in-hand       with the community,'' he said in a statement.        The new Georgia lawmaker is a staunch supporter of the For       The People Act, a sweeping national voting bill which       Republicans have slammed as a massive federal overreach and       Democratic power grab.    It just goes to show you how out of touch the  Democrats really are.   All my Republican colleagues and I want to see is more Americans  vote, and I am thankful Senators Barrasso and Cramer are joining me in  this effort today. We want a vibrant democracy in which citizens are  engaged and participating in government at every level.   Sadly, the Democrats are refusing to work with us to protect our  voting systems. Instead, the Democrats want to make it easier to cheat  and harder to stop election fraud. That is why the Democrats are  pushing H.R. 1, which would perpetuate distrust in our elections,  impose anti-democratic mandates, and further erode our country's  institutions. H.R. 1 is the most radical piece of voting legislation  this Nation has ever seen at a time when restoring confidence in  elections has never been more important.   H.R. 1 removes the most basic safeguards against election fraud. The  Democrat solution to election security is the same as their solution to  all problems: a completely inept, big-government approach that fails at  every level.   Before continuing, I would like to yield to my colleague from Wyoming  and thank him for his leadership on this effort.    Madam President, we can and must pass  commonsense reforms to restore confidence in our elections.   The easiest thing we can do right now is require voter ID. Americans  agree this is a necessary step.   If we are serious about working together to move our country forward,  restore public trust, and protect the democracy our Nation cherishes,  we need to pass my bill today, and I look forward to all my colleagues  joining me to protect our democracy.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of S. 1130, introduced earlier today. I ask  unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Madam President, my goal is 100 percent  participation and zero percent fraud. It is not voter suppression or  racist to prove your identity for in-person voting. It is not voter  suppression or racist to prove your identity for mail-in voting. It is  not voter suppression or racist to require ballot boxes to be  monitored. It is not voter suppression or racist to make sure your vote  is in on time.   My colleague wants to call any attempt to fight fraud in our  elections voter suppression. My colleague wants to call any attempt to  fight fraud in elections racist. That is just not accurate.   Voter ID should not be controversial. You need an ID to get on a  plane, open a bank account, drive a car--even an ID to get into the  White House. But we shouldn't have an ID to vote for the President? It  just doesn't make sense.   Americans believe in voter ID. It is a logical step to make our  elections more secure, and it is a simple change we can pass today.   I yield the floor.
