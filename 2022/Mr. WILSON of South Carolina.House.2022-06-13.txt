 Madam Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and  Brain Awareness Month, a time to raise the level of attention to  debilitating dementias.   I appreciate the dedication of Taylor Wilson, the Director of  Government Affairs for the Alzheimer's Association of South Carolina.   Alzheimer's is a brain disorder which slowly destroys memory and  thinking skills. It is not a normal part of aging but a result of  complex changes in the brain that start years before symptoms appear.   I am grateful for the Lexington Medical Center Carroll Campbell  Place, in loving memory of former and late Governor Carroll Campbell.   According to the Centers for Disease Control, there are nearly 6  million people in the U.S. that have Alzheimer's and related dementias.  We honor those families in America facing a dementia diagnosis, while  supporting the hope of all that through research, we can find a  prevention or treatment for this fatal disease.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues  moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
