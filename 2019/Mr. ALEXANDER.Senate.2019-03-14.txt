 Madam President, Tennesseans have asked me: Is there  really a crisis on the southern border? Do you support President  Trump's border wall?   And my answer to both questions is yes, I do.   I have urged the President to build the 234 miles of border wall that  he asked for in his January 6 letter to the Senate and to do that in  the fastest possible way, with a minimum delay and legal challenge, by  using the $5.7 billion already approved by Congress.   But the President's emergency declaration to take an additional $3.6  billion that Congress has appropriated for military hospitals, for  barracks, and for schools--including one in Fort Campbell--is  inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution that I took an oath to support  and to defend.   Never before has a President asked for funding, the Congress has not  provided it, and then the President has used the National Emergencies  Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway. The problem with this is that  after a Revolutionary War against a King, our Nation's Founders gave to  Congress--a Congress elected by the people--the power to approve all  spending so that the President would not have too much power. This  check on the executive is a source of our freedom.   In addition, this declaration is a dangerous precedent. Already,  Democrat Presidential candidates are saying they would declare  emergencies to tear down the existing border wall, to take away guns,  to stop oil exports, to shut down offshore drilling, and for other  leftwing enterprises--all without the approval of Congress.   I believe the crisis on our southern border is real. U.S. Customs and  Border Patrol arrested more than 66,000 illegal aliens in February of  2019--the highest total in a single month since March 2009. In the last  2 years alone, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have  arrested 266,000 illegal aliens in the United States with criminal  records. Each week, approximately 300 Americans die from heroin  overdoses, of which nearly 90 percent come across the southern border.   During the last 25 years, Congress approved and President Obama,  President Clinton, President George W. Bush, and President George H. W.  Bush built 654 miles of barrier along the 1,954-mile southern border.  In 2013, the comprehensive immigration bill that received 68 Senate  votes, including mine, included $40 billion for border security,  including physical barrier, and enforcement. Last year, I voted with  nearly  [[Page S1859]]  every Democrat for a bill that included $25 billion for border  security, including physical barrier.   So one might ask: Why is President Trump the only President not  allowed to build more wall on the southern border?   But in this case, as the Wall Street Journal said on March 12, ``The  President doesn't need to invoke a national emergency to build his wall  along the southern border.'' He has the money immediately available in  other accounts already approved by Congress. Any appreciation for our  structure of government means that no President should be able to use  the National Emergencies Act to spend money that Congress refuses to  provide.   The late Justice Antonin Scalia, who is revered by constitutional  conservatives, put it this way for us. Justice Scalia said:         ``Every tin horn dictator in the world today, every       President for life has a Bill of Rights. That's not what       makes us free. What has made us free is our Constitution.       Think of the word ``constitution,'' it means structure.       That's why America's framers debated not the Bill of Rights,       but rather the structure of the federal government.''    Justice Scalia wrote:         The genius of the American constitutional system is the       dispersal of power. Once power is centralized in one person,       or one part of government, a Bill of Rights is just words on       paper.    That was Justice Scalia.   I fault Democrats for not supporting President Trump's reasonable  request for more wall on the border after 25 years of approving  physical barriers and border wall for four other Presidents. That is  not an excuse to ignore the constitutional separation of powers,  especially when the faster way to build the 234 more miles of border  wall that the President has asked for is to use $5.7 billion already  approved by Congress.   I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Wall Street  Journal dated March 12, 2019, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 12, 2019]                           Trump's Emergency Exit        how he can declare victory on wall money without losing a vote                          (By The Editorial Board)         The Senate will vote on a resolution to override President       Trump's emergency declaration as early as Thursday, and       rarely has there been a clearer case of needless self-harm.       Mr. Trump should listen to the Senate Republicans offering       him a safe emergency exit.        On Tuesday Vice President Mike Pence met with several GOP       Senators ahead of a vote on the override resolution that       passed the House with ease. As many as 10 to 15 GOP Senators       may vote to override.        Republican Senators up for re-election in tough states are       in an impossible position. Susan Collins of Maine and Thom       Tillis of North Carolina are both up in 2020, and they're       voting to rebuke the President. Martha McSally has to fight       for her seat in Arizona in 2020, and to win she'll need a       coalition of Trump voters and the President's skeptics. No       matter how she votes she isolates potential supporters. Ditto       for Cory Gardner of Colorado.        And for what? The President doesn't need to invoke a       national emergency to build his wall along the southern       border. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee has pointed out       that the White House already has funds at its disposal       without declaring an emergency.        Consider: The President wants $5.7 billion for the wall.       Congress provided $1.375 billion in appropriations. The       President plans to tap $601 million from a forfeiture fund at       the Treasury Department that can be used for general law       enforcement purposes. Mr. Trump also plans to use $2.5       billion from Defense Department accounts that deal with drug       smuggling, though Sen. Alexander notes that the law allows       him to tap up to $4 billion.        In other words, if the President moved $3.7 from the       Pentagon drug account, he'd reach his $5.7 billion goal       without needing to pilfer $3.6 billion from military       construction. The White House noted this in a fact sheet last       month but declared an emergency anyway. The irony is that the       President can't possibly spend all this money on wall       construction before the fall's budget negotiations for fiscal       2020, when he can work on winning more funding.        Mr. Trump could rescind the order and say he'll spend the       money available under the law first, and reconsider if facts       warrant. This would keep the money out of the courts. The       President would also be better positioned to win the 2020       defense spending he wants if he isn't raiding the military to       pay for the wall. In his budget proposal this week, Mr. Trump       asked Congress to backfill the money he is taking from       military construction. House Democrats have no incentive to       cooperate.        The alternative is a divisive vote that Mr. Trump is sure       to lose and a bipartisan resolution he'll have to veto. And       that's for starters. The National Emergencies Act allows a       vote in Congress every six months until an emergency is       terminated. Democrats have found a gift that will keep on       giving.        Some Republicans are proposing fixes to the National       Emergencies Act, which would be welcome. A proposal from Mike       Lee of Utah would let the President declare an emergency as       he can now, but after 30 days Congress would have to vote to       continue it.        Republican Senators don't want a pointless showdown with       Mr. Trump, but they can't avoid one if the White House won't       change course. Mr. Trump should declare victory on wall       funding for this year and live to fight next year.     I yield the floor.
