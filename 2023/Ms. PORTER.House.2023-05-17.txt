 Mr. Speaker, I rise to defend freedom.   On May 17, International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and  Biphobia, we must reaffirm that all Americans, no matter who they love,  where they are, or how they identify, deserve to live their lives free  from discrimination and hate.   Since the start of 2023, State legislatures across the country have  proposed over 400 anti-LGBTQI+ laws, including right here in the House.  That is a record high, and it is unacceptable.   When extremist politicians target Americans' freedom of expression,  the safety of transgender students, and access to healthcare, we cannot  remain silent.   As a member of the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, I am working to root out  hate and discrimination in all its forms.   Californians know that our State's diversity is its strength. We in  Congress owe it to ourselves, to our children, and to our communities  to create a future in which every American, no matter their sexual  orientation or gender identity, can live their lives to the fullest.    Celebrating 30th Anniversary of Orange Coast College's Puente Program     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 30th  anniversary of Orange Coast College's Puente program.   California is home to the largest Latino population in the country,  but too many barriers keep Latino students from getting college degrees  and the keys to their future.   To level the playing field, the Puente program helps California's  underserved students transfer into a 4-year college that helps unlock  more opportunities.   In the Puente program, students work with counselors to refine study  skills, develop action plans, and explore career options. They also  sharpen their writing in college-level courses and meet with mentors to  learn about life after graduation.   For the thousands who are the first in their families to go to  college, the Puente program is a game changer.   I am honored to celebrate this incredible milestone, the 30th  anniversary, and to share the work that the Puente program does for our  students and communities in Orange County.                       Renewing Focus on Mental Health     Mr. Speaker, health goes beyond physical health. It  includes mental health, too. During Mental Health Awareness Month, I am  renewing my push to get Americans compassionate and effective care.   Mental illness can be far-reaching. Just as people of all ages,  races, and genders get colds and take medicine, they can also become  sick and need treatment for their mental health.   I am reintroducing several bills to deliver help.   The Mental Health Justice Act would send healthcare professionals to  respond to mental health emergencies in lieu of police.   The Student Mental Health Rights Act would better protect college  students.   The Behavioral Health Coverage Transparency Act would crack down on  Big Insurance for failing to cover mental health adequately.   I am proud to represent a community that understands the importance  of mental health. I applaud innovative organizations, like Be Well OC,  that meet people in our community, reduce barriers and stigma, and help  people get behavioral care.   I will continue to be a partner in their efforts during Mental Health  Awareness Month and year-round.               Justices Failing to Live Up to Ethical Standards     Mr. Speaker, Americans' confidence in the Supreme Court  is at a record low. That is no surprise when Justices hide that  billionaires take them on luxurious yachts and private jet trips, buy  land from them, and pay their dependents' private boarding school  tuition.   Our Justices are failing to live up to the ethical standards we  expect from the highest court in our land. The problem is not that the  Supreme Court is just conservative. The problem is that it is corrupt.   We have 870 Federal judges across this country, and a basic code of  ethical conduct is enforced against all of them, except nine, our  Supreme Court Justices.   To restore confidence in the Court, we must root out conflicts of  interest, strengthen judicial transparency, and, finally, establish a  code of ethics.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: If we  cherish our institutions, we must reform and strengthen them.                            ____________________
