 Mr. Speaker, last November, more than 2 months ago, this  House passed the reauthorization for the Children's Health Insurance  Program, known as CHIP.   The House again passed the reauthorization for CHIP this week, but  last night, in addition to voting ``no'' on CHIP, Chuck Schumer and the  Senate Democrats voted ``no'' on keeping the government funded, and  here we are.   The funding that Senate Democrats rejected last night includes  funding for our Nation's servicemembers, tens of thousands of whom are  deployed throughout the Middle East, the Pacific, and Korea.   They could have voted ``yes'' to the families waiting for the  Children's Health Insurance Program and ``yes'' to our troops, but they  did not.   There is no excuse for this. The issues of Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals and securing our border are being negotiated  separate and apart from this funding bill and CHIP, and there are  serious proposals to address these issues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Senate Democrats to change course, end the  Schumer shutdown, and do what is right for the American people: pass  the government funding and Children's Health Insurance Program that we  sent over days ago.                            ____________________
