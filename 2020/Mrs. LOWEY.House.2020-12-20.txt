 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 110) making further continuing  appropriations for fiscal year 2021, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                               H.J. Res. 110         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That the       Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 (division A of Public Law       116-159) is further amended by striking the date specified in       section 106(3) and inserting ``December 21, 2020''.        This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Extension of       Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H7282]]  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 110, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on Friday, I informed the House that we were very close  to agreement on a year-end funding package.   I am pleased to say that we have now reached agreement, but logistics  of assembling such a comprehensive bill require additional time. This  continuing resolution provides that additional time and will allow this  Congress to complete our work on government funding and coronavirus  relief. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this clean  extension of funding.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this stopgap measure to  avoid a government shutdown as we finish our critical work to fund  government and respond to the COVID pandemic.   As my time in Congress nears a close, I must briefly, very briefly,  reflect on my 32 years of service, which has been guided by a basic  principle: When you see a problem, do something about it. In times of  crisis like we face today, and after September 11 and Superstorm Sandy,  delivering relief has been my sacred duty.   I will be forever grateful to colleagues, advocates, and excellent  staff who helped me secure critical Federal funds directly for my  district, indelibly shape women's health policy, enact lifesaving food  allergy labeling and the .08 BAC drunk driving standard, and too many  other achievements to fully recount now.   Limited debate time leaves me unable to acknowledge by name all of my  exceptional staff, but I must thank my chief of staff for the last 16  years, Elizabeth Stanley, and my unequaled district director, Pat  Keegan, who, for more than 26 years, has led my outstanding district  staff in solving thousands of cases for constituents who needed help.   Our successes are often overlooked amid partisan rancor and the  notion that institutions of government are irrevocably broken. I do not  believe they are.   To my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, across the country,  and the political spectrum, our work together is a testament to the  enduring values of public service and of a collective commitment to  better the world. You inspired me to be a better legislator, and I am  grateful. While I leave Congress as the first chairwoman of the House  Appropriations Committee, the title I still cherish most is United  States Representative from New York. To those I have represented: Thank  you for your trust and confidence.   To my family, my wonderful husband, Steve; my children and their  spouses, Dana and David, Doug and Ellen, and Jackie and David; and my  grandchildren, Jillian, Daniel, Ilan, Jesse, Jonah, Rebecca, Jonathan,  and Solene, your endless support has made my career possible. I hope  you are ready for a lot more of me.   Mr. Speaker, with gratitude for having had the honor and privilege to  serve, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
