 Madam Speaker, all I want for Christmas is to clean up  the corruption in Congress.   That is why tomorrow morning I will be introducing my political  reform and anticorruption resolution, supported by Unusual Whales,  Capitol Trades, and Quiver Quantitative. CREW has also done important  work on these issues.   It calls for five things: First, a ban on all PAC and lobbyist money;  second, a ban on Members of Congress trading stock; third, a ban on  Members ever becoming lobbyists; fourth, term limits for Members of  Congress and Supreme Court Justices; and, fifth, a binding Code of  Ethics for the Supreme Court.   The American people on both sides are frustrated by the corruption in  Washington. We need real change. I hope Members on both sides will  support this resolution that we introduce tomorrow.                            ____________________
