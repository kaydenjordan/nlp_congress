 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained in a  discussion on prison reform, and I missed rollcall vote No. 167, H.R.  4910, the Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act, as amended.   If I had been present, I would have voted ``aye.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished manager for  yielding to me and for the eloquent statements of our colleagues,  including Congresswoman Sewell and Congresswoman Moore.   I thank our chairman, Mr. Richmond, for his persistence that members  of the Congressional Black Caucus come to the floor of the House to be  able to address these concerns that are very important.   I am going to be very brief, but I want to join my colleagues on what  I think is a striking and provocative discourse, and it is a hurting  discourse.   The reason why I want to make sure that my voice is heard is because  I have constituents who are living poor, but their spirit is not poor.  Their commitment to success is not poor. Their desire for better  opportunities for their children is not poor. Yet we want to condemn or  malign this group that may be living in poverty.   It strikes me as a difficult proposition to know that the Speaker of  the House, for example, is seeking, again, welfare reform which, when I  first came to the United States Congress, I enthusiastically voted  against. And I was right because so many people were turned off the  rolls; so many lives were ruined; so many children did not get the  needs that they needed; so many poor mothers could not tend to their  newborn babies because resources were lost.                                time  2015    Now we come again to a concept of welfare reform, and we are not  concerned, I guess, about the different health conditions of different  ethnic and racial populations.   The age 60 for some, maybe 80, in terms of a physical condition that  they are facing, and so a flat number of 60, cut you off or you can't  have coverage that is necessary, is a sad state on this great country.   The other point that I think is important is that the President has  offered a review of the programs that help the poor.   Now, right now today, Houston is still suffering from the impact of  Hurricane Harvey. And as I heard my colleague, good times today and bad  times tomorrow. Or making ends meet today or yesterday, and not making  them meet today.   We are still seeing students and families who were displaced during  Hurricane Harvey losing everything and barely getting back on their  feet, and this is May, and we are about to enter the hurricane season  again.   So the idea of a safety net that the $1.7 trillion tax cut cuts right  into, that is the point. A safety net is not a handout.   This reverse Robin Hood tax bill takes from individuals who are part,  again, of the greatness of America. We are always hearing of the  stories of the person from the little red schoolhouse or rural America  who was great and made it to a success story. They made it through the  Helping Hands. They made it through the Pell grants. They made it  through Medicare. They made it through Medicaid.   In 1965, we saw more seniors living after 1965, when President  Johnson and the Democratic Congress passed Medicare and Medicaid.   So the idea that we are reviewing programs that are impacting people  who suffer from poverty or that we would think it is more important to  have this major tax cut that is creating this huge deficit so the  people who are victimized are the people who, in fact, are part of  America's greatness and have every right to have an opportunity of  success in their lives.   Seventy percent of Americans rely on at least one means-tested  Federal program. The nutrition program, the SNAP program, the Disaster  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, was a lifeline for  Houstonians and people in Harris County during Hurricane Harvey.   I remember getting an extension, and 30,000 people came and stood in  the hot Sun for 3 days just to be able to get a voucher that would  carry them through the Christmas holiday. That was what you call  emergency supplemental nutrition.   What we have now, the SNAP program, $1.40 per meal. And then the  President was offering: Let's don't do that. Let's send a box. Let's  send a brown box to the house and have some dry milk and whatever other  nonperishables could be in there.   These people have children. They have pre-K. They need childcare.   Have you heard the fact that HUD may be tripling the rents that low- income Americans are receiving that housing Federal subsides would have  to pay? So they get a Federal subsidy and they have to pay three times  the rent? That seems to be a little absurd.   If we are concerned about what is a hand up, what is, in fact, the  opportunity for individuals to meet their promise and their greatness,  we would not have passed such an atrocious tax bill that really eats at  the flesh of survival of this country and many Americans.   For example, the top 1 percent's tax cut, if they didn't get that tax  cut--of which many have said: We don't want it, didn't need it-- childcare would be able to be provided for 19 children, job training  for 27 workers, Pell grants for 38 students, and providing substance  use disorder treatment for 21 people. The CHIP program would be  stronger; and, of course, the ability for individuals suffering from  the opioid crisis, we would have far more dollars to be able to assist  them to restore their lives.   So it is very important that the debate tonight not be, as it has  been characterized, about poor people or the impoverished, or that the  debate is about handouts.   It is the safety net that every single American desires but is really  owed to have. It is the very safety net that has the world looking to  America as the greatest Nation in the world.   I have many friends in many countries around the world, and some of  these countries have a billion-plus people. The safety net that they  have is a nonsafety net. So the level of disaster and devastation in  populations is almost unbelievable as compared to here in this country.   But the reason why we are this country is because people expect us  not to be those countries. They expect us to be the America with  resources, and we do have resources.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman very much for yielding to  me to explain, one, the devastation of this trillion-plus tax cut bill  that we fought vigorously in the Budget Committee and offered any  number of amendments to correct and protect Medicaid, Medicare,  education, and benefits that really give us stair steps of opportunity.   But I hope, as we move forward, that we will not go down this very  disastrous pathway of changing welfare to make it a punitive  legislative initiative so that the people hurt the most are those in  the sunset of their life, seniors, those who are suffering from opioid  addiction, and our children.   I hope we don't totally implode the valuable safety net that brought  us through the depression that FDR developed in the 1940s with the WPA  and then on into the 1960s when President Johnson had the great  society.   Where is the America that cares? Where is the America that  understands?   Mr. Speaker, It is important for me to be standing here.  [[Page H3771]]    This is the Reverse Robin Hood Tax Bill.   Instead of taking from the rich and giving to the poor.   This tax law takes from the very poor and gives to the very rich.   Last year, the GOP passed its tax cuts for the richest among us.   Now no one should be surprised that this happened.   It is crystal clear that President Trump, a man who comes from  wealth, doesn't understand the challenges facing the working poor.   His constant effort to undermine programs that help these Americans  maintain a basic standard of living does nothing more than reinforce  deeply racialized myths that poor Americans are lazy and undeserving.   This couldn't be further from the truth. Millions of Americans who  are beneficiaries of these programs work two or more jobs just to keep  food on the table and a roof over their heads for their families.   In addition, the vast majority of full-time workers live paycheck to  paycheck.   In fact, 70% of Americans rely on at least one means tested federal  program throughout their lives.   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) only provides  $1.40 per meal.   Not to mention that only one in five qualifying families actually  receives housing assistance.   At the end of the day, our constituents should be able to support  their children with one full-time job.   This requires increasing the minimum wage, strengthening job training  programs, and creating good-paying jobs.   Ultimately, we need to give families the tools they need to rise out  of poverty, not undercut programs that keep them afloat.   Instead, the current president has made the least of these pick up  the tab.   And he's doing this while his cabinet nominated officials are feeding  at the trough.   Take for example the Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD).   Just last week, HUD indicated that they would triple the rents that  low-income Americans receiving housing federal subsidies would have to  pay.   This was done while Secretary Carson spent $30,000 in taxpayer money  on a dining room table, proposed tripling the rent for low-income  Americans receiving federal housing subsidies.   Last month, the president issued an executive order to restrict  access to healthcare, housing, food, and many other programs that help  the working poor.   President Trump's plan to cut funding for healthcare, food, and  housing programs in order to give tax cuts to billionaires will do  nothing more than make a bad situation worse.   The fact of the matter is that programs that help the working poor  have been under constant attack for the last 30 years and, in many  cases, don't go far enough.   Only one in four qualifying families with children actually receives  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) only provides  $1.40 per meal.   Not to mention that only one in five qualifying families actually  receives housing assistance.   Federal programs should do more to help the working poor who are  forced to spend 70-80% of their income on rent and utilities.   To give you a snapshot of who is harmed by this tax scam, and how it  harms those needing a hand up, consider that the average tax cut for  someone in the Top 0.1%, that money could mean:   Childcare for 19 children.   Job training for 27 workers.   Pell grants or 38 students.   Providing substance use disorder treatment for 21 people.   Health coverage through the Children Health Insurance Program (CHIP).   So when we consider who this helps and who this hurts, it is clear  that this bill hurts those seeking help caring for their families.   It hurts those seeking training and a professional gateway to another  profession.   It seeks those looking for assistance to education.   And in this age of the Opioid crisis, where tomorrow we will be  having a hearing on this matter, an average tax cut would provide  substance use disorder treatment for 21 people.   So it is clear that this bill is not for the middle class.   By now, the GOP's playbook is well known: campaign as if you support  the middle class and those striving to enter it, but once elected use  the levers of government to favor the rich and the powerful.   That's why time on the GOP is coming up.   The American People are watching and they know that the Democrats  offer a better deal.   And Democrats stand ready to offer #ABetterDeal.
