 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 324 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 324         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1039) to       amend section 3606 of title 18, United States Code, to grant       probation officers authority to arrest hostile third parties       who obstruct or impede a probation officer in the performance       of official duties. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary; (2) the       amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution, if offered by the Member       designated in the report, which shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as       read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in       the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a       division of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous materials on House Resolution 324, currently  under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule  forward on behalf of the Committee on Rules today. The rule provides  for the consideration of H.R. 1039, the Probation Officer Protection  Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided between the  chairman and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The rule  also provides for a motion to recommit and makes in order an amendment  by Congresswoman Jackson Lee of Texas.   On Tuesday, the Committee on Rules had the opportunity to hear from  my fellow Committee on the Judiciary members: Mr. Ratcliffe, Mr.  Cicilline, and Ms. Jackson Lee.   H.R. 1039 was marked up by the Committee on the Judiciary on May 3  and favorably reported by the committee without amendment.   Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that we debate this rule and the  underlying bill this week during National Police Week. As the son of a  Georgia State Trooper, it is an honor to come before this House to help  advance legislation that protects the men and women of law enforcement.  The dangers our law enforcement officers face are real, and I know too  well the fear that a loved one might not come home after leaving for a  routine shift. This week we had the opportunity to recognize those who  make our communities safer, and we are humbled to advance the policies  that support their efforts, and we honor their sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, allow me to point out that the sponsor of the underlying  bill we are discussing, the Probation Officer Protection Act, is a  former law enforcement officer himself. My friend Dave Reichert from  Washington State is Sheriff Reichert also, who led the task force  responsible for solving the case of the infamous Green River serial  killer. Along with him, I serve on the Policing Strategies Working  Group, and I commend him for his work on the underlying legislation and  his tireless advocacy on behalf of the heroes who wear the badge.   The Probation Officer Protection Act is a commonsense, yet modest,  expansion of the Federal probation officers' existing arrest authority.  Under current law, 18 U.S. Code section 111, it is a crime for a person  to forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, or interfere  with any Federal official in the performance of his or her official  duties. While the Federal officials described by this statute include  probation officers, probation officers are limited in their ability to  take affirmative actions in order to protect themselves when they face  these threats not from the offender but from third parties.   Mr. Speaker, while probation officers can make arrests of those under  their supervision, the first party, such as a parolee or individual  serving a term of probation or supervised release, the law does not  allow probation officers to take action to protect themselves should a  third party impede or assault them.   In fact, if a third party, such as a family member or friend of a  parolee, threatens or attacks a probation officer, that officer's only  recourse is to retreat and call for local law enforcement.  [[Page H4326]]    Think about that, Mr. Speaker. I want to read that again.   If a third party, such as a family member or friend of a parolee,  threatens or attacks a probation officer, that officer's only recourse  is to retreat and call for local law enforcement.   Because the law has failed to equip probation officers with the  authority to arrest an aggressive third party, probation officers have  limited recourse when their safety is uncertain. Mr. Speaker, this is  unacceptable and even defies reason. When probation officers find  themselves in a dangerous situation involving third parties, they are  at the mercy of happenstance. Perhaps, in urban areas, other law  enforcement agents may be in proximity and able to respond. Perhaps, at  times, the brave men and women who oversee offenders on release may  have access to the backup they need once a third party threat has been  established. But I will tell you this, in these certain areas that may  happen. But it is possible, though, that without the authority to  deescalate or manage a dangerous situation without the necessary  authority to arrest threatening third parties, probation officers will  remain unnecessarily vulnerable to attacks, violence, or even death.   In rural areas, like my district in northeast Georgia, a probation  officer's restricted authority to arrest could pose an even greater  risk to their well-being. Local law enforcement agencies in rural areas  are often smaller and more separated from backup by distance. This  means that probation officers who call for help could be subject to  longer response times in the very moment they need the assistance the  most.   Considering these facts, Mr. Speaker, it is reasonable to make a  narrow, yet important, adjustment to current law in order to ensure  that the probation officers have third-party arrest authority when they  are forcibly threatened by that third party. Simply put, probation  officers enter dangerous situations for the benefit of our communities  and should be able to effectively protect themselves and others.   The Probation Officer Protection Act would address this flaw in  current law by providing necessary recourse for probation officers.  Under the terms of the bill, probation officers would have the  authority to arrest hostile third parties who forcibly assault, resist,  or otherwise impede a probation officer as they are carrying out their  sworn duties.    We have heard examples of probation officers making visits to those  under supervision, only to be greeted by third parties who are wielding  knives or baseball bats or yelling obscenities at the officers as they  attempt to serve the larger community. In these events, probation  officers should not be handicapped in their ability to perform their  jobs while protecting their own safety. As we know all too well,  situations with agitated third parties can escalate in an instant.  Officers on site need to be equipped to deescalate dangerous situations  for the good of the supervisee, the probation officer, and any  bystanders.   This legislation does not represent an unprecedented or large-scale  expansion of authority for probation officers. Probation officers  already have limited arrest authority for first-party offenders. They  are also bound by formal search and seizure policy and arrest  procedures. Probation officers receive training that instructs them in  properly detaining offenders so that they will be equipped with the  necessary skills to manage dangerous individuals in circumstances that  might warrant it.   Mr. Speaker, the intent behind the underlying bill is but one example  of a larger effort behind much of the legislation we have seen on the  floor this week. Every day, law enforcement officers put their lives on  the line to protect us. Every day, they face dangerous situations for  the sake of their neighbors. Law enforcement officers across the  country bravely walk into uncertain situations prepared to protect and  defend you and me and the people that we love.   I believe that our Nation's law enforcement--be they local, county,  State, or Federal agents--overwhelmingly abide by their oath to protect  and serve. In turn, we should remember their bravery and sacrifices  each day and thank those who risk their lives to protect us. We must  also thank the families who kiss their loved ones good-bye each  morning, fully aware of the risk that their service entails.   Our men and women in blue should experience our gratitude every day,  but this week, during Police Week, it is right for us to take the extra  care to commemorate those who have fallen and to honor those who are  serving.   As thousands of law enforcement professionals visit our Nation's  Capital this week, I encourage all of my colleagues to thank them for  their service. Also, I ask that all of my colleagues in this body look  at this commonsense piece of legislation and show their support by  voting ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate my colleague  pointing out certain things. Again, I think pointing out the complete  story there would also be helpful, and that is that the amendments  spoken of that were not made in order, following the rules of the  House, the Jefferson's Manual, and all were not germane. The one  amendment that was offered was made in order for this bill. The others  were not germane. If they want to be brought up in a separate bill or  separate order or find a bill that is actually germane to it, then that  is a different issue, but not in this one.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to remind  everyone, as we have discussed here and we hear impassioned arguments  for amendments that were not germane, find proper places to put  amendments, and find bills that you want to write. That is all fair.  That is in our rule book. But remember, the only germane amendment was  made in order. I repeat, the only germane amendment was made in order.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time, and I appreciate the debate  today. Also, I feel, in just a little bit of ways, I am sort of Alice  in Wonderland here; what is up is down and what is down is up. I am not  sure how you take this bill to, number one, say that probation officers  would be any more in danger.   I would also, Mr. Speaker, like to include in the Record another  letter that is from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association in  support of what is going on here.                                             Federal Law Enforcement                                             Officers Association                                       Cabin John, MD, May 17, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Leader Pelosi: I am writing on behalf       of the nearly 27,000 members of the Federal Law Enforcement       Officers Association to advise you of our  [[Page H4330]]       strong support for H.R. 1039, the ``Probation Officer       Protection Act,'' and to express our appreciation for the       Congress's consideration of this important officer safety       measure during National Police Week. FLEOA opposes the       amendment that will be offered on the floor to sunset the       authority provided by the bill, as you cannot put a stopwatch       on critical law enforcement officer protection measures such       as H.R. 1039.        The ``Probation Officer Protection Act'' is a critical       officer safety measure. At a time when U.S. Probation       Officers have seen their workloads increase due to changes in       sentencing policy and are being asked to ``do more with the       same,'' ensuring that they have the means to protect       themselves when placed in harm's way is paramount. H.R. 1039       will fully authorize a U.S. Probation Officer to arrest any       third party who violates 18 USC 111. This statute has been on       the books since the 1940s and makes it a crime for any person       to forcibly assault, resist, intimidate, or interfere with       any federal officer in the performance of their official       duties. Current law, however, only allows Probation Officers       to make arrests of individuals on probation or under       supervised release who violate 18 USC 111. This authority       does not extend to ``third parties,'' which could include a       former associate of the offender or an unidentified member of       the community. In many instances third parties are well aware       that a federal officer's authority is limited to individuals       on supervision, and when a third party does impede or assault       a U.S. Probation Officer, the Officer's only recourse is to       retreat and call for local law enforcement. While in major       cities local law enforcement may respond depending on       availability, the same is not true for U.S. Probation       Officers who work in rural communities where response by       local law enforcement may be a single officer or none. This       places Probation Officers at even greater risk, particularly       in those situations where retreat is not even a reasonably       safe alternative.        During the forthcoming debate on this bill, there will       undoubtedly be those who go to great lengths to demean U.S.       Probation Officers as something less than ``real'' law       enforcement officers or to diminish the hazards that they       face. Some may also raise inchoate objections about the       constitutionality of H.R. 1039. For example, you will hear       that Congress cannot extend Executive Branch police powers to       the Judicial Branch, despite the fact that it was Congress       that established the U.S. Supreme Court Police that resides       directly across the street from the U.S. Capitol. Not only       are such statements factually inaccurate, they display a       basic lack of understanding about those who serve our nation       as U.S. Probation Officers and the purposes behind the       ``Probation Officer Protection Act.''        Make no mistake: U.S. Probation Officers are fully trained       federal law enforcement officers. They attend basic training       at the National Training Academy at the Federal Law       Enforcement Training Center in Charleston, SC, and receive       ongoing in-service training throughout the year. Their       training covers everything from firearms regulation and       safety and defensive tactics to handcuffing, the use of       force, de-escalation training, and reality-based scenario       training. It may be difficult for some to acknowledge, but       there is an inherent risk to the work U.S. Probation Officers       do--a risk that often outweighs that of traditional law       enforcement. They do not enter into sterile offices, but       often into environments that are uncertain. They are required       to have frequent and regular contacts in the home and       community and knowingly come into daily contact with       individuals who have a history of violence, mental health       issues, problems with authority, and troubles with substance       abuse. U.S. Probation Officers are not able to anticipate       what is going to occur during all contacts. There are and       have been occasions when U.S. Probation Officers are       threatened and/or attacked by third parties and they need the       ability to take an affirmative step to protect themselves.        U.S. Probation Officers are a unique profession. They have       a knowledge base in law and human behavior, and a mix of       skills in investigation, communication, and analysis. They       strive to make our communities safer, to make a positive       difference in the lives of those they serve, and promote       fairness in process and excellence in service. But as the       volume of approved searches they must conduct has markedly       increased over the past year due to changes in sentencing       policy, the absence of any authority to restrain or direct       the movements of third parties places U.S. Probation Officers       at a greater and unnecessary risk of physical harm. H.R. 1039       provides a modest expansion of U.S. Probation Officers'       existing arrest authority to cover only violations of 18 USC       111. It does not in any way provide them ``peace officer''       status or grant them the same general arrest authority that       state-level probation officers enjoy in many jurisdictions.       Granting U.S. Probation Officers the authority to arrest       third parties would not change who they are and what they are       seeking. Nor will it interfere with or otherwise diminish       U.S. Probation Officers' use of the de-escalation techniques       that are the hallmark of their profession. It would simply       afford them another tool, another avenue, if ever needed.        In the end, this legislation will enhance officer safety       while also protecting probationers and third parties by       preventing obstruction from escalating to actual violence.       Thank you in advance for your consideration of this       legislation and for helping U.S. Probation Officers do their       job more safely by passing H.R. 1039, the ``Probation Officer       Protection Act.''            Sincerely,                                                  Nathan R. Catura,                                                National President.     Mr. Speaker, I think what is interesting here  is I can't really, frankly, understand sort of the shade, I guess, or  the dismissiveness that is being thrown on probation officers and their  lack of training, which is 6 weeks plus 40 hours additional, which is  subject to their job.   The evidence that was presented here, the example of the person not  wanting a search, many times a probation officer will come with a  search warrant that will allow them to search anywhere. But even in the  case of the lady who did not want her room searched, the bill  specifically says forcible impeding, which is already discussed and  talked about in law.   Also, any officer who witnesses a crime or is being attacked does not  have to have a warrant to make an arrest. So, I mean, it is really  interesting to me why we are discussing a bill and doing so in such a  way for which there are actual instances where this takes place.   My friend said, well, it only happens a very few times. My question  for this, as a son of a State trooper, if his name was Leonard Collins  and he was actually going to do this, I would say that one matters,  even if it is the only one--lives of these probation officers, one.   So why we are doing this, I am not really sure. Why we would oppose  this, I am not really sure.   You can make stretched arguments here, but when a probation officer  goes in and, in the words of the bill, is forcibly intimidated,  impeded, attacked, they can arrest the person there who they have  already had training in how to arrest. I am not sure, Mr. Speaker, how  you can make a good argument about that. You can try.   There will be debate here in just a few minutes, which this rule  gives, because I would encourage voting ``no'' on the previous question  and voting ``yes'' on this rule.   But there is also another issue that I do want to address. In this  majority, since this majority has been in control, there has never been  a waiver for germaneness on a floor amendment. Germaneness matters. So,  again, find the proper place.   As we go forward, as we look, at least in my time here, this is one  of the simple, straightforward issues. You are protecting and giving a  chance for those probation officers who encounter something that most  in this body now, in our current jobs, maybe in previous, have not had  to face.   So the question for me today is simply this. It makes sense as a  commonsense update. Support it. It enables them to carry out their job,  protecting themselves.   The underlying bill simply provides additional resources for  probation officers to protect themselves while, at the same time,  freeing up the demands of other law enforcement officers in the area.  When we understand the commitment that they make, I do not understand  making legal sidestep arguments of hypotheticals that may or may not  exist to say we should not give them another tool in their toolbox.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 324 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered  [[Page H4331]]       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
