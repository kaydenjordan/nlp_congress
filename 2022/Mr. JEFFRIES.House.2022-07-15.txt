 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman,  Chairman Pallone, for his leadership in this critically important area,  as well as Representative Fletcher for leading the charge in an area  that is significantly important and consistent with the values of this  great country; a country that embraces life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness, land of the free, and home of the brave, liberty and  justice for all.   But liberty, justice, and freedom are under assault right now because  of a radical, rightwing, illegitimate Supreme Court majority and their  extreme co-conspirators here in the House of Representatives attacking  freedom.   But this legislation and House Democrats are going to do everything  in our power to defend a woman's freedom to make her own reproductive  healthcare decisions, a woman's freedom to make a deeply personal  decision that should be between a woman and her doctor, not extremists  trying to intervene, and her freedom to make the decision to travel to  seek abortion care whenever and wherever is necessary.   Those are the stakes. That is why this legislation is so important,  and we will always defend these freedoms.
