 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dominic LaJoie  of Van Buren, ME, who was recently named as National Potato Council,  NPC, president for 2021. The National Potato Council is a grower-led  organization managed by an Executive Committee and Board of Directors,  which oversees its operations and provides guidance on its policy  activities. It does not surprise me that Dominic LaJoie was chosen as  the 2021 president to lead the council's Executive Committee because  Dominic epitomizes the qualities that are needed to bring State potato  grower organizations together at the national level. He has a proven  history of promoting collaboration and respectful, healthy debate to  further best practices and innovation in agriculture for years. Dominic  has also served on the Maine Potato Board and has been a long standing  and active participant of the National Potato Council in previous years  including serving on the Trade Committee and as first vice president  and vice president of the Environmental Affairs Committee.   But those are the only the highlights of one well-deserved  appointment. What truly makes Dominic stand out is his heart for  farming, for his family and for his community all while stepping up to  serve in a national seat. Dominic and his family are fourth generation  potato farmers. He is so humble and proud to work with his brother and  nephew, along with the support of their wives and children, on the land  that was farmed by their parents and their grandparents before them.  Dominic's work ethic and character have shone through throughout his  career as a farmer, but never one to just sit idle, their farm  diversified and added grain and root vegetables, and they have worked  to carve out new niche products in the natural snacks and health food  markets. He is active in many civic activities and in his church, and  when given a chance to speak of his wife and four children, his already  genuine and wide smile broadens even further with an acknowledgment of  his blessings.   I was pleased to tour their farm in Van Buren a couple of years ago  and learned directly about their farm: the innovations and value added  products; their focus on precision farming and efficiencies to enhance  the productivity of their legacy farm and stewardship of the land they  grew up on. Upon one of Dominic's awards received in recent years, he  was asked if he had advice to those who are considering taking up  farming, and he replied ``Never give up, be open-minded and embrace  change, take chances.'' It was immediately clear to me that Dominic's  successes through attention to detail, sound business practices, and a  true commitment to the future of agriculture was what brought him to be  nominated and appointed as president of the National Potato Council for  2021.   I would like to recognize and thank Dominic for his ongoing  commitment to upholding the legacy of potato growers in our State and  this country. I cannot speak highly enough of Dominic and look forward  to his service as the president of the National Potato Council  Executive Committee.                            ____________________
