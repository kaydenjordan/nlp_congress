 It certainly doesn't have to be a crime. If       you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of       President and who abuses trust and poses great danger to our       liberty, you don't need a technical crime.    Mr. Manager NADLER. But we need not look to 1998 to find one of  President Trump's key allies espousing this view. Consider the comments  of our current Attorney General, William Barr, a man known for his  extraordinarily expansive view of Executive power. In Attorney General  Barr's view, as expressed about 18 months ago, Presidents cannot be  indicted or criminally investigated--but that's OK because they can be  impeached. That's the safeguard. And in an impeachment, Attorney  General added, the President is ``answerable for any abuses of  discretion'' and may be held ``accountable under law for his misdeeds  in office.''    In other words, Attorney General Barr believes, along with the Office  of Legal Counsel, that a President may not be indicted. He believes  that is OK.  [[Page S491]]  We don't need that safeguard against a President who would commit  abuses of power. It is OK because he can be impeached. That is the  safeguard for abuses of discretion and for his misdeeds in office.   More recently, a group of the Nation's leading constitutional  scholars--ranging across the ideological spectrum from Harvard Law  Professor Larry Tribe to former Ronald Reagan Solicitor General Charles  Fried--issued a statement affirming that ``abuse of power counts as an  instance of impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors under the  Constitution.''   They added: ``That was clearly the view of the Constitution's  framers.''   I could go on, but you get the point. Everyone, except President  Trump and his lawyers, agrees that Presidents can be impeached for  abuse of power. The President's position amounts to nothing but self- serving constitutional nonsense. And it is dangerous nonsense at that.  A President who sees no limit on his power manifestly threatens the  Republic.   The Constitution always matches power with constraint. That is true  even of powers vested in the Chief Executive. Nobody is entitled to  wield power under the Constitution if they ignore or betray the  Nation's interests to advance their own. President Nixon was wrong in  asserting that ``when the President does it, that means it is not  illegal.'' And President Trump was equally wrong when he declared that  he had ``the right to do whatever I want as president.''   Under the Constitution, he is subject to impeachment and removal for  abuse of power. And as we will prove, that is exactly what must happen  here.   Of course, President Trump's abuse of power--as charged in the first  Article of Impeachment and supported by a mountain of evidence--is  aggravated by another concern at the heart of the Constitution's  impeachment clause.   Betrayal. The Founders of our country were not fearful men. When they  wrote our Constitution, they had only recently won a bloody war for  independence. But as they looked outward from their new Nation, they  saw Kings scheming for power, promising fabulous wealth to spies and  deserters. The United States could be enmeshed in such conspiracies.  ``Foreign powers,'' warned Elbridge Gerry, ``will intermeddle in our  affairs, and spare no expense to influence them.''   The young Republic might not survive a President who schemed with  other nations, entangling himself in secret deals that harmed our  democracy. That reality loomed over the impeachment debate in  Philadelphia.   Explaining why the Constitution required an impeachment option,  Madison argued that a President ``might betray his trust to foreign  powers.'' To be sure, the Framers did not intend impeachment for  genuine, good faith disagreements between the President and Congress  over matters of diplomacy. But they were explicit that betrayal of the  Nation through plots with foreign powers must result in removal from  office. And no such betrayal scared them more than foreign interference  in our democracy.   In his Farewell Address, George Washington warned Americans ``to be  constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign  influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.''   And in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, John Adams wrote:         You are apprehensive of foreign Interference, Intrigue,       Influence.--So am I.--But, as often as Elections happen, the       danger of foreign Influence recurs.    The Framers never suggested that the President's role in foreign  affairs should prevent Congress from impeaching him for treachery in  his dealings. Case in point: they wrote a Constitution that gives  Congress extensive responsibility over foreign affairs--Congress-- including the power to declare war, regulate foreign commerce,  establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and define offenses against  the law of nations.   Contrary to the claims you heard the other day--that the President  has plenary authority in foreign affairs and there is nothing Congress  can do about it--the Supreme Court has stated that constitutional  authority over the ``conduct of the foreign relations of our  Government'' is shared between ``the Executive and Legislative  [branches].''   Or to quote another Supreme Court case: ``The Executive is not free  from the ordinary controls and checks of Congress merely because  foreign affairs are at issue.''   In these realms, Justice Jackson wrote, the Constitution ``enjoins  upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but  reciprocity.''   Where the President betrays our national security and foreign policy  interests for his own personal gain, he is unquestionably subject to  impeachment and removal. The same is true of a different concern raised  by the Framers: the use of Presidential power to corrupt the elections  and the Office of the Presidency.   The Framers were no strangers to corruption. They understood that  corruption had broken Rome, debased Britain, and threatened America.  They saw no shortage of threats to the Republic and fought valiantly to  guard against them. But as one scholar writes, ``the big fear  underlying all the small fears was whether they'd be able to control  corruption.''   So the Framers attempted to build a government in which officials  would not use public power for personal benefits, disregarding the  public good in pursuit of their own advancement.   This principle applied with special force to the Presidency. As  Madison emphasized, because the Presidency ``was to be administered by  a single man,'' his corruption ``might be fatal to the Republic.''   Indeed, no fewer than four delegates to the Constitutional  Convention--Madison, plus Morris, Mason, and Randolph--listed  corruption as a central reason why Presidents must be subject to  impeachment and removal from office. Impeachment was seen as especially  necessary for Presidential conduct corrupting our system of political  self-government. The Framers foresaw and feared that a President might  someday place his personal interest in reelection above our abiding  commitment to democracy. Such a President, in their view, would need to  be removed from office.   Professor Feldman made this point in his testimony before the House  Judiciary Committee:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
