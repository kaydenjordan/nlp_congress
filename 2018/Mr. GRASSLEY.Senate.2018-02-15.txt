 Madam President, I come to the floor now to offer brief  remarks on the introduction of the latest so-called bipartisan  proposal. There is simply no way to say it, but to say it: This  proposal fails to meet the mark, will result in massive amnesty, and  will result in a surge of illegal immigration, even encouraging the  illegal crossing of our borders. It has absolutely no chance of  becoming law because we have been reminded of what the President has  said he would sign, and he has said that this bill we are talking about  now would not be signed by the President of the United States. It would  be vetoed.   In my mind, the Department of Homeland Security, when they commented  on this bill, has this one point right. This bill will absolutely  destroy our ability--meaning the ability of DHS--to enforce our laws,  secure our borders, and then, consequentially, not protect the American  people. The American people expect our government to fulfill their No.  1 responsibility, which is to protect the American people.   It is hard to decide where to start when you dissect this ill- conceived proposal, but to quote, I think, J.R.R. Tolkien, I guess the  best place to begin is at the beginning. This proposal claims to have  border security measures, but the simple fact is that it doesn't have  border security measures. This proposal does something that Democrats  and Republicans agreed last year isn't sufficient border security, and  we have all agreed that simply throwing money at the border is not  border security. So what does that lead you to, other than just what  you do at the border?   Everyone in this Chamber knows how hard Senators Cornyn and Johnson  have worked on border security. Their hard work has shown all of us  that real border security isn't just about infrastructure and money; it  is about legal authority policy changes, as well, which may be more  important. Like it or not, the simple fact is that our current laws  contain numerous loopholes that actually prevent our law enforcement  officers from apprehending, detaining, and speedily deporting dangerous  criminal aliens.   Professional staffers at the Department of Homeland Security--and I  emphasize the words ``professional staffers,'' not political  employees--all agree we need these authority changes.   I ask my colleagues: What is the point of throwing money at the  border if sex offenders, terrorists, gang members, child molesters, and  war criminals can continue getting into our country? What is the point  if we can't actually remove people who are entering illegally? What is  the point if Americans continue to be victimized by crimes committed by  undocumented immigrants?   This bipartisan plan falls miserably short of providing real border  security and doesn't do anything to make Americans safer.   Worse than the border security problems, this bipartisan plan  massively expands the number of individuals who are eligible for  citizenship. The way this plan is written, more than 3 million  individuals could become eligible for citizenship, and many of these  people wouldn't be the very same people we have been trying to deal  with all week--DACA and Dreamers.   The way this bill is written, people as old as 43 could benefit. I  thought when we began this debate we were talking about protecting  young people, not middle-aged adults. This is clearly beyond the pale  and is just another example of moving the amnesty yardstick.   But the worst thing in this plan, the most egregious thing, is that  it effectively suspends immigration enforcement until June 2018. Think  about that. Why would you effectively suspend immigration enforcement  at any time? If my colleagues look at the last page of this amendment,  it clearly says that any person who illegally enters our country before  the end of June 2018 will never be a priority for deportation. Think of  the invitation that comes for people between now and June 30 to get to  this country because they won't be a priority for deportation. Isn't  that quite an invitation to violate our laws, to violate our  sovereignty? I can't imagine that people in the States of Montana,  North Dakota, South Dakota--any State, for that matter, but  particularly in some of these really conservative States--that they  would be thinking about voting for something that would actually be  inviting people to this country because they won't be a priority for  deportation. Let that point sink in.   The authors of this plan are telling everyone in the world--not just  south of our border--no matter who they are, what they have done, that  if they get here before June, they will never be an enforcement  priority. Isn't that immigration madness? I can't, for the life of me,  understand why my colleagues would want to end immigration enforcement.  What justification do they have?   I would urge them that if they have justification, please come to the  floor and please explain to the American people why you want people who  aren't already here to come illegally. What could be the reason for  that?   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It just isn't serious  and will totally undermine our Nation's border security and immigration  laws. This should not pass. I hope it doesn't pass. The President has  proposed a veto.   For the people who introduced it, it is a good bill, but are you  interested in a good bill or are you interested in getting a law  passed? That takes 60 in the Senate, takes a majority in the House, and  takes a Presidential signature. I hope you are serious about working  for things that can actually become law. That is what we have promised  the Dreamers. That is what we can deliver if we get those 60 votes. We  can do it in a way that is sound immigration policy, not something that  is going to encourage more people to cross our borders without  documentation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, we offer you commonsense reforms. More  than half of the Senators on that side just voted for a massive amount  of funding that we need for border security. We offer that as well, but  we also make it easier for authorities to remove criminals. We end  chain migration. We end the diversity visa. We also have a path to  citizenship for 1.8 million DACA recipients and Dreamers.   In a sense, this is it. It is the only plan that can become law  because the President has said he would sign it. This is it. This is  one's last chance to vote for a path to citizenship for all of the  people we have been talking about giving justice to and being  compassionate about and bringing out of the dark. So here we are with  an opportunity to do it. I hope you will vote yes and support it.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
