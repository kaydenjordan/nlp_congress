 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Financial  Services Committee in strong opposition to the Financial CHOICE Act,  or, more appropriately titled, the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act.   The proponents of this bill claim it is about regulatory relief for  our Nation's community banks, but it is not. This bill guts the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an organization that was  developed to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, abusive  practices.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today because the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau has done amazing things. This bill would dismantle  it, dismantle a Bureau that just in 6 years has recovered almost $12  billion for over 29 million Americans.   Mr. Speaker, this is the wrong choice. This bill returns the American  economy to the deregulatory state that led us to the great financial  crisis and the deepest recession since the Great Depression.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill,  because the fundamental question is, it does not provide choice or hope  or opportunity for investors or for entrepreneurs.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member Waters for yielding me  time.   I stand here and I join my colleagues in opposition to the Financial  CHOICE Act. It is the wrong act. And let me just say this to you:  Certainly, it does not provide choice nor does it create hope and  opportunity for investors and for consumers and for entrepreneurs.   I am from the great State of Ohio, and you may have a sign that says  people are for it; I have letters from ProgressOhio; I have letters  from Policy Matters Ohio; I also have a letter here from the National  Consumer Law Center, Advancing Fairness In The Marketplace For All. Let  me just tell you what they are saying. They are saying that it is  breathtaking--the assault on hardworking Americans, the assault on  businesses that want to level the playing field to improve the economy.   Mr. Chair, this is ridiculous that we stand here. If it was such a  good choice, we would have had more meetings on it. If it was such a  good choice for hardworking Americans, then we would have worked with  Republicans and Democrats to make it a fair choice, to make it a right  choice. But I stand here today and tell you it is the wrong choice for  consumers. It is the wrong choice because it eviscerates the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau. It is against the people, and it is not  for hardworking Americans.
