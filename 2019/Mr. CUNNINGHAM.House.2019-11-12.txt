 Madam Speaker, today I am proud to rise in support of  my bill, the VA Tele-Hearing Modernization Act, which will make it  easier for our Nation's veterans to appeal their claims with the  Department of Veterans Affairs.   Currently, the Board of Veterans' Affairs only conducts tele-hearings  from certain VA locations, meaning veterans have to travel to testify  in support of their claims; and, in many cases, this forces Lowcountry  veterans to drive all the way to Columbia.   My bill offers a commonsense solution to this problem by allowing  veterans to teleconference into these hearings from the comfort of  their own homes using their personal computers.   Further, this legislation will require these hearings to take place  via a secure platform so that veterans do not have to sacrifice the  security of their sensitive personal information to take advantage of  this new process. This change will not only benefit those veterans who  may be otherwise unable to travel for their hearing, but will also help  to expedite the appeals process for veterans across the board.   With veterans given the freedom to participate in their appeals  hearing from a place of their own choosing, no-shows, which add to the  appeals backlog and slow down the process for everyone, will be  significantly reduced, all with no additional cost to taxpayers.                                time  1645    The VA Tele-Hearing Modernization Act is exemplary of the sorts of  advances that we can make when both parties come together for the sake  of our veterans.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Katko for signing on as an  original cosponsor. I also want to thank Chairman Takano and Ranking  Member Roe for their leadership on the committee and for expediting  this legislation, as well as their staffs for all their hard work.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join in supporting this legislation for our veterans, who have  sacrificed too much to need to jump through hoops for a fair hearing on  their claims.
