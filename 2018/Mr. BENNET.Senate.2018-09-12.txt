 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks.    Mr. President, in recent weeks, President Trump has gone  around the country touting the strength of the economy. He said:         Our economy is the strongest it has ever been in the       history of our country, and you just have to look at the       numbers to know that.    The numbers do tell us that the economy is strong and getting  stronger, and that is a good thing, but they also tell us that the  economy has been strengthening since 2010--after President Obama acted  to save us from another Great Depression and when some Members of  Congress wouldn't lift a finger to help him.   During President Obama's term, even as the economic data showed more  and more investment and more growth, the other side talked down the  recovery because, even though it was good for America, it didn't help  them win elections. As a candidate, this was Donald Trump's specialty.  He was a master of this in September 2016--long into the recovery--when  he said: ``This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great  Depression.'' The Great Depression wasn't a recovery; it was the Great  Depression. We were coming out of the great recession.   He even questioned the government's monthly jobs report, at one point  calling it ``total fiction.''   ``Nobody has jobs. . . . It is not a real economy. It is a phony set  of numbers. They cooked the books,'' he said of the government's  report. ``Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 percent  or 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35.  In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.'' He campaigned on that.   Now that he is President, Donald Trump's attitude has changed. This  month he said that we have the strongest economy in the history of our  Nation. It turns out that he loves those jobs reports that he  criticized so readily under President Obama:         JUST OUT: 3.9% Unemployment. 4% is Broken! In the meantime,       WITCH HUNT!    If you only read the President's twitter feed--which I don't  recommend--you could be forgiven for believing that the economy was  collapsing under President Obama but is now roaring back under his  administration. As usual, the truth is not nearly as partisan.   If we ignore the hyperbole and exaggeration and review the actual  history, the trends are clear. The economy was shrinking and shedding  jobs when President Obama took office. He stepped in and made difficult  decisions, and soon after, the economy began growing, adding jobs and  gaining strength. And it has continued under President Trump, I am  pleased to say.   Let's look at the record.   Last week, President Trump celebrated the almost 4 million jobs  created since the election. In the first year and a half of President  Trump, the economy created an average of 189,000 jobs a month. That is  good. Compare that to the last year and a half under President Obama  when the economy created 208,000 jobs a month. Unfortunately, we have  lost some ground since the Obama administration, but we are still  making progress. This chart demonstrates that.   This chart also demonstrates that despite President Trump's deficit- busting tax cuts and higher spending, job growth has actually slowed  under his administration. The same is true for wages. I don't take any  pleasure in this, but, as you can see here, average hourly earnings  grew at a rate of 1.3 percent during the course of President Obama's  last 18 months; they grew by 1.1 percent during President Trump's first  18 months. That growth has slowed.   Last week, President Trump also said that we have more people working  today than at any point ever in history. That is true, but it has been  true since May of 2014. In fact, the private sector has added jobs for  102 months straight--the longest streak on record, and 80 percent of  that streak was during the Obama administration.   As in other parts of his life, when it comes to jobs, President Trump  is once again coasting on his inheritance.   President Trump said:         Economic growth last quarter was 4.2 percent, and as you       people know, it was headed down, big. And it was a low       number. A very low number. It would have been, in my opinion,       it would have been less than zero. It was heading to negative       numbers.    First, the economy did grow by 4.2 percent last quarter, but it grew  by the  [[Page S6131]]  same rate for several quarters in 2015 and 2016 under President Obama.   There is not a single economist who thought we were ``heading to  negative numbers'' at the end of the Obama administration. In fact,  when asked, a surrogate for this administration couldn't name a single  economist to back up the President's claim.   Most recently, on Monday, President Trump tweeted:         The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate       (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!    Even FOX News had to call him out on that one. They pointed out that  since 1948, GDP growth has been higher than the unemployment rate 63  different times. This is not the first time; it has happened 63 times.   The one thing that actually has happened for the first time during  the course of this administration is that it is the first time in  American history that the unemployment rate is falling and our deficit  is going up. That has never happened before. It is hard to do that. The  level of irresponsibility required to have an outcome where your  unemployment is falling and your deficit is rising is unheard of in  American history.   The Congressional Budget Office just announced that the government  spent $895 billion more than it took in over the past 11 months. That  is a 33-percent increase in our deficit from last year. It is a 53- percent increase in our deficit since the last year of the Obama  administration just 2 years ago. And by the way, we still have a month  to go in this year. So the deficit has increased under this Republican  President, this Republican Senate, this Republican House majority, by  more than half since President Obama left office.   By the way, and parenthetically, the last time unemployment was 3.9  percent was the year 2000, when we had a projected surplus of $5.6  trillion. That was at the end of the Clinton administration.   This is all a far cry from candidate Donald Trump's promise to  eliminate our debt over a period of 8 years or his promise to provide  great healthcare for a fraction of the price, whereby everyone will be  taken care of better than they are taken care of now, or his promise to  build the greatest infrastructure on the planet Earth--the roads and  railways and airports of tomorrow. I haven't seen any tweets about that  lately.   I will give him this: President Trump promised he would be the  greatest jobs President God ever created. Do you know what? He has been  the greatest jobs President God ever created since Barack Obama was  President of the United States.   I want to finish by suggesting that instead of trafficking in  complete falsehoods and untruths and exaggerations about what he has  saved us from and how phenomenally well he is doing while he is  creating these enormous deficits as our economy grows, the American  people would be a lot better served by a conversation about the much  deeper challenges we face--for example, why wages have decoupled from  productivity, why incomes have not kept pace with cost, why automation  and global competition have put tremendous pressure on workers and  wages and what we are going to do about it, why inequality continues to  rise and economic mobility in the United States continues to fall below  that of European countries. That is what we should be talking about.  Ignoring these issues doesn't make them disappear.   Reality is out there in States like Colorado and all across our  country, and our lack of mobility and our extraordinary inequality is  bearing down on us. Even if the President chooses to ignore it, for the  sake of our children, we cannot.   I yield the floor.
