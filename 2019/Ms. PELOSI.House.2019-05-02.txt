 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  commend him for his leadership.   This issue of infrastructure resiliency is so important. We are now  discussing doing major infrastructure legislation to rebuild America in  a way that is making it safer, by promoting commerce and improving the  quality of life by decreasing the amount of time people have to spend  in their cars. By increasing broadband and all of the things that  enable people, whether it is healthcare, education, or commerce, the  infrastructure is so central to that.   When we talk about infrastructure, we have to talk about resiliency;  and when we talk about climate change, we have to talk about  infrastructure. So this is a very important amendment, and I rise to  support it.   I thank the gentleman for sharing his New Jersey experience in terms  of the need for resiliency in this very wise amendment.   I also want to rise in support of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.  I commend Chairwoman Kathy Castor who is the chair of our House Select  Committee on the Climate Crisis and also the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel, for his leadership on this important  issue which is under the jurisdiction of his committee. They bring  vision, they bring values, and they bring the voices of Members and the  American people to make a difference.   We thank our freshman Members, in particular, who have carried the  priorities of their communities to Congress to demand climate action  now. And I think it is very appropriate that the gentleman in the chair  is on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and has been a  leader in the private sector, now in the public sector, on this  important issue as we go forward.   It is time, Mr. Chairman, to end denial about this and start  listening to the facts. This is about science, science, science. An  overwhelming number, 86 percent, of Americans know that this is a  crisis. They know that human behavior has an impact on it, and they  want us to act.   We all have stories from our communities.   One of my constituents wrote:         My daughter has developed asthma. It wrenches me to see her       used as a canary in a coal mine. We are literally choking on       the denial and inaction.    Another writes:         Green jobs are guaranteed local jobs and will put people to       work. Survival is now poised to become a viable economic       sector.    Let me just say that this is about jobs, jobs, jobs. It is very  important for our country to be preeminent in the world on the green  technologies, and this legislation is in recognition of that. It is  about public health, about clean air and clean water, the air our  children breathe and the water they drink, and it is about  environmental justice in that regard as well that all children will be  able to live in a safe, clean environment in which they can thrive.    It is about our national security. Over and over again the national  security experts, the generals and the admirals, have come to us and  said that this is a global security issue, because of what impact the  climate change crisis is doing to the use of water and access to food  and how natural disasters affect migration and also how that can lead  to initiation of hostilities among people. It is a national security  issue in terms of how we use our resources for our national security as  well.   It is a moral issue. If you believe, as I and some in the evangelical  community do, that this planet is God's creation and we have a moral  responsibility to be good stewards of it, then you would be sure to be  a good steward and sign up for climate action now.   But even if you don't share that religious belief, we all know that  we have a moral responsibility to the next generation to pass this  planet on in a better way than we found it in a very responsible way.   So it is we must take action. The bill demands action now, by keeping  us in the only international agreement dedicated to ending the climate  crisis and demanding a plan of action from the administration, and Mr.  Kim has put forth that plan to recognize infrastructure resiliency as  the administration comes forward.   We are sending a signal to the world that the U.S. is in denial about  the overwhelming science about climate, but this bill is a step in the  right direction.   I am very proud of the work the House Select Committee on the Climate  Crisis and other committees of jurisdiction are doing. But it is a task  for every committee of the Congress to look at the jurisdiction of the  committee and to see how, in terms of jobs, public health, national  security, and, again, our moral responsibility to our children and  future generations--it is everybody's responsibility in the Congress.  It is a Congress-wide responsibility.   I do thank the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis for the  focus that it is placing on all of this. We will be able to accommodate  so many entrepreneurial ideas, new thinking on the subject, being  current on the data and on the science. So we have a tremendous  generational opportunity and responsibility.   I thank all who are involved in this for their extraordinary  leadership. Anyone who cares about our planet and our children's future  is deeply in debt to those who have taken the lead on this.   Under President Bush's leadership when he was President and we had  our select committee then, we passed the biggest energy bill in  history. While everyone was not in agreement on the climate crisis, we  all agreed that we had to take action. President Bush signed the bill  in a big ceremony, and it was the equivalent of taking tens of millions  of cars off the road in how we raised the emissions standards. It was  important, and that legislation was the basis for many of the executive  actions that President Obama was able to take under the authority of  that legislation.   So that was very important, and it was bipartisan. Hopefully, we can  be bipartisan as we go forward for the next big steps that we have to  take.   Technology has come a long way since then. Science informs us better.  Current events have made it very clear: we have an imperative to have  climate action now.   Again, Mr. Chairman, I urge our colleagues to vote for Mr. Kim's  amendment to H.R. 9.
