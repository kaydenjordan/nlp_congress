 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to salute a good  friend, a gentleman with one of the biggest hearts I have ever met. Doc  McGann was a piece of the very community that I grew up in back home on  Long Island in a small village called Island Park.   Back home in Island Park, one of the beacons of our community is our  local firehouse, and Doc McGann served that fire department for 72  years. He served as chief of our department from 1963 to 1964 and had  the opportunity to serve every rank in that department. Even in his  elder years, he was a calm voice, someone who gave the younger members  advice on how to serve their community.   He was active in our Church of Sacred Heart.   He was the executive leader of the Island Park, Lido, Point Lookout  Republican Committee. In that capacity, in 1980, he was one of the  architects that sent an unknown guy from a small village of 6,000  people by the name of Alfonse D'Amato to the United States Senate.   Mr. Speaker, 42 years later, he helped send another guy from a  village of 6,000 to the United States House of Representatives, that  being me.   He was married to his lovely wife, Gerri, for 66 years. He leaves  behind four children: Danny, Kevin, Kerrie, and Jackie. He is the proud  grandfather and great-grandfather of beautiful children.   Today, I salute Doc McGann. When he died just less than a month ago,  a piece of Island Park died with him.                 Recognizing Brian Sullivan on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Brian  Sullivan, the president of the Nassau County Correction Officers  Benevolent Association.   After a long and storied career in the Nassau County Sheriff's  Department, Mr. Sullivan has retired, leaving behind a legacy of  excellence.   Brian Sullivan was appointed as a correction officer in Nassau County  in 1988, marking the beginning of over 35 years of service. Brian  Sullivan worked his way through the ranks of the department, ultimately  achieving the rank of captain in 2022.   Throughout his time in corrections, Brian Sullivan served in a  multitude of positions, including the Behavioral Management Unit, which  comprised some of the most dangerous inmates in custody in our county.   In addition to safeguarding the public from violent offenders, Brian  demonstrated his leadership among colleagues and was elected in 2002 to  serve as a delegate of his union. As he did in his uniformed career,  Brian rose through the ranks of the union, having been elected first as  a delegate, twice as the union's first vice president, and then twice  as president of the organization.   In his tenure as union leader, he was wildly successful and managed  to help pass several laws at the State level to protect pensions and  death benefits for Nassau County corrections officers.   Brian's work both safeguarding the people of Nassau County and  advocating for his brother and sister correction officers is worthy of  great praise. I am honored to recognize the incredible career of my  Nassau neighbor and friend.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Brian Sullivan the best in this next chapter, and  I know he will continue being a selfless community servant wherever  life takes him. I wish him the best of luck in his retirement.  [[Page H6870]]                                ____________________
