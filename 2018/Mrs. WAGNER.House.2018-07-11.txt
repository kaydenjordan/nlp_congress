 Mr. Speaker, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934  requires most SEC registrants to file a form 10Q quarterly report with  the SEC. The form 10Q includes condensed financial information and  other data prepared by a company and reviewed by independent auditors.   Although technology has evolved rapidly over the years, the form 10Q  used today was adopted in 1950. My legislation, H.R. 5970, the  Modernizing Disclosures for Investors Act, requires the Securities and  Exchange Commission, the SEC, to report to Congress the costs and  benefits of form 10Q and recommendations for decreasing costs while  increasing transparency and efficiency of quarterly financial  reporting.   Specifically, my bill requires the SEC to look at emerging growth  companies that are particularly susceptible to the burdens and  complexities associated with current reporting requirements. In recent  years, annual and quarterly reporting requirements have grown in size  and complexity, making it more difficult for investors to determine  relevant information, often leaving them overwhelmed and unable to make  sound investment decisions.   Furthermore, some companies believe that current reporting  requirements have become a barrier to registering as publicly traded  companies, as noted by a 2011 report by the IPO Task Force. The report,  which was prompted by the JOBS Act of 2012, found that 92 percent of  public company leaders said that the administrative burden of public  reporting was a significant challenge to completing an IPO and becoming  a public company.   Finally, I would like to note that my legislation is timely. At a  recent SEC oversight hearing, Chairman Clayton highlighted in his  testimony that: ``We should regularly review whether we have disclosure  requirements that are outdated, duplicative, or can otherwise be  improved.''   In addition, just last week, the SEC finalized a rule expanding the  definition of smaller reporting companies, which will allow them to be  eligible for scaled disclosures.   Before I conclude, I want to take a minute to thank Congressman  Gottheimer for his willingness to work across the aisle and to get this  bill to the finish line. With the passage of H.R. 5970 just last  evening, we have provided yet another example of how Congress can work  together in a bipartisan manner.                            ____________________
