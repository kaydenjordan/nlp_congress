 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I wanted to come down and speak today  about a very important sector of the economy for Alaska and for  America--that is, our fishermen--and some important, very bipartisan  legislation that I am trying to move right now that I am hopeful  everybody can agree to. The Senate has agreed to it previously, and I  am really hopeful that we can do it again right now.   I talk about the great State of Alaska being the superpower of  seafood. Over 60 percent of all seafood--commercial, recreational-- harvested in America comes from my great State. Sixty percent. So this  is a vital industry in my State but also a vital industry in the  country.   As my colleagues know, our fishermen are some of the hardest working  Americans. They are also some of the Americans who have been hit the  hardest by this pandemic. The Saltonstall-Kennedy Act helps these hard- working men and women across the country by providing consistent  funding for fisheries research and development and related programs,  grant programs--very popular.   Decades ago, Congress authorized a group of experts from all around  the country--Alaska, the east coast--and vessel owners, fishermen, and  distributors to advise the Secretary of Commerce on how to distribute  these funds. It makes sense. They are the closest to the action. Over  time, unfortunately, this group was disbanded. Nobody thought that was  a good idea--abolishing this advisory committee.   Then you had the National Marine Fisheries essentially determine how  all of these Saltonstall-Kennedy funds would be distributed to  fishermen. So, with all due respect to the DC bureaucrats, they are the  ones making the decisions.   So we have a bill--my bill--which, by the way, passed the Senate  previously, unanimously, that members in the fishing community from all  over the country be chosen to determine how to get these funds out to  our fishermen, whether in New York or North Carolina or Alaska, and  everybody thinks that makes sense.   Our fishermen need support right now; there is no doubt. They are  being hammered by this pandemic. So the legislation that I am hopefully  going to be able to pass in the Senate here in a couple of minutes has  cosponsors across a broad political spectrum in the Senate: Senators  Cantwell, Markey, Warren, Murkowski, and myself.   I am aware of no policy objections to this important piece of  legislation. To the contrary, it has already passed the Senate  unanimously. I am, however, aware of an unrelated dispute between the  Democratic leader and some of my Senate colleagues from the east coast  regarding an entirely different bill. I respect disagreements over  regional issues, and I certainly hope my colleagues can work them out,  but this issue is thousands of miles away from Alaska and my  constituents, the people I represent, who are hurting.   Moreover, the bill I am getting ready to introduce, S. 494, helps all  fishermen nationwide--New York, North Carolina, Alaska.   The American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act, S. 494, should not be  collateral damage or hostage taken in an unrelated fight. If my  colleagues want to try and work together, I will certainly help them  work out their differences, but I don't think it is constructive to  hold hostage this important legislation for a fight that is thousands  of miles away from Alaska.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 179, S. 494; that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, while I am disappointed, these are two  good friends of mine on the Senate floor right now, whom I have worked  with on numerous pieces of legislation. They both represent their  States very well, but this is a missed opportunity for the fishermen of  America--America, not  [[Page S5242]]  just Alaska but for the whole country, New York, North Carolina. And I  am certainly hopeful that my good friend from New York and North  Carolina can work this out.   I will certainly lend my efforts, my staff's efforts, because we  shouldn't have a regional fight blocking what will benefit everybody,  particularly when fishermen right now are really hurting. They are one  of the sectors of the U.S. economy that have been hammered by this  pandemic. This kind of legislation, although it is not going to solve  all their problems, shows that we are working for them.   We will live to fight another day here soon. I hope that we are able  to pass my legislation, commonsense legislation--the American Fisheries  Advisory Committee Act--which will help every fisherman in America.   I yield the floor.    Will my colleague from Ohio yield?    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Ohio  for his great leadership on this and so many other issues. I see my  colleague from Oregon is on the floor as well.   I want to talk about an issue that Senator Portman just touched on,  but it is really the key to what is going on here, and that it is good  faith. Are negotiations happening in good faith? Or are they not?   Sometimes, it is hard to tell. Sometimes, there is posturing, but,  last week at this time, Senator Portman, Senator McSally, and myself  were on the floor with regard to discussing Senator McSally's very  simple unanimous consent resolution which said as we negotiate-- hopefully, in good faith--the difference between what we have put  forward--the HEALS Act--and the Speaker Pelosi bill from early May--a  bit of a stale $4 trillion bill, one-third of which has nothing to do  with the pandemic--but as we are trying to negotiate in good faith,  let's move forward with an extension of unemployment so people who are  hurting can continue to rely on it. That happens all the time in the  Senate.   So what happened? The minority leader came down to the Senate floor  and blocked it. He blocked it, and his response was: I am going to  block this 1-week extension unless the Republicans take the entire $4- trillion Heroes Act. That is what he said. If you are watching or  paying attention, that is the definition of not negotiating in good  faith, and every Senator knows it. All 100 of us know it. That was not  a good faith maneuver.   What I predicted was the minority leader of the U.S. Senate, despite  that maneuver which is going to hurt millions of Americans, did it  because he thinks the national media will give him a pass, that no one  in the national media will say: Boy, oh boy, the minority leader just  blocked a reasonable request for an extension to help people.   But he thinks, and I think with good reason, that the national media  won't blame him for what he just did, so he did it with no explanation.  That is not good faith. By definition, coming down saying, Take my $4  trillion package or you won't get a 1-week extension of unemployment,  that is not good faith.   Let me mention one other point which Senator Portman mentioned. Now,  on this tough issue of unemployment insurance--and Senator Portman has  been a leader on this--I was talking to some of my Democratic  colleagues about them today.   By the way, most of them don't believe that $600 until January is a  good idea for the reasons Senator Portman mentioned.   Again, to have the minority leader of the U.S. Senate and Speaker  Pelosi just say: 600 bucks, take it or leave it? Colleagues, you all  know--we all know--that is not good faith. That is not good faith.   It is starting to feel like the minority leader and the Speaker are  not negotiating in good faith right now. I hope they are--I know a lot  of my Democratic colleagues are--but people have to remember,  regardless of what party you are in, Americans are hurting. They need  help. We have one foot in the recovery, one foot still in the pandemic.  But what we need as we negotiate this package is good faith.   So I want to thank my colleague from Ohio again for his strong  leadership on this and so many other issues. I am certainly going to be  supportive of unanimous consent requests which we made at this time  just last week to help people--not controversial, a week extension as  we negotiate. It happens all the time here in the Senate.   I certainly hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not  going to say, No, take my whatever, or we are not going to do it,  because it doesn't look or feel like good faith. Do you know who is  hurting by that? Do you know who is being hurt by that? The American  people, who are suffering    Thank you, Senator Portman.   I have a lot of respect for my colleague from Oregon, who  unfortunately just left the Senate floor, but there they go again. On  the Senate floor, the Senator from Oregon just said ``Republicans cut  off unemployment insurance for millions of families'' when, in reality,  what we have just witnessed--if you are watching--on the Senate floor  is that the Senator from Oregon objected to restoring unemployment  benefits for millions of Americans. That is a fact. That is just what  happened.   So he says one thing--and again, I think they get a little bit  careless because they think the national media will just report what he  says. But he said, ``I object.'' When he said ``I object,'' here is  what he meant: I object to restoring unemployment benefits for millions  of Americans. That is what the Senator from Oregon just did. There is  no denying that. And right before he did it, he said that Republicans  cut off unemployment for millions of Americans. That is just not true-- not true.   He just objected to restoring unemployment benefits for a week--$600  for millions of Americans--just like the Democratic leader from New  York did last week. Then he said: ``Short-term extensions are not  enough.'' That is another quote from the Senator from Oregon, but he  didn't finish the sentence by saying: And because I objected, they are  going to get zero.   So think about that one. Short-term extensions are not enough--sounds  good--so he objects so there are no extensions. Again, that is just  what happened on the floor.   He didn't say one thing about this issue that Senator Portman and I  have been discussing, which is good-faith negotiations. There is not  one Senator in this body who believes that when the Democratic leader  comes to the floor of the Senate and says ``take the $4 trillion  Speaker Pelosi bill passed in early May or nothing,'' that that is good  faith. It is almost, by definition, bad faith.   So I think our colleagues, who are trying to negotiate in good faith  but are getting locked down by their leadership, are having a bit of a  problem because they know this isn't good faith, and they know people  are suffering. That is why we have got to work together to get to an  agreement, but what we cannot do and what I fear the other side is  starting to do is use people who are suffering as leverage in  negotiations. That is not what we should be doing. We should be working  in good faith to try to get to an agreement, and we should be making  statements on the Senate floor that are actually factual.   What just happened here was that the Senator from Oregon objected to  American citizens getting their unemployment benefits restored. That is  a fact.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to thank my good friend and  colleague from Texas for laying out the choice before us and  highlighting, again, this issue of good-faith negotiations, which  hopefully we are starting  [[Page S5251]]  to see, but last week we didn't see; and he talked about the so-called  Heroes Act passed in May--so quite stale.   I will say one other element of that that was shocking and has been  shocking to me is, there is a whole section on clawing back CARES Act  money that went to Alaska Natives. The Heroes Act, the Pelosi $4  trillion bill, has a section that targets expressly about 20 percent of  the population of my State--and my State only. By the way, they are  amazing, patriotic people who have been through pandemics before and  have suffered horrendously during these pandemics. The Heroes Act  targets them and says any money that Native Alaskan organizations have  received--by the way, organizations, regional and village corporations  set up by Congress--any money they have received will be clawed back in  the Heroes Act. Of course, I am never going to let that bill pass-- ever--on this floor. It is an outrage.   They need to get more serious about these negotiations, and the  ``take it or leave it'' on the $4 trillion Pelosi bill that  specifically targets some of the most patriotic Americans in the  country, who happen to be my constituents--Alaska Natives--is never  going to fly. Never                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is Thursday, and it is a time that I  get to come to the Senate floor and recognize an Alaskan who has made a  difference in my State and, in this case, someone who has made a  difference literally around the globe. This is someone I refer to as  the ``Alaskan of the Week.'' I love to do it. I know some of our  reporters listening enjoy this.   Kristin, I know you love bears, so this week you will be particularly  interested.   Before I get into the bears and the story and the individual we are  going to honor today, let me tell you a little bit about what is  happening in Alaska. Like other places in our great Nation, our State  is certainly facing challenges--like the rest of America, one foot in  our economic recovery, one foot still in this pandemic. It is a  challenging time, but Alaskans are tough--certainly some of the  toughest people in America. As I say, tough times don't last, but tough  people do. We will get through this as a State, as a nation, and I  think that certainly applies to Alaska.   It is summer. The Sun is high. The salmon are running thick. The  bears are digging them out of the streams. By the way, a word to the  wise: When you have salmon, you almost always have bears, so be  careful.   In Alaska, we love our bears and so does our Alaskan of the Week,  Julia Bevins, who recently moved from Anchorage to the gorgeous town of  Homer--Homer, AK. For those of you who have been there, you know what I  am talking about. For those who haven't, you have to get out to Homer.  It is the halibut capital of the world but a magnificently beautiful  place. Just the drive from Anchorage to Homer is breathtaking. There is  no other place in the world like it.   It is from Homer that Julia keeps going the now world-renowned  foundation, the international Bear Conservation Fund, which is part of  the International Association of Bear Research and Management, or IBA,  that she and her late husband, wildlife biologist John Bevins, founded.   Why the foundation and why the bears? Let me tell you about a tragic  and beautiful story relating to Julia and her late husband John.   Julia was born in New Mexico and raised in Australia. She has a  degree in veterinary science from the University of Queensland in  Australia. She came to Alaska in 1984 to get a Ph.D. in wildlife  biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Her focus was on  reindeer herd health and disease control.   She met John in 1985, and the two were married in Fairbanks in July,  1990. They were both in love with Alaska and with each other. It was  the love of a lifetime, Julia said.   Indeed, it was a great match. She was a veterinarian focusing on  reindeer. He was a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, working on polar bear research--the best wildlife biologist  job you could ever have, polar bear research in Alaska.   Then, unfortunately, tragedy struck. Three months after they were  married, on October 11, John and his colleague George Menkens, and  their pilot, Clifford Minch, got into a twin engine aero commander at  Deadhorse. They were headed north to do a low-altitude aerial survey of  female polar bears with cubs who prowl the ice hunting for food.   They were believed to have traveled as far as 250 miles northwest of  Barrow, now known as Utqiaqvik--the northernmost point of North  America. That is where people believe the plane they were traveling on  vanished. No one really knows where.   The search, at least initially, was extensive. In the first few days,  members of the U.S. Coast Guard flew C-130s, as well as civilians in  their aircraft, and spanned the area, flying hundreds of thousands of  square miles looking for any signs of the aircraft. After a week, they  decided the search was over. Julia was desperate. She knew that her  late husband and the two others had 2 weeks of provisions and adequate  survival gear. What if they had survived? What if they were on an  icefloe? What if they were still out there and the searchers happened  to miss them in that huge expanse?   This idea was overwhelming to her. She called everyone she knew to  help in keeping the search going. And eventually, like so many Alaskans  did, she called the late great Senator Ted Stevens, who--as he was  known to do--got to work for his fellow Alaskan.   ``He did an amazing thing,'' Julia said. He arranged for the  Canadians to send a military radar plane that could detect metal above  sea ice--anything bigger than a 4-foot square. The plane could cover an  area the size of Manitoba in 1 night. So they did it.   It was that search that finally gave Julia peace of mind. She said:  After the military plane came and left, I felt like we had done  everything we could have possibly done to find my husband. I knew my  husband was gone, and there was a peace of mind going forward   Senator Ted Stevens gave me a life, she said. He gave me a life free  from self-recrimination and free of doubt.   She also credits Senator Stevens for giving her enough peace to work  to honor her husband's memory in a way that was unique to him. She took  the proceeds she received from the insurance, and she began the bear  foundation. It started off small in 1993. The first year it was up and  running, the foundation gave away $5,000 in grant money. That money,  which was invested well, began to grow and so did the amount of the  grants awarded.   One year, the foundation was able to give out $50,000 in grant money.  The average size of individual grants is now $8,000. All told, they are  able to give about $100,000 a year, including donations that they get  from individuals and organizations.   It is not just about the money that has grown, so has the prestige of  this foundation. The IBA now has 550 members from over 60 countries.  Because of Julia Bevins, in Homer, AK, all across the globe,  researchers are working with other biologists. They are tracking bears.  They are assisting in management of these great animals. They are  writing papers and sharing information. They are doing what they love  for the ecosystem. Julia said:         When people love bears, they love them with their whole       heart and soul. It's a very profound thing.    Julia talked about how the IBA funded a researcher to search for a  rumored small brown bear--the Gobi bear--in Mongolia, the only bear to  exist in this extreme desert habitat. There had been sightings  throughout the year, but no scientist had ever been able to prove its  existence.   The IBA funded a scientist, Harry Reynolds--an Alaska from  Fairbanks--to travel through Mongolia and find the Gobi bear. And he  found them. Now the Mongolian Government is committed to its  protection.   Scientists funded by the IBA worked with other scientists in Iran to  document not only bears, but they were able to find 16 new wildlife  species. From the dangerous border between India and Pakistan to the  equally dangerous forests of Colombia, bear researchers, helped with  IBA money, are working with local citizens and governments and other  scientists, forming true alliances to help save bears.   Science ties the world together, Julia said. When you have a  collective of  [[Page S5252]]  like-minded people working for a common goal, all things are possible.   When you have someone with a mission like Julia Bevins, all things  are possible too.   Thank you to Julia for your commitment to this great cause, for your  work in helping keep John's memory alive, and for your amazing work on  bears in Alaska and bears in the world. Congratulations on being our  Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.
