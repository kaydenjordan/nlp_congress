Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on an  issue that I care deeply about: protecting the unborn and defending  life. This week, I reintroduced the Life at Conception Act.   I am honored to be the lead sponsor of the Life at Conception Act,  which simply defines human life as beginning at the moment of  conception. As a result, unborn babies are entitled to legal protection  under the Constitution. We had a record number of original cosponsors  this past Congress, and I pray this bill will pass Congress swiftly.   I believe that we have a moral obligation to protect the unborn at  every stage of development. It is something I have always been  passionate about. I was president of my college's pro-life group, the  Dartmouth Coalition for Life. I can still remember the conversations I  had with my fellow students as I discussed the value of human life with  them. It was a great feeling to know that I was opening eyes to the  value of all human life one student at a time.   Protecting life is one of the issues that compelled me to run for  office. When I first asked for the opportunity to serve you as your  representative in Congress, I promised I would be a strong defender of  the unborn. I am proud to say I have delivered on that promise.   The Life at Conception Act is a crucial part of the long-term battle  to protect the unborn. It started 44 years ago to the week, in 1973 in  the Roe v. Wade decision when the Supreme Court asserted that, because  the beginning of life is not legally defined by Congress, it is up for  interpretation by the court. The Life at Conception Act simply fills  that gap and defines that human life begins at the moment of  conception.   Even Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat, recently restated publicly  his belief that human life begins at conception. There is bipartisan  agreement on this issue. It is important for Congress to define human  life because the unborn are the most helpless among us. They need us to  have enough courage to step up and protect them.   My bill also sets a standard for promoting and encouraging a culture  of life. If enacted, it would simply affirm what we all know in our  hearts and minds to be true: that unborn babies deserve our protection.   Last year, the Life at Conception Act had 146 cosponsors in the U.S.  House of Representatives, including my two colleagues in West Virginia,  David McKinley and Evan Jenkins. I hope that more Representatives will  join me in promoting respect and protection for all human life.   I continue to be guided by my faith and values. I look forward to  working with my colleagues to defend the innocent and give voice to the  voiceless. I welcome the marchers this week coming for the annual March  for Life. I thank them for their participation in defending the unborn.                            ____________________     The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) for 5 minutes.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the  New England Patriots on reaching their NFL record ninth Super Bowl. The  very questionable suspension of Tom Brady early in the season could not  stop New England or the determination and dedication to excellence that  defines the New England Patriots.   Fans throughout New Hampshire and beyond are incredibly proud of  their team and the unparalleled success of Tom Brady and Bill  Belichick. But they would be the first to tell you that the success of  the Patriots lies with not one individual but instead is built upon the  core value of team before self. This year, the motto made famous by New  England, ``Do Your Job,'' is as true as ever.   When the Patriots face the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, I will  be joined by everyone across New Hampshire and throughout New England  in offering them good luck. Go Pats.                            ____________________     Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the  Chair declares the House in recess until noon today.   Accordingly (at 10 o'clock and 40 minutes a.m.), the House stood in  recess.                            ____________________     Without objection, the resignation is  accepted.   There was no objection.                            ____________________
