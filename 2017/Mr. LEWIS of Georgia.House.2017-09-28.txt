 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  this bill. For many years, I have been a proud member to serve on the  Ways and Means Committee, the oldest committee in the U.S. Congress.  Our committee has a responsibility to put people before politics. We  have a commitment to act in the best interest of all, not just a select  few. Most importantly, we have a duty to protect and preserve the  United States Constitution.   Today, Mr. Speaker, it hurts my soul that our committee will pass a  bill that attacks the constitutional principle that you are innocent  until proven guilty.   Where is the reason? Where is the compassion? What is the purpose?  How can you gamble with the livelihood of those who are most in need?  How can we punish the sick, the disabled, and the elderly? How can we  pass a bill that targets Latinos, African Americans, and Native  Americans? Mr. Speaker, how can you rob Peter to pay Paul?   Mr. Speaker, I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on this mean and spiteful bill. It should never have seen the  light of day. The American people deserve better, much better. We can  do better. This bill should not be on the floor of the House. It is not  worthy of the paper that it is written on.
