 Mr. President, I would like to submit this statement  for the record regarding the impeachment trial of former President  Donald Trump. The statement reflects my thoughts on this complicated  constitutional matter and its implications for future impeachments.   In 1787, the Articles of Confederation were failing, and our young  Nation was struggling to address the many challenges it was being  confronted with in its infancy. A collection of independent States, the  newly formed country experienced much difficulty with the regulation of  trade and commerce, foreign affairs, and other basic domestic civil  issues. With calls for disunion multiplying, delegates to the  Constitutional Convention met to deliberate and forge a new government  and with it an Executive to help centralize the powers necessary to  form a strong republic. Having just shed the bonds of the British  Monarchy and its infringements upon the liberties the delegates so  desperately wanted to protect, there was much skepticism toward this  idea. In order to abate these concerns, the Constitution's Framers  provided for a means of removing an Executive, a Presidential  impeachment.   After much debate over particular wording, article II, section 4 of  the Constitution adopted by the delegates reads: ``The President, Vice  President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed  from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or  other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''   This is the fundamental impeachment provision contained in the  Constitution and provides the primary evidence as to why the lone  Article passed out of the House as well as the subsequent trial in the  Senate, was unconstitutional. As this section shows, impeachment refers  to ``the President'' and other officials, and it provides that that  they shall be ``removed from Office.'' Donald J. Trump is no longer the  President of the United States and therefore can no longer be removed  from office. He is a private citizen.   Further evidence that Donald Trump is no longer the President and  therefore that this trial is unconstitutional can be found within the  Senate's impeachment authority: Article 1, section 3 provides that  ``When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice  shall preside.'' Chief Justice John Roberts did not preside over the  impeachment trial, and instead that role was filled by the senior  Senator from Vermont, Patrick Leahy. In a statement, Senator Leahy  himself stated that the President pro tempore of the Senate ``has  historically presided over Senate impeachment trials of non- presidents.'' These facts demonstrate that Chief Justice Roberts  declined to preside over the trial because he did not believe that he  had a constitutional role and that Senator Leahy acknowledged that  Donald Trump was no longer an officeholder. Finally, article 1, section  3 provides, ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further  than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any  Office of honor.'' This reiterates that removal from office must occur  before that person is disqualified from holding an office again. If the  Founders had intended that disqualification be a separate judgment,  then the Constitution would have clearly stated ``or'' rather than  ``and.'' The Constitution does not give the Senate the authority to try  a private citizen or to remove him from an office that he no longer  occupies.   It also does not give the Senate the authority to disqualify him from  an office that he was not removed from.   I voted to acquit former President Donald Trump of the charge of  inciting  [[Page S950]]  an insurrection for the January 6 Capitol riot because of these basic  concerns surrounding the constitutionality of the proceeding. The  impeachment of a private citizen, driven by political obsession, sets a  very dangerous precedent. What would prevent a Republican-controlled  Congress from impeaching former President Barack Obama or Secretary of  State Hillary Clinton? What about historical Presidents such as George  Washington, whose pivotal legacy no longer appears to meet the moral  standards of contemporary times? While the political retaliation  against the President is certain to continue now that he is out of  office, I am proud to have been a part of the minority in the Senate to  stand up to this type of unconstitutional behavior and to acquit Donald  Trump.                            ____________________
