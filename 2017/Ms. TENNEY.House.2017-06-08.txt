 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Hensarling for this important  bill. I rise today in support of H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act.   As a single parent and small-business owner, I know from my own  experience that the only way for hardworking Americans to achieve  financial independence is by building an economy from Main Street up,  not Wall Street down.   The CHOICE Act not only imposes the toughest penalties in history for  financial fraud on Wall Street, it saves taxpayers $30 billion. The  CHOICE Act also eliminates taxpayer-funded bailouts while providing  choices for consumers and a real opportunity for economic growth.   As an upstate New Yorker, our region suffers from economic challenges  caused by excessive regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, that have  crushed small businesses. Yet small businesses create nearly 70 percent  of the new jobs. This bill will increase access to capital for small  businesses and startups--our job creators. It will increase job  opportunities and positively benefit New York's 22nd District.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote to support our job  creators and to vote for the Financial CHOICE Act.
