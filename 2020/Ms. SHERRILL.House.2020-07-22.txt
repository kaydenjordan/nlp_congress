 Mr. Speaker, New Jersey might be the Garden State, but  it is also the most densely populated State in this country. So, New  Jerseyans know the importance of clean air, clean drinking water, and  protecting our natural resources. That is why I am proud to lead the  Great American Outdoors Act with my colleagues.   Grant funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped  protect sites in my district and helped expand conservation efforts  from the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge to Morristown National  Historical Park. The Great American Outdoors Act will make the Land and  Water Conservation Fund permanent, ensuring that future generations of  Americans are able to access our natural wonders.   For too long, LWCF's promise of protecting our Nation's public lands  has been broken as the funds have been diverted. The GAOA would, for  the first time, mandate that such funds are used as intended to protect  public lands and waters, support public access, and provide an economic  boost to communities.   I am so glad Congress has stepped up to expand equitable access to  the outdoors by investing in our parks and public lands at all levels.
