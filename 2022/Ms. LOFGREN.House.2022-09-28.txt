 Mr. Speaker, today, I reluctantly rise in opposition to  this rule and will vote ``no.''   I am a supporter of all three bills covered by this rule as they were  originally introduced. I am even the cosponsor of Representative  Neguse's bill to increase filing fees. However, very unfortunately,  this rule advances a modified version of that bill. It tacks on  provisions from Representative Buck's antitrust enforcement venue bill,  and these antitrust venue provisions are unwise public policy.   I vocally opposed them during the Committee on the Judiciary markup  and have dutifully kept my leadership apprised of my opposition to them  since that time.   Despite proponents trying to sell these venue provisions as  noncontroversial, I am far from the only Member with concerns.   Furthermore, in a highly unusual move, the Administrative Office of  the U.S. Courts wrote to Congress outlining their serious concerns with  these venue policy provisions. Opposition also comes in letters from  the Progressive Policy Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   Proponents argue that State attorneys general are in favor. Well, I  understand it was sold to them as a noncontroversial provision. Of  course, they would be in favor. It makes life easier for them. It  doesn't address the very serious issues outlined by the Administrative  Office of the Courts, and it doesn't make this good, wise policy.   So, very reluctantly, I will vote ``no.'' I would gladly support  today's rule if these venue provisions were not tacked onto the other  good bills.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letters from the  Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the Progressive  Policy Institute, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.                                            Administrative Office of                                        The United States Courts,                                      Washington, DC, July 19, 2021.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Leader: I write regarding H.R. 3460, the ``State       Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act of 2021,'' which was ordered       reported as amended by the Committee on the Judiciary on June       24, 2021. Neither the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict       Litigation (``Panel'') nor any of the relevant committees of       the Judicial Conference of the United States (``Conference'')       have had the opportunity to analyze this bill thoroughly.       Considering its potential impact on the federal Judiciary and       the efficient administration of justice, I offer for your       consideration the following initial observations. These       comments are neither expressions of support for, nor       opposition to the bill. Nevertheless, I hope they are helpful       and note that pending a more in-depth analysis, by both the       Panel and the relevant Conference committees, additional       comments may be submitted.                                  Background         Section 1407 was enacted in 1968, in the wake of a large       multidistrict antitrust litigation involving alleged       conspiracies to divide businesses and fix prices in multiple       product lines of electrical equipment. That litigation       encompassed more than a thousand actions in numerous federal       judicial districts brought, in large part, by public       utilities against virtually every manufacturer of electrical       equipment. The sudden influx of civil antitrust actions led       to the creation of ad hoc procedures to coordinate the       litigation before a smaller number of judges to eliminate       duplicative discovery and pretrial proceedings.        Section 1407 was intended to serve as a permanent solution       to the problem that large multidistrict litigations pose to       the federal Judiciary's ability to administer its civil       docket efficiently and justly. The statute created a panel of       seven circuit and district judges, no two of whom shall be       from the same circuit, which is authorized to transfer civil       actions involving one or more common questions of fact and       pending in different districts to a single district for       coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. See 28       U.S.C. Sec. 1407(a). To distinguish from other forms of       transfer and consolidation, transfer for coordinated or       consolidated pretrial proceedings under Section 1407 is       referred to as ``centralization.'' The Panel may transfer       actions for centralized pretrial proceedings only if it       determines that transfer will be for the convenience of the       parties and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient       conduct of such actions. Id. Civil actions transferred to       multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceedings are remanded by       the Panel at the conclusion of pretrial proceedings to their       transferor districts (i.e., trial is conducted in the       district of original filing), unless the actions were       terminated during the course of pretrial proceedings. Id.        Over the past fifty years, MDLs have encompassed a wide       variety of civil litigation in the federal courts, but       antitrust litigations have always constituted a core category       of cases subject to centralization. Section 1407 contains one       exception with respect to antitrust MDLs--enforcement actions       by the United States arising under the federal antitrust laws       are not subject to transfer under Section 1407. See 28 U.S.C.       Sec. 1407(g). Congress has amended Section 1407 only once. As       part of the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of       1976, Congress added subsection (h), which authorizes the       Panel to consolidate and transfer any action brought under 15       U.S.C. Sec. 15c (i.e., State parens patriae actions) for both       pretrial purposes and trial. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1407(h).                                   Concerns         H.R. 3460 would amend 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1407 to limit the       Panel's ability to centralize civil actions brought by States       under the antitrust laws of the United States and delete the       subsection added by the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust       Improvements Act of 1976. Congress to date has never amended       Section 1407 to restrict the Panel's ability to centralize       civil actions. Doing so in this instance raises several       concerns that merit Congress's consideration.      H.R. 3460 May Negatively Impact the Efficiency and Conduct of           Antitrust MDLs        Restricting the Panel's ability to centralize State       antitrust actions could negatively impact the efficiency and       conduct of  [[Page H8173]]       antitrust MDLs. When the Panel centralizes actions under       Section 1407, it considers whether centralization will       enhance convenience and efficiency with respect to the       parties, witnesses, and the federal Judiciary as a whole--the       Panel does not limit its consideration to the impact on any       one party in isolation. In general, MDL litigation is most       efficient when all related actions are centralized before a       single judge. Doing so minimizes the potential for       duplicative discovery and motion practice, eliminates the       potential for inconsistent pretrial schedules or rulings, and       conserves the resources of the parties, counsel, and the       Judiciary. To the extent there are actions with different       legal issues or concerns, the MDL judge can formulate a       pretrial program that allows pretrial proceedings with       respect to any non-common issues to proceed concurrently with       pretrial proceedings on common issues (for example, by       creating a separate discovery or motion track for certain       actions). This ensures that pretrial proceedings will be       conducted in a streamlined manner leading to a just and       expeditious resolution of all actions to the overall benefit       of the parties.        Excepting State antitrust actions from centralization can       only increase the number of actions (and, hence, the number       of independent parties and courts) outside the ambit of the       MDL. Related actions that cannot be centralized can introduce       case management difficulties into the MDL. Parties and courts       in actions pending outside the MDL may (either actively or       inadvertently) undermine attempts to coordinate and       streamline discovery and pretrial practice in the litigation.       For instance, such actions may be subject to different       pretrial schedules, parties and witnesses might by subject to       duplicative discovery, and the courts might issue       inconsistent pretrial rulings pertaining to the same parties.       It also is possible that substantively inconsistent rulings       could issue--such as with respect to market definition or       which standard of review (per se or rule of reason) applies       to a given case. Given the nationwide scope of these       antitrust litigations, such inconsistent rulings may       complicate proceedings and sow confusion not only among the       courts and parties, but also in the marketplace.      H.R. 3460 May Result in Inefficient Judicial Administration           of Antitrust Litigation        Apart from the general impact on efficiency caused by       increasing the number of actions that cannot be centralized,       there could be particular inefficiencies created by excepting       State antitrust actions from centralization. States are, in       many ways, similar to private antitrust plaintiffs. For       instance, States may sue because they have suffered a direct       antitrust injury (e.g., if the State directly purchased a       product subject to an alleged price fixing conspiracy). Along       with their claims under the federal antitrust laws, States       may also include claims brought under state antitrust law for       ``indirect'' antitrust damages not permitted under federal       antitrust law. Both types of claims are substantially similar       to those presented by private plaintiffs asserting antitrust       injury as direct or indirect purchasers. As such, these type       of State antitrust claims will present factual and legal       issues that are similar or identical to those presented by       the claims of the private plaintiffs. These common claims       generally will be most efficiently litigated in a centralized       proceeding. Notably, similar claims by the United States for       civil damages due to injury to the government itself are not       excluded from centralization under Section 1407. See 28       U.S.C. Sec. 1407(g) (stating that the exemption for claims       brought by the United States as a complainant under the       antitrust laws ``shall not include section 4A of the Act of       October 15, 1914, as added July 7, 1955 (69 Stat. 282; 15       U.S.C. 15a)'').        In addition, States may bring federal antitrust claims on       behalf of their citizens who have suffered harm due to the       alleged anticompetitive conduct (parens patriae actions).       Those citizens may be class members in private antitrust       actions. Indeed, Section 4C of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.       Sec. 15c, imposes on State parens patriae actions notice and       opt out requirements akin to those for private class actions       under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Courts also are       statutorily obligated to exclude from any award in a parens       patriae action any amounts that duplicate awards in private       actions. See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 15c(a)(1). A single MDL judge       usually will be best positioned to coordinate state and       private litigations.      H.R. 3460 Could Adversely Affect the Interest of States        Excluding State antitrust actions from MDL proceedings       could adversely affect the interests of the States. While       States might gain greater autonomy with respect to their       individual actions, they would lose much of their ability to       participate in and influence the centralized proceedings.       Collaboration between private plaintiffs and State Attorneys       General also may be reduced, particularly if the States       retain outside counsel to prosecute their antitrust claims.       Such counsel may have attorneys' fees or other incentives       inconsistent with close coordination with the MDL. This could       result (absent coordination between the different courts) in       competing pretrial schedules and inconsistent orders that       complicate the management and adjudication of both the State       antitrust action and the MDL.      H.R. 3460 Could Undermine the Panel's Efforts to Enhance           Coordination with Federal Antitrust Litigation        Excluding State antitrust actions from centralization could       undermine the Panel's efforts to facilitate coordination and       cooperation between private antitrust litigation and       antitrust actions brought by the United States. Where there       is a federal enforcement action or investigation that cannot       be included in a given antitrust MDL, the Panel often will       centralize the MDL in the court where the federal antitrust       action or grand jury proceedings are pending to facilitate       any appropriate and necessary coordination with the private       actions. By multiplying the number of actions excluded from       centralization under Section 1407, the proposed legislation       might eliminate this alternative means of facilitating       coordination with respect to litigations involving both       federal and state antitrust actions.                                  Conclusion         Thank you for considering these comments. We request that       the Committees of the Judicial Conference and the Panel have       the opportunity to conduct more in-depth analysis of the       legislation before any further consideration by Congress.            Sincerely,                                               Roslynn R. Mauskopf,      Director.                                   ____                               Progressive Policy Institute (PPI)                                                 September 26, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, and Leader Hoyer:       State enforcement of antitrust law plays a key role in       protecting consumer welfare in the face of corporate       monopolies. However, the national nature of our economy means       that, in many cases, consumers across state lines are buying       the same products and services. H.R. 3460, the State       Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act, retreats from the national       nature of many markets by attempting to refocus antitrust law       on a state-by-state basis. It makes this shift by preventing       venue transfers for antitrust cases brought by state       attorneys general in favor of a system where states can bring       antitrust claims against companies with more control over the       venue in which these cases are carried out. A major change       such as this will have unforeseen consequences in a variety       of antitrust situations. It is for this and the following       reasons we urge you to oppose H.R. 3460, which is       incorporated in the House Rules Committee notice hearing for       the modified version of H.R. 3843, the Merger Filing Fee       Modernization Act.        A July 2021 letter from the Director of the Administrative       Office of the U.S. Courts explains the ways in which the bill       would reduce efficiency in the American judicial system. It       highlights that currently under 28 U.S. Code Sec. 1407       similar civil cases in different districts are consolidated       by the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, which       then transfers the case to a single district. This can be       requested by the defendant and the intent is to minimize       duplicative processes and prevent inconsistent rulings.        By discarding this means for centralization through the       passage of H.R. 3460, the processes through which states       approach antitrust cases is fundamentally changed. As is       pointed out by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,       efficiency is compromised, as courts will need to separately       engage in similar discovery and pretrial proceedings in       different venues, even in cases where it would conserve the       time of the court and taxpayer money to carry out in a single       district.        Additional concerns lie in the potential for politically       motivated judicial consequences associated with the bill. The       bill's elimination of the consolidation process for antitrust       cases brought under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 15c will give rise to a       reality where different states could simultaneously pursue       their own separate antitrust actions against the same       companies across various federal courts. As such, state       attorneys generals may harass companies that are politically       unpopular in a particular state or region.        Creating a fragmented and inefficient antitrust system is       not the optimal remedy for potential corporate antitrust       violations. We urge you to oppose H.R. 3460, the State       Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act, and avoid the unintended       consequences that may come with it.            Sincerely,        Progressive Policy Institute (PPI), Center for New       Liberalism (CNL), Computer & Communications Industry       Association (CCIA), Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce,       South Shore Chamber of Commerce, Council Bluffs Chamber of       Commerce, Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York, Florida State       Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.                                   ____                                           U.S. Chamber of Commerce,                                              Government Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 27, 2022.        To the Members of the House of Representatives: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce strongly opposes in its current form H.R.       3843, the ``Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022,''       because it would stymie legitimate business transactions       across sectors and industries, create needless new       bureaucracy, and spur unwarranted litigation. The  [[Page H8174]]       Chamber will consider including votes related to this       legislation in our ``How They Voted'' scorecard.        The egregious provisions of the bill include:        Venue. While no longer retroactive as it was in previous       drafts of the bill, the Multi District Litigation (MDL)       provisions could force firms into simultaneously defending       against private litigants, the federal government, and       various states in dozens of different courtrooms around the       country. The Administrative Office of the United States       Courts indicates that such legislation could harm MDL       participants more generally by harming judicial efficiency       and administration and hamper coordination of state and       federal enforcement actions with MDLs. Moreover, these       problems would be compounded when states employ private,       outside contingency fee attorneys to maximize profits through       litigation, rather than to protect consumers or competition.        Transparency and Fees. Only a handful of the thousands of       mergers filed each year present potential competition       concerns. Yet, the agencies have refused to meet the       statutory deadlines for process and accountability under the       Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act. Rather, regulators issue notice       letters to firms that essentially dare companies to close       mergers at the risk of future action. It is unacceptable to       engage in abusive procedural gimmicks. Congress should not       raise merger fees while the agencies are currently engaging       in process violations.        Foreign Subsidy Notification Provision. Despite efforts to       improve the subsidy notification provisions, they remain un-      administrable. The legislation provides no clear definition       as to what constitutes a subsidy, there is no definition as       to what qualifies as a ``country of concern,'' and the       disclosure of subsidies has zero bearing on merger review and       the merger standard under the law. Subsidies involved in how       a deal is financed are not a concern under the antitrust       laws, and concerns tied to subsidies the merging parties have       received will not result in the government successfully       blocking the merger as a remedy to predatory pricing       concerns.        The Chamber urges you to oppose this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                   Evan Jenkins,                                              Senior Vice President,                                          U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
