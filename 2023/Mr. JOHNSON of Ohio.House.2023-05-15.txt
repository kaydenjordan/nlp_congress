 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding  to me.   Service is something that is in my blood, and I can tell you that, as  I rise today in support of the men and women who wear the blue as we  recognize National Police Week, I don't think we can say enough about  their sacrifices.   All across America, police officers have an increasingly difficult  and thankless job today. They see, literally, the worst of humanity,  day in and day out, putting their lives on the line while serving to  protect all of us for very modest pay.   They head toward the danger. They run into it rather than away from  it. They are constantly put in unpredictable, chaotic, and threatening  positions in order to keep our communities safe.   Very few professions demand the willingness to sacrifice one's own  life in order to protect the safety and security of others, but that is  exactly what our men and women in blue willingly sign up to do.   Just last year, 224 police officers were killed in the line of duty.  Never, as I was growing up in this great country, did I think I would  see a number like that. They have been shot, stabbed, and run over by  the lawless.   Their murders don't receive nearly the media coverage that they  should. The whole Nation should be outraged by what we see.   To the men and women who wear the blue, on behalf of those I  represent, I thank them. I thank them for choosing to serve and to  protect. Importantly, I thank their families who sacrifice so much and  can never be sure if that pre-shift hug and kiss might very well be  their last.   God bless each and every man and woman in blue for what they do. I  thank them so much on behalf of a grateful Nation.
