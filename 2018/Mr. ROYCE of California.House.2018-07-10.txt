 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5626) to amend the Intercountry Adoption Act of  2000 to require the Secretary of State to report on intercountry  adoptions from countries which have significantly reduced adoption  rates involving immigration to the United States, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5626         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Intercountry Adoption       Information Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN ANNUAL                     REPORT ON INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTIONS.         (a) Report Elements.--Section 104(b) of the Intercountry       Adoption Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14914(b)) is amended by       adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(9) A list of countries that established or maintained a       law or policy that prevented or prohibited adoptions       involving immigration to the United States, regardless of       whether such adoptions occurred under the Convention.        ``(10) For each country listed under paragraph (9), the       date on which the law or policy was initially implemented.        ``(11) Information on efforts taken with respect to a       country listed under paragraph (9) to encourage the       resumption of halted or stalled adoption proceedings       involving immigration to the United States, regardless of       whether the adoptions would have occurred under the       Convention.        ``(12) Information on any action the Secretary carried out       that prevented, prohibited, or halted any adoptions involving       immigration to the United States, regardless of whether the       adoptions occurred under the Convention.''.        (b) Public Availability of Report.--Section 104 of the       Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14914) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(c) Public Availability of Report.--The Secretary shall       make the information contained in the report required under       subsection (a) available to the public on the website of the       Department of State.''.        (c) Privacy Concerns.--In complying with the amendments       made by subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary shall avoid,       to the maximum extent practicable, disclosing any personally       identifiable information relating to United States citizens       or the adoptees of such citizens.

(e) Application Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply with respect to reports required to be submitted       under section 104 of the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000       (42 U.S.C. 14914) beginning on the date that is 1 year after       the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this measure. It is the  Intercountry Adoption Information Act, H.R. 5626.   Here in Congress, I have been honored, as has my friend here, Doug  Collins, the author of this measure, to help bring families together  through overseas adoptions.                                time  1645    These children are deeply loved by American parents from all  different backgrounds who give them incredible care and give them  opportunity. Sadly, international adoptions do not always go as  planned.   Over the years, I have met with countless families who were matched  with a child, bonded with that child, financially supported that child,  only to have their child's adoption stalled or, worse, stopped  completely due to policy changes in the child's birth country.  Obviously, this is devastating, devastating to the child, devastating  to the families involved.   In September of 2013, President Joseph Kabila of Congo suspended exit  permits for more than 1,000 children already adopted by international  couples, mainly from the United States and France. These adoptions had  already been approved by the Congolese courts. The children had been  issued passports from their new countries. Parents had come to spend  time with those children, but without the exit visas from the Congolese  Government, they could not leave. The children could not leave.   Families were forced to spend thousands of dollars, travel across  oceans, and navigate foreign courts to fight to bring those adopted  children home. Making matters worse, many children had serious medical  issues. Tragically, I have to report to you that 25 died while stuck in  this bureaucratic chokehold. They were living in horrid conditions,  lacking the most basic care.   Thankfully, through a coordinated push by the previous administration  and Congress, hundreds of children in the DRC were freed to come home  to the United States. It took multiple trips to get the job done. I  personally traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to raise  these issues at the highest levels of the Congolese Government. Within  60 days afterward, more than 400 children were released to their  adoptive American families.   But still, many children remain at risk worldwide. We do not know  exactly how many children are waiting to be united with their families  in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Intercountry Adoption Information Act  introduced by our colleague from Georgia, Doug Collins, seeks to lessen  this problem by enhancing the information available to families who are  adopting.   Those families wish to adopt overseas, and they need to know. They  need to know the situation. This bill requires the State Department to  include in its existing annual report information on countries that  have enacted new laws or policies that would impact intercountry  adoptions.   This information would have been helpful, for example, when the Congo  and Ethiopia imposed sweeping new policies that put a hold on adoptions  for American families.   With the passage of this legislation, families could see not only how  many children are being adopted by American families from certain  countries and how long these adoption proceedings are taking, but if  the country has recently changed its laws or if policies have been  changed by a head of state that could make adoption more difficult or  shut it down completely.   Just as importantly, this legislation would also require that the  annual report include what positive steps the U.S. Government is taking  to reduce the burdens or barriers on stalled adoptions to unite  children with their families.   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the Intercountry  Adoption Information Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), who is the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me just thank my colleagues; the ranking  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Eliot Engel; as well as  Congressman Collins, the author of this bill; and two other Members who  worked hard on it, Congressman Kinzinger and Congressman Schneider.  They made improvements to the legislation during markup.   In closing, I urge my colleagues to support the Intercountry Adoption  Information Act. I think it is very important.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 644) strongly condemning the slave  auctions of migrants and refugees in Libya, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 644         Whereas Libya has become the primary transit hub for       migrants and refugees attempting to reach Southern Europe;        Whereas in December 2016, the United Nations Office of the       High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that many       migrants and refugees in Libya are forced to work without pay       as farm laborers, domestic workers, construction workers, and       rubbish collectors;        Whereas beginning in 2017, multiple news and international       organizations began reporting on the existence of slave       auctions of migrants and refugees in Libya;        Whereas the Department of State's Trafficking in Persons       Report 2017 for Libya stated that migrants held in detention       centers controlled by both Libya's Department to Combat       Irregular Migration (DCIM) and non-state armed groups are       subject to severe abuse, rampant sexual violence, forced       labor, and other human rights abuses;        Whereas on February 12, 2018, the United Nations Secretary-      General reported to the United Nations Security Council that       the humanitarian situation in Libya had recently deteriorated       further, and that ``Refugees and migrants continued to be       subjected to violence, forced labor, and other grave       violations and abuses.'';        Whereas the Presidency Council of the Government of       National Accord affirmed the depravity of slavery and human       trafficking and initiated an investigation into such acts       within Libya;        Whereas a September 2017, report from the United Nations       International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) determined       that unaccompanied children who crossed the Mediterranean       from Libya suffered enslavement, violence, and sexual abuse       at the hands of smugglers and traffickers;        Whereas in November 2017, a joint European Union-African       Union-United Nations Task Force was established to protect       migrants along migration routes to, from, and in Libya;        Whereas since December 2017, the International Organization       for Migration has facilitated the return of more than 15,000       migrants to their homes from Libya through a voluntary       humanitarian program, and the United Nations High       Commissioner for Refugees has evacuated more than 1,300       refugees from Libya as of March 2018;        Whereas the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya in 2011 led to       significant political turmoil and insecurity within the       country;        Whereas in December 2017, the Libyan Political Agreement       was reaffirmed as the internationally-supported framework for       creating a unified Libyan government;        Whereas, despite this agreement, the prolonged and       continuing absence of a unified Libyan government has       resulted in a power vacuum in which human trafficking and       smuggling have emerged as a lucrative trade and funds       obtained from the transfer, sale, and exploitation of       migrants are used to fund armed militias competing for       territory, influence, and control of institutions; and        Whereas the United States has repeatedly condemned slavery,       involuntary servitude, and other elements of trafficking as a       grave violation of human rights and a matter of pressing       international concern: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) strongly condemns slave auctions and the exploitation       of migrants and refugees as forced laborers in Libya;        (2) calls upon all parties to the conflict in Libya,       including parties to the Libyan Political Agreement, to--        (A) investigate and eradicate slave auctions and forced       labor involving migrants and refugees;        (B) hold those identified in the investigation accountable       in courts of law;        (C) manage migration flows and migrant detention centers in       a humane manner; and        (D) investigate how funds earned through the transfer,       sale, and exploitation of migrants are used and the extent to       which such profits are fueling and prolonging Libya's civil       conflict;        (3) calls upon the United Nations to--        (A) investigate allegations of the slave trade and other       forced labor in Libya;        (B) advocate that all parties to the conflict in Libya,       including parties to the Libyan Political Agreement, allow       the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to       regularly monitor and publicly report on the situation of all       refugees and migrants in Libya, including those in detention       centers; and        (C) expand sanctions under United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2174 (2014) against individuals and entities       responsible for slave auctions and forced labor of migrants       and refugees in Libya;        (4) calls upon the Secretary of State and the Administrator       of the United States Agency for International Development to       ensure that any strategies, programs, or other efforts to       address the political and security situation in Libya       appropriately address the vulnerabilities faced by migrants       and refugees; and        (5) urges the Secretary of State to ensure that the country       narrative for Libya in the annual Trafficking in Persons       Report fully and accurately reflects the scope of trafficking       in persons in that country, including any complicity by       parties to the Libyan Political Agreement or other       governmental entities, as required by section 110 of the       Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7107).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Congresswoman Bass, the ranking  member of our subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations. I thank her for authoring this  important resolution, because modern-day slavery continues to devastate  the lives of tens of millions of human beings around the world. The  perpetrators of these dastardly, disgusting acts prey on the  defenseless. They prey on those without power, including preying on  young children.                                time  1700    I think many of us have had an opportunity or a responsibility to  work with survivors of human trafficking in our districts. I can tell  you that one of the things that it taught me was the horror of  trafficking lies not in statistics; it lies in stolen lives.   These crimes are common for one reason: they are profitable and  people get away with it. The International Labor Organization estimates  that there is $150 billion in illegal profit made from forced labor  each year, making human trafficking the third most valuable criminal  enterprise on the planet and providing fuel to violent extremist  organizations.   Unfortunately, Libya has become a major center of human trafficking.  The country continues to be a fractured and failed state. There is no  government to control its territory. This vacuum, when combined with  Libya's proximity to Europe, has made Libya the primary transit hub for  migrants from sub-Saharan Africa attempting to reach Europe.   Various bad actors, including extremist groups, have taken advantage,  profiting from the unrest by mercilessly preying on migrants and  refugees from some of the poorest and most war-torn countries in the  world. News reports tell of people being forced to work without pay;  others have shown people being sold at slave auctions in Libya.   The resolution before us today rightfully condemns these dehumanizing  acts and calls on all parties in Libya to investigate these crimes and  to hold perpetrators accountable. It urges the United Nations to  investigate and to impose sanctions against those responsible for these  abuses, and it calls for greater access for the U.N. High Commissioner  for Human Rights to monitor and publicly report on refugees and  migrants in Libya.   Finally, the resolution calls on the administration to address these  issues in a strategy to tackle Libya's political and security  challenges, and to ensure  [[Page H6018]]  that the Department of State's annual Trafficking in Persons Report  fully reflects the situation in Libya.   The Government of National Accord in Tripoli has made some  encouraging steps toward investigating some of these crimes, but all  parties, nationally and internationally, must do more to stop this  exploitation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  resolution, which puts the House on record as standing against modern- day slavery and other forms of human trafficking in Libya.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   In closing, I thank the author of this measure. I thank  Representative Karen Bass for her work on this resolution. She is the  ranking member of our Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global  Human Rights, and International Organizations. I also thank Ranking  Member Engel for his work on this resolution.   The world was shocked by the videos of the slave auctions in Libya.  The videos are proof that slavery and human  [[Page H6019]]  trafficking exist, despite efforts to eradicate these evils. The  resolution before us now shines a light on this human trafficking in  Libya.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2259, the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act.   To serve in the United States Peace Corps is a worthy mission. The  Peace Corps promotes cultural understanding and creates strong ties  between volunteers and the communities they serve. I've often heard  foreign leaders, particularly in Africa, reflect upon their own  interactions with volunteers who taught English or helped establish a  fishery in their village. And I've seen many returned volunteers become  leaders in industry and government at home--including serving here in  Congress. This bill is named after one of them, former Representative  and returned Peace Corps volunteer Sam Farr.   But serving in the Peace Corps also involves risk. Volunteers are  expected to adapt to unfamiliar areas and customs. They may face  political instability or crime. And they are exposed to countless  infectious and tropical diseases, often without access to reliable  care. Too often, we hear stories of Peace Corps volunteers suffering  from debilitating illnesses that could have been prevented, falling  victim to sexual assault without justice, or even dying. This is why  the bill also is named for Nick Castle, a young Peace Corps volunteer  who died while serving in China from a completely treatable illness.   The bill before us today strengthens the transparency, accountability  and effectiveness of the Peace Corps by enacting a number of important  reforms. It requires disclosures that will enable aspiring volunteers  to better understand the risk they will face before they are deployed.  The Peace Corps is not for everyone.   This legislation provides assurances to volunteers that qualified  medical personnel will be accessible to them while serving overseas and  here at home, should they experience a service-related injury or  illness. And, importantly, it extends and expands upon a number of the  provisions previously included in the Kate Puzey Act, which provides  support to volunteers who have been victims of sexual assault.   Earlier this year, the Senate unanimously passed a similar version of  the legislation: We have been working closely with the House sponsors,  the administration, advocacy groups and our colleagues in the Senate to  ensure that this important legislation can be enacted without further  delay. I would like to thank the lead sponsor in the House, Judge Poe,  for his steadfast commitment throughout this process. I would also like  to acknowledge the important work of the Committees on Education and  the Workforce and Oversight and Government Reform, without whom we  could not consider this bill today.   I urge Members to support this bill.
