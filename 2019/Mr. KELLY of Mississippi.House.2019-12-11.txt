 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize  five 2019 Mississippi football State championship teams that hail from  my district.   In 1A, the Nanih Waiya Warriors defeated the Lumberton Panthers 28- to-14.   In 4A, the Corinth Warriors defeated the Poplarville Hornets 55-to- 21.   In 5A, the West Point Green Wave defeated the Neshoba Central Rockets  20-to-7.  [[Page H10020]]    In 6A, the Oxford Chargers defeated the Oak Grove Warriors 31-to-21.   Finally, in MAIS 5A, the Heritage Academy Patriots defeated the  Starkville Academy Volunteers 55-to-10.   There is nothing that brings Mississippi together more than Friday  night lights, and to have this many championship teams in the First  District is quite an honor.   I am proud of the young men who gave their all in the heat of August  two-a-days, the regular season and the playoffs, and, finally, at The  Rock in Hattiesburg to win a State championship.    I recognize the hard work and dedication of the bands, cheerleaders,  dance teams, and all the other participants who make football games  such an exciting Friday night community event in Mississippi.   I thank the parents who drove their children to and from practice and  spent every Friday night in the fall driving across the State of  Mississippi to watch their kids compete on the field.   Finally, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the teachers, school  administrators, and coaches who work every day to make sure that our  kids have a bright future on the field and in the classroom.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1790, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.   I wish to thank Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Thornberry, Chairman  Inhofe, and Ranking Member Reed for their leadership throughout the  conferencing of this bill.   I also want to thank the Military Personnel Subcommittee chairwoman,  Jackie Speier, for her hard work and leadership.   The strength of our military is our servicemembers, and the strength  of our servicemembers is our military families. This bill contains a  number of significant policy and funding initiatives that affirm our  commitment to our troops and their families.   To that end, this bill supports a 3.1 percent military pay raise,  extends crucial pay and bonuses for servicemembers in high-demand  fields, and eliminates the widow's tax.   I want to specifically thank Representative   Joe Wilson for his  years of tireless work and leadership to make this a reality. Make no  mistake, this is all because of   Joe Wilson's initiative.   This bill also preserves military healthcare by preventing the  services from making cuts to healthcare billets before providing  additional analysis on the impact those cuts will have on our military  health system.   It improves accessibility and effectiveness of mental healthcare by  requiring DOD to update and standardize procedures related to mental  health treatment and substance abuse referrals.   Importantly, this bill strengthens our Reserve component by expanding  eligibility for TRICARE Reserve Select.   This bill also expands support for military spouses by doubling the  reimbursement amount spouses can receive for professional licensing and  expanding eligibility for educational assistance.   Finally, the bill includes provisions designed to improve military  childcare, including expanded direct hiring authority for child  development centers and requiring a comprehensive assessment of  childcare capacity on military installations.   In addition to critical military personnel provisions, this bill  contains many initiatives that are important to my home State of  Mississippi.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my fellow conferrees for their  contributions to this truly bipartisan conference report, and I  strongly urge my colleagues to support its passage.
