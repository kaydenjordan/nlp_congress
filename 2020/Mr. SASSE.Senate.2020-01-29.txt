 I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself, Tim  Scott, and Marco Rubio.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Sasse and also on behalf of Senator Scott  from South Carolina and Mr. Rubio, directed to counsel for the  President:         Mr. Cipollone pointed Senators to the ``golden rule of       impeachment.'' In elaborating on that rule, can you offer       your views on the limiting principles--both in the nature of       offenses that should be considered and in the proximity to       elections--for future impeachments, toward the end of       safeguarding public trust by putting guardrails on both       parties?    Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the  Senate.   In elaborating on the golden rule of impeachment, I would say  principle No. 1, if we listen to what the Democratic Senators said in  the past and the House managers and other Members of the House, that  should guide us, and that principle is--and it is a principle based on  precedent that you shouldn't have a partisan impeachment.   If you have a partisan impeachment, that, in and of itself, is a  dangerous thing because that means that there is not the bipartisan  support that even the Speaker of the House has said you would need to  even begin to consider the impeachment of a President because it is the  overturning of an election. They don't dispute that it is the  overturning of an election.   In addition, it is the removal of this President from an election  that is occurring just months from now, which I think is another  important principle.   I think the other important fact here is that there is actually  bipartisan opposition to this impeachment. Democrats voted against it  in the House of Representatives. That is an important principle.   The other principle would be that if you have a process that is  unprecedented--if you have a process that is unprecedented--that should  be something that ought to be considered. Always in the past there has  been a vote authorizing an impeachment. Why? Because they say the House  is the sole authority of impeachment--but that is the House, not the  Speaker of the House at a press conference. That is another important  consideration.   Another important consideration is all of the historical precedents  related to rights given to a President in a process have been violated.  We haven't seen anything like that in our history. The President's  counsel wasn't able to attend, wasn't allowed to cross-examine  witnesses, wasn't allowed to call witnesses; and they are coming here  and basically asking you, No. 1, to call witnesses that they had  refused to pursue, but, more importantly, I think what they are saying  is, do what they did--only call witnesses that they want. Don't allow  the President to call witnesses that the President wants. That doesn't  work. That is not due process.   The other important principle there is, we hear a lot about fairness,  but in the American justice system fairness is about fairness to the  accused. Fairness is about fairness to the accused. So how can you  suggest that what we are going to do is, we are going to have a trial.  We will get the witnesses and prosecutors that we want, even though you  got to call no witnesses in the House. You got to cross-examine none of  the witnesses that we called, and have we got a deal for you: Let's  call another witness, but you call none. That is another principle.   And I think the reality is that what Professor Dershowitz said is  true. I think, when you are thinking about impeachment, as much as we  can as human beings, we should think about it in terms of a President  is a President regardless of party, and how would we treat a President  of our own party in similar circumstances? I think that is the golden  rule of impeachment.   I don't think we have to guess here because I think we have lots of  statements from Democrats when we were here last time around and  principles. As I said, I agree with them, I agree with those  principles. I just ask that they be applied here.   That is my answer. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Illinois.
