 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 577, I call up the bill (H.R. 2203) to increase  transparency, accountability, and community engagement within the  Department of Homeland Security, provide independent oversight of  border security activities, improve training for agents and officers of  U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2203, the Homeland Security Improvement Act, as  amended, seeks to enhance accountability for how the Department of  Homeland Security carries out its border security and immigration  enforcement activities.   For years, the complaints process at DHS has been fragmented. While  the inspector general of DHS reviews allegations of unlawful activity  by Department personnel, other complaints must go through Customs and  Border Protection or Immigration and Customs Enforcement first.   Further, the process for filing a complaint can be complicated and  confusing. Additionally, there is no central mechanism for residents of  border communities to speak out about how DHS' operations affect their  day-to-day lives or the environment around them.   H.R. 2203, as we are considering it today, would establish a new  ombudsman to carry out an independent, neutral, and confidential  process to help resolve complaints with respect to the Department's  border and immigration enforcement activities. The ombudsman would also  note patterns in the types of complaints received to identify any  systemic issues.   The communities most directly impacted by DHS' border and immigration  enforcement activities are those that are on our borders with Mexico  and Canada.   Under H.R. 2203, the ombudsman would appoint border community  liaisons to serve in sectors along the northern and southern borders to  foster better communication and meaningful engagement with these  communities.   The ombudsman is also required to stand up a border oversight panel  to make recommendations on border and immigration policies and programs  with attention to DHS activities that affect due process, property  rights, and the safety of migrants and officers.   H.R. 2203 is also intended to ensure greater oversight of the  training that frontline personnel receive. Specifically, the ombudsman  would annually evaluate the CBP and ICE agents and officers training,  particularly on standards for professional and ethical conduct, and  make recommendations on any needed improvements.   Additionally, the bill directs the ombudsman to develop an  implementation plan to require the use of body-worn cameras by Border  Patrol agents and ICE officers while engaged in border security or  immigration enforcement activities.   While the current administration's activities in this area warrant  heightened scrutiny, several issues, such as conditions in ICE  detention or insufficient consultation with property owners by U.S.  Border Patrol, have persisted for years.   H.R. 2203 represents a step in the right direction to bring greater  transparency and accountability to DHS. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation.

House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, July 18, 2019.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you that the Committee       on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to review the       provisions in H.R. 2203, the ``Homeland Security Improvement       Act'' that fall with our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate       your consulting with us on those provisions. The Judiciary       Committee has no objection to your including them in the bill       for consideration on the House floor, and to expedite that       consideration is willing to waive sequential referral, with       the understanding that we do not thereby waive any future       jurisdictional claim over those provisions or their subject       matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                       Washington, DC July 18, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2203, the ``Homeland Security Improvement Act.'' The       Committee on Homeland Security recognizes that the Committee       on the Judiciary has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 2203,       and I appreciate your effort to allow this bill to be       considered on the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on the Judiciary with       respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future, and I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House--Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 2203 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                 Washington, DC, September 25, 2019.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: In order to expedite consideration       of H.R. 2203, the Homeland Security Improvement Act, the       Committee on Ways and Means has agreed to waive formal       consideration of provisions that fall within the rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee. We do so with the       understanding that the authority given to the Ombudsmen in       Title II of the bill, relating to the enforcement activities       of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, does not include       authority to enforce trade laws. The Committee also reserves       the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding and would ask that a copy of our exchange       of letter on this matter be included in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of H.R. 2203.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                 Washington, DC, September 25, 2019.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2203, the ``Homeland Security Improvement Act.'' The       Committee on Homeland Security recognizes that the Committee       on Ways and Means has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 2203,       and I appreciate your effort to allow this bill to be       considered on the House floor.        I concur with you that the authority given to the Ombudsman       in Title II of the bill is not intended to include authority       regarding trade law enforcement complaints. Should you choose       to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to       any House--Senate conference involving this legislation, I       would support that effort.        I will include our letters on H.R. 2203 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Escobar) an additional 1 minute.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration's cruel and inhumane approach  to border and immigration enforcement has subjected DHS' frontline  personnel and border communities to chaotic conditions. It has also  hurt families and children.   From the Remain in Mexico policy that puts children and families in  harm's way indefinitely to family separation to metering, the Trump  administration has haphazardly reshaped how people who seek safety in  the U.S. are treated. It is essential that there be greater  transparency and accountability regarding what DHS is doing along the  border. More remains to be done, but H.R. 2203 includes several first  steps.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
