 Mr. President, I reserve the right to object, and I  rise to object to this unanimous consent request.   The VA, for years, has made promises that they have year after year  failed to meet. For years, veterans and their family members have  called my office, whether I was in the State senate or over in the  House or here in the Senate. They are distressed by the lack of service  they receive from the VA. My caseworkers would work tirelessly with  these constituents, only to end up frustrated by a very unresponsive  VA. This is unacceptable. It has become the culture of the VA, and this  is something that has to change.   Now, for weeks, the committee has been asking for feedback on  legislative proposals which have the potential to affect the workflow  and the capacity of the VA. The VA has been silent on this even though  we have asked for their views and have asked them to weigh in. The  reason we have asked them for this is the VA has a backlog of over  180,000 cases. Their wait times this year have continued to escalate.  They are not going down.   So, yesterday, I had a call with Secretary McDonough expressing my  concerns with the lack of feedback that the committee has received on  what is shaping up to be the most consequential legislative effort in  the veterans space in an entire generation. The formal response that I  received today was incomplete, but it contained a promise that they  would have more fulsome feedback by July 30.   I will continue to keep my hold on these pending VA nominees until I  receive the official views on the COST of War Act, on the toxic  exposures bills. We owe our veterans. We owe it to them to get this  right. Therefore, I object to the unanimous consent request, and I will  continue my hold on these nominees.    I object.    Mr. President, you know, it is truly an honor to work  with the veterans in Tennessee, and we have hundreds of thousands of  veterans in our State.   I know that the chairman says he prides himself in working with the  veterans. I will tell you, quite frankly, I consider it a humbling  experience to work with these veterans. Whether they are from World War  II or Korea or Vietnam or whether they are from any of our recent  wars--the Mideast--whether we are dealing with Agent Orange or burn  pits, to me it is heart-wrenching to hear their stories.   And the VA has not done their job. So what we are doing is standing  up for these veterans and saying to the VA: Get your act together.  Provide this information. How do you deal with this backlog? Do you  have the capability to deal with what we are discussing? Do you have  that capability? What is your capacity? How do we best handle these  issues?   The VA, for years--decades, decades, decades--has not done their job  in a timely manner, in a responsive manner to our Nation's veterans.  Therefore, let's say: Let's get this right. Let's get it right.   Excuse me. There is a fly in this Chamber.   Let's get it right now.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week's conversations about our  own government's role in the COVID coverup reflected over a year of  refusal on the part of my Democratic colleagues to accept that the  novel coronavirus may not have spread via natural transmission from a  Chinese wildlife wet market.   As the theories of the pandemic's origins evolved, one remained,  until very recently, off limits. This is, of course, the lab leak  hypothesis, or the theory that the virus somehow escaped from a lab in  Wuhan, China.   Now, this theory didn't come out of nowhere. In early January 2020,  alarm bells were already ringing at the CDC, the State Department, and  in the scientific community over problems with the natural origin  theory of transmission.   Virologists and other public health officials studying the disease  were quickly coming to the conclusion that the way the virus was  spreading suggested that this theory was flawed. Officials also knew  that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was conducting controversial and  dangerous ``gain of function'' research with the help of repackaged  U.S. Government grants.   Yes, that is correct.   In April of last year, I joined many of my colleagues in publicly  demanding a thorough investigation into the lab leak theory. What  followed was nothing less than moral panic. Activists, journalists, and  even our own Democratic colleagues accused us of racism, xenophobia,  and science denial.   Major media organizations refused to report on the hypothesis, except  to decry it as a racist attack on Chinese scientists. Facebook banned  accounts that posted about it. YouTube deleted videos that dared  contradict the World Health Organization.   Rather than scaring us off, though, these attacks left us with  another question to answer: Why did the very idea of investigating the  Wuhan lab inspire such a bizarre panic? Or, perhaps, the better  question is, Why did NIAID Director Dr. Fauci and the rest of the  powers that be publicly insist that the idea of a lab leak was  completely preposterous?   Even NIH Director Francis Collins hadn't ruled it out. In a March  2020 interview with the Atlantic, he said that while natural  transmission was the likely culprit, ``the possibility that such a  naturally evolved virus might have also been under study at the Wuhan  Institute of Virology and reached residents of Wuhan--and ultimately  the rest of the world--as the result of a lab accident has never been  adequately excluded.''   We certainly have evidence to show that mistakes happen, even in a  professional lab. Who could forget that back in 2015, we saw reports  that personnel at a military facility in Utah accidentally shipped  active samples of anthrax to labs in nine States--yes, a 2015 lab  accident.   NIH has also had problems keeping track of things. According to a  memo prepared in 2016 by a minority staff of the House Energy and  Commerce Committee, a 2009 Department of Health and Human Services OIG  audit found an inventory discrepancy at the NIH caused in part by  mislabeled envelopes containing unregistered vials of plague and other  antibiotic-resistant bacteria.   In 2012, NIH researchers found vials of anthrax spores in the wrong  place. What is worse, the scientists in that particular lab weren't  registered to possess them.   In 2014, an FDA researcher working at the NIH campus in Bethesda  discovered vials of live smallpox virus stuffed in a cardboard box in  an unsecured cold storage room.   Mistakes were clearly made. Lab accidents happen. It is also clear  that while a leak from the Wuhan lab could have happened due to human  error, this coverup we are now learning about certainly did not happen  by error.   We now have an emerging picture of what did happen behind the scenes  to create so much resistance to the lab leak theory.   On June 3 of this year, that bastion of rightwing insanity known as  Vanity Fair magazine published an investigative report exposing the  deranged political gamesmanship that prompted public health officials  to paint the lab leak theory as a conspiracy.   The report confirmed just about everything those officials wanted to  keep hidden--namely, that the lab leak hypothesis was suppressed at  multiple levels of government by officials looking to protect their own  interests and to distance themselves from President Donald Trump--so  much for following the science. They were following emotions.   The report confirmed conflicts of interest concerning grant awards  that supported gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of  Virology. The same people who knew that Chinese scientists were  performing these dangerous experiments on the taxpayer dime also knew  from verified intelligence reports that three Wuhan-based researchers  fell ill with COVID-like symptoms in November 2019, well before the  first reported outbreak. Still,  [[Page S4536]]  State Department officials warned investigators to abandon their  inquiries into the origins of COVID-19 because it would ``open a can of  worms.''   The internal coverups bled into this year until, finally, 5 days  before President Biden took the oath of office, the State Department  put out a fact sheet on the Wuhan lab that confirmed the November  outbreak and revealed that scientists working there had collaborated  with the Chinese military on classified research. The Biden  administration has yet to walk any of this back.   We are also finally seeing some interest in the World Health  Organization's Beijing-controlled investigation into the Wuhan lab. On  March 1 of this year and again on May 24, I laid out my concerns to the  White House about the WHO's reliance on the Chinese Communist Party for  funding and support. I explained how this reliance drove their initial  support for Beijing's response to the outbreaks and ruined the  integrity of their investigation. The White House has yet to respond to  my concerns, but it is not going to be able to avoid responding because  the American people are demanding the answers.   I think it is important to state for the record that what we are  seeing in these news reports is not entirely new information. The  foundations of the lab leak hypothesis remain much the same as they  were a year ago. So why pop open that can of worms right now? Because  there is no way to sweep this thing back under the rug.   We have the sudden interest of the media. Imagine that. We also have  an entire body of published statements and investigative reporting from  inside China. Facebook and YouTube have reversed their content  policies, which means they couldn't stop people from sharing this  information unless they pulled the plug on the entire internet which,  obviously, isn't an option.   We also have the magic of FOIA on our side. We learned from Dr.  Fauci's published emails that he knew about the dangerous research  happening in China. He was aware. We know he allowed inquiries into the  Wuhan lab leak theory to go unanswered. We also know he worked with  Mark Zuckerberg to determine what COVID-related information flowed into  the public timeline and when that information went out.   Now, I stand by my criticism of Dr. Fauci. His dystopian comments  equating attacks on his job performance with attacks on science are  unacceptable, but I want to encourage everyone to not make this about  one person. We now have evidence that public officials were eating each  other alive over political disagreements and that these disagreements  derailed investigations into the origins of COVID-19.   This is more than just political failure; it is a moral inversion  that empowered one of the globe's most violent authoritarian  governments. The Chinese officials who hid the existence of the novel  coronavirus from international bodies are the very same Chinese  officials who gunned down freedom fighters in Hong Kong, who unleashed  political violence in Inner Mongolia and Tibet, and who continue to  commit ongoing genocide against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.   It is time for Congress to get serious about cleaning up this mess. I  reiterate the same demands I made more than a year ago for a full and  unbiased inquiry into the lab leak hypothesis and a broader  investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Last week, I joined Senator Cotton in reintroducing the Li Wenliang  Global Public Health Accountability Act. This legislation would  authorize the President to sanction foreign officials who suppress or  distort information about international public health crises, including  COVID-19. I encourage my colleagues to sign on to the bill.   Most importantly, I would implore my Democratic colleagues to engage  in a little introspection. The officials implicated in this coverup  swept science under the rug, orchestrated a relentless smear campaign,  throttled the flow of public information, and allowed the Chinese  Communist Party to exonerate itself at the expense of truth and  accountability.   You don't have to defend this. Please, have the moral courage to make  the right choice, and join us in our demands for unbiased  investigations into the origin of the pandemic.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the referenced fact sheet and letters. The referenced articles and  report can be found online at www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/ 06/francis-collins-nih/619065, www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/06/the-lab- leak-theory-inside-the-fight-to-uncover-covid-19s-origins, and  osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/BRP-House-EC-Report.pdf   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Fact Sheet Activity at the Wuhan Institute of Virology--United States                            Department of State       Fact Sheet      January 15, 2021        For more than a year, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has       systematically prevented a transparent and thorough       investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic's origin, choosing       instead to devote enormous resources to deceit and       disinformation. Nearly two million people have died. Their       families deserve to know the truth. Only through transparency       can we learn what caused this pandemic and how to prevent the       next one.        The U.S. government does not know exactly where, when, or       how the COVID-19 virus-known as SARS--CoV-2--was transmitted       initially to humans. We have not determined whether the       outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was       the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China.        The virus could have emerged naturally from human contact       with infected animals, spreading in a pattern consistent with       a natural epidemic. Alternatively, a laboratory accident       could resemble a natural outbreak if the initial exposure       included only a few individuals and was compounded by       asymptomatic infection. Scientists in China have researched       animal-derived coronaviruses under conditions that increased       the risk for accidental and potentially unwitting exposure.        The CCP's deadly obsession with secrecy and control comes       at the expense of public health in China and around the       world. The previously undisclosed information in this fact       sheet, combined with open-source reporting, highlights three       elements about COVID-19's origin that deserve greater       scrutiny:          1. illnesses inside the wuhan institute of virology (wiv)         The U.S. government has reason to believe that several       researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before       the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms       consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.       This raises questions about the credibility of WIV senior       researcher Shi Zhengli's public claim that there was ``zero       infection'' among the WIV's staff and students of SARS-CoV-2       or SARS-related viruses.        Accidental infections in labs have caused several previous       virus outbreaks in China and elsewhere, including a 2004 SARS       outbreak in Beijing that infected nine people, killing one.        The CCP has prevented independent journalists,       investigators, and global health authorities from       interviewing researchers at the WIV, including those who were       ill in the fall of 2019. Any credible inquiry into the origin       of the virus must include interviews with these researchers       and a full accounting of their previously unreported illness.                            2. Research at the WIV         Starting in at least 2016--and with no indication of a stop       prior to the COVID-19 outbreak--WIV researchers conducted       experiments involving RaTG13, the bat coronavirus identified       by the WIV in January 2020 as its closest sample to SARS-CoV-      2 (96.2% similar). The WIV became a focal point for       international coronavirus research after the 2003 SARS       outbreak and has since studied animals including mice, bats,       and pangolins.        The WIV has a published record of conducting ``gain-of-      function'' research to engineer chimeric viruses. But the WIV       has not been transparent or consistent about its record of       studying viruses most similar to the COVID-19 virus,       including ``RaTG13,'' which it sampled from a cave in Yunnan       Province in 2013 after several miners died of SARS-like       illness.        WHO investigators must have access to the records of the       WIV's work on bat and other coronaviruses before the COVID-19       outbreak. As part of a thorough inquiry, they must have a       full accounting of why the WIV altered and then removed       online records of its work with RaTG13 and other viruses.                    3. Secret military activity at the WIV         Secrecy and non-disclosure are standard practice for       Beijing. For many years the United States has publicly raised       concerns about China's past biological weapons work, which       Beijing has neither documented nor demonstrably eliminated,       despite its clear obligations under the Biological Weapons       Convention.        Despite the WIV presenting itself as a civilian       institution, the United States has determined that the WIV       has collaborated on publications and secret projects with       China's military. The WIV has engaged in classified research,       including laboratory animal experiments, on behalf of the       Chinese military since at least 2017.        The United States and other donors who funded or       collaborated on civilian research  [[Page S4537]]       at the WIV have a right and obligation to determine whether       any of our research funding was diverted to secret Chinese       military projects at the WIV.        Today's revelations just scratch the surface of what is       still hidden about COVID-19's origin in China. Any credible       investigation into the origin of COVID-19 demands complete,       transparent access to the research labs in Wuhan, including       their facilities, samples, personnel, and records.        As the world continues to battle this pandemic--and as WHO       investigators begin their work, after more than a year of       delays--the virus's origin remains uncertain. The United       States will continue to do everything it can to support a       credible and thorough investigation, including by continuing       to demand transparency on the part of Chinese authorities.                                   ____                                                      March 1, 2021.      Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,      President of the United States,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Biden: The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a       significant toll on American life as well as the U.S.       economy. Test kits, antibody therapies, and vaccine       development have occurred in record time due to Operation       Warp Speed and the ingenuity of the private sector. However,       the investigation into the origins of the pandemic are not       complete. Without this knowledge, it will be difficult to       prevent a future, similar pandemic. I urge you to use your       leadership to ensure investigations by the World Health       Organization (WHO) are free from conflicts of interest.        Concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency of       the events that took place at the time the outbreak started       in Wuhan, China. In addition, concerns have been raised       regarding the manner in which World Health Organization       investigators were chosen to study the outbreak and some of       the conflicts of interest that exist in those investigators.        Following the 2014 breakdown of security measures that       resulted in cross contamination with a dangerous bird flu       strain and the accidental mailing of live anthrax spores from       the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to other labs, Tom       Frieden, the director of the CDC under president Obama       testified ``We also need to encourage a culture of openness       and effective reporting of past or future incidents--since a       key aspect of effective response is to support rapid       reporting of problems.''        On February 13, 2021, National Security Advisor Jake       Sullivan said, ``We have deep concerns about the way in which       the early findings of the COVID-19 investigation were       communicated and questions about the process used to reach       them. It is imperative that this report be independent, with       expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the       Chinese government.''        Transparency is an issue upon which we can agree. In light       of that, I respectfully request you use your leadership to       ensure the ongoing investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic       origin be free from conflict of interest. WHO should be       required to have independent investigators to conduct this       study. WHO should not include researchers with conflicts of       interest or with a lack of experience in forensic       investigation. We owe this to the over 500,000 Americans who       have died from this disease, to their families, and to future       Americans who face possible pandemics.            Sincerely,                                                  Marsha Blackburn,      U.S. Senator.                                   ____                                                       May 24, 2021.      Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,      President of the United States,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Biden: I write to follow-up on my March 1,       2021 letter with lingering concerns about the validity of the       World Health Organization's (WHO) investigation into the       origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.        Prior reports appear to confirm that the WHO had ``little       power to conduct a thorough, impartial examination.'' On May       13, 2021, in a letter published in Science, a group of 19       prominent scientists called for a deeper investigation of the       two primary hypotheses: 1) the virus began to spread after       jumping from infected animals to humans; and 2) the virus was       accidentally released from China's Wuhan Institute of       Virology and began spreading in the human population.        Among other issues, these scientists call into question the       China-WHO joint study's consideration of the two main       hypotheses stating, ``Only 4 of the 313 pages of the report       and its annexes addressed the possibility of a laboratory       accident.'' This fact is deeply concerning in light of recent       media reports that, ``[t]hree researchers from China's Wuhan       Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019       that they sought hospital care.''        In light of these reports and my continued concerns, please       respond, in writing, to the following questions:        1. According to reports, the WHO asked the U.S. government       to recommend three experts for the China-WHO joint       investigation team. Although they were not ultimately       selected, another U.S. scientist was selected for the team.        a. Please name the three scientists recommended by the       U.S., and articulate the WHO's reasoning for not choosing       these individuals.        2. Beijing has refused to share critical raw data on the       initial cases of COVID-19 in China. Has Beijing provided the       U.S. with that data? If not, please explain why.        3. The China-WHO joint investigation stated that they       ``lacked expertise and access to investigate a potential lab       leak.'' What will the administration do to insure that       competent, impartial experts are involved in future       investigations?        4. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the organization was       not mandated to do a forensic audit. Why was this the case?       Will your administration insist on a fulsome forensic audit       for future outbreaks?        I request the courtesy of a reply by June 14, 2021.            Sincerely,                                                  Marsha Blackburn,                                                      U.S. Senator.     I yield the floor.
