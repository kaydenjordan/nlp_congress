 Madam Speaker, it has been the honor and privilege of a  lifetime to serve the people of Rhode Island's Second Congressional  District for the last 22 years.   Together we have accomplished so much, from strengthening our  national security and cybersecurity, in particular, to advancing the  rights of people with disabilities, to advocating for our Nation's  foster youth, and so much more.   With less than 2 months left in my term, I will be leaving Congress  with a lot of mixed emotions, but I still believe that politics and  government is still a noble profession, and I couldn't be more proud of  the person who will be succeeding me as the next Congressman for Rhode  Island's Second Congressional District, Seth Magaziner.   Throughout his career, Seth has proved himself to be a committed  fighter for working families, and that is exactly what he will continue  to do as a Congressman.   Seth will be laser-focused on cutting costs for Rhode Islanders, from  lowering the price of prescription drugs to cracking down on oil and  gas companies that are price gouging everyday Americans.   Seth will fight to combat the climate crisis, and he will work to  keep Rhode Islanders safe from the threat of gun violence.   Seth will always stand up for anyone who tries to cut older Rhode  Islanders' hard-earned Medicare and Social Security benefits.   Madam Speaker, I couldn't be more proud of Seth, and I can't think of  a better person to serve the people of Rhode Island. Congratulations.                            ____________________
