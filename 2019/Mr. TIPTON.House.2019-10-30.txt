 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chair, when it comes to public lands management, Colorado has a  long history of balancing the interests of a broad range of  stakeholders, including the needs and interests of citizens who may not  be the most vocal on the issues. This is accomplished through proactive  outreach to communities and engagement with citizens and local leaders  who know their areas best.   This type of local engagement has proven to be effective on previous  public lands efforts, such as Hermosa Creek and Chimney Rock in  southwest Colorado. In both cases, there was an extensive and inclusive  community outreach process with many months of bipartisan support,  negotiations, and conversations with stakeholders from all sides of the  debate.   The result was the House passing bipartisan measures to be able to  protect these individual and valuable open spaces, both of which have  become law. Behind these efforts was a recognition of historic multiple  uses of the land as well as for the communities who live there.   For many decades, Colorado has responsibly developed natural  resources on public lands, which has provided critical funding for  emergency services, education, and infrastructure for rural communities  that would otherwise be unable to have these services. While doing  this, Colorado has also embraced a thriving outdoor economy and  protected access to the public lands for historical uses, as well as  for sportsmen and other recreational access.   We have prioritized conservation of delicate ecosystems and habitats,  protected cultural and historic sites, and defended private property  and water rights. There are certainly disagreements on the most  effective ways to be able to carry out these ideas, but most of us  agree that the most effective approach to be able to work through these  disagreements is by being able to listen to the local communities and  those most affected by Federal decisions and finding a way to be able  to  [[Page H8648]]  incorporate those ideas into balanced legislation.   Unfortunately, we have not seen this same type of outreach  negotiation and local engagement with the CORE Act as a whole. Some  stakeholders and communities in the Third Congressional District were  not included. It is important that we do not discount the Third  District voices who feel like they were excluded or that their concerns  were disregarded.   Madam Chair, I have heard from numerous county commissioners who have  not been involved in the legislative process for the CORE Act and have  simply asked to have their concerns addressed by the House before a  vote takes place. This is the same feedback I have repeatedly heard  from stakeholders and local elected officials in the Third District  following public meetings on these issues over the past few months.    I am not saying that there is not support for the CORE Act in the  Third District, because there is. Many of our resort and mountain  communities are strongly behind the bill, and it is just as important  to listen to their input as those in the rest of western Colorado.   I am optimistic that we can find a balanced public lands bill that  reflects all of these communities, but it can't happen if one side is  left out of the conversation from the beginning. More outreach needs to  happen, negotiations need to take place, and compromise needs to be  made.   The commissioners, other local elected officials, and stakeholders in  the counties that have not yet been included in the experiences have  knowledge and opinions that should be given due consideration when  crafting public policy land bills that directly impact many of them and  indirectly impacts all of them. We firmly are committed to giving all  counties in the Third District the opportunity to be able to have their  voices heard and their ideas included in any public lands legislation  that impacts their region.   During a House Natural Resources Committee on the CORE Act and before  the House Rules Committee this week, I introduced amendments that  included reasonable and necessary additions to the bill based on direct  feedback from Third District stakeholders and officials.                                time  1830    I provided my colleagues from Colorado who sponsored this legislation  in both the House and the Senate with a similar list of items for  inclusion beforehand.   These suggestions include protections for existing water and grazing  rights; codification of the U.S. Army High-Altitude Aviation Training  Site's flight guidelines over wilderness areas; allowing for current  public land management activities to continue in recreation areas, and  language to ensure that leaseholders in the Thompson Divide are fairly  compensated for the value of their leases.   These amendments are not controversial. They are not partisan. They  do not disrupt or alter the outcomes of the bill. What these amendments  do is ensure that there is no ambiguity in the intent of the  legislation, as stated by the bill's sponsors and supporters. There is  great harm in ambiguity, which is what will result if these amendments  are not accepted.   I have also offered two amendments to release wilderness study areas,  at the request of counties in which they are located. Most of these  areas have been deemed unsuitable for wilderness designation. That does  not mean that they will not be protected public lands because they all  have some measure of protection.   Madam Chairwoman, responsible management is not always the result of  more restrictive designations. Instead, it can also mean giving local  communities greater flexibility to be able to address local land  challenges.   In recent testimony given before the House Natural Resources  Committee, Montezuma County Commissioner Keenan Ertel made the argument  for releasing wilderness study areas when they have been deemed  unsuitable by the Federal land management agencies for wilderness  protections. Seven years ago, the Menefee Mountain Wilderness Study  Area was ravaged by fire. Years after the fire, noxious weeds consumed  much of the landscape due to the stringent protections given in the  area. The weed concerns continue to progress, as projected in this  photo.   Local agencies are limited in their ability to be able to proactively  manage these invasive species because of the stringent wilderness  protections that remain in place.   If the Colorado delegation is truly vested in passing a statewide  public lands bill that has broad local consensus, why aren't we  including the removal of these areas that rely on Federal action to be  able to allow for better management of these lands?   I have suggested to my bicameral Colorado colleagues, and even  submitted an amendment, but it was not adopted. I continue to hear that  local concerns have been addressed, yet we cannot assure Montezuma  County residents that theirs have even been considered.   Along with allowing local communities greater access to be able to  protect their cherished open spaces from potential wildfires, it also  includes buffer zones between wilderness and nonwilderness areas.   A look at the devastating wildfires in Colorado over the years shows  us just how important this is. In 2013, the West Fork Complex fire,  which burned over 100,000 acres in southwest Colorado, is a prime  example of how forest fires have no regard for arbitrary lines, as  shown on the map.   We have, unfortunately, seen the aftermath of this fire and other  fires, and they threaten the stability of roads and water quality and  are greater erosion threats for many years to come.   I raised this concern with the sponsors of the bill, suggesting that  we increase the offsets for the trails running on the borders of the  wilderness area from 50 to 150 feet. With this reasonable ask, I  believe we can eliminate unnecessary risks to our forests and protect  them from future forest fires that have the potential to jump across  boundary lines onto other public and private lands. Yet, this amendment  was not allowed to move to the floor for consideration, nor were 8 out  of the 10 amendments that I introduced.   Had there been greater outreach across the Third District, the CORE  Act's sponsors could have heard more examples just like these that need  to be addressed. This week alone, we received letters from Montezuma  County, Dolores County, Rio Blanco County, Montrose County, Mesa  County, all of which have various concerns about the CORE Act today.  That is also accompanied by letters from individuals.   Madam Chairwoman, I applaud the CORE Act sponsor, my Colorado  colleague, Mr. Neguse. He has a passion for being able to protect  public lands in Colorado. It happens to be a passion we share.   However, Colorado's Third District, where most of this bill will have  an impact, not Mr. Neguse's district--I would be remiss if I did not  speak out on behalf of my constituents--have yet to have their voices  heard in this process or their issues addressed.   I am optimistic that we could eventually get broad community  consensus through the Third District on the CORE Act, but first, there  is outreach that needs to be done, issues to be worked out, and  compromises to be made.   There is no doubt that the CORE Act will pass the House tomorrow,  that the bill will head to the Senate. However, in good conscience,  given the concerns that we have heard out of the district that have not  been addressed, I will have to reluctantly vote ``no'' on this current  version of the bill.   It is my hope that the Senate will consider my amendments, that they  will be included, that continued outreach occurs, and that we include  the ideas of all western Colorado.   I stand willing and ready to be able to work with them.   Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.    Madam Chair, I think the gentleman mentioned Montrose  County. Is it going to be impacted by Curecanti?     Madam Chair, I have all the other issues that I have  outlined, and I need those amendments to be able to do that. That does  not make the bill bad, but it does make it an imperfect bill.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in support of my  amendment addressing water rights in the Curecanti National Recreation  Area.   For years, my staff and I have engaged in numerous conversations  regarding the Curecanti National Recreation Area, and there has been  bipartisan agreement in these discussions that water rights in the  region should remain intact.   This area brings in millions of visitors each year and provides  recreation opportunities that include fishing, hiking, camping, and  more. While it might be an outdoor enthusiast's paradise, it is also a  source of Colorado's most precious resource: water.   This amendment ensures that there are no unintended consequences in  this legislation for longstanding water rights in the impacted area.   Mr. Chair, I would like to encourage my colleagues to be able to  support this, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his support for the  amendment.   One of the important points of it, as with some of the subsequent  amendments that we have, is to make sure that we are codifying the  language so that it is understood.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the support, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to support my amendment to be  able to protect longstanding grazing rights in the Thompson Divide.   Since the days of Colorado's pioneers, grazing rights have always  played an essential role in the economy and the way of life.  Generations of Coloradans have followed suit and continued to build a  robust ranching community, including around the Thompson Divide.   In my roundtable discussions with local communities affected by  Federal public lands, I routinely hear how important ranching is and  the importance of protecting grazing rights, and this is true of the  Thompson Divide. The permanent withdrawal of mineral and energy  development in the region should not suppress any existing grazing  rights.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's comments.   I think what is actually important is precisely the words that the  gentleman used: unintended consequences that can come.   This is a perfecting amendment to be able to make sure that we are  codifying the importance of those grazing rights within those  communities, something that is important to not only the Thompson  Divide area but many of our ranchers who happen to have some grazing  leases on public lands throughout the western slope of Colorado,  something that is going to be important, but specifically to this bill,  to make sure that we are codifying the right to have grazing within the  Thompson Divide area with the mineral rights withdrawal that the  gentleman is proposing.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's comments and  appreciate his support, actually, for this. This actually shows how we  can make progress when we do have communication.   In terms of what was going on, something was lacking on some of these  issues going into the CORE Act. Unfortunately, another eight amendments  which I had proposed were not allowed to be discussed on this floor  tonight. We have other concerns that have been expressed through our  counties, through our communities, through individuals to be able to  address as well.   But I am appreciative of the gentleman's support on this amendment  and for recognizing the importance of grazing rights in not only  Garfield County but throughout the West.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1930     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the opportunity to address the Colorado Outdoor  Recreation and Economy Act on the floor. We want to be able to ensure  that the land being transferred from the Forest Service to the National  Park Service management comply with the current memorandum of  understanding.   During testimony before the Committee on Natural Resources committee  hearing on the CORE Act on April 2, 2019, Acting Deputy Chief of the  U.S. Forest Service, Chris French, identified the Soap Creek area  within the Curecanti National Recreation Area as appropriate for  continued active forest management, including fuel treatments, under  the existing memoranda of understanding between the Forest Service and  the National Parks Service.   This is a good amendment to be able to support. I would encourage my  colleagues to get behind this and hope we can continue to have the  continued cooperation that we are finally starting to be able to see on  the floor.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, this is a current memorandum of  understanding, something that the Forest Service itself, Chief Deputy  Chris French, identified as an appropriate area for continued  activities.   You know, one of the big challenges that we have in the Third  Congressional District of Colorado happens to be forest management. We  have seen forests literally burn to the ground. Simply to be able to  have active, good forest management, to make sure that we are standing  up, being able to protect our communities seems to me to be a sensible  approach to be able to address something within something as expansive  as the CORE Act.   The gentleman mentioned conversations with, I assume, a county  commissioner out of Gunnison County. We did have some contact with him  today. We are going to be citing back to him conversations he had with  our legislative director on this issue. So there was communication that  had taken place on this. I would invite the gentleman to actually come  to Montrose County to be able to visit with people who deal in the  forest products areas, to be able to see how they are going to  responsibly be able to deal with some of the treatment areas, to be  able to protect our communities, to be able to protect our watersheds,  to be able to protect endangered species.   I think this is an appropriate amendment to the CORE Act, and I will  encourage its adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I appreciate my colleague's  comments, his passion. I am glad he has been to Montrose to be able to  be there. I hope he spent a lot of money while he was there. We would  appreciate that.   But it is interesting, going back to a comment that the gentleman  made earlier, that just saying it doesn't make it so. We are hearing  comments that there is broad-based support, there is no opposition.  However, Montrose County, which the gentleman just cited, they may  support a provision, but they oppose the CORE Act. So to be able to say  there is broad, unanimous support is probably something that I think is  not taking into consideration some of the concerns that we have heard.   I have just held round tables throughout our district, and there were  concerns. And as I noted in my floor speech earlier, to be able to see  some support, there is--because there is a lot of common ground in  Colorado. It is just that we have not gone through all of the elements  to be able to get this bill to the point where we will have what I  think we would all like to be able to have, and that is unanimous  consent to be able to move forward.   When we are looking at this specific amendment--again, this is  something that is being recommended, not by me but by the Forest  Service, when we are talking about those management provisions to be  able to maintain that current memorandum of understanding. This is, I  think, something that is probably important for our area, an area where  I travel, happen to live, and something that I hope that you will  consider, and you will support.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, we often hear the comment on this floor on  public lands bills: These lands belong to all Americans. I appreciate  and I do respect the support for the CORE Act in terms of the  individual communities, but I think it belies the lifestyle on the  western slope of Colorado, in particular. The people that traverse,  work within different counties, feel the impacts on their businesses,  have the impact of water flowing through those communities coming from  another county, those are the issues that I think, unfortunately, are  not taken into consideration by this bill.   I urge support of this amendment. It is a good piece of work to be  able to make sure that we are dealing with good forest management.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I genuinely appreciate my colleague's position  on this. In fact, he will probably recall, and I believe he voted for-- and our colleague from Colorado (Mr. Neguse) did as well--my amendment,  to be able to recognize the importance of this issue to the national  defense of the United States. We passed that through. 417-6, as I  recall, was the vote total that was on there.   So I applaud the recognition of the importance of high-altitude  training facilities.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague, Mr. Crow, for his service to this  country. That is the importance of people being able and willing to put  their lives on the line for this Nation, but we do need, I think,  ultimately, to be able to go one step further.   While this recognizes the importance of it, it does not codify it.  That is something that I think is really essential to making sure that  the men and women in the United States military have the safest  opportunities to be able to do the training that they need to be able  to carry out the missions of this country.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
