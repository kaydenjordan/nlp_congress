 Mr. Speaker, with a heavy heart, I rise to  honor the remarkable life of recently departed Florida AFL-CIO  President Mike Williams.   Starting as an apprentice, he became an electrician, working  temporary service and construction jobs and living paycheck to  paycheck, like so many workers do.   Seeing the critical value of job protections and livable wages, he  devoted his life to the labor movement, first as a rank-and-file member  for 15 years before becoming business manager of his local, IBEW 177.   Later, he became president of the Florida Building Trades Council,  and in 2009, Mike was elected president of the Florida AFL-CIO, where  he served distinctively until his death.   A natural-born leader, Mike revitalized Florida labor by fostering  new alliances with community, immigrant, and faith-based groups.   Tall and with a contagious smile, he was a straight-shooter and  always brought a worthy cause and compelling case for workers to the  Capitol.   Direct and trustworthy, he was a man of standards whose shoes will be  hard to fill.   Mike's empathy, dedication, and compassion will be sorely missed, but  his legacy and impact must never be forgotten.   I will miss my dear friend. May his memory be for a blessing.                            ____________________
