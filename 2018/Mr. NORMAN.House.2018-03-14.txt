 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to  highlight a pro-life pregnancy center in my own district, the Palmetto  Women's Center.   The Palmetto Women's Center is focused on uniting hope, health, and  healing to women as they bring a child into their family. The center  provides women with pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, Biblical counseling,  education from nurses, connections within the community for access to  resources, and much, much more. For example, the center partners with  the Rock Hill Salvation Army to ensure that soon-to-be mothers can have  access to maternity clothing and baby supplies.   The Palmetto Women's Center will be able to reach more women in my  district as they begin operating in their new mobile unit. This will  allow the staff of the center to travel throughout the district and  provide women with the center's free services.   Palmetto Women's Center is working to lower the number of abortions  in South Carolina and supporting women as they choose life for their  children. I  [[Page H1588]]  applaud the work that pro-life pregnancy centers are doing, and I will  continue to be an advocate for them and for life.                            ____________________
