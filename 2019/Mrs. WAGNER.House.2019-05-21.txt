 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 354,  celebrating the 100th anniversary of this body passing the 19th  Amendment.   On May 21, 1919, the House of Representatives approved a proposed  amendment to the Constitution that provided suffrage for women. This  amendment not only ensured that all women are full participants in our  democracy, but it also ensured that the United States is a full  democracy.   Women and girls have always possessed the same fundamental rights as  men and are essential to a stable, peaceful society.   On behalf of every woman in the Second District of Missouri, I honor  the role that the ratification of the 19th Amendment played in  fulfilling the principles of the Constitution for women.   I commit to working to strengthen our democracy as we remember  remarkable women like Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and  others who fought for our freedoms.                            ____________________
