 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to celebrate the  record of service of my friend and our colleague, Congresswoman Elaine  Luria.   Elaine came to Congress as one of the first two women who graduated  from the United States Naval Academy to serve here in the Halls of  Congress. She had an incredible 20-year career as a Navy Nuke before  continuing her service here in the Halls of Congress. But for anyone  who thought that she was solely focused on the Navy--and it did feel  like she has always been focused on the Navy--she has been a  [[Page H9923]]  dedicated Congresswoman focused on the issues that matter to Virginia's  Second District.   One of her proudest achievements, and first achievements of many, was  passing bipartisan legislation to protect the Chesapeake Bay, a vital  resource to her community.   Elaine, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, has been a  champion for our military and our Navy, and I caution anyone never to  doubt Elaine when she says that the Navy is the strongest and most  powerful element that our United States military has in the face of a  rising Chinese threat.   To continue her service, Elaine Luria continued on the January 6  Committee where she has bravely, proudly, and resolutely wanted to have  a defined history for generations to come of what happened in the lead- up to and on that day.   As she leaves Congress, I wish her and her family well. I am grateful  for her friendship and her service to our great Commonwealth.                            ____________________
