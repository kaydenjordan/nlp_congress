 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Westerman for his  leadership and for all that he does for our efforts on the Natural  Resources Committee.   I rise today in support of S. 1942, the National Heritage Area Act.   S. 1942 includes my bill, the Northern Neck National Heritage Area  Act. The Northern Neck of Virginia's lands and waters showcase natural  beauty unlike any other. As a long-time resident of the Northern Neck,  I know our heritage is unique and worth preserving.   With a history profoundly intertwined with that of the entire Nation,  it is only right for us to recognize the Northern Neck as a National  Heritage Area.   The Northern Neck National Heritage Area Act will deliver critical  Federal resources; it will encourage public-private partnerships; and  assign a specific entity, the Northern Neck Tourism Commission, to help  protect the Northern Neck's natural, cultural, scenic, and recreational  resources.   Under this legislation, the National Heritage Area designation would  apply to the land between the Potomac River and Rappahannock River  spanning King George, Lancaster, Northumberland, Richmond, and  Westmoreland counties.   The Northern Neck has been working together for over 20 years in  pursuit of the National Heritage Area designation. With this  designation, the Northern Neck region will have a greater voice in  sharing its stories which contribute to the understanding of the early  origins of our Nation.   It also aligns with the region's tourism strategy as an important  economic driver in this rural part of the Commonwealth.   I was proud to have worked with Senators Warner and Kaine on this  bipartisan effort and thank them for their work in bettering the  Northern Neck.
