 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.  [[Page H9201]]    Mr. Speaker, first and most importantly, I want to concur with the  remarks of Mr. Thornberry. We have had a great many people work  together to produce a very important product. The staff, the Members,  House and Senate, have all done an outstanding job.   On the Armed Services Committee, we are very proud of the fact that  we produce a legislative product every year. We actually do legislation  the way it is supposed to be done. We work it through committee.  Chairman Thornberry often outlines the number of different provisions  that were asked for at the committee level, at the full House level and  the Senate level, and we worked through those, reached compromise where  we could, and produced a product that is truly a legislative product.                                time  1400    That is testimony to the great work, first and foremost, of our  staff. Both the House and Senate do an outstanding job with hundreds of  complex issues and working with all the Members, and I thank them very  much.   It is also a testimony to the Members, both House and Senate, to  their commitment to make sure that we pass the National Defense  Authorization Act, understanding how important it is to support our  troops and meeting our national security needs.   I also want to thank our colleagues in the Senate. Mr. Thornberry and  I oftentimes say those are some of our most contentious debates--not  between us, but between us and the Senate. But they are handled, I  think, with great dignity and intelligence, and I enjoy working with  Senator McCain and Senator Reed. They are great partners in this final  product.   I am proud of this final product. There is a lot of very good policy  in here. Mr. Thornberry mentioned several of the keys: acquisition  reform, basically getting more out of the money we spend, making sure  the system works better.   I particularly want to thank Chairman Thornberry. He has taken a lead  on this issue for a number of years. I think we have made significant  improvements, even while acknowledging that we still have a long way to  go to get the efficiency that we need out of the Pentagon budget, but  that is an important change.   I also think that this bill does a great job of supporting our troops  and their families. As the chairman mentioned yesterday, it is  basically the case that you recruit a servicemember but you retain the  family, and that means that you have to provide for them. We fully fund  the 2.4 percent pay raise in this bill and support our troops and their  families in many other ways. This is a very good product.   I will also say, I want to particularly thank Representative Langevin  for working on this issue. This bill states that climate change is a  national security threat. We make that the policy of the United States  Congress, to acknowledge climate change and the impact that it is going  to have on our national security, and Representative Langevin was  tireless in making sure that that was part of this bill.   So this is a good product. I am proud of it. I am proud of the work  that we have done together to produce a legislative product that, as  Mr. Thornberry says, none of us like everything that is in it, but we  reached a compromise to produce a product on an important issue.   The challenge that we have going forward is what the chairman  mentioned at the end there: This bill funds, I think it is right around  $696 billion in defense spending. It goes $80 billion, roughly, over  the budget caps, and the bill can't do that on its own. Unless the  budget caps are lifted and appropriators pass the appropriations bill,  that doesn't happen; and we haven't made a lot of progress on that.   I was thinking, today, back to 2011, in August, when we first passed  the Budget Control Act. We were about 2 days short of not being able to  meet our debt ceiling obligations when we passed that; and at that  time, the hope was that we would come together on a compromise to deal  with our deficit and our debt to get us on a fiscally responsible path.   Well, over 6 years later, I can't say that we have made an enormous  amount of progress on that, and that is a huge threat to our troops and  our national security. I would also say that it is a threat to the  nondefense discretionary budget and the rest of the budget as well.   But without question, one of the greatest challenges the Pentagon  faces--they don't know from one month to the next how much money they  are going to have. Is this going to be the number? Is this bill going  to work?   I hope so, but we don't know. We have got to resolve that issue. We  have got to figure out how to have a fiscally responsible budget so we  can pass appropriations bills every year so all aspects of the  discretionary budget can have some predictability.   It is absolutely true, as the chairman and others have said, we have  a readiness shortfall. What that means is we are not providing the  equipment and the training to our troops necessary to fully prepare  them to do the missions we are asking them to do. I have no doubt that  part of that is underfunding.   But another part of it is we have a National Security Strategy that  is unclear and, as it is presented, is far greater than we would ever  have the resources to match. I had a meeting with a Pentagon official  who told me that they were very concerned because they were way short  of having the funds necessary to meet their 2012 National Security  Strategy.   And make no mistake about it. As big and confusing as the Pentagon  may look, they have a reason for everything that they spend. They have  a plan in place. Right now, we don't have the funds to match those  plans.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rogers of Kentucky). The time of the  gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1  minute.   That is a huge problem. So going forward, while we do need to provide  more resources and more stability, I also think we need to take a look  at that National Security Strategy and say: Where are we spending money  that we shouldn't be? What part of our strategy do we not need?   If we can't do that, if we can't cut back, we are never going to be  in a position to provide adequate funds to our troops, and, to me, that  is the absolute worst result.   Whatever the strategy is, the one thing that it absolutely ought to  do is fund our troops sufficiently to meet it. To have a big idea of  what we ought to be able to do and then to underfund the men and women  whom we are asking to do it, I believe, has led to some of the  accidents and deaths that we have had recently with our ships and with  our planes.   We need to adequately fund readiness to meet a mission that is  achievable. That, we still need to get to; but, overall, this is a good  policy bill.   Again, I thank the chairman. I appreciate the partnership and really  enjoyed working with him to produce this product.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Readiness.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Readiness.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper), who is the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the ranking member on the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Carbajal), a member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much  time each side has remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington has 6 minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 12 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), who is a member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo), who is the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Readiness, for purposes of a colloquy with the  chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   As has been mentioned, this is an excellent bill that a lot of people  did very good work on. I thank them for that.   The only issue I want to raise in closing is the money. That is the  sticking point and the difficulty that we have.   This bill, as it is currently constructed, is $80 billion above the  budget caps. In the 6 years since the budget caps passed, we have been  unwilling to raise those.   But we have a larger problem. We have a $20 trillion debt. Our  deficit is close to $700 billion. It has no prospect of going down  anytime soon. At the same time, we have other needs.   During this debate, we focused like a laser on armed services and the  needs of national security and our troops, as well we should. Those  needs are incredibly important. I don't doubt that for a second. But  you have to look at the whole or we are not going to be able to meet  the needs of our national security and our troops. The amount of  revenue that we take in as a country, unsurprisingly, impacts--or  should impact--the amount of money that we can spend.   We are having this debate now. We are talking about how underfunded  the military is and how badly we need to shore up our readiness. I  agree with all that. The rest of this week we are going to figure out  how to make sure that our government takes in trillions of dollars in  less money. That is wildly inconsistent. If we believe we have these  needs, we ought to be able to pay for them.   Then there are the other aspects of the budget. I know we are not  supposed to talk about that during the Armed Services Committee debate  on the National Defense Authorization Act, but the needs for infracture  and education are things that also make our country strong, not to  mention the Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence agencies,  and other aspects of our national security, which are all part of the  same whole.   If we are going to get to a fiscally responsible place, we can't just  say defense gets whatever it wants and then let the chips fall where  they may elsewhere.   On the Armed Services Committee, if we truly care about making sure  that our troops have enough money, we need to do two more things in  addition to this bill.   Number one, we need to argue that we shouldn't do a massive tax cut  to undermine our ability to fund defense and national security.   Number two, we need to take a hard look at our national security  strategy and figure out where we can save money.   If we keep looking at every single section--it is too short here; it  is too short here--we do not have enough money. Even if we had a fit of  fiscal responsibility and decided to make cuts elsewhere--which hasn't  happened, by the way--and we decided to raise revenue instead of  cutting it, even if we did that, we are still looking at needs within  the national security budget. When you look at the programs that people  want to fund over the next 10 years, they are wildly beyond the amount  of money that we have.   We need a national security strategy that has an honest look at how  much money we are going to have. Otherwise, we are not serving our  troops.   I know the comeback is: How can you put a price on national security?  They should get whatever they need.   The only problem with that is that they don't. If we have a national  security strategy that exceeds the amount of money we have, the ones  left holding the bag are our troops. They are the ones who are asked to  do missions that they are not adequately trained to perform. They are  the ones who are asked to train without the adequate resources to train  properly.   That is what we must fund. To do that, we need to do more than just  pass this bill. We need to have a fiscally responsible approach to the  overall budget.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
