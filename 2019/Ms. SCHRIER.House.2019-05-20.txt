Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am excited that the House of Representatives is  considering this bill, Stronger CAPTA, today, a bipartisan bill I urge  my colleagues to support.   Stronger CAPTA is a reauthorization of the Child Abuse Prevention and  Treatment Act, CAPTA, that will revamp already existing Federal  supports for preventing child abuse and neglect.   It has been 9 years since Congress comprehensively reauthorized  CAPTA. This Congress, I partnered with several of my Democratic and  Republican colleagues to introduce the bipartisan Stronger CAPTA, which  would help States and communities address the recent rise in cases of  child neglect, abuse, and death, many of which can be linked to an  increasing number of parents affected by substance abuse and the opioid  crisis.   Stronger CAPTA will overhaul a prevention system that has always been  overworked and underresourced. In Washington State, only 11 of about  125 programs that apply receive funding. The support my State gets from  the Federal Government is about 50 cents per child per year.                                time  1700    Stronger CAPTA will increase funding so that more programs can ensure  families in need receive their services.   It will also create a local system in which families who are seeking  services but have not yet been identified as needing those services can  receive the help they need.   Currently, a family who knows they need help can't get it unless  something bad happens to the child. Parents are the most informed  regarding the needs of their children, and we should not punish  families who are proactively seeking assistance. Stronger CAPTA will  help these families before harm occurs.   I am hopeful that, because of this legislation, Washington State will  build on their efforts to support new mothers with parenting, help  families teach social-emotional and early literacy skills, expand  programs for Tribal families, counsel families and children exposed to  violence and homelessness, and expand the countless other programs in  place to help families seeking support.   I am also excited that the bill I introduced with my Republican  colleague   Steve Stivers, the Early Detection to Stop Infant Abuse and  Prevent Fatalities Act, is included in this legislation. With passage  of Stronger CAPTA, States will be able to help medical professionals,  early childhood educators, and others better identify early signs of  infant abuse and neglect that might look harmless to the untrained eye.   As a pediatrician, I take care of the children and families we are  talking about today. I want every parent to have the support they need  to parent well. My bill will go a long way to making sure every family  gets the support they need.   I thank my colleagues, Representatives Trahan, Johnson, Stefanik,  Bonamici, and Comer; Chairman Scott, and Ranking Member Foxx, for  coleading this legislation with me.   The well-being of children and their opportunity to grow up in  stable, loving environments will be improved with the passage of  Stronger CAPTA.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Oregon an  additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath).

Chairman Bobby Scott,      House Committee on Education and Labor,      Washington, DC.      Representative Kim Schrier,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Virginia Foxx,      House Committee on Education and Labor,      Washington, DC.      Representative James Comer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Foxx, Representative       Schrier, and Representative Comer: On behalf of the National       Child Abuse Coalition, thank you for your outstanding       leadership on the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and       Treatment Act. The reforms and funding levels you have       proposed in this legislation are extremely important, and we       strongly encourage all members of the House Committee on       Education and Labor to support its passage. If appropriately       funded, this legislation will reduce child abuse and neglect,       strengthen families through community-driven solutions,       improve local responses to child trauma, increase states'       child safety tools, and bring much improved data and       transparency around abuse and neglect fatalities so that       states can make tailored reforms to prevent future       fatalities. Though some changes to the bill are still needed,       we look forward to continuing to work with you as the       legislation moves forward.        In particular, we strongly support the following elements       of the proposal:        Authorization levels. Meaningful increases to CAPTA funding       are essential to ensure this bill's important reforms will       make children safer and families stronger. For too long,       Congress has sought key improvements to this law but has       failed to appropriate the funds that would allow states to       successfully implement them. The Coalition believes at least       $500 million for each title is critical, but we recognize the       authorization levels in this legislation reflect your strong       commitment to keeping children from being harmed. We were       very disappointed to learn that the House Labor-H bill       released today does not reflect the important investments you       have included in the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and       Treatment Act. We look forward to working with you to ensure       the funding levels included in this legislation are executed       in the appropriations process. The reforms this Committee       envisions for CAPTA will not be realized without robust       increases to funding.        Emphasis on family strengthening. We also applaud the       bill's focus on family strengthening, a clear reflection of       what we know to be true: that healthy and strong families are       key to ensuring children are healthy and can achieve their       full potential. The Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and       Treatment Act reflects the entire continuum of supports to       families, starting with primary prevention at the heart of       Title II and extending into the identification and treatment       of abuse and neglect in Title I. All are essential to       creating systems of support that both prevent child abuse and       neglect and keep families together whenever possible, and       also ensure timely and appropriate action when child abuse or       neglect does occur.        Improvements to child protection systems to reduce child       fatalities and near fatalities from abuse and neglect.       Experts estimate nearly 3,000 children die every year from       child abuse and neglect. Without proper data and disclosure,       efforts to reduce these fatalities will not succeed. The       legislation's reforms in Section 103 to develop uniform       standards for tracking and reporting of child fatalities       resulting from maltreatment are absolutely essential to       making sure federal, state, and local governments have the       information they need to keep more vulnerable children alive.       The bill's reforms to clarify and strengthen disclosure about       fatalities and near fatalities in Section 106 are also very       important to these efforts. Both of these reforms were       proposed by the Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and       Neglect Fatalities, a bipartisan Commission devised by       Congress to put an end to these tragic child deaths. We also       commend you for taking steps to improve interstate data       exchange.        Thoughtful attention to children and families impacted by       substance use disorders. As the national rise in substance       use disorders continues to drive more children and families       into the child welfare system, we appreciate the thoughtful       attention paid by the Committee to these issues. In       particular, the bill incorporates new language reflecting the       intersection between child abuse and neglect and substance       use disorders, the needs of children and families with       substance use disorders, and how critical collaboration       across multiple public and community partners is to       effectively connect families to needed treatment services.        Improved transparency, accountability, and focus on key       priorities. We greatly appreciate the legislation's much-      needed streamlining and updating of CAPTA in ways that will       prioritize key needs from the experts working in states and       communities, and that will improve transparency and       accountability to ensure better implementation of the law.       The revisions to Sections 104 and 105 reflect a more focused       approach to key priorities in child welfare. The use of funds       in Section 106 presents a much more cohesive and coordinated       vision to help states in their efforts to prevent, treat, and       intervene in child abuse and neglect. The bill's revisions       specifying the state mandates in Section 106 will bring much-      needed improvements to CAPTA's transparency and       accountability.        Finally, as the bill advances, we look forward to working       with you so that the following provisions in Title II strike       the right balance to ensure effective use of taxpayer       dollars, reduce bureaucratic requirements for states, and       reflect the importance of a universal, or public health,       approach to primary prevention:        Administrative cap. Thank you for working with the       Coalition and its members on this provision in between       introduction and mark-up. We appreciate your willingness to       respond to deep concerns from the states that the initial       proposed cap would hinder states' ability to carry out the       provisions of the legislation. CBCAP lead agencies are       committed to running their programs efficiently, and most of       them operate as part of larger agencies and do not always       control what shared expenses are charged to them. We heard       from numerous CBCAP lead agencies that a four percent cap       would greatly limit their ability to provide adequate       oversight and support in implementing the bold vision that is       proposed in the underlying legislation. As the legislation       advances, we hope to work with you to ensure that the       administrative cap is consistent with guidance from Office of       Management and Budget related to federally negotiated       indirect cost rates for federal funding, in a manner that       does not undermine state flexibility to effectively implement       the law.        70/30 funding formula. The Coalition urges Congress to       simplify the Title II formula to be entirely population       based. Currently, thirty percent of the funding formula is       determined by a very complicated set of rules that burdens       states with onerous bureaucracy, reduces state flexibility,       produces accounting incentives that do not necessarily       reflect state investments, and creates a situation where       states that might benefit the most are the least able to       leverage funds. As a result, just three states receive nearly       one-third of the funding from this portion of the formula. We       hope that you will continue to work with us to create a more       appropriate formula for this Title.        Public health approach. As the Committee repeatedly heard       from the witnesses at its March 26th hearing, a universal       approach to primary prevention services is essential to the       success of Title II. Primary prevention of child abuse is       most effective when it takes a universal approach to building       protective factors and reducing risks in families and       communities. It is important that CAPTA strike the right       balance between emphasizing building a universal--or public       health--approach and targeting higher risk communities. We       look forward to working with you to make sure the final law       addresses this in the best manner possible.        Thank you for your commitment to the prevention and       treatment of child abuse and neglect, and to improving the       lives of children and families in the United States. The       National Child Abuse Coalition and its twenty-five       organizational members stand ready to continue to help       support your efforts as the critical bill moves through       Congress.            Sincerely,                                        Ruth J. Friedman, Ph.D.,                                  Executive Director, National Child      Abuse Coalition.                                   ____                                   American Academy of Pediatrics,                                                        May 8, 2019.      Hon. Kim Schrier,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. James Comer,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Schrier and Comer: On behalf of the       American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a non-profit       professional organization of 67,000 primary care       pediatricians, pediatric medical sub-specialists, and       pediatric surgical specialists dedicated to the health,       safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and       young adults, I am writing to share our endorsement of the       Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 2019       (H.R. 2480).        As many as 25 percent of children in the United States have       experienced some form of maltreatment. Pediatricians have       long supported the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act       (CAPTA) because it is an essential federal policy tool for       preventing and responding to child maltreatment. CAPTA       provides critical support to states and nonprofit community-      based organizations for services to prevent and treat child       abuse and neglect. While CAPTA is critically important,       limited federal funding has historically impeded its ability       to create meaningful change for vulnerable children and       families. This bipartisan legislation would create major       progress and support efforts to apply a public health       approach to preventing and addressing child maltreatment        The Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act would       reauthorize and strengthen CAPTA to better promote child       health and well-being. Crucially, the bill authorizes $270       million for Title I state grants and $270 million for Title       II community-based prevention and state system improvement in       FY2020. The AAP strongly supports this critical funding       increase, which would improve CAPTA's ability to create       meaningful change for vulnerable children and families. In       addition, the AAP supports the bill's restructuring of CAPTA       to shift away from lists of state assurances to intentional       strategic planning. This will improve the quality  [[Page H3994]]       and accountability of CAPTA-financed activities.        H.R. 2480 also shifts CAPTA toward a public health focus on       prevention of child abuse. The bill streamlines CAPTA       research topics to focus on understudied areas such as how to       best address trauma, promote racial equity, and serve       families with substance use disorders in child welfare       systems. The Academy strongly supports the inclusion of a       provision to allow funds for research into ``sentinel''       injuries. This will help develop practices for improving       early detection and management of injuries indicative of       potential abuse, preventing further maltreatment and       fatalities.        The AAP also supports the bill's requirement for the U.S.       Department of Health and Human Services to create       standardized definitions for fatalities and near-fatalities       related to maltreatment, and to require data tracking on       those incidents. These data will be essential to applying a       public health approach to child maltreatment, enabling       researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to learn how to       better prevent maltreatment from studying the most tragic       outcomes.        The AAP also supports the bill's creation of a new       interstate maltreatment registry system. This policy would       support essential information sharing to ensure that       information about maltreatment a child has experienced can       cross state lines. Currently, states do not readily share       this information, which can lead to missed opportunities to       intervene and protect children from further harm. This is       vital to protecting children and preventing child fatalities.        Child maltreatment is a preventable but pervasive public       health problem. This bipartisan legislation offers critically       needed innovative approaches to improving child welfare       systems. The Academy supports this legislation and looks       forward to working with you to advance these important       policies.            Sincerely,                                          Kyle E. Yasuda, MD, FAAP,      President.                                   ____                                              American Psychological                                      Association Services, Inc.,                                        Washington, DC, May 9, 2019.      Chairman Bobby Scott,      House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington, DC.      Representative Kim Schrier,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Virginia Foxx,      House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington, DC.      Representative James Comer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Foxx, Representative       Schrier, and Representative Comer: On behalf of the nearly       118,4000 members and affiliates of the American Psychological       Association (APA), thank you for your extraordinary       leadership on H.R. 2480, the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention       and Treatment Act (Stronger CAPTA). The reforms in this       legislation, in concert with the increased funding       authorization, are powerful steps toward preventing child       abuse and neglect and improving access to treatment and       essential services for children and families, especially       those recovering from trauma.        APA is a scientific and professional organization       representing psychology, comprised of clinicians,       researchers, educators, consultants and students across the       United States and around the world. APA works to advance the       creation, communication and application of psychological       knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives. Many       psychologists are specialized in child development and work       across research and practice to serve children and families,       including children who have experienced abuse and neglect.        The Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act takes       a streamlined and family-oriented approach to addressing key       priorities in child welfare. The bill thoroughly emphasizes       the importance of strengthening families through a continuum       of services and supports including treating traumatic stress,       connecting parents and children to mental and physical health       services, programs to develop parenting skills, and other       core services. Building on the Family First Prevention       Services Act, the new Stronger CAPTA includes a greater focus       on the prevention of child abuse and neglect. APA is       particularly pleased to see trauma and adverse childhood       experiences highlighted across the bill's, research and       technical assistance components, as well as the state grants       in both Titles I and II. While there is much to be commended       in the proposal, APA strongly supports the following       elements:                 Improvements in Research and Data Collection         The priorities set in section 104 focus on key areas of       research to identify evidence-based approaches that improve       primary prevention efforts, service delivery to children and       families, and the wellbeing of victims of child abuse and       neglect. The bill emphasizes scalability with an eye toward       better serving more children and families, particularly those       who have experienced trauma or have complex needs. APA       strongly supports the promotion of racial equity within the       child welfare system and the development of evidence-based       approaches that consider the unique needs of rural, urban,       and suburban families. In addition to streamlining research       priorities, Stronger CAPTA enables much needed improvements       in transparency and state data reporting through an update to       the state plan mandates in section 106.                 Reducing Findings of Neglect Due to Poverty         Consistent with APA's Presidential Initiative on Deep       Poverty, APA applauds the new provisions aimed at preventing       and reducing findings of child neglect that result from a       family's economic insecurity. Keeping families together,       whenever possible, is critically important for healthy       development and children should not be separated from loving       families due to poverty. As the section 106 grants suggest,       families in financial need are better served by connecting       them to services, such as nutrition assistance benefits.                       Addressing Complex Family Needs         GI Stronger CAPTA recognizes the challenges of adequately       supporting and improving outcomes for families with complex       needs. Some of America's most vulnerable families are those       with multiple risk factors for child abuse and neglect, such       as parents with substance use disorders, parents who have       experienced domestic violence, caregivers and children with       disabilities, and young parents. Across both Titles, the bill       encourages comprehensive outreach and treatment strategies to       identify and support families with complex needs.                           Substance Use Disorders         The national epidemic of opioid use disorders has driven a       substantial increase in findings of child abuse and neglect       that has resulted in more children in the child welfare       system. This bill acknowledges the intersection of substance       use disorders and child maltreatment and incorporates new       provisions to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration       across community and public partners, with the goal of       ensuring families are connected to the mental health services       and additional supports that they need. These reforms reflect       a responsiveness to current needs identified by state and       local agencies and service providers.                        Increased authorization levels         Congress has long sought myriad improvements to CAPTA but       has historically failed to appropriate adequate funds for       proper implementation. Additional funding is vital to ensure       that the meaningful reforms of this legislation are fully       realized, to the benefit of vulnerable children and families.       The significant increases to authorization levels in H.R.       2480 illustrate a renewed commitment protecting children from       harm. The importance of the increases proposed cannot be       overstated, and the changes must be incorporated into the       Fiscal Year 2020 appropriations legislation accordingly, so       as to not risk delays in implementation.        The Stronger Child Abuse and Prevention and Treatment Act       represents an encouraging federal commitment to preventing       child abuse and neglect before it occurs and proving the best       possible continuum of services to support to children and       families who have experienced child abuse and neglect. We       welcome opportunities to work together to strengthen and       advance this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                 Katherine McGuire,                                            Chief Advocacy Officer.     Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2480. I am so pleased that we worked together in a bipartisan fashion.   Parenting is the hardest job we have, and yet we have no training for  it. This bill ensures that parents will have the support they need. It  will save lives and prevent child mistreatment, maltreatment, abuse,  and neglect.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
