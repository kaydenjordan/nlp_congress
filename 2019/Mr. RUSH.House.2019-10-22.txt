 Madam Speaker, between 1882 and 1968, 3,446 African  Americans were lynched in this Nation. This fact appears to be  completely lost on the President, who just this morning conflated  constitutionally mandated oversight with the horrific act of lynching.   The heinous nature of lynching is why I have introduced H.R. 35, The  Emmitt Till Antilynching Act. Madam Speaker, this bipartisan bill would  specify that lynching is a crime in and of itself, and that its vile  nature warrants an enhanced sentence under hate crime statutes.   I would encourage all my colleagues to support this bill and to  reject this President's vile rhetoric.                            ____________________
