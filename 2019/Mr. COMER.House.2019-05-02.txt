 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the  entrepreneurial spirit and compassionate philanthropy of Ray Eckstein,  who passed away on April 20, 2019, at the age of 93.   After receiving a law degree from Marquette University, Mr. Eckstein  founded Wisconsin Barge Line. He later sold the business and formed  Marquette Transportation, leading him to relocate to Paducah, Kentucky.  His business had a profound economic impact and brought numerous jobs  to the region.   Mr. Eckstein and his wife touched the lives of many through the  establishment of the Ray and Kay Eckstein Charitable Trust. The  couple's generosity has, no doubt, had a tremendous impact on the local  community.   Over the years, they have gifted the area they loved with a hospice  care center, regional cancer care center, and heart and vascular  institute, all named in their honor.   Mr. Eckstein was widely known for his warm, compassionate spirit and  devotion to his family. I join with all those who knew him to express  our gratitude for his outstanding contributions to western Kentucky.   May God continue to bless the many members of his family through whom  his memory lives on.                            ____________________
