 Reserving the right to object, I feel like Yogi Berra  when he said ``It's deja vu all over again.''   Just 18 hours ago, the Senator from New York and I stood here, and he  made the exact same request, and I objected to it. And I will object  again. I will object tomorrow, and I will object for as long as he  wants to make these requests.   I will point out, though, that the business of the people is not  being done. For all of you up there in the Gallery, we just started 20  minutes ago. That is the regular order under which the Senate starts  when it can't reach agreement on when to start earlier. We typically  would start around 9:30 or 10, but the Democrats refused to allow us to  come in earlier today to start processing some of the President's  nominations.   You may have heard on TV that Democrats on the Finance Committee have  boycotted their hearing this morning. They refused to show up to do  their job to confirm some of the President's nominees.   I don't know how long they plan to do this. I don't know if they  intend to abscond out of the district, if we are going to have to vote  to have the Sergeant at Arms track them down and haul them into work to  do their business. I see him standing right over there. He has a  distinguished record in military and law enforcement. He could probably  do that effectively.   I wish, though, that they would simply show up and have a debate and  do their work and confirm the President's nominees in an orderly  process.   The Senator from New York mentioned State Department officials who  had left work last week. Well, there is a simple solution for getting  political accountability at the State Department, and that is for this  body to confirm Rex Tillerson to be the Secretary of State.   Finally, I just want to make a few points about Ms. Yates's firing  last night, since that is the only thing that has changed since the  Senator from New York and I were on the floor yesterday.   Ms. Yates, in her letter about the President's order, did not cite  any provision of the Constitution, any Federal law that suggested the  President's order was unlawful or unconstitutional, nor could she  because her own Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal guidance  for the executive branch, had already reviewed the order before it was  issued for its form and its legality and had signed off on it. Her  decision was a policy decision, which is not a decision of the Attorney  General--certainly is not a decision of a holdover Acting Attorney  General--to make.   She was grandstanding. She should have been relieved. I am glad the  President relieved her.   The American people deserve to have a politically accountable  Attorney General to make these decisions, which we would have, yet  again I say, if the Democrats would simply do their job and process  these nominees in an orderly fashion.   So, as I said, on behalf of the Republican Conference, I object. I  will object tomorrow. I will object for as long as we make these  frivolous, dilatory requests.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). Objection is heard.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to express my support for Rex  Tillerson to be our next Secretary of State. Mr. Tillerson is one of  the most distinguished businessmen in the world. His reputation  precedes him. I don't have to recount for all of you his remarkable  career--rising from an entry-level production engineer to CEO of  ExxonMobil, the largest oil company in the world. Mr. Tillerson's story  should be an inspiration to kids across this country: Through hard  work, discipline, and striving, you can achieve your dreams, even if  you weren't born into wealth, power, or privilege. Like the Boy Scouts  he has mentored, like the Eagle Scout he was, Mr. Tillerson inspires by  his example.   No one can doubt Mr. Tillerson has acquired a wide range of skills  throughout his notable life, as well as a gold-plated reputation. I  think it goes without saying that a man of such varied experiences will  bring a well-informed and shrewd perspective to the post. In fact, I  would suggest that it is the very perspective which recommends him most  for the job.   I met with him in December, and we had a wide-ranging conversation  about Russia, the Middle East, human rights, and the many other  geopolitical challenges and opportunities facing our country. I was  impressed by the breadth of his knowledge, his familiarity with so many  world leaders, and his understanding of their peoples. The one thing  that really stood out to me was his clear-eyed, hard-nosed prudence. It  is little wonder that Mr. Tillerson comes highly recommended by Dick  Cheney and Bob Gates, seasoned statesmen with no illusions about the  world and no doubts about America's role in it. I am confident that as  Secretary of State, he will protect the interests of the American  people just as he protected the interests of ExxonMobil's shareholders  as their CEO.   I have heard some Senators wonder whether a businessman can really  walk away from a company and its financial interests--as if it were the  money that made the man, instead of the man who made the money. Their  concern reminds me of similar questions raised about one of the best  Secretaries of State in the modern era, George Shultz. When President  Reagan nominated him, Secretary Shultz was president and director of  the Bechtel Group, a large construction concern with business across  the Arab world. People asked whether Secretary Shultz would therefore  tilt U.S. policy toward those countries. I think anyone looking back  today on his record would marvel at those fears.   In 2015, the World Jewish Congress awarded Secretary Shultz its  prestigious Theodor Herzl Award on behalf of his work with America's  good friend Israel. Yes, Secretary Shultz went on to lead a very  successful tenure, working with different countries all over the world  and always putting America's interests front and center.   If anything, Rex Tillerson's business experience will only enhance  his ability to provide the President his sound, unbiased judgment. If  you need any more evidence, just look at the way Mr. Tillerson has  conducted himself throughout the confirmation process. He has answered  every question and addressed every concern. He has been calm and steady  under pressure. These are precisely the qualities we need in our next  Secretary of State.   Today, I offer my strong support for an outstanding businessman and  an American patriot, our next Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. I  encourage all of my colleagues to vote for the nomination.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to express my support for Rex  Tillerson to be our next Secretary of State.
