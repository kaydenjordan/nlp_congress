 Mr. President, I rise for the seventh time to call  for this entire body to have the opportunity to consider and cast their  votes for the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention  Act.   This commonsense reform would ensure that people in the military who  have been subjected to sexual assault or other serious crimes get the  justice they deserve.   In the 8 years that I spent advocating for this reform, with many  other Senators, I have heard some criticism from those who would rather  not see change to our military justice system. I wanted to take this  time to briefly respond to a few of those criticisms.   First, I have heard that the bill will add bureaucracy to the  process. The fact is, this bill actually cuts redtape. Instead of  needing to find time on a commander's busy schedule for a military  prosecutor to brief them on the case, the prosecutor's recommendations,  instead, become the prosecutor's decision.   Under this law, prosecutors who understand complex military justice  concepts like unlawful command influence and evidentiary standards make  the decision, rather than a commander whose time is better spent  focusing on warfighting than on learning the evidentiary rules. I have  to wonder if these critics have actually read the bill, since it  specifically requires the services to use existing resources that we  have already provided to accomplish this reform.   Second, detractors worry that this law will result in fewer  prosecutions. The opposite is true. Under the current system, only  about one-third of survivors are willing to even come forward to report  a crime. When 64 percent of victims are retaliated against for coming  forward and less than 1 percent of victims actually sees a conviction,  who can blame them?   When we put complex cases in the hands of impartial, professional  prosecutors, both victims and the accused will have more faith and more  confidence in the system. The more confidence survivors have in the  system, the more they are likely to come forward. And the more  survivors who come forward, the more offenders we can prosecute.   Third, those who would rather push off this reform to maintain the  status quo sometimes say that there is a lack of data to support the  policy and worry that it would somehow collapse good order and  discipline. There is no lack of data on justice systems to pull from.   Our major Western allies have implemented systems like this, and in  country after country, this type of reform, just like other military  justice reforms, has improved good order and discipline.   In Israel, for example, this system brought survivors out of the  shadows and gave them confidence to report. From 2012 to 2017, the  Israeli military saw a 91-percent increase in willingness to report  crimes. During that same period, the U.S. military saw an increase of  only 33 percent. Despite the success of the #MeToo movement, we are  still lagging so far behind in fostering a military climate where  victims feel safe to come forward.   Year after year, detractors have had the same dogmatic response:  Commanders will be unable to maintain good order and discipline if we  make this change. Well, I have talked to commanders who have seen the  need for change, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. They can  start with my cosponsor, Senator Joni Ernst. If commanders feel this  authority is essential to their ability to lead, then they have a lot  more to learn about leadership.    Last, we have the argument that is developing that, if we do make  this change, to just make it a little bit. Let's just do it for one  crime. Let's just do it for the crime of sexual assault.   Well, we have an editorial today that was published in The Hill. The  headline is, ``Military justice reform, `pink court' and unit  cohesion.'' These were four military experts who wrote this editorial,  and I will read a quote from it.         President Biden, Secretary Austin and members of the House       and Senate may be tempted to settle on a compromise under       which only sex offenses would be subject to prosecution       decision making by lawyers rather than non-lawyer commanders.       After all, they may believe, it's those offenses that have       given rise to this entire controversy, so let's just fix       that.        That may be the way the process unfolds from here, but it       would be a mistake--and a tragic one, given the difficulty of       getting Congress to focus on military justice in a sustained       way. It would take years for the military justice system to       recover if Congress takes the wrong path at the current fork       in the legislative road.    It goes on to talk about two reasons this would be harmed. The first  lies with the fact that there is bias in the system and that this bias  cannot be eradicated by just taking out one crime, that it should be  for all serious crimes.   I will read from the text again.         Second, even though men as well as women in uniform are       victims of sexual assault, public concern has chiefly focused       on the women. It is concern over them and their willingness       to come forward without fear of retaliation that has given       the reform issue such potency. As a practical matter, if a       parallel system is created for the disposition of sex       offenses, that system will be understood as having been       created chiefly for the benefit of women in uniform. Congress       will, in effect, have created ``pink courts''--courts for       women.        Creating ``pink courts'' will destroy unit cohesion. It is       difficult to imagine a surer way of turning back the clock on       all the progress our country has made in integrating women in       uniform, including opening occupational specialties,       admission to the service academies, qualification as pilots       of warplanes and commanders of naval ships and Coast Guard       cutters, and promotion to flag and general officer ranks.        Congress should transfer the charging power for all felony-      level offenses by military personnel to uniformed prosecutors       independent of the chain of command. Limiting the transfer to       sex offenses makes no sense.    One argument that was not included in here is that, if you do limit  it to just one crime, you don't address the issue of defendants'  rights. Now, with so much data we have available about racial biases in  prosecution and conviction and punishment, it is right that we care  about both plaintiffs' rights and defendants' rights and reform the  entire system.   These unfounded arguments are nothing more than delay tactics. Every  day we delay this vote, we deny justice to our servicemembers--the  people who do so much for us and so much for this country. There is no  reason to wait any longer.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation  with the Republican leader, the Senate Committee on Armed Services be  discharged from the further consideration of S. 1520 and the Senate  proceed to its consideration; that there be 2 hours for debate, equally  divided in the usual form; and that upon the use or yielding back of  that time, the Senate vote on the bill with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
