 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the heroic  actions of the U.S. Marshals Service.   Last month, the U.S. Marshals Service issued this press release: In  an ongoing joint operation known as Operation Homecoming, the U.S.  Marshals, in coordination with the National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children and other Iowa agencies, have located 21 missing  Iowa children between the ages of 4 and 17 since October 2020.   As a mother, I cannot begin to imagine the heartache the families of  these children have endured, but thanks to the U.S. Marshals Service  and other agencies tasked with finding missing and exploited children,  these 21 children have finally been brought home.   I would like to thank Deputy Marshal Christopher Siemens, U.S.  Marshal Doug Strike, and the more than 50 local task forces that are  working to return Iowa children home to their families.   Speaking of missing and exploited children, it cannot go without  saying that, for missing and exploited children, know what is happening  at our border is a travesty. I want to thank Customs and Border  Protection agents for all they are doing to try to reunite these  children and get them safely to their end result. But it should not  continue as the U.S. Federal Government, under this administration, is  engaged in a human smuggling operation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  the National Federation of Independent Businesses opposing H.R. 7.                                                           NFIB,                                     Washington, DC, March 24, 2021.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx: On behalf of       NFIB, the nation's leading small business advocacy       organization, I write in opposition to H.R. 7, the Paycheck       Fairness Act. This legislation will add significant burdens       to small businesses and potentially expose them to frivolous       lawsuits.        NFIB and its members believe in equal pay for equal work.       However, NFIB does not believe that this legislation is the       solution. H.R. 7 will make legitimate business-related pay       differences difficult to defend in court, invite frivolous       lawsuits against small business owners by allowing unlimited       compensatory and punitive damages in equal pay lawsuits, and       significantly increase small business paperwork burdens.        This legislation would make it nearly impossible for a       small employer to defend against claims where an       ``alternative employment practice'' exists and could serve       the same business purpose without producing a wage       differential. Even if an employer were to demonstrate that a       legitimate factor such as education, training, or experience       accounted for a wage differential, an employee could claim       that an ``alternative employment practice'' existed and that       the employer refused to adopt such a practice. For example,       an employee of a small, local hardware store would be able to       sue an employer for refusing to adopt a business practice       that a much larger company uses to address wage       discrepancies. Forcing one-size-fits-all legislation on       small, independent businesses puts them at a significant       disadvantage relative to their larger competitors. A small       business may have legitimate reasons for not adopting the       practices of a large business. However, if an employee can       prove that the independent business refused to adopt the       ``alternative employment practice'' of a large competitor,       the small business automatically loses the suit.        This legislation also prohibits an employer from asking a       prospective employee about wage history and prohibits an       employer from relying on wage history in determining wages.       These prohibitions create a very difficult situation for       small business owners. A person's written resume is only one       aspect of the application process; a person's salary history       is another essential part of gauging professional growth and       development. If the needs of a prospective employee and the       wants of a business do not match, the prospective employee       and the business should be able to discern this sooner rather       than later to avoid wasting each party's time and energy. By       eliminating salary history, the hiring process becomes less       precise and more difficult for small employers.        This bill also puts significant paperwork burdens on small       business owners. It requires the Equal Employment Opportunity       Commission (EEOC) to issue regulations providing for the       collection of employers' compensation data. Most small       business owners do not have a human resources department or a       full-time staff member in charge of reporting and compliance.       NFIB members find unreasonable government regulations to be       their sixth biggest problem and federal paperwork to be their       15th biggest problem when ranking their top 75 problems and       priorities.  [[Page H1815]]         NFIB strongly opposes H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act,       urges the committee to oppose the legislation in its current       form.            Sincerely,                                                  Kevin Kuhlman,                                                     Vice President,                                      Federal Government Relations.     Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to introduce  this as a small business owner myself. The NFIB letter says: H.R. 7  will add significant burdens to small businesses and potentially expose  them to frivolous lawsuits. In addition, the bill will make legitimate  business-related pay differences difficult to defend in court, invite  frivolous lawsuits against small business owners by allowing unlimited  compensatory and punitive damages in equal pay lawsuits, and  significantly increase small business paperwork burdens.   Moreover, the NFIB letter says that H.R. 7 will make it nearly  impossible for a small employer to defend against claims where an  alternative employment practice exists and could serve the same  business purpose without producing the wage differential.   The letter also highlights the significant paperwork burdens H.R. 7  would place on small businesses who do not have a human resources  department, a full-time staff member in charge, or attorneys for  reporting and compliance.   Mr. Speaker, having been a small business owner and supported by the  small business owners, and during the pandemic when it is so necessary  for us to get our small businesses up and operating, I urge my  colleagues to take these views of small business owners into  consideration before they vote on H.R. 7.    Madam Speaker, I rise as the designee of  Representative Stefanik, and I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, equal work deserves equal pay, and we owe it to women  to constructively engage on addressing pay disparities in the workplace  and put forward real solutions. Unfortunately, Democrats have put forth  a bill that prioritizes lawsuits and government regulation over women's  economic empowerment and advancement.   H.R. 7 would require employers to make intrusive data disclosures  that would add compliance costs exceeding $600 million per year while  posing serious threats to workers' privacy and their paychecks.   On top of these onerous new requirements, H.R. 7 will force America's  businesses to prepare for an onslaught of frivolous lawsuits, which now  will be open to unlimited compensatory and limited damages.   Forty percent of small businesses are run by women, and H.R. 7 would  make it harder for these women business owners to succeed.   This issue is too important to leave to partisan solutions. Our  amendment, the Wage Equity Act, offers a stark contrast to the approach  laid out in H.R. 7. We look to innovation in the States to find  bipartisan policy that is supported by both Republicans and Democrats  and signed by Republican Governors--proof that equal pay for equal work  is not a partisan issue.   The Wage Equity Act supports the empowerment of women in today's  economy. America's businesses--particularly our small businesses--seek  to do right by their employees. In recognition of this, the Wage Equity  Act creates a voluntary pay analysis system to encourage the good-faith  efforts of employers to self-identify and correct any wage disparities,  should they exist, creating an environment of consistent self- reflection.   We believe every American should be able to negotiate employment  based upon their qualifications and merit for the position, and that a  victim of wage discrimination should not have this discrimination  follow them to their next job and compound through the rest of their  career.   This is why this amendment protects the employee's right to not  disclose their salary history during the job interview process unless  they wish to do so voluntarily. At the same time, we cannot erode the  necessary negotiations that take place in a job interview.   The Wage Equity Act protects the ability for an employee and their  prospective employer to have a pay expectation conversation, an  important part of any negotiation.   Our amendment protects employees' ability to discuss compensation  with  [[Page H1824]]  their colleagues while giving employers the ability to set reasonable  limitations on the time, location, and manner of this activity to  protect employees from harassment.   Furthermore, the Wage Equity Act seeks to put women on equal footing  as men as they start their careers with a grant program targeted  towards women in college and career tech programs to provide  negotiation skills education.   Lastly, our amendment directs the GAO to study the manager's gap to  give us a clearer sense of the impact new parents leaving the workforce  have on an employee's future earning and opportunity potential.   These are commonsense proposals that are supported by both Democrats  and Republicans alike. I encourage my colleagues to reject partisan  Government overreach and to support practical, bipartisan solutions  that improve the existing law of the land--equal pay for equal work--by  voting for the Stefanik amendment.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
