 Madam Speaker, I was absent today due to a medical  emergency. Had I been present, I would have voted: ``yea'' on Roll Call  No. 28, ``yea'' on Roll Call No. 29, ``no'' on Roll Call No. 30,  ``yea'' on Roll Call No. 31, and ``yea'' on Roll Call No. 32.                            ____________________
