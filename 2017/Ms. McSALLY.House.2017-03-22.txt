 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1302) to require an exercise related to terrorist and  foreign fighter travel, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1302         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1302, the Terrorist and  Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act.   This legislation furthers the efforts that I and several of my  colleagues on the House Homeland Security Committee engaged in last  Congress as members of the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist  and Foreign Fighter Travel. For 6 months, our task force investigated  our security vulnerabilities and the threat posed by ISIS. Our work  produced 32 key findings and over 50 recommendations to make Americans  safer.   In our findings, the task force found that the growing complexity and  changing nature of the foreign fighter phenomenon may be creating  unseen gaps in our defenses. Yet, it has been years since any large- scale stress test has been conducted on U.S. Government protection and  prevention programs against terrorist travel.   The last major government exercise on terrorist travel occurred in  2009 when the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, conducted  an exercise focused on the aftermath of a national terrorist event  outside of the United States and how to prevent subsequent efforts by  the terrorists to enter the United States and carry out additional  attacks. The objective of the exercise was to determine how government  agencies at all levels would respond in such an environment.   However, the threat environment has changed considerably and relying  on information gathered during an exercise that took place nearly a  decade ago is simply unacceptable and puts American lives at risk.   The exercise conducted in 2009 also focused primarily on terrorists  attempting to infiltrate the United States. However, our task force  found that officials today should be just as concerned about Americans  leaving the country to train overseas with terrorist groups as foreign  fighters and then come back.   The ability of these hardened fighters to return to the United States  is a legitimate security threat to the homeland. Catching individuals  who are looking to join the ranks and train with ISIS and other  terrorist organizations prior to their initial departure is equally  important and should be a goal for law enforcement as well.   As such, H.R. 1302 would require that the executive branch conduct an  exercise to evaluate the Nation's preparedness against all phases of  foreign fighter planning and travel. Carrying out such attacks would be  beneficial in understanding how partners at all levels of government  and abroad are currently responding to these scenarios.   We must take decisive action to defeat the threat of ISIS and other  terrorist organizations. The findings of the exercise required by this  legislation will identify weaknesses at home and abroad that may be  exploited by terrorists and foreign fighters, particularly to  infiltrate the United States to conduct attacks. These findings will  also be provided to Congress and Federal law enforcement and  intelligence officials to provide information on how we can best  address these weaknesses.   Passage of the Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act  today represents continued action by this body to fight against ISIS  and ensure we keep Americans safe. I urge all Members to join me in  supporting this commonsense, bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 1302, the       ``Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of       2017.'' This  [[Page H2304]]       legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.        In order to expedite Floor consideration of H.R. 1302, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo       action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our       mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill       does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate you working with us on the base       text of the bill and request you urge the Speaker to name       members of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the       Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the       bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on       Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                     Washington, DC, March 15, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 1302, the ``Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel       Exercise Act of 2017''. I appreciate your support in bringing       this legislation before the House of Representatives, and       accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation       and Infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the       bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this       bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation       in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill       be necessary, I would support your request to have the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on       the conference committee.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                          Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa) on the Committee on Homeland Security for supporting this bill,  and I urge the rest of my colleagues to support H.R. 1302.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
