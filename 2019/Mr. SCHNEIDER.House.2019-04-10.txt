 Mr. Speaker, last month, I spoke on the floor about  the urgent need for EPA ambient air testing at two manufacturing  facilities in Lake County that use ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen.   As well, I and my colleagues in the Illinois delegation have written  to the EPA urging them to undertake ambient air monitoring.   The neighbors living near these plants, as well as the local  governments, need to know that the air they breathe is safe. Yet the  EPA still refuses to conduct any ambient air monitoring, instead  insisting on using dispersion models based on estimates of smokestack  emissions.   Such dispersion monitoring is completely inadequate because it fails  to account for what are known as fugitive emissions, EtO escaping into  the environment from locations other than the smokestack.   Absent EPA leadership, the local municipalities and the Lake County  Public Health Department have stepped up to pursue monitoring on their  own.   Good for them, but it should not have come to this. They are only  doing so because the EPA has failed to do its job.   Our communities deserve far better from the EPA. This is about our  families and the public health. I urge the EPA to do its duty and to  begin this vital testing immediately.                            ____________________
