 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  incredible educator in southern Nevada, Ms. Laura Penrod, who has been  recognized as Nevada's Teacher of the Year for 2024.   Ms. Penrod currently teaches at Southwest Career and Technical  Academy where she opened the special education department and began  working and teaching English soon thereafter.   She brings 17 years of teaching experience to help her students not  only in the classroom but also after school, advising several  extracurricular activities and in her community as a fearless champion  of public education.   Ms. Penrod exemplifies what makes our teachers so special--the drive  to do good and always be there for our students.   I wish Ms. Penrod the best of luck as she moves on to the National  Teacher of the Year competition, and I am deeply grateful for the  impact she has on her students and our community.                            ____________________
