 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of a man whose  service to his community has resulted in greater safety, security, and  justice in Polk County, Florida.   Sheriff Grady Judd, a stalwart of law enforcement in the 15th  District and a dear friend, has been sworn into the role of president  of the Major County Sheriffs of America, a position to which he will  bring his knowledge, his skill, and his integrity to advocate for safer  communities across our great Nation.   For centuries, the Anglo-American sheriff system has produced  officers who secure the peace and prosperity of the land, and even two  American Presidents, Grover Cleveland and Teddy Roosevelt, served in  such a capacity.   Sheriff Judd has long been an advocate for the rule of law, and we  will all benefit as he rises to this position to fight to uphold the  noble tradition of keeping the peace.   My deepest congratulations to Sheriff Judd and his family, and to the  Major County Sheriffs of America, who do such important work to keep us  all safe.                            ____________________
