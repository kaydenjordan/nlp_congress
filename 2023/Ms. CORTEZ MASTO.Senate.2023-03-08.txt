 Mr. President, I have had the opportunity now to  listen to all of my colleagues as they rightfully come to the floor  here to, really, talk about the erosion of women's rights in this  country by the far-right extreme.   I have to thank Senators Baldwin and Blumenthal and so many of my  colleagues--Senator Murray and so many--who have been on the forefront  of protecting women's rights and freedoms.   Let's not mistake this. This is about women's freedom. That is what  this is about. It has been less than a year since the Supreme Court  overturned Roe v. Wade, and it has been a dark time for women in  America since then, because, by dismissing 50 years of precedent that  protected women's freedom, the Supreme Court emboldened far-right  Republicans to go after women's rights in increasingly extreme ways.  One of the first things some of these Republican leaders did in  Congress after the Dobbs decision was to work on legislation to ban  abortion nationwide. Until they can pass that legislation denying  States their ability to keep abortion legal, they will continue their  attacks on reproductive freedoms and make it as difficult as possible  for women to access essential reproductive healthcare.   In Texas, Arizona, Wisconsin, and other States with strict abortion  bans, doctors who provide women with reproductive care could be  prosecuted, heavily fined, or imprisoned--and in some cases, all three.  These States have threatened to revoke providers' medical licenses,  putting their politics over what is best for patient health.   For women, confusion and fear over abortion bans have led to denied  access to necessary and potentially lifesaving reproductive care.  Imagine the distress, the burden these women and their families carry.  Pregnancy decisions are deeply personal. It is not a legal debate up  for discussion in the courts.   We must do everything we can to ensure that women have the tools they  need so they can decide what is best for their lives, for their health,  and for their families.   Since the Court overturned Roe, women have begun traveling, as you  have heard today, to pro-choice States like Nevada for the abortion  care they need, but that is not enough because anti-choice policymakers  are working on ways to take that freedom away. States' rights aren't  enough.   Their latest attack on women's rights is through a lawsuit to  restrict nationwide access to the abortion pill, even for women in  States where medication abortion is one of the few legal options left.   Extremist Republicans' war on reproductive freedom didn't stop with  overturning Roe, it didn't stop with punishing doctors, and it won't  stop with going after medication abortion.   Let's get one thing clear: For the far right, this is about  controlling women.   I trust women, and so do a majority of Americans, including Nevadans.  Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe women should have the right to  make their own choices about their reproductive care, and I stand with  them. That is why I am proud to join my colleagues today to reintroduce  the Women's Health Protection Act.   As you have heard, this bill defends women against the extreme  politicians who are working to strip away those rights, guaranteeing  that women can seek the vital reproductive care they need without  having to answer to the government.   Under this bill, women would see an end to abortion bans and  burdensome restrictions to accessing abortion. Women would be able to  get the healthcare they need without being subjected to medically  unnecessary ultrasounds, excessive waiting periods, and other obstacles  that far-right politicians have put in their path. Women and their  families would be able to plan for their futures on their own terms.   The alternative is to watch a minority of extremists continue to  strip away women's rights across the country. We must protect a woman's  right to choose and pass the Women's Health Protection Act.   I will say one final thing, and I would hope my colleagues on the  other side would listen to this. We have heard conversations about the  impact that this issue has had on this past election cycle. I am proof.  I am back here because not just Democrats but Republicans and  Independents, nonpartisans in my State, care about this issue. They  care about the rights of women and their freedom to make this decision,  and a majority of Americans do as well.   That is why it is important for all of my colleagues--I don't care  what aisle you sit in; I don't care what party you are--or you are not  a party; the goal here is, when we come to this Congress, when we stand  here together and we try to solve the problems that matter to this  country, we are listening to the American people, and we are not  letting a minority determine, and we are not about taking away the  freedoms and rights of people in this country, including women, and  turning them into second-class citizens. That is not who we are.   I invite my colleagues at all times--I don't care where you are, what  party you stand with, where you are--to stand with women in this  country. This is such an important issue. Pay attention to the American  public and what is at stake here. I ask you to support us with the  Women's Health Protection Act.   I yield the floor.                                 H.J. Res. 26
