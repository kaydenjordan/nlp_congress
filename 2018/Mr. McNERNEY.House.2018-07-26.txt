 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Maria McClain for  being selected by the National Science Teachers Association and the  National Council of Teachers of Mathematics as 1 of 10 2018 STEM  teacher ambassadors.   For the past 22 years, Maria has been teaching mathematics at Deer  Valley High School in my district in Antioch, California. She has twice  been named Antioch Unified School District Teacher of the Year and  Contra Costa County Teacher of the Year. Maria is also a recipient of  the prestigious Presidential Award for Excellence in Math and Science  Teaching.   As the only Ph.D. in mathematics in Congress, I have a great  appreciation for STEM education and the rewarding impact it has on its  students. I am especially thankful for the work Maria is  [[Page H7693]]  doing in my district; and around the country, it is teachers like Maria  who are shaping the future of this country by bringing their passion  and dedication to the classroom.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Maria and in  thanking her for her commitment to STEM education.                            ____________________
