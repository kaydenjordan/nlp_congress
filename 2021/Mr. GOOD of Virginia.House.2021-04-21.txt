 Madam Speaker, we must establish an America- first immigration policy. However, the Democrats are doing the  opposite, with illegal aliens first, foreign nations first, and future  Democrat voters first. Law-abiding American citizens are clearly last  on the list of priorities, if they even make the list at all.   They are giving illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, free  social services, free transportation, and even free lodging. Today, it  is more of the same, with the continued effort to enable and facilitate  illegal entry into our country. Now they want to provide attorneys for  illegal aliens and further restrict our ability to refuse entry to  those who wish us harm. Come one, come all.   Is it confusion and incompetence on the part of Democrats?   Do they not know the threat to our country? Do they not understand?   Or is it worse and they know exactly what they are doing and they  don't care about the consequences?   Why else would they let organized crime profit off the suffering of  those trying to illegally cross our border?   Why else would they stop building the Trump wall?   Why else would they reinstate catch-and-release and offer amnesty to  illegal aliens?   Why else would they stop MPP and Title 42 restrictions?   The Democrats are destroying our country, and you need to look no  further than our own border.
