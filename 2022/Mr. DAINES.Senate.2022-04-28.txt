 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Mike DeVries of Fergus County as Montanan of the Month for  his dedication to serving his community and his courage during the  Denton fire last December.   Mike joined the volunteer fire department shortly after moving to  Denton with his family in 2004 and has been loyal to the department and  community ever since, serving as chief for 11 years. On December 1,  2021, Mike's love of his community and resolute leadership was on full  display. As the West Wind fire tore through the town of Denton, Mike  acted swiftly to maintain incident command and ensure the safety of his  firefighters and members of the Denton community.   As Montana suffered a terrible fire season in 2021, Mike not only  coordinated aid and resources, he showed care and compassion to his  fellow residents of Denton and the surrounding area. He met with folks  who were impacted by the fires and connected personally with all of the  local firefighters and community members who showed up to help.   Serving as the Denton fire chief is just one of the ways Mike gives  back to his community. He is also on the elder board of the Denton  Bible Church and has served several terms on the town council. As a  volunteer fire chief, he has spent countless hours training, traveling,  and managing the department. His son Joel says that Mike is held in  high regard by other firefighters as he works to build relationships  between Denton and surrounding departments.   While Mike is quick to give credit to his crew, he deserves  recognition for his leadership during the 2021 fire season, loyalty to  the Denton Fire Department, and compassion for his community.   Keep up the great work, Mike. You make Montana proud.                            ____________________
