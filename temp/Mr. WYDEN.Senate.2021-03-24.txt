 Reserving the right to object.    Madam President, the Senator from Florida claims to be  looking out for gig workers and freelancers. The reality is very  different.   What is in the bill, which the Senator from Florida apparently  opposes, is a way to make sure that these workers can get the  information they need to help meet their existing tax obligations.  Without this information, for example, workers may lose out on benefits  that would help them pay rent and buy groceries. They could  inadvertently lose out on important tax benefits, like the earned  income tax credit. The rescue plan, of course, expands the earned tax  credit. We want to make sure that every eligible worker can get that  financial help.   Finally, without reporting, workers might jeopardize the size of  their future Social Security benefits, putting their retirement  security at risk.   So what the Senator from Florida is up to here would deprive American  entrepreneurs of the information they need to keep business records,  comply with tax requirements, and claim important Federal benefits. For  these reasons, I strongly object to this request for unanimous consent.   I yield the floor.
