 Madam Speaker, 20 States, including  Louisiana, still have the same hourly pay floor as the Federal minimum  wage: $7.25.   Louisiana also has the second highest poverty rate of any State. That  is because minimum wage is a poverty wage--a full-time salary is less  than $16,000 a year. No one can survive on that, much less raise a  family on that wage.   While the Federal minimum wage has not increased since 2009, the  costs of housing, medicine, food, and childcare have all exponentially  increased. We cannot simply subject millions of our constituents to  endure the trials of poverty. It is not a mystery. We can, we must, and  we know how to help. It is time to finally increase the Federal minimum  wage and lower the costs with the Build Back Better Act.                            ____________________
