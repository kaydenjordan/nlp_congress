 Mr. Chair, it must be nice to perch yourself upon  privilege. The vast majority of my colleagues across the aisle have  never had to have ``the talk.''   In fact, most of them may not even know what ``the talk'' is, but  let's talk about it. I am going to talk to you about my life  experiences as a civil rights lawyer and urge that we legislate from a  place of compassion instead of a conspiratorial, sunken place.   Let's talk about these weapons. Let's talk about the fact that in the  summer of 2021 when George Floyd was killed, I represented over 600  protesters pro bono. Unfortunately, these were people who believe in  the Constitution and understand that there is more than one amendment  besides just the Second Amendment. They were actually exercising their  freedoms under the First Amendment, but instead what happened is that  they ended up becoming victimized.                                time  1915    Let me tell you, when I am talking about this, I am not talking about  conjecture. I am talking about what is real. You can Google Brandon  Saenz, a 26-year-old who had his eye shot out.   Let me be clear. You can be injured, and it not necessarily be a  firearm. Honestly, if my colleagues really care about making sure that  we are going to be safe in our streets----    Then maybe we will get some gun reform----    And stop going after women's reproductive rights,  because if you believe in freedom, then kids should be able to go to  school and know that they will be safe.
