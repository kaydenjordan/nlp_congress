 Mr. Speaker, our Republican Senate majority is  killing our conservative agenda, our Republican agenda, and President  Trump's agenda. The murder weapon is the Senate filibuster rule, an  archaic accident of history created during the days of horse-and-buggy  and slavery.   The filibuster rule destroys the basic democratic principle of  majority rule and obstructs passage of legislation unless a 60 percent  supermajority of Senators agree. While today's 52-Senator Republican  majority can abolish the filibuster rule anytime it wants, so long as  the filibuster rule is in place, Republicans can pass nothing without  the consent of Chuck Schumer and the Democrats.   Think about it. Our Republican Senate majority has abdicated control  and empowered Chuck Schumer and the Democrat minority to obstruct the  will of the Republican House, obstruct the will of the Republican  Senate majority, obstruct the will of President Trump, and obstruct the  will of the tens of millions of American voters who send us to  Washington.   That is political suicide and an abject betrayal of the millions of  American voters who sent us here.   There will be no border wall because our Republican Senators empower  Democrats to kill it. There will be no ObamaCare repeal because our  Republican Senators empower Democrats to stop us. America's out-of- control deficits and debts will cause a debilitating insolvency and  bankruptcy that destroys an America it took generations of our  ancestors to build because our Republican Senators empower Democrats to  spend money we don't have, have to borrow to get, and cannot afford to  pay back.   During 2015 and 2016, the House worked hard to address America's  challenges. Over 500 of our bills never got so much as a single Senate  floor vote. All that work wasted.   The Senate filibuster rule is not in the Constitution. It is not a  Federal law or statute. It exists solely at the discretion of the  Senate majority.   President Trump understands the filibuster rule and that it threatens  the President's entire legislative agenda. On May 2, President Trump  urged our Republican Senators to end the filibuster rule, stating:  ``Change the rules now to 51 percent.''   On May 30, President Trump reiterated: ``The U.S. Senate should  switch to 51 votes immediately and get healthcare and tax cuts approved  fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt.''   President Trump's pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Exhibit A in this  murder trial is an April 7 letter to Chuck Schumer, of all people, and  Mitch McConnell that lists the accomplices, those deaf ears, who are  killing the conservative agenda, the Republican agenda, and President  Trump's agenda.   The letter states: ``We . . . urge you to . . . preserve existing  rules, practices, and traditions as they pertain to the right of  Members to engage in extended debate on legislation before the United  States Senate. . . . We are united in our determination to preserve the  ability of Members to engage in extended debate when bills are on the  Senate floor.''   Each Senator on exhibit A empowers Chuck Schumer and the Democrats to  kill President Trump's agenda. Remarkably, even an Alabama Senator  supports killing President Trump's agenda.   Mr. Speaker, Republican Senators claim we need the filibuster to play  defense when Democrats control the Senate. I submit that claim is  myopic and shortsighted. In the past 90 years, Republicans have not had  a single filibuster-proof Senate, while Democrats enjoyed filibuster- proof Senates in the 1930s, the 1960s, and in 2009. In those years,  Democrats passed ObamaCare and forced great society welfare programs on  us that busted our budgets, destroyed the work ethic, broke up American  families, and threatened America with a national insolvency.   Over the long haul and because of the filibuster, Democrats force  their leftist, socialist policies down America's throats, while  Republicans never have the power to reverse the damage done.   That is the Senate filibuster legacy.   Mr. Speaker, time is running out. America's future is at stake. Now  is not the time to play procedural games. I agree with President Trump.   Senate: End the filibuster.                            ____________________
