 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to discuss my amendment to the  fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, Rules Committee  amendment No. 778.   My amendment is very simple. It would reinvest $157 billion from our  defense budget into our public education system.   Many of my colleagues may balk at that number. However, I remind  everyone that we spend more on our national defense than the next 10  countries combined. We are secure as a nation in our military might  because we have consistently supported the military industrial complex.   Where we have neglected mightily is another pillar of our democracy,  which is our education system and our public school system.   As we continue to neglect our public schools, we are harming our most  precious and most vulnerable resource, which is our Nation's children.  Historically, this neglect is well-documented from redlining  communities, underfunding public housing, underfunding green spaces,  and underfunding schools in historically marginalized communities.   Before coming to Congress, I had the pleasure and privilege of  working in our public schools for 20 years. I served as an elementary  school teacher in the South Bronx before becoming a high school  guidance counselor and dean of students, where I served for 3\1/2\  years.   Realizing that our schools weren't doing enough to unlock the  unlimited potential of our kids, I wrote a proposal and opened up a  public middle school in the northeast Bronx, where I served for 10\1/2\  years as its principal.   Our mission as a school was simple: Listen to our students. Listen to  our families. Respond to the community's needs because that is what is  necessary to unlock the magic, magnificence, and brilliance of our  kids. I scoured the Earth to find additional grants and resources to  bring into our school.   We didn't just invest in traditional curriculum, we invested in the  holistic development of our kids. Now, what does that mean?   That means that we made sure that we focused on language arts, we  focused on mathematics, we focused on science, but we also focused on  STEM and STEAM, music, the arts, play, gym, mental health supports,  food security, adult education, and everything to ensure the full  development of our students and support for their families.    Mr. Speaker, I have to say to the House Chamber and to America,  education, I argue, is the number one national security issue in our  country. Because of historic miseducation, separation, and segregation  across race and class, we continue to have these battles rooted in  sexism, racism, and discrimination. We continue to have an economy that  doesn't work for all Americans. When we invest in education, we invest  in shared prosperity from rural America to urban America and everything  in between.   Imagine a Nation where every single child, regardless of learning  style, background, or race had access and opportunity to the American  Dream.   When we invest in education, we have better healthcare, economic, and  obviously, education outcomes. We deal with the issue of public safety.  We deal with the issue of mass shooting. We deal with the issue of mass  incarceration.   Invest in our children. Invest in our schools. Let us stop neglecting  this critical area. We need to invest in this space in order to save  our democracy and take it to the next level.                            ____________________
