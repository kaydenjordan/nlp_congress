 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of the MORE Act and I applaud my colleagues, Chairman Nadler  and Barbara Lee, for their leadership on this critical legislation.   For years, public support for marijuana legalization has surged.  Thirty-seven States have voted to legalize marijuana. It is past time  that Congress answers the call for marijuana justice.   This sweeping legislation would finally decriminalize cannabis at the  Federal level by removing it from the Controlled Substance Act. The law  would apply this retroactively to prior and pending convictions that  have disproportionately harmed communities of color.   The MORE Act would also help those whose convictions are overturned  through the Opportunity Trust Fund that would provide job training,  reentry assistance, legal aid, and healthcare.   If we are serious about criminal justice, we need to get rid of the  antiquated cannabis laws. The MORE Act would do just that. I hope my  colleagues will join me in voting on this long overdue bill.
