 Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to introduce to the  House and bid welcome to Father Mike Gutierrez today. He is the pastor  at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church and school in the city of  Baldwin Park in California. Thank you, Father, for coming from Baldwin  Park and for the wonderful prayer.   Father Mike, as he is known--he doesn't use Gutierrez--leads a parish  of 10,000 families with a focus on Filipino and Hispanic communities.  He has increased participation in religious and educational programs,  youth and family ministry, and allows the church to bring attention and  encourage activism on issues impacting the area.   He is an integral part of the 32nd District's, my district, annual  immigration clinic event and is known for his joviality and smiling  consistently.   Since my move to the California 32nd, he has been helpful in many  issues and events that I have put forth, recognized by the California  State Legislature and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles for support of  social issues.   Father, thank you. Thank you for today's blessing and for the work  you do to spread and promote Gospel throughout the San Gabriel Valley.   May God continue to bless you and your ministry.                            ____________________
