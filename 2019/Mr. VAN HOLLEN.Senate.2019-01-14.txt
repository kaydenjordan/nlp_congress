 Madam President, first, I thank my colleague from  Maryland, Senator Cardin, for his steadfast efforts to bring this  shameful shutdown to an end. He and I have met with Federal employees  all over the State of Maryland to bring their stories here to the floor  of the Senate.   While they are under incredible hardship and incredible duress, the  first thing they tell us at every meeting is that they want to get back  to work for the American people, to do their job for the American  people. These are civil servants; these are public servants; and they  want to get back to helping the country.   To my friend and partner and colleague, Senator Cardin, I thank him  for all of his efforts in this shameful episode of our history.   President Trump often falsely boasts that he has accomplished what no  other President in American history has been able to do. This time, he  has succeeded. This time, he has succeeded in closing down the Federal  Government for a longer period than any other President in United  States history--24 days and counting.   President Trump said just a few weeks ago that he would be proud-- proud to shut down the government if he didn't get his way. But  President Trump should know that reaching this historic milestone is  nothing to be proud of. It is unnecessary, and it is shameful. Every  day that goes by, we see mounting harm around the country both in terms  of members of the public who are denied important services and denied  important health protections and, of course, Federal employees and  Federal contractors who are either going without pay--all of the  Federal employees who are going without pay, and Federal contractors  have been laid off in many cases.   Every day that this shameful shutdown goes on, our colleagues on the  Republican side and the Republican leader have to own up to their share  of the responsibility. Every day that goes on where we do not have a  chance to vote on the two House bills that are on the Senate calendar,  which we could take up this afternoon--every day that we do not vote on  those bills, which have had bipartisan support here in the U.S. Senate,  the Senate is an accomplice in the shutdown, and those who prevent us  from turning the keys to reopen the government are complicit in the  harm that is increasing every day around the country.   On Friday, 800,000 Federal employees began to get pay stubs that  showed zero pay. I have one in my hand from somebody who is an air  traffic controller. If you look at the area that says net pay, it has a  big goose egg--zero. Among these 800,000 Federal employees, of course,  are hundreds of thousands of people--like the folks at TSA, like the  folks along the border--who are working every day, but in the mail or  in their electronic pay stub they get zero for their pay.   Of course, there are hundreds of thousands more who are being  furloughed, who want to get out and do their work for the American  people, and they are being locked out of their jobs.   I have been talking with many of my constituents over the last  several weeks, and I have shared many of their stories here on the  floor of the Senate. They talk passionately and personally about how  they want to get back to work and also about how they worry about their  ability to provide for their families.   I met with Edward last week. He works at the Census Bureau. He is the  only person in his family to have gone to college. He is very proud to  be a civil servant and wants to do his job. He owns a home, and his  mortgage payments are coming due every month, like those of millions of  Americans. While those mortgage payments are coming in, his paycheck is  not. He told me he is very worried that he will soon miss a payment.   It is important to understand that the harm from this shutdown is not  just felt in the Washington metropolitan area. Of course, Americans  around the country are losing access to services, and it is a fact that  80 percent of the people who work for the Federal Government live  outside the Washington metropolitan area. TSA officials at airports  throughout the country are just one example.   It is also important to recognize that about 30 percent of the  Federal workforce are people who previously served our country in  uniform. They were in the military. That means that as a result of this  shutdown, 250,000 Americans--in fact, a little more than that--who  served our country in the military are also suffering and going without  pay.   One of those veterans is somebody I spoke to last week, an Air Force  veteran who works at the Office of Personnel Management. He told me he  was worried that he wasn't going to be able to pay his electric bill on  time. He told me he had contacted the electric company and said: Look,  I am not going to be able to pay you this month because I am not going  to get a check. Can you just hold off? Can you defer my bill?   They told him: Sorry, that really isn't our responsibility.   It really is our responsibility here in the U.S. Senate--and, of  course, the President of the United States, who said that he was proud  to shut down the government. I would like the President to visit  Maryland and look at that Air Force vet who now works as a civil  servant and tell that Air Force vet that he is proud to be shutting  down the government.   There are other veterans around the country. As I said, the harm from  this is not confined to the Washington metropolitan area. Toby Hauck  served our country in the Air Force and continues  [[Page S172]]  to serve as an air traffic controller in Illinois. His son and  daughter-in-law are about to deploy overseas, and Toby and his wife are  going to care for their 2\1/2\-year-old daughter--their granddaughter-- during this deployment. Toby says that the continued lack of pay adds  stress to their already hectic jobs. This is something I have heard  from other veterans, air traffic controllers, and others going without  pay throughout the State of Maryland.   In fact, we know from a lot of the Federal employees who work in law  enforcement that the impact on their jobs is hurting our national  security. Just reading from an article in the Washington Post,  ``Shutdown threatens national security, FBI agents group warns,'' it  goes on to say: ``A group representing FBI agents warned Thursday that  the partial government shutdown is threatening national security as  thousands of federal law enforcement professionals, working without  pay, grow anxious that personal financial hardships may jeopardize  their security clearances and as furloughs of their support staffs slow  investigations.''   I spoke to a Federal law enforcement officer just last week. He made  exactly the point made by others in this article, which is that his  entire support team has been furloughed. These are the folks who track  down DNA analysis; these are the people who do the investigations. When  they are furloughed and when they are not on the job, it puts their  colleagues who are on the job--in the FBI or other Federal law  enforcement missions--at greater risk, and it puts the public at risk  to the extent that those FBI agents are not able to fully do their job.   The harm is spreading. We know that a lot of Federal contractors,  including a lot of small business folks who do work with the Federal  Government, have had to lay off people. I know that because, in my  State of Maryland, a small outfit that contracts with the Federal  Government to help seniors find work just had to lay off 173 employees  last week. Senior Service America is the name of the organization. They  do great work, but they just had to send pink slips to 173 people  saying: At least for now, you are out of work, and you are out of a  paycheck.   Again, this is something we are seeing and witnessing around the  country. A business in Denver, CO--Sky Blue Builders--had to stop work  on several Federal contractor jobs for Federal construction projects  they were doing. The GSA--General Services Administration--put their  projects on hold, and a 50-person company had to lay off 8 carpenters  and a superintendent because of the shutdown. They will need to lay off  more in the days ahead if the shutdown continues.   Every day that goes on, we see a mushrooming effect in terms of the  damage and harm being done throughout the country. A lot of the folks  who work for these small business Federal Government contractors are  already getting low-wage paychecks; now, they are out of income  altogether.   One of those workers is Lila Johnson. She is a janitor at the  Department of Agriculture. She works for a company, and that company  contracts with the Department of Agriculture to provide janitorial  services.   Lila is 71 years old. She has bills coming due for her rent, her  credit card, and her car. Here is how she has described the impact of  the shutdown:         I don't have enough from my retirement and my Social       Security to make ends meet. Everything is piling up on me,       and I don't know how I'm going to have the money to pay these       bills.    I don't know how many of my colleagues saw President Trump the other  day. He sort of waved off reporters when they asked him a question  about the harm being done as a result of the shutdown. The President  said he can relate to these people who are just one paycheck away from  not being able to make a mortgage or not being able to make a medical  copayment. He said:         I can relate. I'm sure the people that are on the receiving       end will make adjustments. They always do.    Give me a break. The President clearly doesn't realize that 40  percent of our fellow Americans cannot pull together even $400 for an  emergency. They do live paycheck to paycheck.   When you have grown up with a background of privilege, as the  President has, you really have not experienced that kind of hardship.  Between Trump Tower, the White House, and Mar-a-Lago, it is pretty  clear the President doesn't have a clue about what our fellow Americans  are experiencing in this shutdown.   Because all of these Federal employees are unable to do their jobs-- in many cases, for the country--and because the small business  contractors are not able to do theirs, every day you are seeing the  growing, harmful impact of the shutdown in terms of denial of important  services and protections for the American people.   We know now the FDA is no longer conducting their routine food safety  inspections. We know the EPA has halted inspections of major polluters,  including chemical factories. We know 1,000 affordable housing  contracts have expired because of the shutdown, which can delay  critical repairs and place families at risk of eviction. We have seen  trash and waste piling up at our national parks.   Despite the efforts of the administration to hide a lot of these  impacts, the result has been a disaster. At Joshua Tree National Park,  we saw motorists cut down several of the iconic Joshua trees so they  could drive in areas of the park where vehicles are banned, and vandals  have sprayed graffiti in the park. That is just one example among many.   Why is this happening? It is because the President says, if he  doesn't get his way entirely, he is going to be ``proud''--that is his  word, not mine--to shut down the government.   I can tell you what it is not about. It is not about the need for  strong border security. We need secure borders. I think Senators on  both sides of the aisle know that over the years, we have worked on a  bipartisan basis to do that. We certainly can continue to work on a  bipartisan basis to do it going forward.   I know Senators on both sides of the aisle recognize that wasting  taxpayer dollars on a 2,000-mile-long wall is not the answer. For  goodness' sake, the President's own Acting Chief of Staff--a former  colleague of mine in the House of Representatives--Mick Mulvaney said a  couple of years ago that it was childlike to believe that building that  2,000-mile wall was going to actually provide the kind of security we  need.   We need a multilayered approach. Yes, there are areas along the  border where we need barriers, fences, walls. Call them what you want.  They are already there. They were there before President Trump was ever  elected President.   What was the President's budget request this year for this part of  the Homeland Security budget? What was his request in the official  document he sent for this fiscal year? He asked for $1.6 billion. That  is what the Senate Appropriations Committee voted for on a bipartisan  basis, $1.6 billion.   It was only in December, when all of a sudden you have the rightwing  talk show hosts going 24/7, spinning the President up, that all of a  sudden, oh, boy, I guess I didn't really mean what I asked for; I need  something else.   Then, to justify the $5.7 billion, he did this national address the  other night. What was the very first example he gave for why we needed  this border wall? The very first example he gave was to interdict and  stop the flow of drugs across the southern border. That was the first  item he mentioned in the speech. He focused on it. By focusing on that,  he demonstrated the argument against spending all this money on a  2,000-mile border wall.   As everybody knows, including his Department of Homeland Security, to  the extent we have drugs coming across the southern border--and this is  a big issue--they are actually coming through the legal points of  entry, so building a wall on all sides of the legal points of entry  will not do a thing. We all know that on a bipartisan basis, we have  looked for new technologies and new investments to better detect drugs  that are flowing through those legal ports of entry.   My goodness, we can certainly talk about further steps that can be  taken, but the leadoff point in the President's speech showed his  ignorance about the overall issue on how we need effective border  security.   We should not be spending what will ultimately be $30 billion on a  2,000-mile wall the President said Mexico was  [[Page S173]]  going to pay for. Make no mistake. We are talking about $30 billion  because the President may ask for one amount this year. It started at  $1.6 billion. That was his official request. Then, in December, it was  $5.7 billion. Now he is going to threaten to shut down the government  every year if he doesn't get his $30 billion, which Mexico was going to  pay for.   I know he is doing all sorts of dances, saying that is not quite what  I meant, but that is what he told the country.   Since we are talking about border security, let's talk about some of  the men and women who, right now, today, as we gather here, are  defending that border, providing border protection. I will tell you  what, the folks at Customs and Border Protection have had enough. The  Customs and Border Protection officers are suing the United States.  They are suing the President because of this shutdown and demanding  that they get paid for the work they are doing.   I know the President likes to talk about the good work a lot of those  men and women do at Customs and Border Protection, and they do, do good  work. They are now suing the President of the United States and the  U.S. Government because they are out there providing border security,  and they are now getting big goose eggs, big zeros for net pay for the  work they are doing.   I know Members of this body are not ``proud'' of this shutdown, as  the President of the United States is. He said he was proud. He hasn't  said otherwise, although he started pointing fingers now at everybody  else. He said he was going to take responsibility; that he would be  proud to if he didn't get his way.   Every day that goes by in this Senate that we don't take action,  which is within our power to take, this Senate becomes an accomplice in  President Trump's government shutdown. That is why, together with my  colleagues, we are going to continue to press the Senate and the Senate  Republican leader to take up the two House bills that are on the Senate  calendar, which are the keys to reopening the government.   The House of Representatives, on their very first day of the new  Congress, said their priority is reopening the government, and they  did. They passed those two bills.   I have had them on the floor before. I am going to show them again  because they are still on the calendar. They haven't disappeared. They  are still right there. One is H.J. Res. 1. It is a very simple bill. It  is a bill that would reopen the Department of Homeland Security through  February 8. It is identical, with respect to the Department of Homeland  Security, as to what this Senate did by a voice vote before Christmas-- identical. It says: Let's reopen the Department of Homeland Security at  current funding levels while we discuss the best and most effective way  to provide border security.   That bill was on the Senate calendar. Last week, standing right here,  I asked for unanimous consent to take it up and vote on it right away.  The Senate Republican leader denied that request.   Just last week, standing right over there, Senator Cardin brought up  the other bill that is on the Senate calendar that was passed by the  House to reopen eight of the nine Departments of the U.S. Government  that are closed and have nothing to do with Homeland Security or the  wall--nothing to do with it. That bill is right here, H.R. 21. Senator  Cardin asked for the Senate to vote on it. Again, it was blocked by the  Republican leader on behalf of the caucus.   As many of us have discussed, the great irony is, these are pieces of  legislation that have bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate.   As I said, the bill to reopen the Department of Homeland Security  through February 8 while we work on the best and most effective way to  provide border security is something we passed by voice vote.  Republican colleagues thought it was a good idea about 5 weeks ago. I  don't know why it is not a good idea to do the same thing today.   The other bill, which contains the funding levels through the  remainder of this fiscal year for the other eight of the nine Federal  Departments that are currently closed, also had broad bipartisan  support. One of the parts of that bill dealing with the Department of  Agriculture, the Treasury Department, the Interior Department, the  Department of Transportation, and the Department of Housing and Urban  Development passed this Senate by a vote of 92 to 6.   The House of Representatives said: Do you know what? We like the  funding levels the House put together, but let's send the Senate a bill  that was already supported by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in  the U.S. Senate, 92 to 6.   This bill, H.R. 21, contains those Senate funding levels voted on 92  to 6 to reopen all those Departments. This bill also includes measures  that were overwhelmingly passed in the Senate Appropriations Committee.  One measure was adopted in the Senate Appropriations Committee by a  vote of 31 to 0--Republicans and Democrats voting for it. That is in  the bill the House sent over.   The other bills relating to the Department of Commerce and the  Department of Justice passed the Senate Appropriations Committee vote  30 to 1. In this package the House sent us, you have bills that passed  the Senate Appropriations Committee by 30 to 0, 30 to 1, and the floor  of the U.S. Senate by a vote of 92 to 6.   It is a very simple question: Why is it that the Republican leader  refuses to allow this body to vote on measures that have already had  overwhelming support in this body and would reopen the government  today?   The answer we get is, well, you know what, the President of the  United States says he will not support it.   Do you know what? We are an independent branch of government. We are  a coequal branch of government, although these days I begin to wonder  if we relegated ourselves to the very bottom of the totem pole here.   There is no excuse not to vote. Ninety-two to six? That is a veto- proof majority. Let the President veto it. It has to come back here?  Ninety-two to six. I will tell you, the fact the others passed 30 to 0  and 30 to 1 in the Senate Appropriations Committee--that is a pretty  good indicator of their strong, bipartisan support. So let's not go  hide out. Let's not go hide out. Let's do our job in the Senate, and if  the President wants to veto it, let him do it. That is how the system  works. But nobody here should be hiding from accountability to their  constituents because the Republican leader refuses to hold a vote today  on what the Senate supported overwhelmingly in weeks past.   I do want to thank my colleagues for a measure that we passed last  week, passed it on Thursday or Friday. The Senate passed a provision  that was introduced by Senator Cardin and me and many other Senators  and that had some bipartisan support and cosponsorship and strong  bipartisanship here on the floor. We said that Federal employees should  not, at the end of the day, be the ones who have to bear the entire  burden of this shutdown they had nothing to do with. So we passed  legislation to make sure that when this shutdown is over, Federal  employees will be made whole in terms of their pay. That then passed  the House, and it is on the way to the President. It was on the way to  the President before the weekend. The Republican Senate leader said  that the President said he was going to sign it. Of course, that is  what the President said about the bill that passed the U.S. Senate  before Christmas to provide stopgap funding, so we will see. I hope  that is the case because Federal employees, at the end of the day,  should not be the ones who are penalized and never made whole.   But it doesn't address the problem before us right now, which is that  while those Federal employees--hundreds of thousands of them--are not  working, they are not there to provide important services for the  American people, and the harm done from the denial of those services is  growing every day. And of course it doesn't help those hundreds of  thousands of Federal employees--in fact, 800,000 Federal employees--who  are not getting paid now but have their bills coming through the door  every day. That creates great harm because when they can't pay the  bills, their creditors come after them. Even though, whenever this  shutdown ends, whenever it may be, they may get back pay, it is going  to be very hard for them to get back their credit rating. It is going  to be very hard to undo the damage that is being done to them by their  inability to pay their bills because of our inability to vote on two  House measures that the Senate  [[Page S174]]  has already supported on a bipartisan basis. So it doesn't solve that  very, very real problem, which is growing every day.   I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are hearing more and  more from their constituents--hearing from their Federal employees who  are going without pay, hearing from small business contractors who have  had their contracts cut and are at risk of going belly-up, from those  small contract employees who live paycheck to paycheck--and from the  American people who are being denied services on a growing basis.   So let's open the government. Let's vote on these two bills that  would accomplish that. We could do it tonight. Do it right now, as soon  as the Republican leader comes in.   I can assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to ask  consent to bring up those bills. We are going to continue to move to  bring up those bills because they are the one thing before the Senate  right now that we could vote on that would at least demonstrate that we  in the Senate are doing our job. It is the President's job to decide  whether he thinks it is a good idea, and if he thinks it is a bad idea,  he can veto it, and then it comes back to us.   Let's do our job here. Let's not contract to the President of the  United States our constitutional responsibilities. That is not how it  is supposed to work. And we need to do our job. Let's end the shutdown.  Let's reopen the government. We can have a conversation on the most  effective way to provide border security, but for goodness' sake, let's  release the hostages here. Let's release eight of the nine Federal  Departments that have nothing to do with homeland security or the wall.  Let's release the 800,000 Federal employees who are not getting paid.  Let's release all of the small businesses that do contract work for the  Federal Government, many of which are at risk of going belly-up. Let's  release the Federal contract employees who are now being told not to  come to work because the contract is not in effect during the shutdown.  Let's release all those hostages who have nothing to do with the  political dispute here.   Nobody should be proud of this shutdown, and so I say to the  President of the United States: Let's not take pride in being the  President of the United States who is now overseeing the longest  shutdown in American history. That is not a first that any President  should be proud of, and it is not something this Senate should be  complicit in.   Let's reopen the government. Let's vote on the House bills.   I yield my time.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
