 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee  on Rules, I call up House Resolution 509 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 509         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 397) to       amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to create a Pension       Rehabilitation Trust Fund, to establish a Pension       Rehabilitation Administration within the Department of the       Treasury to make loans to multiemployer defined benefit       plans, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendments in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committees on Education and Labor and Ways and Means now       printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       116-24 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided among and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and       Labor and the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Ways and Means; (2) the further amendment       printed in part A of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution, if offered by the Member       designated in the report, which shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as       read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in       the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for       division of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.

Sec. 3.  House Resolution 507 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 4.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of July 25, 2019, or July 26, 2019, for the       Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules       as though under clause 1 of rule XV.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules  Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 509, providing for  consideration of H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer  Pensions Act of 2019, under a structured rule.   The rule makes in order one amendment. The rule provides 1 hour of  general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committees on Education and Labor and Ways and  Means.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3239, the  Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in Customs and Border Protection  Custody Act, under a structured rule.   The rule self-executes Chairman Nadler's manager's amendment and  makes in order two further amendments.   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  the Judiciary.   Upon passage of the rule, House Resolution 507 will be considered as  adopted.   Finally, the rule provides suspension authority for this Thursday and  Friday, and standard floor recess instructions for the August district  work period.   Mr. Speaker, in a few days, we will be celebrating 200 days since  Democrats took back the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.  We have spent the past 8 months fighting for American families,  American values.   While Republicans spent 8 years in charge, what did they get done?   Their crowning achievement was a massive tax giveaway to corporations  to line the pockets of the superwealthy, while exploding the Federal  deficit by $1.5 trillion. Clearly, a tax scam was a result of special  interests having too much power in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to give back that power to the people, to the  American people that sent us here.   Democrats passed the For the People Act, which puts elections back in  the hands of the people and gets special interest out of the  government.   And instead of giving tax cuts to billionaires, Democrats, last week,  passed legislation to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.                                time  1230    And as a result, 33 million Americans will finally get a raise and no  more singling out to our young Puerto Ricans.   The Raise the Wage Act repealed a shortsighted Republican measure  that allowed employers to pay Puerto Ricans under the age of 25 a  measly $4.25 an hour for up to 4 years. I don't know about my  colleagues' backgrounds, but at 20 years old, I was raising a family,  and I could not have done that on $4.25 an hour.   And we proclaim to all the American women, whether you are a  supervisor at a fast-food restaurant, a nurse at a hospital, or a World  Cup-winning soccer player, women deserve equal pay for equal work.   And for Dreamers without permanent legal status who came here as  children and just want to contribute to the greatness that makes  America, Democrats passed the Dream Act so that they can have a pathway  to citizenship. My Republican colleagues refused to bring up the Dream  Act when they were in charge, even when, clearly, we had enough votes  to pass the bill.   Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of progress Americans wanted to see.  That is why elections matter.   Today, we are also voting on the Butch Lewis Act, to protect the  pensions of hardworking Americans.   I come from a proud union household. For 17\1/2\ years, I worked as a  911 dispatcher, and my husband was a member of the building and  construction trades for 20 years. We taught our children, our sons, to  work hard and save for their future, and we showed them the honor of  public service.   Mr. Speaker, in December of 2014, this body passed the Multiemployer  Pension Reform Act of 2014, a misguided bill that reneged on the  promise that we make to retirees that they will get the benefits they  worked and negotiated for. And here we sit, almost 5 years later, and  the multiemployer pension system is still on the brink of a real and  disastrous crisis.   While these plans have historically been a safe and secure retirement  option, many plans now face financial shortfalls because of the Great  Recession and other structural challenges, like a lack of new workers,  an increase in the number of retirees, and employees abandoning the  commitments that they made to their employees.   Around 130 of these plans covering over a million Americans are  rapidly running out of money to pay benefits that were promised to  these employees. Truck drivers, electricians, ironworkers,  steelworkers, coal miners, and many, many others participate in  multiemployer pension plans. More than 5,000 of my constituents, alone,  participate in multiemployer pension plans. These hardworking  individuals are staring down the possibility of losing their retirement  through no fault of their own.   I know that some of my colleagues are going to tar and feather this  bill. They are going to call it a bailout. They are going to say that  it is fiscally irresponsible. But this bill only authorizes loans,  loans for multiemployer  [[Page H7259]]  pension plans, if it is clear that those loans can be repaid with  interest.   This is not a bailout; this is a loan. And I am happy to have my  staff provide a dictionary if any of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle are still confused about the difference and the meaning of  each.   Hardworking American workers and retirees are counting on us to  protect the benefits that they have earned and keep them on a solid  financial footing. H.R. 397 does that exactly, and all without forcing  workers and retirees to pay a single cent more for the benefits that  they have earned.   Now, I would like to turn our attention to H.R. 3239, Humanitarian  Standards for Individuals in Customs and Border Protection Custody Act.   I have had the opportunity to witness the horrendous conditions at  our southern border, children jailed in freezing cold cages, toddlers  going without nutritious food. They need to grow up and be healthy and  strong. Six-year-olds who are not allowed to shower. Border Patrol  agents parading asylees around with degrading messages hanging from  their necks.   This is the greatest country in the world, and no child--no child-- should die in our custody and in the greatest custody in the world.  Jakelin Caal should not have died. Felipe Gomez should not have died.  And Carlos Hernandez should not have died.   We cannot bring these children back from the dead, but we can try to  prevent the next child from dying. And we must. We must because we have  a moral responsibility to these children.   Today we have the opportunity to act. The Humanitarian Standards for  Individuals in Customs and Border Protection Act would protect the  health and safety of children in CBP care. It will bring medical  expertise to the border so that children receive the care that they  need, and it will ensure that children have access to the basics:  nutritious food, a shower, toothpaste, and clean clothes.   I urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation. Vote  ``yes'' on the rule for the children. Vote ``yes'' on the bill for the  children.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if my colleagues had read the bill, they would know that  not only are there numerous incentives for plans to repay the loans,  there is a statutory requirement for plan actuaries to demonstrate that  the plan will be able to pay the loan back with interest.   Let's talk about how we got in this situation. After the 9/11  attacks, the airline industry was in desperate need of help, and  Congress stepped up and approved loan assistance. We acted because it  was seen as an emergency.   In 2008, during the greatest financial crisis in our lifetimes, Wall  Street banks and the auto industry were in trouble and in desperate  need of help. Congress again acted because it was seen as an emergency.   Mr. Speaker, what makes this situation any different?   Congress disbursed approximately $624.6 billion in taxpayer money  during these emergencies, and roughly $699.7 billion has come back:  revenue, interest, fees, and asset sales. Ultimately, it earned  taxpayers more than $75 billion in profit.   To the 898 retirees of Texas' 26th Congressional District, I say to  you: Democrats have your back, and Democrats are fighting for you.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, painting this greedy picture  of union bosses who mismanage funds and overpromise benefits doesn't  get us anywhere, and it is simply not true.   I will tell you what is true. What is true is that 399 retirees in  Texas' Congressional District 19 will lose. But guess what? Democrats  got your back in Texas 19. Know that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Ruiz).                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the joint select committee held five hearings. Enough  with the talk. These hardworking American retirees are demanding  action. They want Congress to act.   We are here because of failed IRS regulations in the eighties and  nineties that deterred employers from increasing contributions in times  of surplus. We are here because when a contributing employer went  bankrupt, the remaining employers got saddled with the unfunded  liabilities.   Most importantly, we are not here because of the millions of  Americans participating in these plans. They did nothing wrong.   I want to point to one plan in Wisconsin's First District. There are  3,285 retirees. And, to them, I want to repeat and say: Democrats in  Congress have your back.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, at the core, how we choose to vote on these bills  reflects our values.   This morning, I read a report that a school district in Pennsylvania  tried to create a family separation program in order to collect school  lunch debts. Imagine that. Family separation because children are too  poor to pay for their lunch.   This maltreatment at our southern border is spreading across our  Nation, dehumanizing people because they are poor. This is how we want  to treat the weakest among us?   Will we lock children in cages and allow babies to sit in dirty  diapers for days, give asylees toothbrushes but no toothpaste, and deny  children regular showers and proper medical care?   Will we turn a blind eye when children are dying at the hands of the  CBP officers?   Will we watch as retirees are forced to choose between paying for  rent, paying for groceries, or paying for their medication?   Will we stand by and watch as our neighbors, our parents are forced  to stretch their medication because they are being denied the pension  that they were promised, that they worked for?   We are a country where migrants and asylees can come for a better  life. We are a nation where you can work hard and retire with the peace  of mind that you have earned your keep.   Democrats are fighting to protect the promise of the American Dream  for everyone. Mr. Speaker, I can only speak for myself when I say this,  but I refuse to be a party to breaking that promise, because it means  that much to me.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and to pass these  critical pieces of legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                      Amendment to House Resolution 509         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 10. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 54) establishing the       Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension       Plans. The concurrent resolution shall be considered as read.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       concurrent resolution to adoption without intervening motion       or demand for division of the question except one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the Majority Leader       and the Minority Leader or their respective designees.        Sec. 11. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 54.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
