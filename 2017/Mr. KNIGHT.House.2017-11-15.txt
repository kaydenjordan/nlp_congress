 Will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Speaker, if you want to demonize or scare people,  you come down and yell and scream and raise your hand and you say  things that they haven't looked into.   What I did was talk to people in my district and looked at their  rates and said: Let's look at your taxes and kind of work them through.   I found that people in the lower-income rate in my district got  relief. People in the middle-income rate got relief. This happened  right across the board to everyone we kept talking to.   So I would say that, before you come down and yell and scream and try  and scare people on something you might have heard from a talking head,  actually work with your people. It works.   Madam Speaker, if this bill is enacted, it will result in economic  growth across the country, especially in my home State of California.  The lower rates for individuals, families, businesses, and the tax  simplicity and certainty offered by this bill will provide net tax  relief to the middle class and our country's job creators.   We expect this bill to create nearly 1 million jobs nationwide, and  nearly 10 percent of those in California.   While the bill makes commendable strides toward a fair, simpler Tax  Code, I am concerned about how the bill could impact some of my  constituents as a result of the high level of income taxes imposed on  them by our State government.   I would ask the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee if he can  assure me that we continue our work and ensure the families in my  district are protected from such unintended consequences and that they  will be able to fully enjoy the benefits of this bill.
