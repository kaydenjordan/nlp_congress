 Madam Speaker, I rise to talk a little  bit about the national debt and accusations that have been made against  my colleagues in the House Republican Conference.   I have listened as a couple of my colleagues from the Democratic side  have accused us of playing chicken and gambling, and have said they are  glad that we are going to be educated on the impacts of a default on  the debt. I will tell you, I agree with a lot of the consequences that  have been outlined about the default.   What I want my colleagues to recognize on the other side of the aisle  is that 2 days before Christmas a bill passed this House, 4,126 pages,  and spent $1.7 trillion dollars. That bill was negotiated among four  people: Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Schumer, President Biden, and  Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.   When President Biden signed the bill on December 30, what I want my  colleagues to know is that we had already hit the debt limit on  December 30.   I have the Daily Treasury Report dated December 30 of 2022. The  national debt subject to the limit was $31,347 trillion. The statutory  debt limit is $31,381 trillion. Now, technically, we were 99.89 percent  of the way to the debt limit. For all practical purposes, if you spent  99.89 percent on your credit card, you are there.   The four people who negotiated it had to know that we were less than  one-tenth of 1 percent away from hitting the debt limit the day that  legislation was signed. All they had to do in that 4,000-page omnibus  bill was write one sentence to change the debt limit to what it would  have taken to fund their omnibus bill.   One sentence would have changed the debt limit in this country, and  we wouldn't be having the discussions we are having today about  default--but they didn't do that.   January 19 was 20 days after that bill was signed, and now they are  accusing House Republicans of being fiscally demented and not paying  attention, playing chicken, and gambling with America's future.   The four people that negotiated that deal had four choices. They  could have passed a continuing resolution with a debt limit included.  They could have passed a continuing resolution without the debt limit.  They could have passed an omnibus bill and included the debt limit.  They could have passed an omnibus bill and not included the debt limit.   There was only one of those choices that would have led to the  current situation where everybody points the finger at House  Republicans and says you are gambling with. The one choice that led to  the current situation is an omnibus bill without the debt limit  included.   Guess what those four, with 160 years of political experience, chose?  They chose the one that would lead to the current situation.   They could have included the debt limit in the piece of legislation  that was adopted and signed on December 30. They chose not to. You  don't need to point the finger at Republicans and say we are gambling  and playing chicken.   The fact of the matter is, the four people that negotiated the  omnibus bill knew exactly what they were doing. This crisis was  intentionally created, and it is something that we are going to have to  work together to get out of.   We have $32 trillion in debt. In 2019, we had $21 trillion. We can't  keep running at a $2 trillion deficit every year.                            ____________________
