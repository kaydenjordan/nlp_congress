 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, the distinguished  ranking member, and I thank my friend Mr. Royce, the chairman of the  committee, for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 397, reaffirming the  commitment of the United States to NATO's principle of collective  defense as enumerated in article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.                                time  1515    As the head of the U.S. delegation to the NATO Parliamentary  Assembly, and as rapporteur for the Transatlantic Subcommittee, I can  attest to the anxiety within NATO regarding the administration's  commitment to the alliance.   Case in point, one cannot talk about the U.S. commitment to article 5  in 2017 without mentioning President Trump's failure to embrace it in  full view of our NATO allies when he was in Brussels earlier this year.  It has been widely reported that even the President's own national  security team was blindsided by the omission.   I welcome this resolution, but it would have made a stronger  statement to bring it to the floor immediately after the President's  disconcerting speech in Brussels. This resolution maybe is less a  profile in courage as it is a sigh of relief.   Since the House failed the leadership test on this account, let's  redeem ourselves by taking up the Engel-Connolly bill on Russian's  sanctions, and the Iran-Russia sanctions package recently passed in the  Senate by 98-2, and send it to the President's desk for signature.   Any delay only furthers the trend of obsequiousness to the executive  branch and enables this administration's disastrous retreat from global  leadership.   I am proud to support this resolution, I am glad it is on the floor,  and I hope it is an auger of things to come.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.   I rise to remind us that Martin Luther King once said: ``Injustice  anywhere threatens justice everywhere.''   We are all in this together. The idea that we can cherry-pick whose  rights we will proclaim and defend is a mistaken notion. It is also un- American. So the future rights of LGBT members in Chechnya are  important to Americans, and we need to stand up for their security,  their safety, and their fundamental human rights.    This resolution is important. I congratulate the chairman and ranking  member for bringing it before us. I congratulate my good friend, Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen, and David Cicilline for their leadership. I am proud to  support this resolution today.
