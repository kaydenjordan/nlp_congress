 Mr. President, before I make my prepared remarks, I would  like to note the fact that this is the first time that I am returning  to the floor of the Senate since the events of January 6. It was in the  early morning hours of January 7 that we concluded our business and  left this Chamber to return to our homes for the interim period.   We left, knowing that something terrible had happened in this  building on January 6, but we didn't know the extent of it. As Members  of the Senate, we were largely protected from this terrorist  insurrection, which took place in this building.   It was about 2:15 p.m. on that afternoon of January 6, when Vice  President Pence was presiding over the Senate and most of us were in  our seats, that there was a commotion at the Chair and the Secret  Service came in and literally pulled the Vice President away from that  podium and took him out the door. We weren't sure what was happening.  It all unfolded quickly. There was an effort to make a quorum call to  determine which Senators were on the floor. It was interrupted when a  representative of the Capitol Police stood where the Presiding Officer  is now seated and instructed us to stay in this room, in this Chamber,  in the Senate, in our chairs. The staff people and surrounding offices  were going to line the walls. This was going to be a safe place of  refuge for whatever was going on.   I remember that moment particularly because something happened, which  is etched in my memory. Two plain clothes officers came down into the  well of the Senate and stood there, just a few feet from where I am  standing. One of them had an automatic weapon around his neck. I  couldn't imagine what was going on, where, in the U.S. Senate Chamber,  it was necessary to have that kind of firepower.   He stayed there for a few minutes, and then we were told to leave and  leave quickly. We filed out the doors and down the steps and walked  across through the tunnel to the Hart building, where Members of the  Senate were safely protected.   That is one of the reasons I wanted to say a word this afternoon and  this morning. The Capitol Police, throughout this, were heroic. They  were overwhelmed by this massive insurrectionist mob. The Capitol  Police, as well as the others who joined them--the DC Metropolitan  Police and other law enforcement agencies, which I don't know the names  of as I stand here--I want to thank them all for literally risking  their lives for me, for Members of the Senate, for our staff, and  visitors.   It wasn't until the next day that we learned--that many of us  learned--that a Capitol policeman had been killed--killed by this mob.  My heart goes out to him and his family. I thank him and all of his  colleagues, men and women, who each day get up in the morning, put on  their uniforms, and come to this building to protect me and protect the  other Members of the Senate and the House and all of the staff who work  here. We will never be able to repay them in any words for what they  sacrificed and risked on January 6, but let us never, never demean what  happened that day. It was a terrorist attack--homegrown American  terrorist attack.   I know we are going to spend some time discussing who provoked that  attack. The Republican majority leader laid the blame, as he should  have, at the feet of the President, who invited this group to  Washington and then urged them to come march on Capitol Hill. I know we  will go into this matter with more detail at a later point.   But the fact of the matter is, we endured a great travesty and a  great violation of our Republic on that day. To think that in this  building--this building that we value so much--so many people came in  hell-bent on death and kidnapping and destroying this great Chamber and  the building around it. It is inconceivable that this happened in  America, and we have to come to grips with it in honest, truthful terms  and not say: Oh, that was yesterday's newspaper, and we have to move  on.   But there is good news--good news in light of the bad news that I  have just recounted. The good news is that by this time tomorrow, we  will have a new President and a new Vice President of the United  States.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as we begin the Congress and prepare to  welcome President Biden and Vice President Harris, I find myself  thinking of the words of the 13th century Persian poet, Rumi. He wrote,  ``Out beyond the ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field.  I'll meet you there.''   For the moment that we are living through, I would edit his words  slightly. I would say: Out beyond the ideas of right versus left, out  beyond the rigid confines of our current polarized politics, there is a  field of common good and common purpose. I hope we will all find the  courage to meet there, to work together in this place.   At another moment of dangerous division in America, Abraham Lincoln  prayed that the ``better angels of our nature'' would help us to  rediscover our common bond and pull back from the brink of a civil war.   Today, the Union, preserved through that war, is battered and  divided. For the first time since the Civil War, thousands of Federal  troops stand guard at our Nation's Capitol to protect it from attack by  American citizens.   Carpenters and other crafts people are still hard at work repairing  the doors and windows and furniture smashed to bits less than 2 weeks  ago by the insurrectionist mob. We must be better than this or we risk  losing our democracy.   I believe that beyond the killing field of weaponized politics, there  is still a field of shared dreams, which brings me to a specific reason  I take the floor of the Senate today.   I come to thank a remarkable woman who has devoted countless hours  over many years trying to help the Members of this Senate, Democrats  and Republicans, find that field on which we can work together.   Reema Dodin has been a member of my staff for more than 14 years. She  started as a law school intern in my Chicago office, and over the  years, she rose through the ranks: legislative assistant; research  director; Judiciary Committee staff member; floor counsel; and finally  my deputy chief of staff.   For years, my person on the Senate floor has been this woman, this  amazing woman. I am grateful for her service to the Senate and her  service to the people of Illinois and to our Nation. But tomorrow Reema  begins a new challenge as Deputy Director of the White House Office of  Legislative Affairs. This daughter of immigrants will make history as  the highest ranking Palestinian-American woman ever to work in the  executive branch of the President of the United States.   As the liaison to the U.S. Senate, she will continue to help the  Senate search for common ground on which to build a better future; only  now she will be doing it from a different office, with a much better  boss.   I know that she will be a tremendous asset to President Biden and the  Nation. In these divided times, it is rare to find a public servant  like Reema, whose excellence and integrity is so widely admired on both  sides of the aisle.   No one understands better than Reema--well, perhaps two people in the  Chamber might understand better--how this Senate works but only two. As  the saying goes, she wrote the book on it, coauthoring an insightful  tome entitled ``Inside Congress: A Guide for Navigating the Politics of  the House and Senate Floors,'' published in 2017 by the Brookings  Institution. It came this close to being a New York Times bestseller.  But maybe still, with this speech today, it will reinvigorate sales.   As floor director for the Senate Democrats, Reema has worked closely  with staff and Members on both sides of the aisle to whip bills and  overcome hurdles. No matter how long or pitched the debate, she has  always remained friendly, decent, optimistic, and dedicated. It was not  unusual to find her still at her desk at midnight or 2 in the morning,  sending her final whip alert or email of the day to Senate staffers  summarizing the day's activities and the next day's Senate agenda.   Reema acquired her political and diplomatic acumen through hard work  [[Page S54]]  and partly, it seems, through genetics. Her grandfather served as  Social Affairs Minister for the Kingdom of Jordan under King Hussein  and was involved in the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in the  1970s.   As I mentioned, Reema, like so many Americans, including myself, is a  child of immigrants. Her parents both came to the United States as  college students from Hebron, in the occupied West Bank.   Reema was born in North Carolina and grew up in Orange County, CA.  She graduated from the University of California at Berkeley, earned her  law degree from the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, and we  made her an honorary daughter of the land of Lincoln. She also is a  Truman National Security fellow; a New Leaders Council fellow; an Aspen  Socrates alumnus; a former term-member of the Council on Foreign  Relations; and a member of the Jenkins Hill Society, a consortium of  women in politics supporting women politicians.   Reema loves the Senate, and she loves the challenge of this great  Chamber. She loves to give tours in this Chamber to those who want to  know the procedure and the history of this beautiful room in American  history and the Capitol of our Nation. She cares about the people who  protect and preserve this building, including the maintenance people,  cafeteria workers, and everyone who works here.   Even after so many years of climbing the marble staircase from the  Senate floor to my office, she and I remain in awe of those time-worn  steps, the colorful Minton tiles that brighten the Senate floors, and  the majestic Brumidi frescos that adorn the walls.   During the recent siege of the Capitol, Reema worried for the safety  of Senators and their staff, police officers, and troops who were  defending this building, but she also worried about the priceless  paintings, statues, and other historical treasures that had been passed  down from one generation to the next as part of our national legacy.   Most of all, I know that Reema reveres the Senate as the place where  men and women representing all of the people and all of the competing  interests of the United States can reason and work together for the  common good of our Nation.   In her personal inscription to her book on the Senate, Reema thanked  me for taking a chance on folks with only dreams and no connections.   Well, Reema, tomorrow when you join the staff of the President of the  United States, Joe Biden, you will have the best connections in  Washington, and I know that you will use whatever opportunity presents  itself on this new assignment to bridge the gaps in America and bring  together the people of this country in a better, more caring nation.   I will forever be grateful for your many years of brilliant, loyal  service, and I wish you the best.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
