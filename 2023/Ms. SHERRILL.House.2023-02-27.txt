 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the strength of  the Ukrainian people after enduring 1 year of merciless attacks by  Russian forces.   The following is from a record entry on Friday that marked the 1-year  anniversary:   When Putin ordered his tanks and forces into regions like Mariupol  and Kharkiv, he thought Ukraine would fall in a matter of days. Instead  of an easy victory, Putin's war of aggression has been a dismal  failure.   The people of Ukraine refused to be forced into an authoritarian  state where any opposition is met with jail, torture, or murder. They  are prepared to pay the ultimate price for their freedom.   NATO is now more unified than ever in providing military, economic,  and humanitarian assistance to support Ukraine's right to sovereignty.   Since the invasion, the United States has provided unprecedented  support and coordination, which has helped the Ukrainian military make  exponential gains.   Picatinny Arsenal in my congressional district has been integral to  Ukraine's military success. They have developed the primary cannon  being used by the Ukrainian army and continue to be responsible for  every piece of ammunition being sent by the United States to Ukraine. I  remain committed to protecting the fundamental values of peace,  prosperity, and stability across the globe and in Ukraine.                            ____________________
