 Mr. Speaker, the 21st Century AIRR Act gives a voice  to rural America on aviation issues.   For too long, our aviation assets have been managed with little to no  input from the citizens in the real world who are most impacted. The  21st Century AIRR Act benefits rural and small communities through  local empowerment.   This bill enhances the Airport Improvement Program and ensures grant  availability for small airports in the years ahead. These grants  support infrastructure construction and rehabilitation critical to  local and regional economic development.   The bill also promotes air traffic control tower technology. This  promising concept has vast potential to allow rural airports to  maintain tower service at a far lower cost and to actually bring  service to airports that have previously been unable to support it.   The 21st Century AIRR Act is visionary, innovative legislation that  will make the long-needed improvements to more efficiently serve  American fliers and keep rural America connected to our aviation  system.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar) for his leadership in setting up this Special Order  on the importance of proper forest management, proper forest management  on our Nation's Federal lands. I would also like to thank him for his  unwavering support of my bill, H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests  Act of 2017.   It is my sincere hope that we see H.R. 2936 move off the floor of the  House with strong bipartisan support and then move through the Senate  and get it on the President's desk so he can sign this and we can start  the process of reversing something that has been going on for many  years.   As a person educated in forestry, I can tell you that forests grow  slowly. We almost don't recognize the change in the forest because it  happens so slowly over time. But given enough years, we see what has  happened to our timberland out West. I have a map here of all the  forest fires that we have seen out West this summer.   We didn't just get to this point overnight. It happened over a series  of years. It happened when, back in the 1990s, I believe, we had an  overreaction to probably some forest management practices that weren't  the best that they could be. The pendulum swung way too far, and we got  in a position where, what I say is, we were loving our trees to death,  and we stopped managing our trees.   But we kept putting fires out, and fire is nature's natural way to  manage overgrown forests. So what we have seen happen over time is we  have seen more insects and disease infestations. As these trees grow  closer together and fill the growing space, they start competing for  water; they start competing for sunlight; they compete for nutrients;  they become weak, and they become susceptible to insect attacks; they  become susceptible to disease; and then they die. We get lightning  strikes or we get fires to get out, and then we are dealing with a  catastrophic event.   But it doesn't have to be this way. If we would employ sound forest  management practices, we can do a lot to mitigate the intensity and the  number of these fires.   As we look at issues that are created with these fires, we know that  this has been the worst fire season on record, but it broke the record  that was set in 2015 as the worst fire season on record. I predict  that, if we don't start managing our forests now, in the next coming  years we are going to see new worst fire seasons on record.   This is a process that will continue to get worse unless we address  the problem. It is to the point where it is going to take time to  reverse what has happened and to get the forest back into a healthy  state.   I was notified this week about a sheep farmer down here in southeast  Wyoming, in Torrington, who was a young guy getting into the business,  and he lost five sheep. He took them to the veterinarian to do a  postmortem analysis and found out they died from smoke inhalation.   Now, the fire that was creating the smoke that was drifting down  there was about 800 miles away in Montana. If it is causing that kind  of health risk to sheep, what is it doing to the residents that live  out here? I know that there have been schools closed, there have been  people who have to stay indoors, but this creates a health risk. It is  more than just a risk to healthy forests. It is a risk to healthy  humans.   We have got another map here, and this shows the smoke drift on a  particular day. I believe this was September 14. This is a map that was  produced by NOAA, and you can see where the fires were, and you can see  how the winds carry the smoke. The red shows the most intense areas of  smoke, the lighter green the intermediate, and then the darker green  shows where the least smoke intensity was.   This map really illustrates how fires in certain areas, the smoke  gets picked up by the wind and gets carried to different places across  the country.   When I look at this map of the Western United States--and me being  from Arkansas, some might ask: How do these fires affect forestry in  Arkansas?   Well, we have talked about fire borrowing. When we take money from  one account in the Forest Service budget and put it in the firefighting  account, that takes money away from management practices that could  take place on the forest in Arkansas and other places to the east where  we don't have as many catastrophic fires. On top of that, we see how  the smoke drift affects many, many parts of the country.    When we think about the smoke, what is that smoke? It is mainly  carbon. One of the main purposes of a healthy forest is to fulfill the  cycle of photosynthesis, where it pulls carton dioxide out of the  atmosphere, takes that in through the leaves, converts it into sugars,  and releases oxygen back into the air. The forests clean the air except  when they are burning at the rate that they are burning right now, at  8.5 million acres of our Federal timberland that went up in smoke,  putting hundreds of millions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere. If  we want to talk about taking carbon out of the atmosphere, the solution  to that is a healthy forest.   But not only do forests clean the atmosphere, they clean the water.  The more ground cover we have, the more water gets filtered as it goes  into the ground, as it goes into streams.  [[Page H7741]]    But overstocked forests can also prevent water from actually getting  into the ground table and getting into streams. In areas in the West  where we are having water shortage problems, proper management of  forests can help to alleviate those problems.   We are not talking about clear-cutting. I get so tired of people  saying, ``All they want to do is clear-cut our Federal forests.'' We  don't want to clear-cut the Federal forests. We want to manage them. We  want to use practices like thinning from below, where we take out small  stock, where we take out the smaller trees. Some of it is merchantable;  some of it is not. We can produce timber that can be used in the rural  areas where it is grown to help the economies out there.   But the end goal is to have a healthy forest with larger trees spaced  further apart without all the fuel ladders going down to the ground so  that, when a fire moves through these areas, it burns at a low  temperature through the ground. And guess what. That creates great  wildlife habitats when we do that.   There are so many benefits of having a healthy forest, and as a  forester, a forester who was trained at a school that was started by  Gifford Pinchot, who is the father, along with Teddy Roosevelt, of our  Federal forests, it is embarrassing to me what has happened to our  Federal lands across this country.   Roosevelt and Pinchot talked about conservation. They talked about  leaving our resources in better shape than we found them in. Right now,  we are not doing that. We are allowing the lack of management to  destroy these resources for future generations. We are allowing the  lack of management to emit hundreds of millions of tons of carbon into  the atmosphere and also take that vegetation away that provides  wildlife habitat, that provides a filter for clean water, and that  provides timber that is pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.   We can do better than this. We have provisions in the Resilient  Federal Forests Act to allow the Forest Service to actually manage the  timber. We require them to do a no-management analysis, because when  you look at the dynamic nature of a forest, if you say, ``We are not  going to do anything,'' well, you just made a management decision.   Again, the trees are living, growing organisms. Even though the  Forest Service says, ``We are not managing it,'' they are going to  continue to grow. They are going to fill the growing space. If we  continue to suppress fire, the fuel load is going to get worse, and we  are going to have more and more forests subject to catastrophic  wildfire of, I believe it is, 192 million acres of Federal timberland  in this country. About 60 million acres right now, according to the  Forest Service, is subject to catastrophic wildfire.   It is time to act. We have waited too long, and the problem continues  to get worse. It will continue to get more severe as time moves on if  we don't start intervening now.   Mr. Gosar, I want to again thank you for putting this together, for  the efforts that you are putting forth so that we can take a proactive  stance to make not only our air cleaner by not having all these  catastrophic wildfires, but to conserve our forests so that they are  healthy, so that they are functioning the way that they should be.   I want to thank you again for all that you are doing, the work for  the Western Caucus and all the members here, realizing, on both sides  of the aisle, how important it is that we do the right thing, that we  pass H.R. 2936, and that we start addressing this problem now.
