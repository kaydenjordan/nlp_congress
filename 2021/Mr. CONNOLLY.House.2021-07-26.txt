 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, Congresswoman  Dingell, for her support, and the distinguished ranking member, the  Republican manager, for his support.   In a troubled time, when we seem like we can't get together, here is  an opportunity to come together, as we did 20 years ago on September  11.   I rise in support of H.R. 2278, designating the September 11th  National Memorial Trail Route, a 1,300-mile system of trails and  roadways that connect all three sites attacked on September 11, 2001:  The World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon here in Washington,  D.C., and the Flight 93 Memorial near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   As our Nation prepares for the 20th anniversary of September 11, we  have an opportunity to create a lasting legacy connecting all three  sites.   The trail provides trail-goers with a chance to reflect and learn  about our Nation's resilience and perseverance following that dreadful  day.   In addition to the three 9/11 memorials anchoring this route,  travelers can learn about our founding with stops at Valley Forge  National Historical Park and Independence Hall in Philadelphia or visit  the Antietam National Battlefield or the Gettysburg National Military  Park to remember some of the other darkest days in our Nation's  history.   This trail route connects travelers with these points in our history  and majestic landscapes, while driving further tourism and recreation  along its route.   It starts at the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington and extends northwest  to the Shanksville site in Pennsylvania. It continues east to New York  City's National September 11 Memorial & Museum. It then heads south,  following the East Coast Greenway, connecting to the Garden of  Reflection 9/11 Memorial. It then connects to the National Mall here in  Washington, D.C., and ultimately returns to the Pentagon Memorial,  remembering that dreadful incident at the Pentagon that cost so many  lives.   It extends through six States and the District of Columbia. It is a  multiuse trail, with more than 50 percent of the route off road. The  idea for the trail was born in the wake of September 11 at the Mid- Atlantic Governors Conference on Greenways, Blueways, and Green  Infrastructure.   Conference chair and then-director of the Virginia Department of  Conservation and Recreation, David Brickley, presented the vision for a  trail route connecting the Pentagon and the site of Flight 93 and the  Twin Towers in New York City. David founded the September 11th National  Memorial Trail Alliance in the following year to develop the September  11th National Memorial Trail.   This route would be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in  consultation with the affected landowners but would not be considered  as a unit of the National Park System or as part of the National Trail  System.   The Secretary would be authorized to produce and disseminate  educational materials and create an official symbol or trail marker to  mark the trail routes.   The bill authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with and  provide technical and financial assistance to other Federal agencies,  States, localities, and private entities, as may be required.   Designating the September 11th National Memorial Trail route will  serve as a natural embodiment of our pledge to never forget the heroes  and the victims of that terrible day.   It honors the memories of nearly 3,000 family members and loved ones  we lost on that day, and it is a tribute to the bravery of the heroes  that responded.   When I was a local board of supervisors member, I was in a fire  station, Fire Station 30, and I saw firsthand those first responders  who went to the Pentagon to try to save lives, putting their own lives  at risk.   Mr. Speaker, I hope this bill gives anyone touched by the tragedy of  9/11 an opportunity for reflection, comfort, and healing. It is also a  moment for us to come together once again to remember the heroes and  the victims of that day, to honor them, and to come together as  Republicans and Democrats in that pursuit.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and neighbor, the  Congresswoman from the District of Columbia for her work, and I also  thank the Republican manager for his kind remarks about a grieving  family in my district.    Last year, I brought a similar version of this bill to the floor  requiring Federal agencies to communicate safety plans to their  employees before returning to their offices. It is not an extra layer  of paperwork; it is a plan. You have just got to have a plan so that we  don't have more people like Chai Suthammanont dying from COVID. It  seems to me that is something we ought to come together on, on a  bipartisan basis.   While our country opens for business, COVID-19 cases and  hospitalizations that had been declining just a month ago are again on  the rise, and the dangerous delta variant accounts for 83 percent of  those cases in the United States.   Meanwhile, only 56.3 percent of the total U.S. population has had at  least one dose of the vaccine, and in 16 States, fewer than 50 percent  of the population has had at least one dose, including, I believe, the  State of the distinguished Republican manager today.   We are clearly not out of the woods, and we must look to ensure the  safety of both of our Federal workforce and our contract Federal  workforce as they return to the workplace.   The Chai Suthammanont Remembrance Act would require every Federal  [[Page H3880]]  agency to prepare and communicate a safety plan for how to do that.   The plan would include descriptions of the personal protective  equipment that the agency will provide to its onsite employees and  contractors; guidance of other mitigation efforts; protections for  employees whose work requires them to travel offsite; testing, contact  tracing, if necessary, and vaccination protocols; and procedures that  ensure the continuity of operations in the event it is necessary to  reverse onsite requirements.   The bill would also require every agency's inspector general to  report on whether the agency has published and implemented a safety  plan consistent with CDC guidelines.   We should not be looking to rush Federal employees back to offices no  matter what the cost, because that cost is too high. Already, two of  our colleagues in this body, who have been vaccinated, have contracted  the delta variant, apparently, of COVID-19. People are at risk.   The man for whom this bill is named tragically lost his life in May  of 2020. He was an immigrant from Thailand, who came here at the age of  17. He built a life as a man known for helping others.   Even in retirement, Chai's call to service brought him to work as a  Federal employee at the Marine Corps Community Services Child  Development Center in Quantico, Virginia. He worked to prepare meals  for the children of our Marines. He developed a unique handshake for  every kid at the daycare, making every child feel special and included.   On April 27, 2020, Chai worked his last full shift at the daycare  kitchen as one of his coworkers coughed repeatedly and looked very ill.  The problem was there were no protocols in place. That person  subsequently tested positive.                                time  1645    A month later, after 13 days on a ventilator, my constituent, Chai,  lost his life unnecessarily, because there was no plan. There were no  protocols.   This bill would prevent that. This bill will save lives. I plead with  my friends on the other side of the aisle, please let's not make this a  political pawn.   For the sake of Chai, his surviving widow, his family, his loved  ones, his colleagues at the Marine base at Quantico, can we not do the  right thing?   I could talk a lot about the need for this, Mr. Speaker. I could talk  more about Chai and his family, but I rest on the hope and belief that  today on this matter we will hear the better angels of our nature and  make sure that no more Chais have to die because of a lack of protocol  and the lack of a plan simply to protect the workforce in the Federal  workplace.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from District of  Columbia, and I thank Mr. Keller, the Republican manager, for his kind  words and his support.   Current law requires Federal agencies to develop a performance plan  every year that defines the agency's mission, summarizes strategic  goals and objectives, and identifies strategies to achieve them.   Agencies use that plan to align resources and guide decision-making  to accomplish priorities and improve outcomes.   These performance plans should support planning across organizational  operating units and describe how agency components are working together  toward common results that serve the public.   They should inform agency decision-making about the need for major  new acquisitions, strategic human capital planning, evaluations, and  other evidence-building and evidence-capacity building investments.   Moreover, the performance plans can also stimulate innovation to  advance agency goals.   With such a broad and robust purpose, these plans should be prepared  collaboratively by agency leadership using the best available data and  evidence to form a strong foundation from which to execute agency  missions.   Current law, however, requires only the chief human capital officer  to contribute to the creation of this performance plan. Current law  does not require agencies to incorporate data and evidence or  information technology solutions into their performance plans. In the  21st century.   These narrow requirements overlook the invaluable expertise of key  stakeholders and crucial resources in the formation of agency plans and  exclude a critical area of agency planning.   For example, chief information officers must identify and plan for an  agency's IT needs.   IT is critical to mission delivery at every agency. Missions are  threatened by outdated legacy systems, software, and hardware, to say  nothing of their being cyber insecure.   CIOs deserve a seat at the table to engage in performance planning  that drives meaningful IT modernization so agencies can provide the  critical services upon which the American public relies. The pandemic  has certainly made that clear.   Current law exacerbates the lack of collaboration that plagues  leadership in many Federal agencies and stymies successful IT  modernization.   The Performance Enhancement Reform Act requires agencies to integrate  IT modernization and evidence metrics more effectively into their  performance plans and gives the CIO a seat at the table.   The bill requires agency performance plans to include descriptions of  human capital, training, data and evidence, IT, and skill sets needed  for the agency to meet its performance goals.   Finally, the bill requires performance plans to include descriptions  of technology modernization investments, system upgrades, staff  technology skills and expertise needed, stakeholder input and feedback,  and other resources and strategies.   As the distinguished gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  mentioned in her opening remarks, this is a bipartisan bill. My ranking  member, Mr. Hice from Georgia, collaborated with us fully in trying to  get to this point.   This is a good government measure. I certainly commend it to all of  our colleagues. If we approve this, we will take a giant leap forward  in trying to modernize performance planning for every Federal agency to  serve the American public better.
