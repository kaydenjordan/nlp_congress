 Madam Speaker, let me be clear. Everyone everywhere  should have the freedom to make their own personal healthcare decisions  without interference from politicians.   When the Supreme Court allowed the most restrictive abortion law in  the nation to go into effect in Texas, they made it clear that they  cannot be trusted to protect the constitutional right to an abortion.  That is why the Congress must act as other States are moving to follow  suit.   That is why Democrats are fighting to protect a woman's right to  choose. That is why we have removed the restrictive Hyde language from  all of our appropriations bills.   It is time to trust women, to respect their decisions. Healthcare is  not political, not negotiable.
