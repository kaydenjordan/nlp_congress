 Mr. President, the Nation watched in horror Friday as  a senseless act of violence changed a community forever. The Senate and  all Americans stand in mourning, sorrow, and sympathy with the  students, faculty, staff, and families of Santa Fe High School in  Texas.   No community should ever be subjected to such horror and heartbreak.  Our hearts go out to the families of those killed, to the wounded who  continue to battle injuries, to the first responders who leapt into  action, and to the Santa Fe community that rallies around them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, in the  coming days, the Senate will take up landmark legislation on one of our  top priorities: providing more options and better care to America's  veterans.   The VA MISSION Act is a major milestone in an ongoing effort by  Chairman Isakson and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to ensure that  our Nation fulfills its promises to our men and women in uniform,  including more than 300,000 veterans in my home State of Kentucky.   What Senator Isakson and his colleagues have put together is one of  the most comprehensive reform packages for veterans' healthcare since  the VA was created in 1930. It builds on the substantial success of the  Veterans Choice Act and harnesses provisions of 15 different Senate- introduced bills. This bill streamlines support systems, expands access  to care, and provides new tools for attracting and retraining top  caregivers.   The veteran who lives far from a VA facility but needs frequent  followup care will now have easier access to local providers and walk- in clinics. The wounded warrior navigating difficult pain management  routines will now be served by providers with clearer guidelines for  opioid prescriptions. The retired servicemember who relies on a family  caregiver will rest assured of expanded eligibility and program  benefits for veterans of all eras.   It is hardly surprising that this bill has such a broad bipartisan  coalition of support, including the endorsement of 38 of the Nation's  leading veterans advocacy organizations. I look forward  enthusiastically to considering it in the coming days.   I urge every one of my colleagues to support this legislation and  send it to the President for his signature. It is not merely our duty  but our privilege to improve and enhance the care available to those  who have given so much.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, later today we will  consider the nomination of Dana Baiocco, the President's choice to join  the Consumer Product Safety Commission.   Ms. Baiocco's resume speaks for itself. After receiving her J.D. cum  laude from Duquesne University, she clerked in the Western District of  Pennsylvania before launching an impressive career in private practice.   For two decades she has stood at the center of complicated cases and  gained national recognition for her mastery of the legal questions  surrounding consumer safety. This experience makes Ms. Baiocco an ideal  candidate to help the CPSC protect consumers effectively and  efficiently without imposing unnecessary barriers to free enterprise.   Testifying before our colleagues on the Commerce Committee, she  pledged to seek that balance with ``transparency'' and an ``open door  policy'' and to remain ``guided by the rule of law.''   I look forward to advancing this qualified nominee when we vote this  afternoon and urge all of my colleagues to join me.  [[Page S2782]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, earlier today,  President Trump signed into law a Congressional Review Act resolution  that repealed a particularly egregious overreach by President Obama's  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Federal regulators found a  loophole, skipped the standard period for review and public comment,  and issued unilateral guidance that made life needlessly complicated  for the American auto industry and its customers.   Thanks to Senator Toomey's tenacity, the GAO ruled that this  intrusion did indeed constitute rulemaking that ought to be subject to  congressional review. So Congress got to have its say. Accountability  won out in the end. Thanks to this resolution from Senator Moran, yet  another onerous regulation is now headed to the wastebasket.   Our record use of CRAs is just one of the tools Republicans are using  to get Washington out of the way of American workers and job creators.  Republican tax reform is providing historic tax cuts for middle-class  families and small businesses, and it repealed the individual mandate  penalty at the heart of ObamaCare.   Tomorrow, the House will vote on the Senate-passed legislation  championed by Senator Crapo, which will give community banks and credit  unions relief from the crushing burden of complying with Dodd-Frank.   Of course, in the executive branch, the President's team has turned  the page on the last administration's hostility toward American  business. The result is a palpable shift that is improving the entire  economy.   Back in 2013, more than three-quarters of U.S. manufacturers said  that a hostile climate due to taxes and regulation was a major business  obstacle. Three-quarters of the U.S. manufacturers said that in 2013.  Today, 16 months into the unified Republican government, fewer than 20  percent say that. It went from 75 percent who were concerned about  taxes and regulations in 2013 down to 20 percent today. Nearly 95  percent are optimistic about their future economic prospects.   Everyone is taking notice. Here is a New York Times headline from a  few months ago: ``The Trump Effect: Business, Anticipating Less  Regulation, Loosens Purse Strings.'' That is from the New York Times.   One Texas homebuilder told reporters, ``It's an overall sense that  you are not going to face any new regulatory fights.''   There is more investment, more prosperity, more job openings, and  higher wages all across the country. Good things happen when Republican  policies get Washington out of the American people's way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all postcloture time on  the Baiocco nomination be considered expired at 12 noon tomorrow; that  if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    For the information of all Senators, there will be two  rollcall votes at 12 noon tomorrow: a vote on the confirmation of the  Baiocco nomination for the CPSC, followed by a cloture vote on the  veterans' healthcare bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to a true  legend in South Louisville, KY: Pleasure  [[Page S2788]]  Ridge Park High School Baseball coach Bill Miller. The winningest coach  in the history of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association, KHSAA,  Bill unfortunately passed away after a yearslong struggle with cancer  at 68.   Pleasure Ridge Park High School, or PRP as we all call it, was Bill's  home away from home. He spent 50 years of his life there as a student,  an assistant coach, and, ultimately, for nearly four decades, as head  baseball coach. Working with the students, Bill influenced countless  lives and helped prepare young people for adulthood. The school's  athletic director Nick Waddell said, ``He was like a father to so many  people.''   Bill attended the University of Alabama after graduating from PRP,  playing baseball and one season of football. Leaving Tuscaloosa, Bill  returned to his hometown and to his high school as an assistant coach.  Then, in 1980, Bill was named PRP's second head baseball coach.   For the next 38 seasons, Bill's team dominated baseball in Kentucky  winning a record 1,144 games, including six State championships.  Baseball was Bill's passion, but it was more than just a game. On the  diamond, Bill saw it as his responsibility to help make boys into men.  He taught them the values of hard work, of competition, and how to  leave it all on the field.   Two and half years ago, when Bill was diagnosed, he refused to let  his disease stop him. He kept coaching and mentoring, even winning his  sixth State championship last year. When he couldn't coach, Bill would  be there on the sidelines, supporting his team.   Last month, Bill was inducted into the KHSAA Hall of Fame. Although  he wasn't able to attend the ceremony, he recorded a message to his  players, his fans, and his friends. Dozens of current and former  players, many of whom consider Bill to be a role model throughout their  lives, attended the ceremony to honor their coach.   When he passed away on April 23, Bill was surrounded by his loving  family and friends. In addition to all of his players, Bill is survived  by his wife and high school sweetheart, Vickie, and their children,  Matt and Megan. Following in Bill's footsteps, Megan is in her 15th  season as the head softball coach at PRP. Coach Bill Miller's legacy  will continue to be felt by this community, and I ask my Senate  colleagues to join me in remembering this remarkable Louisvillian.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 517, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  May 22; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed. I further ask that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Baiocco nomination under the previous order.  Finally, I ask that  [[Page S2800]]  the Senate recess following the cloture vote with respect to the House  message to accompany S. 2372 until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:22 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, May 22, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
