 Mr. Speaker, for the fourth time since 2010, the city of  El Paso is honored to be named an All-America City for our resiliency,  response to tragedy, and vaccination efforts against COVID-19 this  year.   The National Civic League awards the All-America City award to  communities where residents, organizations, and government work  together to address challenges and improve quality of life. When  President Biden announced his goal to vaccinate 70 percent of our  Nation, El Paso not only met the goal a month early, but we have  surpassed it and currently lead the country by 10 percent.   The All-America City award reaffirms our resiliency and outstanding  civic accomplishments in the face of the tragic August 3 domestic  terror attack and the devastating COVID-19 pandemic as well as our  continued goodwill toward migrants seeking refuge at our Nation's front  door.   El Pasoans are no strangers to challenges, and our strength is tested  over and over. Each time we grow stronger because we are and always  will be El Paso Strong.   It is an honor to represent this extraordinary community here today,  and I congratulate the city of El Paso.                            ____________________
