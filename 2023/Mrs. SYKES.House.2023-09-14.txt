 Mr. Speaker, we have just 16 days to pass a budget and  avoid a government shutdown; just 16 days to prevent a completely  unnecessary shutdown and manufactured crisis that will be devastating  for the people, families, and communities of Ohio's 13th Congressional  District and Americans.   These disruptions would interrupt critical government services,  hurting small businesses, and even forcing our troops to go without pay  and benefits.   Thousands of Federal workers and contractors who do vital work  throughout the country would not be able to do their jobs, creating a  lose-lose scenario where the public misses out on essential government  services and a lower quality of life.   Instead of governing, what has the majority decided to do? Focus on  partisan games meant to distract and divide our country. It is  reckless, irresponsible, and a complete failure of leadership.   People in Ohio's 13th District are tired of partisan politics. They  sent me to Congress to put people over politics, to lower costs, grow  the middle class, keep our community safe, and protect our fundamental  freedoms. I am committed to passing a budget that invests in the people  and communities of Ohio's 13th District, not extreme politics.   It is time to stop the political games, honor the bipartisan budget  agreement Congress already passed, and avoid a government shutdown. The  American people are counting on us to get this done. We cannot let them  down.                            ____________________
