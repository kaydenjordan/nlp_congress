 Mr. President, millions of acres of national forest in       Montana and across the West are at extreme risk of catastrophic       wildfire, and just throwing a whole bunch of money at the problem is       not going to solve it.        And one of the biggest barriers to responsible forest management is       the Ninth Circuit's Cottonwood decision that dates all the way back to       2015.        In a nutshell, the Cottonwood decision imposed additional redtape on       Federal Agencies and is having a crippling effect, crippling       consequences, on commonsense land management.        And that is not just what I or leaders of the wood products industry       believe; it is exactly what the Obama administration feared when they       fought against the Cottonwood decision in 2016 hoping the United States       Supreme Court would overturn it.        Well, they didn't overturn it. In fact, they said: Congress needs to       resolve this discrepancy between the Ninth Circuit and Tenth Circuit       court. So for 6 years, we have been working to reverse this disastrous       Ninth Circuit Cottonwood ruling so we would have commonality and       continuity across the entire United States versus this exception that       is applied just to Ninth Circuit States.        And, gratefully, for 6 years, there has been a good bipartisan effort       with strong support from conservation and sportsmen groups to do just       that. In fact, earlier this year, I had a bipartisan bill that would       fully and permanently fix this Ninth Circuit Cottonwood decision, and       it cleared the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with a very       strong bipartisan vote.        In fact, it was all primed to get across the finish line this year,       in this Congress. And by the way, healthy forest management, what it       does is it improves wildlife habitat, because catastrophic wildfires       destroy habitat. It also restores watersheds, because when you have a       catastrophic wildfire, in the spring when the rains come, they silt out       the trout streams and affect trout habitat.        They provide jobs for a timber industry that are needed badly in many       parts of Montana. When I was a kid growing up in Montana, we had over       30 active sawmills. Today, we are down to a handful.        But somehow, this bipartisan urgent need of reform was left out. And       let me paint you a picture of the effects of that Cottonwood decision.       This ruling has stalled hundreds of wildfire mitigation. It has stalled       wildlife and restoration projects across multiple forests and in some       cases has shut down forests in Montana and throughout the West       entirely.        And, sadly, the conditions in our national forests have deteriorated.       And too often, these catastrophic wildfires have occurred on the same       acres where management was stalled due to this Cottonwood decision.       And, sadly, it is only going to get worse.        What is more, this Ninth Circuit created a split in the courts       creating two different standards for forest management across the       United States. All my bill does is it applies a common standard, the       same standard, across the whole country, which that would include       Montana and the other Ninth Circuit States. And the time to make this       fix is now.        In March of 2018, Congress passed some partial reforms to respond to       the Cottonwood decision, but even these fixes expire in March of 2023.        A few months ago, the Forest Service testified that the failure to       act by March--as in about three months from now--will have devastating       impacts on land management.        In fact, according to the Forest Service in their testimony, if we       don't pass my bipartisan bill now, at least 100 forest plans will need       to go through reconsultation and redtape for no justified reason,       resulting in years of delays and millions of dollars wasted.        Not to mention, it will also undermine the investments that we made       here in Congress in the Great American Outdoors Act, probably the       greatest conservation win we have seen in 50 years in Washington, DC.        The failure to pass my Cottonwood solution is bad for wildlife. It is       bad for forest health. It is bad for habitat, and it is dangerous for       local communities.        There is no doubt the summers are getting longer. They are warmer.       This is an important mitigation strategy to address the issues of       warmer summers and longer summers, longer fire seasons.        I can tell you, I am deeply disappointed. After years of bipartisan       work and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed this bill 16       to 4 in a strong bipartisan vote, sadly, this bill has fallen through       the cracks during this very broken process here in DC related to       budgets and will fail to pass when it is so desperately needed.        And, by the way, it doesn't cost anything. There is no need to pay       for it. This is a commonsense bipartisan fix. It reflects the Obama       administration's position from 6 years ago. It is supported by       mainstream conservation and sportsmen groups from the left, the center,       the right.        And I will tell you, I am not going to stop fighting on this to       ensure that we pass these commonsense forest management policies. In       fact, it generates tax revenues because you get more timber harvest       going on by improving the landscape. And we need to finally overturn       this disastrous Cottonwood decision.        This bill should have been and needed to pass this year, but we are       not going to give up the fight.        I yield the floor.
