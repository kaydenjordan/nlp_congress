 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 1181 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1181         Resolved, That the requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII       for a two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee       on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is       waived with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of December 24, 2018.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time through the       calendar day of December 23, 2018, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5  [[Page H10344]]  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us is a very simple one.  It provides the House with the maximum flexibility to expeditiously  move important legislation before the end of Congress.   The resolution allows the House to suspend the rules to consider  bipartisan pieces of legislation, including the Senate-passed criminal  justice reform legislation, which we will consider later today. It also  allows for the House to quickly consider measures to fund the  government. As we are up against a deadline, it is important that we  have the ability to quickly ensure that the government does not shut  down.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend. I am going to  certainly accept the gracious gift that he has offered me. I learned a  long time ago, when you win an argument, you shut up and sit down. So I  want to applaud my colleagues for their work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 1183 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1183         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 695)       to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to       establish a voluntary national criminal history background       check system and criminal history review program for certain       individuals who, related to their employment, have access to       children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities, and       for other purposes, with the Senate amendment to the House       amendment to the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in       the House, without intervention of any point of order, a       motion offered by the chair of the Committee on       Appropriations or his designee that the House concur in the       Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate       amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 115-88. The Senate amendment and the motion       shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable       for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1645                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for  consideration of the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act,  2019. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us represents the  fourth appropriations package to fully fund the government for fiscal  year 2019. While the Congress has completed its work with respect to  almost 75 percent of total discretionary spending, including, notably,  the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Labor, roughly 25 percent of this discretionary spending remains  outstanding. Today's bill will provide a short-term continuing  resolution to February 8, 2019, to ensure that the entirety of the  Federal Government remains open and operating while the Congress  continues its work.   I have said on numerous occasions both on this floor and elsewhere  that continuing resolutions are not the best way to fund the  government, but allowing the government to shut down, even in part, is  much costlier and much worse. It is our obligation to our constituents  to keep all of the government open and operating to provide needed  services to them.   Mr. Speaker, from an appropriations perspective, this year has been  remarkably successful. Earlier this year, we sent 5 of the 12  appropriations bills to the President for his signature before the  beginning of the fiscal year. That is the best record in 22 years.  [[Page H10478]]    With hard work from both sides of the aisle in both Houses of  Congress, our earlier efforts represented a return to regular order and  to the normal legislative process. For us to drop the ball now, at the  end of the year and at the end of this Congress, would negate much of  the good work that has already been done this year.   As I have said so often on this floor, the primary obligation of the  Congress is to fund the American Government and to keep it open and  operating. The American people deserve no less. With this package under  consideration today, Congress will do just that with respect to 7 of  the 12 main spending bills: Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  Drug Administration, and Related Agencies; Commerce, Justice, Science,  and the Related Agencies; Financial Services and General Government;  Homeland Security; Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies; State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs; and, finally, Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies.   As my colleagues can see from this list, the group of bills covers a  broad array of vital government programs the American people rely upon.  It includes key departments like the Department of Homeland Security,  the Food and Drug Administration, the Border Patrol, and the State  Department.   It covers services like funding roads, operating security checkpoints  at airports, passport services, food inspection services, importation  and exportation of goods and services, banking services, and thousands  of other important government functions.   Perhaps just as importantly, it covers approximately 800,000  employees, about half of whom would need to be furloughed and about  half of whom would likely be deemed essential and be required to work  without a guarantee of pay.   While continuing resolutions are in no way, shape, or form the best  way to do business, the measure before us today will at least ensure  that the government remains open and operating and will continue to  provide the needed services for our Nation and our constituents. I look  forward to working with my colleagues in the coming weeks to complete  our work on funding the government for fiscal year 2019.   Importantly, this bill also includes funding for disaster relief and  to secure the border. The American people have made their voices heard,  and they have told us time and time again that they want additional  border security. To that end, this bill appropriates $5 billion for the  purpose of securing the border.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill also appropriates $7.8 billion for  disaster relief. As we have seen time and again in places like New  Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, the East Coast after Hurricane Sandy,  and my own hometown of Moore, Oklahoma, after devastating tornadoes,  disasters require a helping hand. By appropriating these funds we offer  our fellow Americans who have been afflicted by disasters the help that  they need and require.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to make a couple of comments before I yield to my  friend from Alabama and fellow Rules Committee member for 3 minutes.   Let me just quickly point out that we are really talking about border  security here. This clearly isn't simply a wall. Frankly, there is not  enough money involved here. This is a matter of providing additional  security.   It is important to note the Border Patrol union itself fully supports  what the President is trying to do. This is the type of thing they have  asked us to provide them so that they can provide us with the security  that we tasked them to give to the American people.   The disaster relief is something I think probably both sides should  be able to agree on. We know there is a genuine disaster. We have had  fires, and we have got hurricane relief. I have a very detailed summary  here of all the various items that would be taken care of. I would be  more than happy to provide that to my friend. That is something that we  should do before we go home. That is something, frankly, Americans have  a right to count on.   I remember--and I was with my friends in this endeavor--during the  Sandy debate and how desperately we needed aid at that point in time  and how severe the reaction was when Congress went home without getting  that done and came back in January. I  [[Page H10479]]  think the reaction was appropriate. So this disaster relief is  extraordinarily important, and I hope that we focus on that in our  debate as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), who is a fellow member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to make a couple of comments with regard to  the statement my good friend made.   We are actually talking, really, in a sense, not about not $5  billion. We are talking about $3.3 billion. The Senate bill that passed  actually added $1.7 billion, which is a tacit admission that physical  barriers do make a difference.   We all agree that the amount of money we are talking about here would  not build an entire wall. Quite the opposite, it would just provide  some physical barriers at points along the border that are weak and  need additional security.   My friend says that nobody is interested in this. Frankly, the border  security unions are. The Border Patrol has endorsed the President's  proposal. The men and women we have tasked to defend our borders tell  us this is something that they need. They have gone so far as to say  they would support a government shutdown.   I hope we don't have that. I am not for a government shutdown. I  never have been for a government shutdown. But this is not an  extraordinary amount of money in a bill, frankly, that totals well over  $250 billion, when you add up all the spending. And being able to put  additional security there is important.   To my friend's point about Puerto Rico, I think that is a good point.  I think that is a fair point to make. We should probably go back and  take a look at that. I do know that Americans desperately need  assistance in a variety of areas, Puerto Rico included. Agriculture  help is necessary, as well as help for rebuilding military  installations and schools that have been destroyed. Why can't we get  that done?   This is a very substantial package. There is actually more money in  this bill for disaster relief for American citizens than there is for  additional border security. So I think this is an eminently sensible  proposal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption and the adoption of the rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, sometimes, in the heat of debate, it is easy to miss  what the real essence of the dispute is.   When I vote for the rule--and I don't expect my friend to vote for  the rule; that is always a partisan exercise--but when I vote for the  underlying legislation, I will actually be voting to fund the  government. If my friends vote ``no,'' they will be voting not to fund  the government. So if they are worried about funding the government,  all they have to do is vote for this bill, because it funds the  government.    The second thing I will be voting for is disaster relief. My friends  have said that there are other areas that are worthy of relief. That is  probably true. I don't have any quarrel with that. But I wouldn't vote  against this disaster relief because it wasn't enough. I would  [[Page H10481]]  vote for this and then try to get additional in the time that we have  remaining.   Finally, I will be voting for enhanced border security. We all know  we have a problem. We all know that our border is not as secure as we  would like. There is a debate over wall versus no wall. This really  isn't a wall.   The wall would be $25 billion. Our friends have offered $1.7 billion.  The President has been the one who has compromised, who has come back  with $5 billion. So we are talking about $3.3 billion for various  physical barriers at spots that we all agree would almost certainly  work, done with the cooperation of our own people at Homeland Security.   Finally, we are talking about not paying border agents. Border agents  have told us this is what they need. That is what their union has said.  That is what their elected representatives said.   We want to do what the President has proposed. The President isn't  shutting down the government. The President is willing to sign  legislation that funds all the government. He has asked for disaster  relief, something that should not be controversial in this Chamber, in  my view, but sometimes is.   Finally, he has asked for an awfully modest amount of money to  provide additional security along the border that the Border Patrol  itself has asked for. That is really what is at issue.                                time  1715    So when you vote against this legislation, you will be the ones  voting to shut down the government, not the President, not my  colleagues in this Chamber, not the Senate and whatever they decide to  do in their infinite wisdom, but a ``no'' vote on the underlying  legislation is a vote to shut down the government.   A ``yes'' vote for the rule, which my friends would differ with, and  that is fair enough, but a ``yes'' vote for the underlying legislation  is the vote to keep the government open, take care of the disasters  that we are faced with, and provide modest additional support for our  border agents and Border Patrol.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close whenever my friend is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend. As always, it is a spirited  debate, and I want to be the first to say he is exactly right on a  point he made. He did, earlier today, actually help me on this side of  the aisle. I was evidently much more persuasive this morning than I  have been this afternoon. But my friend is exactly right. On many  occasions we have worked together, and I want to thank him for that.   I also want to review just quickly what I see, at least, Mr. Speaker,  as the main issues here.   Number one, we all say we agree we want to keep the government  funded, and I believe we all do. We don't believe in government  shutdowns. We all believe the government ought to be funded. The  underlying legislation does exactly that.   I think all of us, on both sides of the aisle, care about Americans  who have been hurt in disasters, and we have shown that time and time  again. We have struggled on occasion, but we generally get aid to where  it is needed; and if we overlook somebody, we try and come back and do  that again.   This bill makes a good-faith effort to provide billions of dollars in  assistance to Americans who need it through no fault of their own, who  have been ravaged by fire, who have been damaged by hurricanes, who  face a variety of disasters, not just in the United States, but in the  territories as well. If, again, we have overlooked something, we should  go back and try and take care of that as well.    Finally, it provides a very modest amount of money. Remember, this  package, together, is over $250 billion. The difference between the two  sides--unless my friends object to disaster relief, which I doubt they  do--to be fair, is really $3.3 billion. That is what the President  thinks he needs, an additional expenditure along the border, or $5  billion if you want to characterize it that way. But the difference  between the two sides is only $3.3 billion.   That doesn't build a wall. We have been told the President is  uncompromising. He is not uncompromising. He has been, for 2 years,  talking about an  [[Page H10482]]  elaborate border security of $25 billion. This is 5, not 25. This would  not build a wall, but this would provide additional security.   We all know there are points along the way where physical barriers  matter and make a difference. I think that is what the President is  asking for.   My friends worry, and rightly so, about people not getting paid  during a government shutdown, which I hope we avoid, quite frankly. But  the men and women on the border have asked the President to do this.  They support what he is trying to do.   When we send troops into combat, I listen to what they have to say  and what they need. So does this Congress, and it tries to provide it.   We put people in a difficult situation along the border, and they  tell us these are the sorts of tools they need. The President is trying  to respond in this case, and I think we should support him in that  effort.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule.  Today's bill represents the next step toward fulfilling our primary  obligation as Members of Congress to fund the government.   While continuing resolutions are never the best way to fund the  government, today's measure will allow us to keep the entire government  open and operating and providing needed services for our country and  our constituents until February 8 of 2019. This measure will give  Congress the time it needs to complete the rest of our work and fully  fund the government through the end of fiscal year 2019.   I want to applaud my colleagues for their work.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 1183 Offered By Mr. McGovern         Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the       following:        ``That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 695) to       amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to establish       a voluntary national criminal history background check system       and criminal history review program for certain individuals       who, related to their employment, have access to children,       the elderly, or individuals with disabilities, and for other       purposes, with the Senate amendment to the House amendment to       the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House,       without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered       by the chair of the Committee on Appropriations or his       designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment to the       House amendment to the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment       and the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall       be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the motion to adoption without intervening motion.        Sec. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of the Senate amendment to the House amendment       to the Senate amendment to H.R. 695.''.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
