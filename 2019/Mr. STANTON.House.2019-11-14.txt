 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 4863, the United States  Export Finance Agency Act, which will reauthorize the Export-Import  Bank for 10 years.   I am proud to cosponsor and support this bill for one simple reason:  Businesses across Arizona looking to create great jobs and export their  products across our international borders need certainty to succeed.   Main Street is still the backbone of my State's economy, and the  Export-Import Bank is an essential tool to ensure they remain  competitive in an increasingly competitive global market.   I want to highlight one business headquartered in Tempe in my  district. First Solar focuses on securing the energy of the future by  developing next-generation PV technology.   The company exports solar panel technology around the world and has  benefited from nearly $4 million in export financing from the Bank.  First Solar is just one of the many environmentally friendly companies  that benefits from the Export-Import Bank.   In Arizona, four out of five exporters supported by the Bank are  small businesses. In the last 5 years alone, it has supported upward of  $2 billion in exports in my State.   Congress has a duty to reassert its role in U.S. trade policies as  exporters continue to face challenges on all fronts. If we can't find  common ground and reauthorize the Bank, we will be removing one of the  most essential tools American companies have.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important  bill in order to provide certainty and to level the playing field for  American businesses across the country.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Waters for leading this important  effort.
