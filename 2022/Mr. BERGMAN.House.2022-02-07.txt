 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary  of the first Native American in the Winter Olympics and fellow Yooper,  Clarence ``Taffy'' Abel.   Taffy was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, on May 28, 1900, and  was a member of the Sault Tribe of the Chippewa Indians. Following his  childhood years, he joined the U.S. National Hockey Team in the first  Winter Olympics in 1924. From there, he was selected by his fellow  athletes to carry the American flag during the opening ceremonies and  helped the U.S. win a Silver Medal.   Taffy went on to lead a successful professional career in the NHL  with the New York Rangers and Chicago Blackhawks, resulting in two  Stanley Cups, and was greatly respected by many of his peers. His  accomplishments significantly advanced international hockey as an  institution by tearing down many sport and cultural barriers.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing this  historic anniversary and the legacy of Clarence ``Taffy'' Abel.                            ____________________
