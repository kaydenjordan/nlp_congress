 Madam Speaker, and Members of the House, last month, on  the 10th anniversary of 9/11, former President George W. Bush delivered  remarks commemorating the heroism of the crew and passengers of United  Flight 93 in Pennsylvania.   The former President's words were a welcome reminder, Madam Speaker,  of what it looks like for an American leader to call us together in  unity. His words were compassionate, inspiring, and patriotic.   Madam Speaker, he and I have had many differences over the years when  it comes to policy. During his Presidency, I opposed much of his  governing agenda. He did the same, opposing many of Democrats' plans  when we came into the majority in 2007.   We respected one another, we were able to work together with one  another, and we both had at the center of our philosophy the best  interests of the United States of America and its people. We always  approached each other with civility, with seriousness, and with a  shared respect for each other's patriotism.   We never questioned each other's love of our country or that we were  doing what we thought was best for the safety and security of the  American people.   I hope that President Bush's message will inspire my friends on the  other side of the aisle, from the former President's own party and,  indeed, all Americans and all of us, to remember what that kind of  leadership looks like after 4 years of a President who did not call us  to unity, who did not encourage civility or common cause, and who  furthered our divides instead of bridged them.   I hope as well that we in this House can strive to heal the divisions  in our country and embrace the kind of leadership that President Bush  displayed last month and that together, as Democrats and Republicans,  we can work toward a better tomorrow for all of our fellow Americans.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record President Bush's full remarks.   Remarks by President George W. Bush at Flight 93 National Memorial in    Commemoration of the Tenth Anniversary of 9/11 on September 11, 2021         ``Thank you very much. Laura and I are honored to be with       you. Madam Vice President, Vice President Cheney. Governor       Wolf, Secretary Haaland, and distinguished guests:        ``Twenty years ago, we all found--in different ways, in       different places, but all at the same moment--that our lives       would be changed forever. The world was loud with carnage and       sirens, and then quiet with missing voices that would never       be heard again. These lives remain precious to our country,       and infinitely precious to many of you. Today we remember       your loss, we share your sorrow, and we honor the men and       women you have loved so long and so well.        ``For those too young to recall that clear September day,       it is hard to describe the mix of feelings we experienced.       There was horror at the scale of destruction, and awe at the       bravery and kindness that rose to meet it. There was shock at       the audacity of evil, and gratitude for the heroism and       decency that opposed it. In the sacrifice of the first       responders, in the mutual aid of strangers, in the solidarity       of grief and grace, the actions of an enemy revealed the       spirit of a people. And we were proud of our wounded nation.        ``In these memories, the passengers and crew of Flight 93       must always have an honored place. Here the intended targets       became the instruments of rescue. And many who are now alive       owe a vast, unconscious debt to the defiance displayed in the       skies above this field.        ``It would be a mistake to idealize the experience of those       terrible events. All that many people could initially see was       the brute randomness of death. All that many could feel was       unearned suffering. All that many could hear was God's       terrible silence. There are many who still struggle with a       lonely pain that cuts deep within.        ``In those fateful hours, we learned other lessons as well.       We saw that Americans were vulnerable, but not fragile--that       they possess a core of strength that survives the worst that       life can bring. We learned that bravery is more common than       we imagined, emerging with sudden splendor in the face of       death. We vividly felt how every hour with our loved ones is       a temporary and holy gift. And we found that even the longest       days end.        ``Many of us have tried to make spiritual sense of these       events. There is no simple explanation for the mix of       Providence and human will that sets the direction of our       lives. But comfort can come from a different sort of       knowledge. After wandering long and lost in the dark, many       have found they were actually walking, step by step, toward       grace.        ``As a nation, our adjustments have been profound. Many       Americans struggled to understand why an enemy would hate us       with such zeal. The security measures incorporated into our       lives are both sources of comfort and reminders of our       vulnerability. And we have seen growing evidence that the       dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but       from violence that gathers within. There is little cultural       overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent       extremists at home. But in their disdain for pluralism, in       their disregard for human life, in their determination to       defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul       spirit. And it is our continuing duty to confront them.        ``After 9/11, millions of brave Americans stepped forward       and volunteered to serve in the Armed Forces. The military       measures taken over the last 20 years to pursue dangers at       their source have led to debate. But one thing is certain: We       owe an assurance to all who have fought our nation's most       recent battles. Let me speak directly to veterans and people       in uniform: The cause you pursued at the call of duty is the       noblest America has to offer. You have shielded your fellow       citizens from danger. You have defended the beliefs of your       country and advanced the rights of the downtrodden. You have       been the face of hope and mercy in dark places. You have been       a force for good in the world. Nothing that has followed--      nothing--can tarnish your honor or diminish your       accomplishments. To you, and to the honored dead, our country       is forever grateful.        ``In the weeks and months following the 9/11 attacks, I was       proud to lead an amazing, resilient, united people. When it       comes to the unity of America, those days seems distant from       our own. A malign force seems at work in our common life that       turns every disagreement into an argument, and every argument       into a clash of cultures. So much of our politics has become       a naked appeal to anger, fear, and resentment. That leaves us       worried about our nation and our future together.        ``I come without explanations or solutions. I can only tell       you what I have seen.        ``On America's day of trial and grief, I saw millions of       people instinctively grab for a neighbor's hand and rally to       the cause of one another. That is the America I know.        ``At a time when religious bigotry might have flowed       freely, I saw Americans reject prejudice and embrace people       of Muslim faith. That is the nation I know.        ``At a time when nativism could have stirred hatred and       violence against people perceived as outsiders, I saw       Americans reaffirm their welcome of immigrants and refugees.       That is the nation I know.        ``At a time when some viewed the rising generation as       individualistic and decadent, I saw young people embrace an       ethic of service and rise to selfless action. That is the       nation I know.        ``This is not mere nostalgia; it is the truest version of       ourselves. It is what we have been--and what we can be again.        ``Twenty years ago, terrorists chose a random group of       Americans, on a routine flight, to be collateral damage in a       spectacular act of terror. The 33 passengers and 7 crew of       Flight 93 could have been any group of citizens selected by       fate. In that sense, they stood in for us all.        ``The terrorists soon discovered that a random group of       Americans is an exceptional group of people. Facing an       impossible circumstance, they comforted their loved ones by       phone, braced each other for action, and defeated the designs       of evil.        ``These Americans were brave, strong, and united in ways       that shocked the terrorists--but should not surprise any of       us. This is the nation we know. And whenever we need hope and       inspiration, we can look to the skies and remember.  [[Page H5797]]         God bless.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   On Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m.  for legislative business with votes postponed, as usual, until 6:30  p.m.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and 12  p.m. for legislative business.   And on Wednesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for legislative  business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   Madam Speaker, the House will consider several bills under suspension  of the rules. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced  by the close of business today.   With the short-term extension of the Surface Transportation Program  through October 31, the House will aim to consider the bipartisan  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Build Back Better Act  this work period.   In addition, the House will consider H.R. 2119, the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Improvement Act of 2021, sponsored by Lucy  McBath of Georgia. That bill modifies and expands and reauthorizes,  through fiscal year 2026, the Family Violence Prevention and Services  Program, which funds emergency shelters and supports related assistance  for victims of domestic violence.   Madam Speaker, if time allows, the House may also consider H.R. 3992,  the Protecting Older Jobs Applicants Act, which allows applicants to  bring disparate impact claims under the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act of 1967 when they experience discrimination while  seeking a job.   Lastly, additional legislative items may be possible when and if they  are ready.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments and  question.   Let me say that I mentioned two bills that will have a very, very  substantial impact on the welfare of Americans, of their families, of  their health, and yes, even of their environmental security in the  Build Back Better plan and the BIP plan, which is a bipartisan bill on  the Senate side.   I hope to bring both of those bills to the floor next week, if they  are ready. Unfortunately, we don't have help from your side on either  of those bills so it is more difficult to get unanimity on our side of  the aisle.   Madam Speaker, I will tell my friend, all those problems that you  mentioned, would be extraordinarily worse if we hadn't passed the  American Rescue Plan in March of this year, which helped families  extraordinarily and generously to stay above water. Not a single person  on your side of the aisle voted for those.   So when the gentleman asked me, are we going to bring legislation to  the floor, we brought it to the floor. You all opposed it, however-- unfortunately--that helped families, helped childcare, helped  healthcare, helped health workers, helped States all to meet the  pandemic that this administration inherited.   The pandemic was not the previous administration's fault, obviously,  but the failure to deal with it effectively was their fault.   So I tell the gentleman that 5 million jobs have been created since  this administration took office. Some people lamented the 233,000 jobs  last month, how awful that was.   In the best year that Donald Trump had, that was his average  production of jobs--in the best year he had, which was from January  2018 to January 2019.   So I will tell my friend, we hope to be able to bring these bills to  the floor. We think they will have a very substantial, positive impact.  We inherited, of course, because of the pandemic--again, not the fault  of any--well, we don't know whether it was the fault of somebody  purposely, but in any event, for whatever reasons, extraordinary  amounts of people were laid off around the world.                                time  1145    Then, because of the American Rescue Plan, we finally gave some  people the resources that they could buy things that they had needed  and wanted for them and their families, and now we have a supply  shortage.   The President acted through executive order, as the gentleman knows,  to make sure that we had a 24/7 operation at the ports off Long Beach,  off other ports in our country, to try to make sure that we, A, got  goods on those ships that you say are to China--I don't know whether  they are to China, but there are a lot of them; you are absolutely  right on that--to get them offloaded, to get them on trucks, and to get  them to where they could be distributed and available for businesses.   Then, of course, we have a substantial shortage of chips, which the  gentleman knows, which was caused by a lockdown for major producers-- Singapore being one--of chips.   So, we are dealing with that. The executive is dealing with that as  well.   I very much hope the gentleman will help us get that legislation  passed, which will make a major difference. Who says? Fourteen or 17  laureates who wrote to the White House and said if these bills passed,  it is not only going to help jobs, it is not only going to help  climate, it is not only going to help health, but it is also going to  help bring down inflation, which is a problem.   Why do we have inflation? Because we have too many dollars chasing  too few goods, so prices go up. That is true of employment as well,  which probably is good news in terms of salaries going up for people  around the country.   I tell my friend that we do have some very substantial, important  legislation  [[Page H5817]]  that we are trying to get done. It would be a lot easier to get it done  if we had help from your side of the aisle. And your answer will be,  well, it would be very helpful if you would take some of our ideas. I  get that.   I will also tell you, if the gentleman is concerned about all of  those issues, if we don't protect the full faith and credit of the  United States of America, they will all get disastrously worse. And not  one of you is prepared, in a debt that we all created, all of us, not  all on the same thing--it may have been cutting revenues, increasing  spending, this, that, and the other.   We all essentially voted for very substantial spending last year to  meet the crisis of the pandemic. All of us did. The CARES Act, the  largest of those, $2 trillion, was unanimously passed by a voice vote  in one instance.   The only thing I would say to the gentleman is that we are very, very  concerned about what is happening. We are very glad that we created 5  million jobs. Nine million jobs were lost the year before under Mr.  Trump. He had a net loss of 2 million jobs over his 4 years--a net loss  of 2 million jobs. This President has a net gain, and we are going to  try to continue that. I hope we get some help from your side of the  aisle.    I don't think I can respond, nor do I intend to respond,  to each one of those assertions. I noticed that the gentleman totally  ignored the facts.   The presentation the gentleman made, Madam Speaker, was as if the  Republican policies were in place, we would be in high cotton.   Let me remind the gentleman, Donald Trump was President; the  Republicans were in the majority, Madam Speaker; and over those 4  years, we lost a net 2.876 million people from jobs. The last 12 months  of the Trump administration, 9,416,000 jobs were lost. Let me remind  you, the best year you had, you had 2,820,000 new jobs. That is about  an average of 235,000 jobs a month. Last month, when we were all  wringing our hands because it came down substantially from  expectations, it was 233,000.   In other words, the wringing of the hands over the poor job  performance you seem to reflect was the average of Mr. Trump's best  year. In fact, under this administration, helped by a bill, the  American Rescue Plan, that every Republican voted against--what was the  difference between the first five bills that were passed and the bill  of 2021 that every Republican voted against? Donald Trump was  President, and then Joe Biden was President.   It is like the debt limit, Madam Speaker. They know the debt limit  has to be raised, or all the things that the gentleman just referenced  are going to be hurt very, very badly.   Before you start criticizing people for not doing things to help, why  don't you stop hurting the ability of the United States to present a  balanced fiscal posture to our own economy and to the rest of the world  and have some certitude that America is going to remain fiscally  responsible and viable and pay its bills? I don't know the answer to  that question. Perhaps, Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Louisiana  knows.                                time  1200    The gentleman from Louisiana comes from a very important and critical  energy producing State of our Nation. I don't blame him for being  concerned about energy. He ought to be. We all ought to be. But, very  frankly, we ought to also be very concerned about global warming, which  the national security apparatus of the United States of America, even  during the Trump administration, said was one of the biggest  existential threats to the welfare of our people and the global  community.   So, yes, we are very concerned about reaching an environment which is  not dangerous for life on this planet. That is a very big issue for us.  My friend is right, and we are going to deal with that in the Build  Back Better plan. We are dealing with it, and we are dealing with it in  the BIP plan.   Now, the BIP plan is a plan to spend $1.2 trillion on infrastructure  investment over the next 10 years which will make our country more  competitive, will increase our ability to produce goods here in  America, Make It in America, which will make us more independent and  self-sufficient. We found during the pandemic we weren't as self- sufficient as we should be and wanted to be.   These bills that we are considering will do that.   I don't expect many Republicans to vote for it. Even the  transportation bill that I think they ought to be for--Donald Trump  said he was going to spend $1 trillion, have a $1 trillion  infrastructure program during his campaign, and then we went down to  the White House, we had a meeting with him, and he said: No, $1  trillion is not enough, we ought to do $2 trillion.   He did zero, Madam Speaker, zero when the Republicans were in charge.  Zero.   We are going to pass this infrastructure bill, and it is going to  make a real difference. It is going to make a real difference on jobs,  it is going to make a real difference on inflation, and it is going to  make a real difference because we can increase the supply chain. It is  going to make a real difference on the health of our globe.   So I tell the gentleman that he raises a lot of issues, and I would  hope his party would start returning to a sense of bipartisanship in  dealing with legitimate problems that the gentleman raises which we did  in 2020.   Now, we did. We were in the minority. We voted with President Trump.  Actually, we were in the majority, but President Trump was President,  and we helped support his and the Treasury Secretary's objectives and  our own objectives, and we came to an agreement, a bipartisan  agreement.   Very frankly, it is unbelievable to me, Madam Speaker, that in the  debt limit the minority leader of the United States Senate--and, very  frankly, the gentleman just said that we all understand we don't want  to--I presume he doesn't believe we ought to not raise our debt limit.  I believe he wants us to pay our bills because he knows the  catastrophic impact if we don't. But I don't understand why they won't  support this. That is not an issue of Democrat or Republican. We all  created that debt in one form or another. Certainly, last year we did a  big number because we thought we needed to meet the pandemic. We did,  and we saved millions of jobs in the process.   So my friend has these bills, we have bills, we are prepared to talk  about proposals, as I have told my friend in the past. But, very  frankly, there needs to be on some issues--that ought not to be  political at all, like the debt limit--a statement that we are loyal to  our country, not to Democrats. I said this the other day to the  gentleman, the loyal opposition, not to Democrats, not to me as the  majority leader, not to any of us, but to the country.   I would implore my friend, because we are going to have to do the  debt, we are going to have to do the omnibus, we are going to have to  do the debt limit, we want to do Build Back Better, and we want to do  the infrastructure bill, those are four pieces of big legislation we  want to do before December 30, I am hopeful that we can get some  cooperation from the Republicans.   I mentioned the debt limit because that is an issue that the  gentleman came to us under the Trump administration and asked us to  help with. We knew it was critical for the interests of the country,  and on three different occasions we voted with the President at the  Secretary of the Treasury under the Trump administration's request and  voted to make sure that America did not default on its bills.   Can I ask if the gentleman will at least, Madam Speaker, indicate  that  [[Page H5819]]  they will support making sure that America continues to pay its bills?    The gentleman continues to say facts that are not true.    They are not true.    I do not disagree with it.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The reason I said he was misstating the facts is we have a bipartisan  bill. It wasn't done by the Democratic leadership. It, frankly, wasn't  done by the Republican leadership. It was done by Members of the United  States Senate on the Republican side and on the Democratic side.   That bill was sent over here with almost half of the Republicans in  the United States Senate voting for it, and my friend's leadership is  lobbying against that infrastructure bill which would help all the  issues the gentleman raised.   My friend is urging a ``no'' vote on that, and he is threatening  Members who are going to vote for it--maybe not very many--because they  know it is a bipartisan bill.    Madam Speaker, the whip is talking about bipartisanship.  There has been so little bipartisanship, and when there is  bipartisanship, their Members are disciplined. When there is  bipartisanship on saying that it wasn't a protest, it was an  insurrection, there was no bipartisanship on that.    It was a: ``We don't care what it was. We don't care that some people  were killed. We don't really care that they were trying to stop the  counting of votes for the President of the United States of America. It  was just a protest.''   That is what former President Trump said the other day. What a bunch  of hooey. There clearly has been a conscious decision made by the  leadership on the other side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, against a  bill that had 69 votes in the United States Senate. We only have 50.  [[Page H5820]]    And it is being lobbied against. Why?   To hurt Joe Biden.   Yes, they voted, Madam Speaker, for the five bills.   Why?   Because ultimately Donald Trump was for them. Not everybody voted for  them, but the majority. And as I said, CARES, $2 trillion, absolutely  essential, was passed. But the gentleman refuses to answer the question  except to say: Well, the credit card was maxed out.   The credit card was maxed out by date in a couple of those votes  which we helped as the responsible opposition, as we did with John  Boehner and Paul Ryan when they couldn't get votes to pass bills to  keep government open or to keep the United States from defaulting. Yes,  we cast the responsible vote.   It is not a popular vote because it is demagogued, Madam Speaker. It  has nothing to do with the debt. The debt happens when you pass  spending or pass revenue cuts. That is what affects the debt, and that  is what all of us do one way or the other.   So we are all responsible and we ought to all be responsible. But the  Senate leader on the Republican side of the aisle has said he is not  going to do anything.   Not only will he not do anything, Madam Speaker, he will not allow  the majority to do it on their own because he is going to filibuster so  it requires 60 votes. We don't have 60 votes. We have 51.                                time  1215    Not only will they not do the responsible thing on debt, which would  adversely affect, if we do not extend it, all the things that the  minority whip lamented were wrong; it would all be adversely affected  if, for the first time in history, Madam Speaker, we fail to extend the  debt limit, which, by the way, very few countries have--one or two-- because it is a phony issue. The debt is not phony, but the limit is  controlled by what budgets we pass, what tax cuts we pass, what  policies we pass.   Once we do that, we go in the store, or as  Jim McGovern, the chair  of the Rules Committee said, we go in the restaurant and buy the steak.  You need to pay for the steak. The argument, Madam Speaker, of, oh,  well, you are proposing a lot of spending in the future, is totally  unrelated. The debt limit is caused by the debt that we already  incurred. The two bills that we had, they don't affect the debt limit.  We have met it now, not when we passed these bills, not after we make  that commitment.   We have a debt limit coming up now on December 3, which was totally  irresponsible in and of itself, for political reasons only, coterminous  with the funding of government. In 2019, when we took over, the  government was shut down. We spent a lot of time opening it up. That  hurt the economy. That hurt jobs. Now, at that point in time, it didn't  hurt inflation. And I have been amazed over the years, over the last 10  years, that we haven't had more inflation for a number of reasons.   But he didn't answer the question, whether he would help on that.  That is not for us. It is not for Democrats, not for Republicans. It is  for our country. It is for our economy. It is for global fiscal  stability.   So I would hope at least in that area--not for us. I am not asking  you to do it for me, Madam Speaker. I am not asking anybody to do it  for me or for my party or for the President of the United States. Mitch  McConnell says it is the country and the global community that could  not afford default, and that is true.   Let me tell you, I think that is the first step to showing bipartisan  responsibility together; not for one another, but for our country,  Madam Speaker. And I hope that at some point in time we can show that  kind of good faith.   I included this morning the remarks that President George W. Bush  made in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on the kind of America that he  wanted to see. I would hope all of my Republican colleagues would read  what George W. Bush had to say. It is so different from the rhetoric of  the current leader of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, in terms of  bringing us together as a country.    Madam Speaker, I think that bill passed the Senate  Wednesday, so we will look at it, but we haven't had a chance to look  at it at this point in time.   I want to get back--and I know this sounds like a broken record on  the debt limit, but the gentleman makes the point, Madam Speaker, that  somehow we have raised the debt to accommodate spending. That is what  you always do because if you reach the debt limit, you are done. You  stop Social Security. You stop veterans' payments. You stop any support  payments. You stop paying the armed services of the United States. That  is the spending you stop when you can no longer incur debt. Why?  Because we spent a lot of money. We put it on the credit card, and it  is coming due. It comes due on a regular basis, and we have to pay it  on a regular basis.   The gentleman has voted for bills that do exactly what the bill he  lamented, and none of his colleagues voted for, Madam Speaker, exactly  what he asked us to do, extend it by a date, not a number, by a date.  Then he hypothesizes, well, in that timeframe, you are going to incur  additional expenses. He is absolutely right.   So, he is lamenting and giving as a reason for his not voting for it  is because there are some proposals to spend money in the future. There  are lots of them from all sides.   Then he brings up this ``tied together.'' Let me tell you who has  tied it together. The Republican leadership has tied these together.  Yes, the President talked about it. He said, no, they are not tied  together. He said, first of all, they are tied together, and then he  said, no, I negotiated this bill; don't do it.   But I will tell the gentleman, as the majority leader who brings  bills to the floor, their infrastructure bill passed overwhelmingly in  a bipartisan vote and put together in a bipartisan vote Republicans,  Democrats, and the President of the United States.   Now, he is the President of the United States. I know the gentleman  voted against certifying his election in a bipartisan move, I suppose.   But, Madam Speaker, that bill will be brought up separately, and you  vote for that bill on its merits and vote against it on its merits. Do  not hide behind the fact that you don't like some other bill.   Donald Trump said he was going to do a trillion dollars on  infrastructure to help our economy. He didn't do it. Then he said it  was going to be $2 trillion. He didn't do it. Republicans were in the  majority. They controlled the House and the Senate. They didn't do it.   We have a bill they can vote for. I would urge them to vote for  extending the debt limit so our country meets its full faith and credit  obligations and for the infrastructure bill because I think it is a  bipartisan bill negotiated by Republicans, by Democrats, and by the  President of the United States which will help our economy and, as I  said and will reiterate, every issue that the gentleman raised, Madam  Speaker, in his opening remarks.     That is not accurate, and you know it.    Madam Speaker, if this Congress had never met this year,  we would have to extend the debt limit at some point in time this year.  That is a fact.   Mr. McConnell has said it is inconceivable that we would not extend  the debt limit of the United States of America and fail our obligation  under full faith and credit. As a matter of fact, the Constitution, in  the 14th Amendment, says it shall not be questioned, but we have to  take some legislative action.   The issue is what is our responsibility to the United States of  America, not all this argument that pretends that somehow some bills  that are proposed on spending or some that may have been passed this  year, if they hadn't been passed, somehow we wouldn't have to do this.  If anybody on either side of the aisle believes that to be the case,  they ought to be defeated by their constituents because they don't know  what is going on here, on either side of the aisle.   This is a very serious issue with respect to jobs, infrastructure,  inflation, healthcare, and environment. All of those will be adversely  affected, and the global community itself, if we do not extend this  debt. We can argue about the other issues, but there is no argument  about this issue.   Every Republican President has asked that this be done. Every  Republican Secretary of the Treasury, since I have been in this  Congress, 41 years, has asked that we extend the debt limit; every one  of them, without fail. Every one of them has said--President Reagan  on--that if we did not do it, the country's economy, reputation, and  well-being would be put disastrously at risk.   I don't want bipartisanship. I want patriotism. I want people  committed to their country and their country's well-being to stand up  and say: I am not going to demagogue an issue that is so critically  important to the welfare of my Nation.   I say to the gentleman again: Exactly what they passed when they were  in the majority, and we voted for it, setting a future date--not a  number, a future date. Exactly. We didn't ask them to do anything more  than we did.   In terms of bipartisanship, I will again say: You have got a  bipartisan bill negotiated in a bipartisan way that will be coming to  this floor at some point in time, I hope earlier rather than later,  separately--not tied to I don't like this bill, I don't like that bill,  I won't do this, I won't do that, I won't do the other--which will  substantially grow jobs in our country and deal with the climate crisis  in our country.   I would ask you to support both of those propositions when they come  to the floor in a show of bipartisan support for our country, not for  each other, but for our country.    Madam Speaker, this needs to come to an end, obviously,  but I will tell you this, as I stand here, as somebody who sat on this  floor on January 6 and the question was would the House perform its  function of accepting the electoral college vote to elect this  President--it wasn't that there hadn't been voices in the past who had  raised questions. But there was no effort by Ms. Clinton, who received  the majority of the votes, or Mr. Gore, who received the majority of  the votes, to raise a question about the legitimacy of the election.   But we had an insurrection incited by, invited by, and deployed by  the President of the United States. So we didn't start on a very good  bipartisan basis, again, not because Republicans should have been happy  that their candidate was not elected or any more than we were happy  that our candidate was not elected in the Clinton and Gore campaigns.   It was, at least, that we ought to uphold the constitutional  principles. Vice President Pence did, and there were people in this  Capitol on that night who wanted to see him, apparently, eliminated.  That wasn't a good bipartisan start, Madam Speaker. The majority of  Republicans voted against certifying the electoral college results in  State after State. But we ought to put that behind us. That is done.  What we are doing now is we are acting on behalf of the country.   The two issues that I dwelt on, because I think we have agreement on  that, rhetorically and intellectually but not electorally, not in terms  of voting, is the debt limit should never be breached and that we need  to invest in infrastructure, two simple propositions.   The Senate minority leader says: We should never breach the full  faith and credit of the United States of America, but I won't help you  do it. I don't get that. Frankly, it seems to be kind of irrational.   And then an infrastructure bill passed overwhelmingly by the United  [[Page H5823]]  States Senate, which we are putting on the floor unchanged, as it was,  not coupled--as it is and was--and saying let's vote for that.
