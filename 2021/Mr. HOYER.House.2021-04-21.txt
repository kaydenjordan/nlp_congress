 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  for her service. I thank Chairwoman Beatty and members of the  Congressional Black Caucus for organizing this Special Order tonight.   Madam Speaker, Alcee Hastings was a dear friend, a close friend, a  wonderful supporter, adviser, counselor, a friend who will be greatly  missed not only by me, but by so many with whom he served on both sides  of the aisle.   Madam Speaker, he and I served together in this House for 28 years,  almost three decades. Over the course of that time, I came to know him  very well. I visited his district. I know his wife. I saw his passion  for public service, his sharp intellect and ability as a legislator,  and his kindness and decency as a human being.                                time  1900    Alcee was someone who held strong convictions, as all of us know, and  he would impart those to you, and he fought hard for what he believed  in. One of those convictions was that all people on this Earth deserve  the same basic freedoms and access to democracy as Americans are  privileged to enjoy.   Madam Speaker, he and I served together on the U.S. Commission on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, and Alcee later served as its  chairman, as I once did. He was the first African American to lead that  body. And he was also honored, Madam Speaker, by legislators from 57  different nations when he was chosen as president of the Organization  on Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly. The  only American, the only African American, obviously, to have had that  honor, and the only person of African descent to have that honor.   Before the pandemic, Alcee traveled the world to promote democracy  and human rights where they were newly enjoyed or not yet achieved.  Wherever he went, he brought his deep commitment to constitutionalism,  rule of law, equality, justice, and opportunity for all.   In doing so, he was an excellent envoy of this House of  Representatives, the people's House, and the democratic mission it  embodies to the nations of the world.   I want to take a moment to speak about a part of Alcee's life that  shows his true character. It is no secret that Alcee faced difficult  and painful rebuke earlier in his career. I am not going to go into the  specifics. Most people know the outlines.   But what stands out, Madam Speaker, for me and for others more than  anything about what happened is that most people, after having been  through such an experience, might have turned away from public service  and harbored a debilitating anger and self-pity. Not our friend Alcee  Hastings.   He was determined to continue giving back and serving his State and  his country. So he ran for Congress and received the imprimatur of his  neighbors and friends and constituents as a person of great worth whom  they wanted to represent them. He served his constituents faithfully  and with great ability for 28 years and, indeed, prior to that as well.   Those he served and those with whom he served are grateful that he  made that choice. We are grateful that he persisted and persevered. And  we are so fortunate, Madam Speaker, to have been blessed in our own  lives by the wonderful life of service and contributions by Alcee  Hastings.   I join others in offering my condolences to his wife, Patricia; to  his family; to his devoted staff; and to the communities of southern  Florida he represented so skillfully in this House.   Another Representative of southern Florida, my dear friend, Debbie  Wasserman Schultz, will be relating from her personal experience  serving with him from southern Florida the extraordinary impact that he  had on Florida and that region.   Madam Speaker, I spoke this morning at a memorial service led, again,  by the Congressional Black Caucus for Alcee, and I related the story  that a few days before his death, I had called Patricia and talked to  her about how Alcee was doing, and she said: Not well.   Two days later, I called her back. It was probably 7 o'clock, about  this time, in the evening. I said: How are things?   She said: Not good.   I said: Can I talk to him?   She said: I don't think he will understand you and I don't think he  will be able to respond, but I will put the phone to his ear and you  can say something to him.   She did that, and I said a few words very briefly, and then I closed  with the sentiment that I have today and that I had for most of the  time that I had known him. I said to him: I love you, Alcee.   I said this morning that I don't know whether he could hear or  understand what I said at that point in time, but the good news for me  is I knew that he knew that I loved him. He was a man of great worth,  of great feelings, of great expectations, of great service, of great  vision. I will miss Alcee, my friend.   May Alcee's memory be a blessing and inspiration to us as we continue  to work here in this institution that he loved and served so well.
