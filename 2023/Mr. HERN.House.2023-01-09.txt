 Mr. Speaker, on March 1, 2022, President Biden made a  promise to the American people during the State of the Union Address  before a joint session of Congress. I was sitting in this room as the  President stated: ``Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a  year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.''   Mr. Speaker, the President lied to us all because, in August 2022,  CBO confirmed that the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which  supercharges the IRS with 87,000 new agents, will, in fact, lead to  more audits and enforcement measures and higher taxes for families  making less than $400,000 a year. In fact, the CBO confirmed that  lower- and middle-income taxpayers would see as many as 710,000 more  audits.   Americans are suffering under harmful inflation caused by the  irresponsible fiscal policies from President Biden and our  congressional Democrats. The last thing the American people need is  burdensome IRS audits.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill to  make Joe Biden's promise come true.
