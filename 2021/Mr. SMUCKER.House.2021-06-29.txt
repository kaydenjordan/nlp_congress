 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Lampeter- Strasburg High School softball team for winning the PIAA 5A Softball  Championship earlier this month, with a 10-7 victory over Armstrong.  This is the Pioneers' second State championship in just 3 years. This  victory capped off a dominant 30-win season.   Through the halfway mark, the Pioneers were down 1 run entering the  5th inning, but after putting 5 runs on the scoreboard, including a 2- run home run from senior Cam Byler, the game was over as the Pioneers  closed out to claim the championship.   Mr. Speaker, I extend congratulations to the team members for their  success this season. It is a great credit to the players, their hard  work, Head Coach Gene Charles, the entire coaching staff, that, for the  past 3 years, the Pioneers have played in the championship game,  bringing home the trophy this year and previously in 2018.   Mr. Speaker, our community is really proud of this truly outstanding  accomplishment. We wish the graduating seniors best of luck in their  future endeavors.                            ____________________
