 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague  Representative Slotkin's resolution regarding war powers.   First and foremost, I am extremely grateful that the Iranian  ballistic missile attacks on A1 Asad Air Base and Erbil resulted in  zero injuries or casualties to our U.S. servicemembers or Iraqi allies.  As always, I will continue to prioritize the safety of our deployed  government officials, servicemembers, and contractors.   Madam Speaker, let me be clear: Qasem Soleimani was a terrorist, and  I hope his removal from the battlefield will, in fact, improve U.S.  security in the long run. That being said, in the wake of the strike on  Soleimani, let us not forget that we invest in our highly capable  military to promote stability, not to undermine it.   Our Founding Fathers made abundantly clear in the Constitution that  only Congress has the power to authorize use of military force. This  resolution that we will be voting on later today is a necessary step to  ensure deescalation with Iran while we await a clear strategy from the  administration on how the President's actions will reduce the chances  of Iran becoming a nuclear state.   U.S. Forces will always retain the inherent right to self-defense;  however, any further military actions that can lead to war will require  congressional authorization.                            ____________________
