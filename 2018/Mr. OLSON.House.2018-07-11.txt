 Mr. Speaker, the heart and soul of Fort Bend County in my  hometown of Sugar Land is in great pain today. Herb Appel put on his  angel wings and joined our Lord yesterday. We are the most diverse  county in America, and the best place to start a family, raise a  family, and start a business because of Herb Appel.   Herb was a long-time CEO of the Fort Bend Economic Development  Corporation. During his tenure, Schlumberger moved their North American  headquarters to Sugar Land, Smart Financial Center opened, and Texas  Instruments stayed in Fort Bend County, moving from Stafford to Sugar  Land. The list goes on and on and on.   Herb was called home on a cruise he took with his wife, Emelia, and  most of his five kids, sixteen grandkids, and two great grandkids. He  was at sea with a sea of love around him.   When Herb met God yesterday, God said: Well done, good and faithful  servant. God bless Herb Appel.                            ____________________
