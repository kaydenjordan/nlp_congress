 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  America COMPETES Act.   I am especially proud that my legislation, H.R. 6121, the Leveling  the Playing Field Act 2.0, was included in this bill. This bipartisan  legislation sponsored by myself and my Republican colleague, Bill  Johnson, will modernize our outdated trade remedy laws to push back  against many of China's most aggressive anti-free market practices.   For years, a number of American industries have faced repeated dumped  and subsidized imports into the U.S. market. In 2000, China produced  about 18 percent of the world's steel. Today, it produces roughly 50  percent.   This overcapacity has undermined U.S. steel manufacturing and has put  our steelworkers and steel manufacturers like those in my district,  U.S. Steel and Nucor, at a big disadvantage.   At the end of the day, this bill will promote global competitiveness.  When America competes fairly, America's workers win, and America's  businesses win.
