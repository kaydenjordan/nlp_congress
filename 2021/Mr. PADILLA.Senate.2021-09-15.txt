 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the  cloture motion with respect to the motion to proceed to S. 2093.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent  to deliver a portion of my remarks in Spanish.    Mr. President, in Spanish, we say ``en Espanol,'' but I  know the Presiding Officer knew that from Colorado.   I rise today, as we mark the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month, to  reflect on a historic leader whose work inspires me in this fight for  voting rights and the work that we have before us.   Willie Velasquez, recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom,  dedicated his life to improving the freedom to vote in Latino  communities.   Everywhere he went, he brought a simple motto. You might have heard  it.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         ``Your vote is your voice.''    Willie Velasquez was born in 1944 and grew up in a Latino community  in Texas which suffered from the harms of segregation, redlining, and  government neglect. He understood that the path to greater recognition  for Latinos was through participation in our democracy. So Willie set  out to make sure Latinos across the Southwest could participate.   In 1974, Willie Velasquez founded his groundbreaking organization,  the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. Through his  efforts, Willie helped bring the vote--and a powerful voice--to many  Latino communities.   Now, Willie's successes were built on the hard-earned victories of  those of past civil rights leaders. Especially critical was Congress's  1975 extension  [[Page S6524]]  of the Voting Rights Act--yes, a bipartisan reauthorization of the  Federal Voting Rights Act--which established protections for language  minorities, like Spanish speakers. In just 10 years, with Willie's and  other activists' hard work on the ground, the number of Latinos  registered to vote nearly doubled, and in the same 10 years, the number  of Latinos holding elected office also nearly doubled.   That is the power of the freedom to vote and the power of what we can  do here in the Senate and here in Congress--give every American a voice  in our democracy.   Now, in his time, Willie fought to do exactly this, like the  generations of Americans of all ages, colors, creeds, and genders who  came before him. Their efforts reflect a fundamental truth about our  country: We are stronger when more Americans can vote, and we are  stronger when all communities have a say in government. But the path to  realizing our highest ideals has never been easy. From a convention  hall in Seneca Falls to a bridge in Selma, from Willie's home in San  Antonio, TX, to this very Chamber, the voting rights' victories of each  generation have been hard-fought and hard-won, and it is no different  today.   In recent months, we have seen the latest challenge to the core of  our democracy: scores of new laws proposed by Republican State  legislatures to target the past five decades of gains in voting rights;  cynical politicians, spreading false claims of voter fraud because they  fear losing in a fair election. You can see the danger of it even in my  home State of California where, just yesterday, we held a recall  election. Republicans ran a campaign of disinformation, spreading  baseless claims of massive voter fraud before the polls even closed,  before they even opened, and long before a single ballot was even  counted. It is straight out of Donald Trump's playbook--the same  playbook that perpetuated the Big Lie and fueled the domestic terrorism  that the world witnessed on January 6.   It is no coincidence that the cynical claims of voter fraud are often  targeted at communities of color. In the face of these challenges, we  must overcome, together, again. We must renew our collective fight for  our democracy. It is up to us. The time is now to get the job done.   It is an honor to lead the Freedom to Vote Act alongside my  colleagues Senators Klobuchar, Merkley, Warnock, Manchin, King, Tester,  and Kaine.   The Freedom to Vote Act will make it easier for all eligible citizens  to register to vote and to cast their ballots. This bill will set a  baseline of protections for voters across the country, with  commonsense, proven reforms that have already been successfully  implemented in blue and red States across the country. I urge all of my  colleagues to join us and vote to strengthen our democracy.   As the first Latino to represent California in this body, in the U.S.  Senate, I am proud to be spending this Hispanic Heritage Month fighting  for voting rights because so many of our community's gains have been  achieved through political participation and representation. The fight  to expand voting rights is, indeed, part of our heritage. It is also a  tradition that unites Americans because we have come together,  generation after generation, to expand the promise of our democracy for  all. Yes, we are strongest when every eligible voter can make their  voice heard.   ``Your vote is your voice.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   Your vote is your voice.''   I yield the floor.
