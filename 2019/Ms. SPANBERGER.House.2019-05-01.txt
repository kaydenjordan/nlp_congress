 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now  Act.   Back in 2003, 16 years ago, the Pentagon commissioned a report on how  climate change would impact our ability to keep our country safe. Its  conclusion? That we should move beyond scientific debate and treat  ongoing ecological damage as a serious national security threat.   Our military and intelligence communities agree that climate change  exacerbates conflict and instability. It weakens fragile governments,  contributes to food and water insecurity, and perpetuates poverty.   These are threat multipliers, and they present real risk to U.S.  interests around the globe, especially in areas vulnerable to extreme  weather, such as the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa.   As a former CIA officer, I recognize that combating climate change is  a national security imperative, and the first step in this fight is to  keep our word to cooperate with our allies and partners in this battle.  By staying in the Paris Agreement, we demonstrate that the United  States takes our planet's fate seriously, keeps its word, and can be a  steady partner in future agreements. Going forward, we must use our  country's tremendous diplomatic, military, and economic strength as  assets in this global fight.   Today, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation because our  country cannot afford to abdicate its role of leadership.
