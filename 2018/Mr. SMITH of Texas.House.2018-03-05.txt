 Mr. Speaker, there is a legal term called ``fruit  of the poisonous tree.''   If the evidence, or tree, is tainted, then anything gained from the  evidence, the fruit, is tainted as well.   A former FBI Director intentionally leaked questionable memos about  President Trump, hoping it would lead to the appointment of a special  prosecutor. It did. Since the evidence for a special prosecutor was  tainted, the appointment of the special prosecutor was tainted, too. If  the premise is faulty, the conclusion is faulty.   To continue the investigation is to violate a legal principle and  dishonor our system of justice. The process is poisoned. The special  prosecutor should cease and desist.                            ____________________
