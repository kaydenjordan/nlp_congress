 Mr. Speaker, this is one of the most  important bills that any of us will ever vote on--no hearings, no  expert witnesses--and now we get 30 seconds on the floor to debate it.   So let me just use my 30 seconds to say that this is a bad bill for  working families. It is going to cause middle class working families to  pay more in taxes. It is going to strap our citizens with $2.3 trillion  more of national debt. I ask for a ``no'' vote.
