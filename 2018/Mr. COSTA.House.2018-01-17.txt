 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand with the DREAMers, both those  living throughout the great San Joaquin Valley whom I have the honor  and the privilege to represent, as well as those across the entire  United States. We in the valley--as we like to say--and throughout our  Nation are, let us remember, a nation of immigrants, past and present.   So we know the integral role, both historically and today, that  immigrants have played throughout the great history of our Nation in  terms of the development of our economy and our communities. The  contributions that have been made are the story of America. And our  DREAMers, these young immigrants, also make immense contributions, and  their story is a part of America's story.   It is estimated that roughly 685,000 of our Nation's workers, our  DREAMers, with protections through the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals, or DACA, program, that if we, in fact, remove them as some  are maybe suggesting, it would impact over $460 billion to our Nation's  economy, to our GDP. Think about that.   In my home State of California, it is estimated that there are over  193,000 DREAMers who are currently legal, who are working and  contributing with these DACA protections, and that removing them from  the workforce in California would cost an estimated $11.6 billion to  the GDP of California.   Does this make any sense? No.   But the DREAMers also serve in our military, protecting our Nation  both at home and abroad, in harm's way. They are our friends. They are  our neighbors. They are deacons in our local churches, and many of them  are students, hoping to contribute to the betterment of America. They,  too, want to be a part--and they are, in fact--of the American Dream.   In my district alone, we have over 600 DREAMers at the University of  California, Merced, and more than that at my alma mater, Fresno State  University.   But these DREAMers are young men and women. They are not just  numbers.  [[Page H459]]  These are people. They are people, many of whom we have trusted to be a  part of our country, to uphold its word, when they basically enrolled  to be a part of the DACA program.   Just today, I spoke to two DREAMers in my office. One of them is a  remarkable young person, currently getting her Ph.D. in physics--she is  27 years old--at the University of California, Merced, focusing her  research on solar energy.                                time  1830    Just think about this: helping America with the next generation of  our energy development.   Her name is Bo. She hopes to work in renewable energy when she gets  her Ph.D., but now with the possible removal of DACA, her future is  uncertain. She came here when she was 3 years old. Her DACA protections  expire in less than 1 year.   Another DREAMer I spoke to today was a student body president while  working on his bachelor's degree at Fresno State, my alma mater. His  name is Pedro. He has graduated now. He has earned his master's degree  in public policy and urban affairs and is contributing to the economy  of our valley and to our State. His DACA protections expire within  months.   Think about that. Think about the gravity of these two students, Bo  and Pedro. In less than a year, they don't know if they are going to be  here. This is their country, as far as they are concerned.   Our DREAMers have shared stories time and time again of uncertainty  and fear that is gripping their families and our communities as they  are forced to wait and see if the only home that they have ever known,  this country, will keep its word when they enrolled in the DACA program  and create the protections that allow them to stay here and ultimately  become citizens.   That is the question. That is what we are trying to achieve.   So I stand here today to say to my colleagues, as Members of the  Congress, we all take an oath every 2 years. We swear to protect and  defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign  and domestic, and to promote, guess what, the general welfare for the  good of our country.   Well, that is what this is all about, promoting the most positive  things that can be a part of our country. These DREAMers are a part of  that. So this has to be a part of our permanent solution.   Eighty-six percent of the people in this country support providing  legal designation for these DREAMers, and it is imperative that we do  the right thing. This is America. I will continue to work with my  colleagues on the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and other Members of  Congress in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that we do the right thing.  This is the American way.   More than just protecting these young people, America needs a stable,  just, and commonsense immigration policy. Let's face it, our  immigration system is broken. I will continue to work on a bipartisan  basis for comprehensive immigration reform more broadly so that we  don't end up back right where we are here today in bickering and in  partisan, piecemeal, and often contradictory fashion that does nothing  to fix our broken immigration system.   We must improve the dialogue and the debate. This problem is very  solvable. It really is. Let's get past the political posturing, let's  fix DACA and provide support for our DREAMers, let's move on in the  second phase, which the President has suggested, and let's work on the  other elements. We are for border security. It is important. We all  support border security. Let's do the other things that are a part of  fixing this broken immigration system.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for recognizing me.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is absolutely correct. That is  why this debate is so important and that is why we must come together  not just on behalf of Bo and Pedro, as I cited their examples, but for  the 800,000-plus DREAMers across this country and their families.   This is just good common sense. It is the right thing to do and it is  the thing that we must do to move our Nation on a positive track.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for all his hard work. I am  honored to be a part of this Special Order.
