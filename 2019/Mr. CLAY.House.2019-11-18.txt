 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member  McHenry for getting us to this day.   The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program before us this afternoon is one  of the most important bills in the ongoing fight against terror.   TRIA helps to support the private market in providing coverage for  terrorism risks by providing Federal reinsurance in the event of  catastrophic losses from terrorism. The lack of public data on the  scope and nature of terrorism risk makes it very difficult for private  companies to model these risks, and as a result, a Federal backstop is  important and necessary.   When businesses in my State of Missouri can purchase terrorism risk  insurance, it provides confidence, promotes public safety, and  undergirds the overall economy. TRIA also protects key healthcare and  research facilities in St. Louis that not only work on lifesaving cures  but also employ thousands of our constituents.   Overall, the TRIA program has been extremely successful in ensuring  economic stability in the post-9/11 environment and has done so at  virtually no cost to the taxpayer due to its cost-sharing structure.   In 2019, the threat of terrorism has not abated, and insurers still  face challenges in underwriting risk with such a high potential loss.  Without TRIA, many policyholders in Missouri and elsewhere would lose  terrorism coverage; commercial lending would be significantly  diminished; and the Federal Government would likely be called upon to  provide assistance at great cost to taxpayers in the event of an  attack.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this critical piece of  legislation.
