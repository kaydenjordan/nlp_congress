 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona being  down here talking about the trajectory this Nation finds itself on with  respect to all spending, but in particular mandatory spending as we  call it, and the need for all of us to get serious about doing  something about it.   We sat here in this Chamber last night. The President of the United  States did what you do in a campaign speech, not in the State of the  Union. He did what you do when you have a failed agenda and you want to  try to scare the American people rather than inspire the American  people: Accuse your opponents of being against Social Security and  Medicare with no real backing, but offering no solutions himself to the  very problems articulated by the gentleman from Arizona.   Did anybody hear the President of the United States last night  address at all the reality that Social Security and Medicare are on a  path to bankruptcy in terms of their funding relative to the demands to  pay benefits? Of course not. Of course not. Because the President of  the United States, Joe Biden, has zero solutions to the problems facing  this country. Not one.   Not one solution last night was offered. Standing at the well where  the Speaker currently sits, not one solution was offered. Instead, it  was a campaign speech.   The fact is, the American people, I think, saw through it because in  the same speech that the President attacked Republicans for not having  a solution for Social Security and Medicare, accusing Republicans of  saying we were going to walk away from the obligations for Social  Security and Medicare, the President offered no solutions on the  border. None.   The President said not a word about our men and women in uniform. The  President referenced Ukraine but didn't provide an actual strategy or  desired outcome besides ``Putin bad, Ukraine good.''   Look, the fact of the matter is, the entire Nation is tired of  exactly what we saw last night. Tired of it. The President came in and  tried to offer populist rhetoric. Frankly, stealing some of the  rhetoric almost directly from President Trump.   He tried to offer some old school Democrat rhetoric, saying, we have  got a program for everybody in America. Don't worry, we are going to  pay for it. I gave a speech on the floor of the House about a year ago  entitled the United States House of free stuff about this body. A  number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle came down and  talked about all of the student loans that would be forgiven, all of  the spending that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would  offer with no indication of how it would be paid for because why would  you do that?   Look, the fact of the matter is, this body, the people's House, is  never going to be serious about representing the people until we stop  spending money we don't have, stop allowing for the printing of money  to carry out the very things the American people sent us here to stop  doing, stop funding the very bureaucracy that are carrying out the  actions that we decry in our own campaigns. We are never going to get  this country on track until we stop printing money, borrowing money,  and spending money we don't have.   I would defy any one of my colleagues, anyone this side of the aisle  or the other side of the aisle to come prove that statement wrong.   When we are $32 trillion in debt, or almost, and we keep having a  debate about who is going to spend more money on which program of our  choice, how is that going to save the country?    With all due respect to colleagues on my side of the aisle, I have  heard numerous Republicans say, ``We are not going to touch defense  spending.'' Okay. Good for you. Maybe I agree. Maybe we shouldn't touch  defense spending. Maybe we need more defense spending to beat China.   But then what, pray tell, is your solution to fund it? I promise  you--look, I request all my Republican colleagues  [[Page H778]]  out there, come on down. If you are the one saying you will not touch  defense spending, you come down here and you give me a solution. Don't  hide behind the men and women in uniform. Don't go, oh, no, we are not  going to touch defense spending, we need more defense spending, we need  to beat China.   I might agree with you, but I am not going to sell printing and  borrowing money that undermines the very national security that you are  going out and talking about.   To my Democrat colleagues, you come down here, don't say a word about  how you are going to pay for any of the spending, any of the programs  that you stood up and applauded last night when the President of the  United States was talking about it.   You say you want to have nondefense spending; you want to have more  funding for HUD, more funding for HHS, more funding for programs, more  funding for some cop grants or whatever it is. It wouldn't be for cop  grants. You want more funding.   How are you going to pay for it? The answer is, no one is going to  come down here and give an answer to that with the possible exception  of two things. My Democratic colleagues will come down and say taxes.  Okay. Come down, let's have a conversation about taxes. Come down and  show me what taxes you want to raise that will not cause economic  impact such that our revenues actually go down. Come show that to me.  Let's have a debate about that.   My colleagues on this side of the aisle will tend to say, well, it is  the mandatory spending, don't you understand? Don't worry about  discretionary spending, that is small ball. Well, a third of our budget  is discretionary spending still, so I am not sure that is small ball. I  mean, it is, after all, $1.6 trillion. I don't consider that small  ball.   My colleagues aren't incorrect that we have got to deal with  mandatory spending, but you can't hide behind mandatory spending, say  that is the problem, while you then say, whoa, we have got to increase  defense spending, and, well, I don't know that I would increase all  that other nondefense spending, all those agencies, but you know what?  That is what my Democrat colleagues want, so the only way I can get my  defense spending is to agree to what they want, and one day we will  deal with mandatory spending. What the hell, $32 trillion of debt and  counting.   That is exactly what happens. And, again, to any of my colleagues,  come down here and prove me wrong. Come on down. I am here. Come debate  me. The American people actually want to have a debate. Maybe we should  have that debate every day, all day, until we come to some conclusion  about how we are going to stop doing the same thing over and over  again. Stop spending money we don't have.   Now, I will tell you my solution. I actually believe you should come  to the floor and come here to debate and have solutions. I believe that  the bureaucracy of the Federal Government is plenty big. I don't  believe it needs to get any bigger.   Call me crazy, but I think maybe returning the bureaucratic state,  the administrative state, the bureaucracy, the Federal Government  bureaucracy, returning it to preCOVID levels--I am not asking for that  much. I am just saying, let's go back to the size of the bureaucracy  before COVID spending blew the spending out of the water. That would be  2019 spending levels. Are you with me? Let's just take the bureaucracy,  take it back to preCOVID spending levels.   Now, do that. Hold defense spending at 2023 levels that were just  passed, that all the hawks were running around going, all right, we got  more money for defense, we got a 10 percent increase in defense. Okay.  Let's hold that spending. If you do what I just said, freeze the  bureaucracy at 2019 levels, freeze defense spending at 2023 levels, the  one we just passed, if you do that and you do that for 10 years, freeze  that number for 10 years, you will save $3.6 trillion and reduce our  deficit spending. You will get about, I don't know, probably about a  third of the way toward balancing the budget in 10 years. I think that  is a pretty good start.                                time  1930    Does anybody in America want to raise their hand and say that the  Federal bureaucracy in 2019 was too small? Does anybody want to come  down and say: The size of the nondefense Federal Government in 2019,  man, that government, oh, my gosh, it was so small. There were no  bureaucrats interfering with my life. There were no regulations cutting  off economic activity.   Again, come on down. Tell me how that government of 2019 just a few  years ago was so efficient, so great, such a good size; that you think  that is the right size and that we need it to be bigger; that it is not  the right size and that we need it to be bigger.   I don't know many Americans--if I go to my district that I represent,  750,000 Texans, I don't know many of them that would raise their hand  and go: Oh, please, I need that bureaucracy to be bigger. Hire more  Federal workers into all of those programs. Fill up more buildings in  Washington, D.C. We need more of that.   Defense spending, we just got defense spending increased a bit here  in 2023. Well, you say, do we need more spending for defense? There are  a lot of people who might say we might. Why? Well, is our Navy what it  needs to be to beat China? Do we have all the latest technology that we  need to be able to beat China or another world foe? Do we have all the  latest and greatest intel? Do we have all the personnel trained  properly at the levels we need to ensure that we can be the finest  fighting force in the world and that we can kill people and blow things  up when necessary? That is what our military is supposed to do.   We might need more spending. I will grant that.   I will tell you what, take my plan of freezing the Federal  bureaucracy, nondefense. Take last year's defense levels at 2023, and  now increase it 2\1/2\ percent for the next 10 years. Instead of saving  $3.6 trillion, we would save $3 trillion. It is still a pretty good  step toward a 10-year balance.   That is one idea. I think it is the right idea. I will tell you why I  think it is the right idea. I don't know why I want to give more money  to an EPA that puts Joe Robertson in jail because he had water on his  land and somehow that violated the waters of the United States laws.   I don't want to give more money to the bureaucrats at the Federal  Bureau of Investigation to build a new $400 million facility in  Maryland like we just voted through in December, to hire more FBI  agents to put more people like Scott Smith, a dad in Loudoun County, on  a list to be a domestic terrorist because he dared to go to a school  board and challenge a school board for not doing enough to protect his  daughter.   Scott Smith joined me in this Chamber last night and sat right up  there listening to the bloviating nonsense we heard coming from the  other end of Pennsylvania Avenue sitting here last night.   I don't want to give more money to those bureaucrats. I don't. I  don't mind saying it.   I was a Federal prosecutor for a couple of years. The Department of  Justice has plenty that it can cut. All I am talking about is going  back to 2019 levels.   Do we want to fund NIH or FDA or CDC further to carry out more gain- of-function research? Anybody? Raise your hand. Raise your hand if you  want more gain-of-function research coming out of your Federal labs,  maybe even working with China to do it. Anybody sign up and say: Yes,  that is a great idea. Good use of money. Well done. Does anybody want  more of that, more of those programs, again, with borrowed printed  money?   Do you want more money to go to the Department of Labor to shut down,  for example, Rhea Lana Riner's children's clothing consignment company  because she violated some standards, according to the Department of  Labor?   How about more money for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,  and Explosives to issue by regulation--not a law that we passed--a  barring of pistol stabilizing braces that potentially make felons out  of, I don't know, 10 million or more Americans? Does anybody want to  give the ATF more money to go after and target the American people?  That is what we do here.   With all due respect to my Republican colleagues who like to go take  shots at my Democratic colleagues for  [[Page H779]]  a lot of good reasons, by the way, it is not enough to campaign against  this stuff and then come here and fund it. That is what we do. We  campaign against these terrible regulations and these terrible actions  by bureaucrats.   The IRS is going after nonprofits and faith-based organizations  because of their beliefs. The FBI is targeting Mark Houck, a dad. The  FBI showed up at 7 a.m. in the morning with a SWAT team to go after his  family in Philadelphia because he dared to defend his son when they  were outside of an abortion clinic engaging in their First Amendment  right to stand up in defense of life. Oh, but let's go give some more  money to them.   That is what we will do. Let's give more money to that bureaucracy,  the woke, weaponized, wasteful bureaucracy at war with the American  people, targeting the American people.   The truth is, we have an obligation to reduce Federal spending even  if it were filled with nothing but angels doing nothing but angelic  things because we are spending money we don't have. The truth is that  bureaucracy is doing anything but those angelic things.   Why do we continue to fund it? The funding that we continue to  provide for a bureaucracy that not only is at odds with and targeting  the American people, targeting the Scott Smiths, targeting the Mark  Houcks, targeting the Joe Robertsons for having water on his land,  targeting Marvin Horne for his raisin crop, fining him $685,000 because  he didn't comply with certain New Deal-era restrictions that the  Department of Agriculture put on him--think about that.   I am not saying that I can say every single thing that every example  you bring up that someone didn't violate some reg or some rule because  who the hell knows how many there are? I have asked. No one can tell  me. How many Federal laws are there? Again, if any of my colleagues can  come down here to the floor and bring me a footnoted cite and say this  is how many Federal laws there are, I would love to see it. Come tell  me how many regulations there are with laws and crimes attached.    According to one report I saw, there are an estimated 4,500 Federal  laws, statutes, criminal statutes--sorry, not laws, criminal statutes-- and some 300,000 crimes attached to regulations. That is just one  report that I saw. The Department of Justice apparently tried to  calculate this in the early 1980s, and they gave up. They came up with  a certain number, and they just kind of stopped.   How can any American engage in activity and not essentially be  violating something somewhere where some eager bureaucrat is just able  to go: Nope. You are in violation. You are shut down.   We were sitting up in the Rules Committee the other day talking about  vaccine mandates, and one of the witnesses testified. One of my  colleagues said: Well, why aren't you taking this end to the public  health emergency or this end of the vaccine mandate through regular  order?   Look, I am a big supporter of regular order. I think we should take  things through committees and bring them to the floor and offer  amendments. Let's keep in mind that is a one-page bill that is pretty  straightforward, and I will just say this: What was the regular order  carried out by the executive branch in just unilaterally executing an  order to force vaccines upon private citizens through OSHA  requirements--shut down by the courts, by the way. Where was the  regular order? Where was the sort of equivalent to due process for the  American people where we can at least go through and make some good  decisions for the executive branch when they said: Yes, you military  guys, you have to get this COVID vaccine.   Based on what? Well, Anthony Fauci said so. Rochelle Walensky said  so.   Wait, but didn't CDC Director Walenski say that the vaccines don't do  anything for transmission? Well, don't mind that. We will just keep  mandating needles get stuck in the arms of our men and women in  uniform, notwithstanding some of the concerns of myocarditis among the  young, healthy population that predominantly make up our military, by  the way.   Last night, my friend Senator Cruz was sitting right over here during  the State of the Union. He brought a young man, a member of our  military who has been kicked off the career track. They are coming  after him to get $75,000 of money from schooling. They are coming after  him. He has to write that check or they are going to keep coming after  him. They have not fired him because of the bill that we passed in  December saying we are not going to allow you to remove members of the  military if they don't want to take the vaccine, but he is still being  punished.   Right now, a patriot who signed up to serve his country has his  government going after him for money that he has gotten for his family  after his sacrifices to serve the country. They are going after him.  His government is going after him when all he wanted to do was serve  his country and not stick a needle in his arm because some bureaucrat  said so.   Let me be perfectly clear to my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle: This is going to change. We are not going to do this. We are not  going to allow the government to do this to the American people. I mean  that.   When we fund the government this year, things better change, Mr.  President. You come down here and make threats to us about what you  think is going to happen with respect to default. You come down here  and lecture us in the people's House. Well, let me tell you, Mr.  President, we are a coequal branch of government. We are not going to  allow the American people to continue to be targeted by the very  government that is supposed to protect them, that is supposed to do  their constitutional duty, that is supposed to secure the border of the  United States, that is supposed to stop fentanyl from coming in, that  is supposed to have operational control of the border so that neither  Americans nor migrants are dying, that it is supposed to stop dangerous  cartels, that is supposed to stand up to China, that is supposed to  have a strong military sparingly used but not woke.   We are not supposed to spend money we don't have. We are supposed to  balance our budget. We are supposed to defend the American people.   I am not going to agree, sitting in the Rules Committee or on this  floor, to continue the process of spending money we don't have, of not  changing the status quo, and not demanding that the President of the  United States act like it, act like he is the President, defend this  country, secure our border.   He doesn't get to come down here and lecture us. The people's House  decides how dollars get spent. The people's House represents the  people.   We need a reckoning. We need to stand up and fight, to stand up and  be counted. I am not going to go around in the circles that we  constantly go around in this place, having another meeting about  another meeting about another meeting.   How about we just stand up for something? How about people be on the  floor of this body debating? Get another hour of Special Orders,  another half-hour of Special Orders.                                time  1945    I am sick and tired of watching my fellow Texans in the State  legislature debating right now spending more Texas taxpayer money to do  the job the Federal Government is supposed to do and secure the border.   I am sick and tired of walking around on eggshells around a body  comprised of Members on both sides of the aisle that refuse to do their  job to stop spending money we don't have and say, oh, well, what  political poll-tested 80-percent-issue can we put out there and go to  the American people with so that we can sound reasonable in our  demands?   How about you just demand what is right?   Why don't we just stand up and say, you know what? We are going to  balance our budget. Giddyup.   That is what every American does. It is what every business has to  do. But no, no, no. We will keep going around in circles, each side  going to their pet projects.   Meanwhile, the Federal bureaucracy is going to continue to be at war  with the American people like my friend, Scott Smith, who was here last  night. Not one single mention by the President, hasn't apologized a  lick for putting him through that, domestic terrorist.   Hasn't apologized a lick for the fact that his Secretary of Homeland  Security, who was here last night, stood up  [[Page H780]]  at a lectern and said that his own border patrol employees that work  for him whipped Haitian migrants when he knew full well--both from the  video evidence that we all saw with our eyes and a memo from his own  people in the Department of Homeland Security--that was not true.   He knew it. And then he blamed it on systemic racism.   Has he apologized? No.   And the reason he hasn't apologized is because he is at war with the  people of the United States and the fact that his job is supposed to be  to secure the border.   And the President knows it.   The President goes down and does a photo op with a preset visit in El  Paso where they literally go out and clean out the streets of the  migrants who are piling up in El Paso and sets up a photo op, and then  last night dares to come down here, lecture us, lie to the American  people that we are trying to go after their Social Security and  Medicare, and offer nothing about his constitutional duty as President  of the United States to secure the border.   Mr. Speaker, I will yield back here in a minute. I assume my time is  running short.   I will just close by saying this: The American people expect more out  of the people's House.   They expect more out of the President of the United States than what  we saw last night. It was not a State of the Union. It was a state of  confusion.   We have an obligation to do our job and stop spending money we don't  have, secure the border of the United States, and actually represent  the people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 49 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, February 9, 2023, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
