 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 4366.   My amendment would prevent any funds under the act from being used to  continue a VA current practice of sending a veteran's name to the FBI  National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or the NICS list.  [[Page H3998]]    According to the VA rules, if a veteran or beneficiary is appointed a  fiduciary to help manage their VA benefits, their name is automatically  sent to the NICS list. VA sends the veteran's name without finding that  veteran a danger to themselves or others, and this is not done in a  court of law, not done by a judge, not done by any person with legal  authority. It is only done by a VA bureaucrat.   A Federal employee currently has the right to take away a  constitutional right of our veterans. The same veterans who protected  our constitutional rights are now losing theirs because they need a bit  of help managing their finances.   I have said this once, and I will say it again: Veterans should not  be treated any differently from any other American citizen.   The mission of the VA is to care for those who have served. To me, it  seems this practice is the opposite of caring for our veterans.   Veterans have told me that this practice is a barrier for them to  seek healthcare. They are so afraid of losing their constitutional  rights that they will not go to the VA for their healthcare or their  benefits.   There were just under 15,000 individuals reported to NICS last fiscal  year from the VA. This fiscal year, over 8,000 veterans have already  been reported to the NICS so far. This practice must stop.   I am proud to have introduced my amendment that would prohibit the  unlawful loss of a constitutional right of our veterans.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record letters of support for my  amendment from The American Legion, Gun Owners of America, National  Rifle Association, National Defense Committee, Vets 4 Vet Leadership,  Veteran Warriors, and Catholic War Veterans.                                             The American Legion,                                                      July 20, 2023.      Hon. Mike Bost,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Representative Bost: On behalf of the more than 1.6 million       members of The American Legion, I am pleased to express       support for amendment to H.R. 4366, the Military       Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies       Appropriations Act. It is ironic that veterans, a community       in which every member swore to uphold the Constitution of the       United States, requires advocacy to maintain their       constitutional right to bear arms. The American Legion       believes that each veteran, regardless of disability, has the       lawful right to possess firearms, unless deemed unfit by a       judicial authority with the full benefit of due process. Any       constitutional right should be protected with this same       expectation of scrutiny.        The proposed amendment would prohibit the Department of       Veterans Affairs (VA) from sending information on veterans       who are assisted by a fiduciary to the FBI's National Instant       Criminal Background Check System (NICS), without a judicial       ruling that they are a danger to themselves or others. As       such, this amendment would prevent veterans from losing their       Second Amendment right to purchase or own a firearm because       they receive help managing their VA benefits.        Through American Legion Resolution No. 118: Amend Title 38,       United States Code, to Clarify the Treatment of a Veteran as       Adjudicated Mentally Incompetent for Certain Purposes, The       American Legion urges Congress to pass legislation which       would prohibit VA ``from transmitting in any form, findings       about a veteran's mental status or ability to handle his or       her own funds, to other agencies without the order or finding       of a judge, magistrate, or other judicial authority of       competent jurisdiction.'' The American Legion supports the       proposed amendment. The American Legion sincerely appreciates       your leadership on this issue and looks forward to working       with you to secure the passage of this critical amendment.            For God & Country,                                        Vincent J. ``Jim'' Troiola,      National Commander.                                   ____                                            Gun Owners of America,                                                      July 18, 2023.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bost: Gun Owners of America is thankful to       the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for its focus on the       lost gun rights of a quarter of a million veterans with its       legislative hearing on H.R. 705, the Veterans' 2nd Amendment       Protection Act.        GOA exists to protect the constitutionally recognized right       to keep and bear arms of all Americans. Because our veterans       have taken up arms to defend this country, we strongly       believe that the Department of Veterans Affairs must respect       that right. Yet, since the Clinton Administration and the       invention of the NICS background check system, the VA has       used its ``fiduciary rule'' to disarm veterans as if they had       been ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' by a court and       were now prohibited from possessing firearms under federal       law.        Veterans who have risked life and limb and now suffer from       the psychological consequences related to their service       should receive the best mental health care our nation has to       offer. But VA gun control measures, such as this ``fiduciary       rule'' to arbitrarily report veterans to the NICS database,       pose major barriers to care for gun owning veterans who may       need life-saving mental health treatment.        Sadly, veterans are disproportionately ``adjudicated'' as       mental defectives by the federal government. As of 3 January       2023, 97.8 percent of active 18 U.S.C. Sec. 9221(g)(4)       records in the NICS system submitted by the federal       government are veterans. Of the 266,804 records submitted to       NICS by federal agencies pursuant to 18 U.S.C.       Sec. 922(g)(4), 261,168 records were submitted by the VA.        The procedure of turning a veteran who cannot manage his or       her checkbook into a prohibited person begins when a VA       bureaucrat requires a fiduciary to administer benefit       payments. The VA only notifies the veteran once at the       initiation of the fiduciary appointment process. If the VA       does not receive a response within 60 days of the issuance of       this notification, the VA makes a determination of competency       based only on the evidence of record and the veteran's record       is submitted to the NICS database. Thus, a veteran may lose       the legal right to possess or obtain firearms without       committing any crime, without the constitutional due process       necessary for the deprivation of a right, and sometimes       without the veteran's full knowledge or consent,        It is essential that Congress immediately pass the Veterans       2nd Amendment Protection Act to prohibit the Department of       Veterans Affairs (VA) from disarming any more veterans with       its unconstitutional ``fiduciary rule'' process. Congress       must also restore the Second Amendment rights of the veterans       currently prohibited from possessing firearms because the VA       has submitted their name to the FBI's background check       system.        GOA fully endorses Chairman Bost's Amendment to H.R. 4366--      to include the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act to the       Military, Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related       Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024.        In Liberty,                                                    Aidan Johnston,      Director of Federal Affairs.                                   ____                                          National Rifle Association                                                      of America,                                      Washington, DC, July 19, 2023.        Dear Chairman Bost: The National Rifle Association (NRA)       applauds your amendment to H.R. 4366, to prevent the       Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from stripping veterans'       Second Amendment rights without due process.        For decades, VA has been using an entitlement program as a       pretext to revoke a fundamental constitutional right from       those it vows to serve. Under the current scheme, appointment       of a fiduciary--a bureaucratic decision assessing a       beneficiary's ability to handle personal finances--is treated       as an ``adjudication'' of ``mental defectiveness.'' This       results in the reporting of these veterans to the FBI's       National Instant Criminal Background Check System as       disqualified from firearm ownership and acquisition, even       though that finding does not involve a judge or a hearing to       establish whether the individuals are dangerous to themselves       or others.        No government bureaucrat should have the unilateral and       arbitrary power to strip any American of their gun rights.       Therefore, on behalf of millions of NRA members across the       country--many of whom have served this great nation in       uniform--the NRA fully supports this amendment as well as       your companion legislation, H.R. 705, the Veterans' Second       Amendment Protection Act.            Sincerely,                                                      Randy Kozuch,      Executive Director, NRA-ILA.                                   ____                                                      July 26, 2023.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker of the House.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      Majority Leader of the House.      Hon. Jim McGovern,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Rules.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Minority Leader of the House.      Hon. Tom Cole,      Chair, House Committee on Rules.        Dear Speaker McCarthy, Leaders Jeffries and Scalise, Chair       Cole, and Representative McGovern: We, the undersigned       veteran and military serving organizations, endorse the       inclusion in the House Committee on Rules' reported Rule on       H.R. 4366, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and       Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024, of the Rules       Committee Amendment 23, Version 2--sponsored by       Representative Bost of Illinois--to prohibit ``the VA from       using funds to submit a beneficiary's name to the NICS list       based on VA's appointment of a fiduciary.'' We also endorse       the amendment's adoption by the House into the final House-      passed version of the bill.        The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA's) Fiduciary program       is a testament to the threat the unchecked regulatory powers       of the Executive Branch can pose to the inalienable rights of       the People, in this case, to the rights of disabled veterans       to due  [[Page H3999]]       process under the law, and to keep and bear arms. From the       Fiduciary program's placing the burden of proof on the       veteran to prove they are competent (and not on the VA to       prove the veteran is incompetent), to the lack of judicial       oversight to the process (as is provided in similar       incompetency determinations by the Social Security       Administration), to the then Orwellian process by which the       VA tattles to the Department of Justice that the veteran has       problems balancing their checkbook, and therefore now somehow       qualifies as a ``mental defective'' under the Brady Handgun       Violence Prevention Act of 1993 and loses their right to keep       and bear arms, all without any judicial action, this program       is rife with threats to the liberty and property of the very       men and women who sacrificed their physical well being in the       defense of this country.        Furthermore, the National Academies of Science,       Engineering, and Medicine found 55 percent of those Iraq and       Afghanistan veterans needing mental health services did not       seek VA care. The National Academies further stated a       significant reason these veterans are not seeking these       mental health care services is because of the fear they will       lose their firearms, or other legal or administrative actions       will be taken against them for seeking mental health care       such as loss of security clearance, loss of child custody,       and with 35 percent of those interviewed by the National       Academy saying ``the potential of having their personal       firearms taken away as an obstacle to use VA mental health       services.'' And given the rate of increase in veteran       suicides over the last 20 years is almost 240 percent higher       for those veterans not in the VA's mental health care       programs than those in it, such disincentives to seek VA       mental health care, such as the Fiduciary Rule, appear to be       increasing veteran suicide, not decreasing it.        While we believe the entire VA Fiduciary program must be       fundamentally reformed to address the significant civil and       legal right abuses the Fiduciary program itself represents       for America's veterans, given the legislative process that       will require, we believe the Fiscal Year 2024 Military       Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act should       contain this prohibition on any funds being expended by the       VA to involuntarily place any veteran into the Fiduciary       program.            Very Respectfully,      National Defense Committee.      Vets 4 Vet Leadership.      Veteran Warriors.      Catholic War Veterans.     Madam Chair, I thank Representatives Rosendale, Hudson,  DesJarlais, Self, Cammack, Higgins, Ogles, Miller, Boebert, Van Orden,  and Kiggans for joining me on this amendment.   Madam Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am glad that was brought up, the claim that the bureaucrats do not  do this. It is only the bureaucrats that recommend to the NICS list,  and then the Department of Justice does this. They take away a right of  a veteran where any other citizen in this United States would have to  go before a court of law where they would be found to be a danger to  themselves or others.   Yet, our VA, under the interpretation that they have made of an  existing law, has decided that they will have a bureaucrat, without due  process, take away the rights of our veterans. It is as simple as that.   When I came here to this House, I found this out. As a veteran, I was  appalled. What bothers me more than anything is the number of veterans  across the central part of this United States who choose not to seek VA  help for the fear that they would lose that Second Amendment right.  They fought for that right and every other right under this  Constitution.   This needs to be straightened out. It is not gun control. It is not  any issue like that. This is a veterans rights issue.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.  [[Page H4000]]    Madam Chair, I will answer two quick questions.   The fact is that, no, the VA employee does not take the Second  Amendment right and possess the guns. The Department of Justice does.  They give the name to the Department of Justice.   Two, when the statement was made that I have a bill to try to deal  with this, the ranking member was totally correct. I do because I am  going to do everything I can to make sure that the rights of our  veterans are not taken away.   It is time for us to stand up for our veterans and protect the  constitutional rights that they fought to protect. No veteran should  lose their Second Amendment right without due process of law.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
