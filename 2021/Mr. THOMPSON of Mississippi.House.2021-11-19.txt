 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Yarmuth  for his steadfast commitment to shepherding this landmark legislation  to the floor.   I am honored to join with my colleagues, just days after President  Biden signed a sorely needed and long-awaited infrastructure package  that will rebuild the Nation's deteriorating roads and bridges to  consider the ``Build Back Better Act.''   Madam Speaker, the magnitude of what we are doing here is really  compelling.   Twenty-eight years ago, I came to Congress to advocate for the  interests of my friends and neighbors who, after decades of struggle,  deserve a more fair and equitable economy that fuels prosperity and job  growth in our communities well into the future.   That is just what H.R. 5376 will do.   I could not be prouder to be a part of this Democratic majority as we  come together, with a sense of urgency, to deliver for the people while  tackling climate change and other challenges that put our communities  at risk.   I am particularly appreciative that the bill invests $1.5 billion in  the Department of Homeland Security to provide crucial resources to  three challenges confronting the Nation: cybersecurity; domestic  terrorism and other threats to houses of worship and non-profits; and  reducing the Department of Homeland Security's carbon footprint.   The homeland security title of this bill provides $100 million in new  funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which helps DHS take  necessary action to help secure churches, synagogues, mosques, and  other nonprofits from domestic terrorism and other threats.   It has been just 3 years since the deadliest attack on the Jewish  community in U.S. history, when 11 lives were lost in a mass shooting  at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.   The funding the House provides today can help prevent such a tragedy  from happening again.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a statement in support of this  additional funding from the Jewish Federations of America.   It also invests in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency to help State and local governments develop secure and resilient  critical infrastructure networks by, among other things, accelerating  State and local governments' transition to the (dot) gov domain and  increasing capacity to hire network defenders.   Finally, the homeland security title provides $900 million in  strategic investments to help the department reduce its carbon  footprint and mitigate the ongoing effects of climate change that have  a direct impact on our national security.   Once again, I thank Chairman Yarmuth for his leadership along with  Speaker Pelosi, Leader Hoyer, and my fellow committee chairs for their  months of hard work to produce this once-in-a-generation legislation  which includes so many important investments in our homeland security.   For these reasons, I urge passage of H.R. 5376 and look forward to  swift action on this package by the Senate so that it can be signed by  President Biden and begin to improve the lives of my constituents in  the Second District of Mississippi and beyond.       [From The Jewish Federations of North America, Oct. 28, 2021]    Jewish Federations Express Gratitude for Additional Security Funding         Jewish Federations Express their gratitude to House       Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson (D-MS) and Senate       Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Gary       Peters (D-MI) for helping to secure an additional $100       million for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) in       the Homeland Security portion of the reconciliation package.        ``Communities can only flourish when their security needs       are met. The inclusion of an additional $100 million for the       Nonprofit Security Grant Program will save lives, help keep       Jewish and other communities safe, and allow them to       flourish'' said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of the       Jewish Federations of North America.        ``Just yesterday, we commemorated three years since the       Tree of Life massacre in Pittsburgh, the worst violent       anitsemitic attack in the nation's history. Additional       funding to the Nonprofit Security Grant Program will not only       help secure synagogues, but houses of worship and nonprofits       of every stripe across the nation that face threats at a time       of increased violent extremism,'' he added.        The NSGP provides grants to nonprofits to help fund       security measures such as inspection and screening systems,       physical barriers, and development of emergency preparedness       plans.        This year, as hate crimes spiked and houses of worship were       increasingly targeted, the NSGP was able to fund fewer than       half of all applicants.        Fingerhut advocated for increasing NSGP funds at a Senate       HSGAC hearing on violent extremism this Summer.        Homeland Security Appropriations bills in both chambers       propose leaving NSGP funding flat at $180 million, as overall       proposed funding levels remain unchanged.        Federations' advocacy for further government investment in       community safety measures is part of the public-private       partnership envisioned in the historic LiveSecure campaign,       which is raising $54 million in philanthropic dollars to       spread the security umbrella to every Jewish community across       the country and help fortify Jewish communal institutions.        Jewish Federations also thank Senate Majority Leader       Charles Schumer (D-NY) for his leadership on this program,       and the perennial champions Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY),       Rob Portman (R-OH), and Reps. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) and John       Katko (R-NY) for supporting NSGP funding. We look forward to       continuing to work with them to increase annual funding for       the program through the appropriations process.
