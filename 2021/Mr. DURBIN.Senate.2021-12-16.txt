 Madam President, let me first echo the comments of  Senator McConnell, as well as Senator Schumer earlier, in wishing Sara  Schwartzman the very best in her next undertaking.   Whatever the challenge may be, I hope the hours are better because I  know that the sacrifices made by you and members of our staff because  of our peculiar scheduling in the Senate have caused some strains and  stress and pressure and hardship.   But thank you so much for making the Senate better with your service  every single day.                            Lithuania and Belarus    Madam President, I have tried to visualize this experience so many  times: It was in July of 1911, and a ship arrived in Baltimore from  Germany. A family came down the gangplank. One of the members of the  family was my grandmother, and she brought her three children. One of  them was a 2-year-old little girl--blonde-haired--named Ona, my mother.   How they managed to navigate their way through Baltimore and catch a  train to East St. Louis, IL, I will never know because there were  virtually none of them able to speak English, but they did. They  arrived, and I grew up the son of a Lithuanian immigrant who was proud  of what her family left behind and prouder still of what they found in  this great country as Lithuanian Americans.   I have had a special attachment and interest in the Baltic States-- and particularly Lithuania--ever since. It has been my good fortune to  follow their history from Soviet occupation and oppression to freedom  and democracy today.   If you go on a search engine on your computer and type in the word  ``fearless,'' don't be surprised if the map of Lithuania pops up. This  small nation, 2.6 million in population, has done some remarkable  things in history and remarkable still in modern history.   For half a century, millions lived under the tyranny and oppression  of the Soviet Union. Before I was elected to public office, I went to  visit Vilnius in Lithuania in 1978, and I saw Soviet rule firsthand. I  am glad I did because it is such a sharp contrast to the Lithuania of  today.   In the late 1980s, things began to change, particularly in the Baltic  States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Who can forget when 2 million  people--2 million people--joined hands across these three nations to  form a 420-mile Baltic Chain of Freedom in August of 1989. Not  long thereafter, in February of the following year, Lithuania held its  first free elections since World War II, voting for the country's first  post-war noncommunist government. Immediately thereafter, the new  Parliament voted to make Lithuania the first occupied Soviet republic  to declare independence. Lithuania's bold move was followed later that  year by Latvia and Estonia.    These brave efforts culminated a year later in February of 1991 when  the Lithuanian people voted for independence. Those brave Lithuanians  30 years ago, including my friend, music professor, and national leader  Vytautas Landsbergis, led that country back to democracy.   That Lithuanian effort three decades ago is still alive today. As a  vibrant and vital member of the European Union and NATO, this small and  brave nation is standing firm against renewed Russian aggression and  now Chinese economic intimidation and defending heroic efforts to end  tyranny in Belarus. It is one of the most vocal countries on Earth in  defending democratic values and norms. Is it because they have a  nuclear stockpile? No. A massive army? No. They are just determined,  principled people who are courageous.   Some years ago, I visited the Lithuanian town of Rukla, where U.S.  and German forces were rotating through as part of the European  Reassurance Initiative aimed at keeping the Baltic safe from Russian  aggression. There was good reason for it. They knew they had to take  seriously what Putin might do against them.   Russia, under Vladimir Putin, has undertaken regular military, cyber,  and political efforts to destabilize Lithuania and the Baltic States,  but Lithuania will not be bullied. And I am glad that in the just- passed National Defense Authorization Act, we reaffirmed our commitment  to Baltic security in the amendment that I offered.   Lithuania is also standing firm against the giant nation of China,  which is trying to cut off supplies and punish the Lithuanian economy  simply because the Lithuanians have established trade ties with Taiwan.  Yet again, Lithuania will not be bullied.   On Lithuania's immediate border, there is a heroic struggle to end  the last dictator in Europe, Lukashenko in Belarus. Most of us remember  last year when this Belarusian dictator, Lukashenko, once again, after  the bogus election results were announced, proceeded to jail those who  had the temerity to run against him in the election. That has become  normal with this man. This dictator, if somebody shows the nerve to run  against him, will announce that he has beaten them by 80 percent-plus  and then put them in jail.   When popular social media personality Sergei Tikhanovsky found  himself arbitrarily jailed, his wife Svetlana Tikhanovskaya  courageously stepped in to run in his place. She probably won that  election, but of course Lukashenko would never allow those results to  be announced. So what did she do after the election, her husband in  jail? She fled Belarus. Where did she go for safety for herself and her  children? Lithuania. Not surprisingly, Lithuania. She found a welcoming  nation next door, and she continues her struggle for a free and  democratic Belarus out of Vilnius, Lithuania.   Belarus and Russia have retaliated against Lithuania with cruel and  manufactured migrant flows and other intimidation, but once again,  Lithuania will not be bullied.   Secretary of State Blinken understands the importance of this  Lithuanian nation and continues to make sure they know they have  friends in the United States. He recently hosted Lithuanian Foreign  Minister and grandson of Vytautas Landsbergis at the State Department  and then traveled to the Baltic States to reaffirm American solidarity.   Blinken said clearly at the State Department that Foreign Minister  Landsbergis ``has been such a strong voice for democracy and human  rights not just in Lithuania, but around the world.'' I couldn't agree  more. I couldn't be more proud.   So let's use this 30th anniversary of Lithuanian independence to  stand firm with our brave ally and recommit to our continued support  for our Baltic allies through economic and security cooperation. Doing  so will help ensure  [[Page S9223]]  the next 30 years of the longstanding U.S.-Baltic friendship are  equally strong and fruitful.   In early 2011, a trip through these same Baltic countries gave me one  more extraordinary experience in my Senate career. I went on a road  trip from the free, democratic Lithuania back in time to the closed,  totalitarian nation of Belarus. Crossing over that border was like  driving onto a Hollywood movie set. I looked along the roads for  telephone poles or evidence of electricity and found none. It looked  like a bucolic, rural village, mile after mile after mile, indicating  how economic development has still yet to arrive in Belarus.   You see, this last dictatorship of Europe held a Presidential  election in December 2010, and I wanted to be there in 2011 to meet  with the families of those who had the temerity to run against  Lukashenko and were in jail. So I drove from Vilnius to Minsk to meet  with those family members. They had been arrested by the security  services of Belarus, which are still called the KGB.   It was a sobering meeting. Many tears were shed. Fortunately, over  time, by working at it doggedly, we eventually saw the release of all  the brave Belarusians who had been jailed at that time.   Yet, tragically, the Belarusian people found themselves in the same  outrageous situation last year when Lukashenko jailed these candidates  with the courage to run, including Sergei Tikhanovsky.   Some of you may have read the outstanding profile about his wife,  Svetlana, in this month's New Yorker. It is entitled ``The Accidental  Revolutionary Leading Belarus's Uprising.'' It describes how her  campaign speeches galvanized boisterous crowds. She had a very simple  message to the Belarusian people and the courage to say it. She said  she was ``fed up with living in humiliation and fear'' in Belarus.  Lukashenko, this mighty dictator, didn't even have the courage to  debate this woman.   She likely won that election, as we know, but we will never know the  official outcome because Lukashenko wouldn't allow it.   I was proud to host her last year with my Senate colleagues Senator  Shaheen and Sullivan. And I am glad to see that President Biden met  with her as well.   She is a brave woman, soldiering on, despite the fact that the  Belarusians announced just a week ago that her husband has now been  sentenced to 18 years in prison.   Tragically, since Lukashenko stole that most recent election, he has  continued to double down on his outrageous behavior, including forcing  down a commercial airline in May to arrest the Belarusian activists and  just this week, after months of closed hearings, that 18-year prison  sentence for her husband.   Five other defendants, including another Presidential candidate and a  journalist from Radio Free Europe, received an equally outrageous  sentence from Lukashenko. What a waste; what an outright theft of the  Belarusian people's future.   These people must be freed, and we must continue to support Ms.  Tikhanovskaya's effort, and her husband, and the thousands upon  thousands who peacefully protest on her behalf.                                  Lithuania    Madam President, this morning I was listening to the news, as I came  in, on National Public Radio. And I will close by just noting that the  most recent report led me to make this statement on the floor today.   It seems that the Lithuanians have been compelled to close their  Embassy in Beijing. The Chinese Government will no longer promise the  most basic tenet of ambassadorial representation: diplomatic immunity.  They are still angry because this little country of 2.6 million people  is establishing trade relations with Taiwan.   The Chinese have said they are cutting off all exports and imports to  Lithuania, putting pressure on them for their political courage. It  won't work, I might say, to Prime Minister Xi. These people are not  going to be bullied or pushed around. They have shown an extraordinary  amount of courage. And I hope all of the world, particularly their  great allies here in the United States, understand that these Baltic  States--and my mother's country of Lithuania--are standing up for  values which we all treasure as Americans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I just want to join the comments of  Senator Murkowski and Senator Ernst and Senator Feinstein. I want to  thank them for allowing me to join a pretty power-packed team working  on the Violence Against Women Act.   Senator Feinstein is our lead sponsor on the Democratic side. I am  happy to work with her all the time. I want to especially thank Senator  Ernst on the Republican side, who has been designated as the official  negotiator on the reauthorization of VAWA for the last 3 years, and, as  you have just heard, a passionate supporter of our efforts, Senator  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska--we worked closely together on other  legislation, and this one is extremely important.   This afternoon, Senators Ernst, Feinstein, Murkowski, and myself have  announced that we have reached a bipartisan agreement and that we will  be introducing an updated version of VAWA next month when we return. We  are coming together in supporting the simple premise that VAWA will  save lives. We need to ensure every survivor, whether they live in  rural Alaska or urban Illinois, can reach out for a lifeline in a  moment of crisis.   We still have work to do. We still need cosponsors. We are going to  be working individually, Member to Member, to make sure this important  legislation passes.   It is a statistic that should shock us all: Nearly one in three women  living today--nearly one in three--has experienced some form of  physical or sexual violence. That finding came from the WHO, surveying  women in more than 160 countries across the globe. It proves that this  crisis of sexual and domestic violence touches every community in the  world. But our responsibility, first, is here at home, in all of the 50  States, to make sure that we are doing everything we can to protect  women who are vulnerable.   Let me tell you about one of those survivors; her name is Meaghan.  And she reached out to my office to share her story. Five years ago,  Meaghan was brutally assaulted by her ex-husband. The beating was so  violent that, today, she is still suffering from hearing loss.   While Meaghan was being attacked, her 2-and-half-year-old son--who is  on the autism spectrum--ran over to help her. Her ex-husband responded  by throwing the child through a closet. Meaghan says the experience was  so traumatizing that her son didn't speak for a full year after the  attack.   When Meaghan finally broke free from her ex-husband, she packed her  bags, buckled her two children into the car, and fled for her life. But  he continued tracking her, requiring Meaghan and her children to move  10 times in the last few years.   As Meaghan and her family have begun to heal from this horrifying  ordeal, she says they have found much-needed compassion and support in  the detectives and social workers that came to their aid.   She wrote that service providers ``were patient with me and didn't  push me, [they] only showed me they cared, and most of all didn't give  up . . . with their support and guidance I found the light at the end  of the tunnel and I fought my way out of the darkness that my ex- husband had cast . . . on my life.''   Meaghan's story illustrates how laws like VAWA have the potential to  change--and even save--lives. In her case, VAWA provided critical  resources to law enforcement and social service agencies that helped  her and her family escape a perilous situation.   And today, at a moment when sexual and domestic violence are on the  rise in America, we need to do more than reauthorize VAWA. We need to  build on its achievements--and we need to do it on a bipartisan basis.   I thank the group for allowing me to join them.   We have work to do, and I am looking forward to doing it with you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Judge Holly Thomas is a nominee for the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. She went through the  Senate Judiciary Committee. It is a bipartisan committee of 11 to 11.  She was before the committee, available for questions and available for  written questions soon afterward.   If the Senator from Alaska or any other Senator has a grievance with  the White House's procedure on how to handle his nominees, so be it,  but is she going to be punished because that decision was made at the  White House level? She went through the committee, as we asked her to,  and made herself available. She has an extraordinary record as a  jurist, and to dismiss her because of a disagreement with the White  House on the procedure on his nominees, I don't think it is fair. I  think she deserves to be judged on her merits, and on her merits, she  should be sitting on the Ninth Circuit.   Mr. President, today, the Senate will consider the nomination of  Judge Holly Thomas for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.   Judge Thomas is a highly qualified nominee. Her extensive experience  as an appellate litigator and a California State court judge will serve  her well on the Ninth Circuit.   And, if confirmed, she would be the first Black woman from California  to serve on that court.   A San Diego native, Judge Thomas was drawn to a career in law at a  young age. Her mother--a bookkeeper--used to take her to the San Diego  courthouse to watch the proceedings. That experience inspired her to  pursue a law degree at Yale Law School--which she did after receiving  her undergraduate degree from Stanford University with Honors and  Distinction.   After law school, Judge Thomas began her legal career as a clerk for  Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw on the Ninth Circuit.   She then began an expansive appellate litigation career, initially  working at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, where she  focused on education and issues related to criminal justice.   In 2010, Judge Thomas joined the Justice Department, where she worked  as a Senior Attorney in the Appellate Section of the Civil Rights  Division. In this role, she argued appeals on behalf of the United  States before multiple U.S. Courts of Appeals--including the First,  Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits.   After 5 years at the Justice Department, Judge Thomas went on to work  for the Office of the New York Solicitor General, where she served as  special counsel. In this role, Judge Thomas argued multiple cases  before the Second Circuit and in the State courts of New York.   In 2016, Judge Thomas became the deputy director of the California  Department of Fair Employment and Housing, where she helped enforce  State and Federal civil rights laws.   Since 2018, she has served on the Los Angeles County Superior Court-- with the exception of this past summer. In May, the chief justice of  the California Supreme Court chose Judge Thomas to serve as judge pro  tem on the California Court of Appeals. And she returned to the LA  County Superior Court earlier this year.   During her time on the bench, Judge Thomas has handled hundreds of  cases that have gone to verdict or judgment, and she has presided over  thousands of hearings. As judge pro tem on the California Court of  Appeals, she sat on numerous appellate court panels and authored seven  opinions, all of which were unanimous.   In short, Judge Thomas has demonstrated that she is a fair,  impartial, and evenhanded jurist.   She has extensive experience as a both a trial and appellate court  judge. And before her appointment to the bench, she represented a wide  range of litigants.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Thomas as  ``Qualified'' to sit on the Ninth Circuit.   And she has the strong support of her home State senators--Senators  Feinstein and Padilla.   Additionally, as only the second Black woman to ever serve on the  Ninth Circuit, Judge Thomas will help  [[Page S9236]]  bring much needed diversity to our Federal judiciary.   Given her varied professional background, years of appellate  experience, and her accomplishments on the bench, Judge Thomas will be  an excellent addition to the Ninth Circuit. I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting her nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, let me in closing say: I think we should  be respectful and try to work with one another and cooperate. That also  includes the over 100 nominees sitting on this calendar who have been  obstructed by two or three Republican Members for weeks, if not months.  If there is going to be fairness, let's make sure that the road travels  in both directions.   I yield back all remaining time.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), are necessarily  absent.
