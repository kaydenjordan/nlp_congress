 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, agency guidance serves an important function in the  Federal regulatory system. Agency guidance helps regulated parties and  the public understand how agencies will interpret the laws and  administer their programs.   However, agency guidance can be--and has been--abused. For example,  agencies can use guidance documents to intimidate small businesses and  individuals into compliance with agency views, sometimes under the  threat of enforcement action.   Small businesses and the American people often do not have the legal  resources or necessary background to know when an agency statement is  binding law. It is tough for the public to determine what agency  statements are binding and what are not.   Even Federal agencies have a tough time understanding the difference.  They have been known to try to start enforcement actions based simply  on guidance. Agencies have also been known to attempt to issue binding  rules by quietly slipping rule language into guidance documents. This  clearly bypasses the Administrative Procedure Act's requirements that  were put in place to protect regulated individuals and small  businesses.   The courts coined the term ``non-rule rule'' to describe this Big  Government sleight of hand, and the courts have rightly struck down  such rules that only appeared in agency guidance.   The Guidance Clarity Act offers a simple solution to these problems.  It requires agency guidance documents to include the following explicit  statement:   ``The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of  law and do not, of themselves, bind the public or the agency.   ``This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public  regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.''   With that stroke of the pen, gone will be the days in which agencies  can use guidance documents to force small businesses and individuals to  comply with nonbinding agency views. Gone too will be the days of the  agencies trying to issue non-rule rules that bypass the Administrative  Procedure Act's requirements for legislative rules.   I thank Senator Lankford for his hard work to make this legislation  the law of the land.   I also thank the sponsor of the companion bill in this House, the  ranking member of the Small Business Committee, Blaine Luetkemeyer, who  has worked tirelessly on this bill since he first introduced it during  the 115th Congress.   Also, I thank House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman  Maloney, Ranking Member   James Comer, and Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Chairman Gary Peters for their critical efforts to  help make passage of this bill a bipartisan success.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, thanks to the Guidance Clarity Act, small business  owners and individuals across the country will soon have the confidence  that agency guidance--however helpful and clarifying it may be--is not  legally binding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this necessary  bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in 2019, President Trump signed the Civil Rights Cold  Case Investigations Support Act into law after it passed with broad  bipartisan support in Congress.   The act directed the National Archives and Records Administration to  make a collection of previously sealed civil rights cold case records  available for public scrutiny. It also required the National Archives  to establish a process for Federal agencies to transmit cold case  records--older records from about 1940 to 1979--to the National  Archives.   To do this, an independent agency review board was established to  review the National Archives' civil rights cold case records and  evaluate which public record disclosures should be postponed.   The review board is also charged with investigating cold case records  and requesting relevant documents held by government agencies and the  courts be transferred to the National Archives. However, this board was  not fully formed until this year, leaving the review board with less  time than Congress intended before it terminates at the end of 2024.   The bill before us today, the Civil Rights Cold Case Investigations  Support Act, will extend the review board's term until 2027. This  extension will allow the board to increase the volume of cold case  documents made available to the public. This will enable journalists,  students, and others to lend their expertise to help investigate and  resolve unsolved civil rights cold cases.   According to the Department of Justice, about 115 civil rights cases  remain unsolved, and the older the cases become, the less likely they  will ever be solved.   The 2019 law was necessary to establish a specific process for  addressing cold case records instead of having citizens rely on the  Freedom of Information Act to directly request individual  [[Page H8482]]  records from law enforcement agencies. The Freedom of Information Act  is a valuable Federal records transparency tool, but it is not designed  for enabling efficient access to open criminal cases.                                time  1715    Every cold case that is solved as a result of this legislation will  provide long-awaited answers to the surviving family members of the  victims and bring about resolution to the local communities where these  crimes occurred.   S. 3655 will ensure that the review board has the necessary time to  complete its critical work.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senators Ted Cruz and Jon Ossoff for moving this  bipartisan legislation through the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the House Committee on Oversight and Reform  Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Ranking Member   James Comer for their  support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that my colleagues support this important bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill continues to make  information regarding cold cases available to the public. The American  people deserve transparency from their Federal Government. I encourage  my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3510, the Disaster Resiliency  Planning Act.   Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and wildfires cause significant damage  across the country to Federal real property assets. According to the  Government Accountability Office, over the past 5 years, Congress has  spent billions of dollars to repair Federal assets damaged by natural  disasters. Yet, for decades, Federal agencies have made minimal efforts  to prepare for natural disasters and make their real property assets  more resilient. This is unacceptable.   Billions in taxpayer dollars have been wasted to repair assets left  unprepared in the face of reoccurring and predictable risk posed by  natural disasters and extreme weather events.   Natural disasters are a fact of life, and the U.S. Government  maintains a sprawling footprint of buildings and facilities across our  great Nation. We must recognize these realities. The Disaster  Resiliency Planning Act does this.   It tasks the Office of Management and Budget with issuing guidance  requiring Federal agencies to incorporate natural disaster resilience  planning into their real property asset management and investment  decisions. This will help save taxpayer dollars and ensure Federal  agencies are acting in a fiscally responsible manner.   Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will save  taxpayer dollars and ensure Federal property recovers from natural  disasters more quickly.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1941, the Metropolitan Areas Protection and  Standardization Act, or MAPS Act, is a technical but important bill.   Maintaining government-wide statistical standards may seem mundane,  but these standards have real-world consequences. We saw this last year  when the Office of Management and Budget tried to make updates to the  definition of core-based statistical areas. Out of the 734 public  comments submitted, 712 comments opposed definitional change. As a  result, the Office of Management and Budget delayed its proposed  recommendation.   Municipalities and other organizations should not feel caught off  guard by standards changes in the future. The MAPS Act will help  provide transparency if the Office of Management and Budget tries to  revise core-based statistical area standards in the future.   This bill will provide better visibility into how these statistical  standards are used in Federal domestic assistance programs to determine  funding eligibility; and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National  Rural Health Association, and the National Association of Counties all  agree that this legislation is needed.   I thank Senators Rob Portman and Jerry Moran, as well as Chairman  Gary Peters, for moving this bipartisan bill through the Senate.   I also take a moment to thank Carolyn Maloney, the chairwoman, and  Ranking Member   James Comer for advancing this legislation through the  House Oversight Committee. I support this legislation, and I encourage  my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1941 will provide transparency into the Office of  Management and Budget's work in the area of statistical standards. This  bill does not restrict OMB from continuing its work keeping important  statistical standards up to date. Instead, it provides transparency  into future revisions of core-based statistical area standards. It also  provides visibility into use of such standards in Federal domestic  assistance programs.   I once again encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7899, which honors Army  Specialist Joseph ``Joey'' W. Dimock, II.   Joey, as he was known to his loved ones, grew up in Wildwood,  Illinois, where he was actively involved with his church, swim team,  and Boy Scout Troop 672, earning the rank of Eagle Scout.   He joined the Army his senior year of high school and served for  nearly 3 years with the 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment.   He was serving his third overseas deployment, his second deployment  to Afghanistan, when he died on July 10, 2010, in a noncombat explosion  at an ammunition holding facility.   For his time in service, he was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star  Medal and Army Commendation Medal.   Specialist Dimock was a true American patriot that paid the ultimate  price in service to a grateful Nation. I encourage my colleagues to  support this bill honoring his sacrifice and service.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring  an American war hero, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6917, which would name a  post office in Crystal Lake, Illinois, for Marine Corporal Ryan J.  Cummings.   Corporal Cummings was born in Cook County, Illinois, in 1984. Marine  Corporal Cummings was set on becoming a marine and, according to his  family, signed up for duty on September 10, 2001, the night before the  September 11 attacks on our Nation.   He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Division  Expeditionary Force based at Camp Pendleton. Sadly, he died from wounds  sustained while conducting combat operations in Iraq on his third  deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was only 22 years  old.   Corporal Cummings was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart in  recognition of having made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our  grateful Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring  Marine Corporal Ryan J. Cummings, a true American war hero.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2473, which honors  Corporal Howard Arthur Tibbs.   Corporal Tibbs was one of the storied Tuskegee Airmen and served in  the 99th Fighter Squadron and the 477th Medium Composite Group in World  War II.   He was born and raised in Salem, Ohio, where his family had long  resided. After his time in the military, he graduated from Youngstown  College and enjoyed a long career with the Internal Revenue Service.   In recognition of his bravery and contributions to this country,  Corporal Tibbs was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in  2007 after passing away on January 26, 1986, in Newark, Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill  honoring an American veteran and a true hero.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill honoring an American veteran and hero, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7518, which would name a  Michigan post office for Roy Dickens.   Mr. Dickens was a dedicated public servant in Hazel Park, Michigan.  In fact, he was the longest-serving public official in Hazel Park,  starting in 1967 when he joined the Hazel Park Police Department after  serving in the United States Army. He retired from the police  department in 1995 and then went  [[Page H8488]]  to work as a court officer until 2010. He is remembered fondly for his  43 years of service to the local community.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, which  honors a community civil servant and law enforcement officer.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill honoring a great public servant, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3826, which names a post  office in Canyon, Texas, for Gary James Fletcher.   Mr. Fletcher was born in nearby Amarillo, Texas, and grew up in  Canyon, Texas. He joined the United States Army as a specialist E5 and  was a decorated Vietnam war veteran, having been awarded the National  Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and the Republic of  Vietnam Campaign Medal.   Upon his return to Canyon, Texas, he attended West Texas State  University and graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration and  Finance. He put his degree to work as a successful banker and rancher.  He also devoted countless hours to volunteering, including with the  United Way and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Most importantly, he was a  devoted husband, father, grandfather, brother, and friend.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring a great  veteran and American hero, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Jackson).    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, honoring an American veteran, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3884, which honors Cora  Reynolds Anderson, the first woman elected to the Michigan House of  Representatives and the first Native American woman elected to serve in  a State legislature.   Ms. Anderson was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in  1924, just 4 years after women were granted the right to vote.   During her sole term in office, she chaired the Industrial Home for  Girls Committee. She was also an advocate for public health, helping  Baraga County, Michigan, secure its first public health nurse and  organize the county's first public health service.   As a member of the Ojibwa Native American Tribe, she also fought to  recognize Native American fishing rights on Huron Bay.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring  this loyal public servant, and I yield back the balance of my time.
