 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 446, a bill to extend the  deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project,  introduced by Mr. Griffith.   On March 13, 2012, FERC licensed the Gathright Hydroelectric Project  to be located at the Army Corps of Engineers' Gathright Dam on the  Jackson River in Alleghany County, Virginia. The licensee for the  Gathright project was not able to commence construction by the already- extended deadline in March 2016.   The bill would, therefore, authorize FERC to extend for up to three  consecutive 2-year periods the date by which the licensee is required  to commence construction. Similar legislation passed the House of  Representatives by voice vote twice during the last Congress.   I hope everybody will support passage of H.R. 446. I hope we can get  this thing built.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I again rise in support of legislation by Mr. Griffith, H.R. 447,  which would extend the deadline for commencement of construction of the  Flannagan Hydroelectric Project, to be located at the Army Corps of  Engineers' John W. Flannagan Dam on the Russell Fork River in Dickenson  County, Virginia.   The licensee for the Flannagan Hydroelectric Project did not commence  construction by the already-extended deadline in January 2016.  Legislation is now required for the project to move forward.   The bill would authorize FERC to extend for up to three consecutive  years the date by which the licensee is required to commence  construction.   During the last Congress, the full House of Representatives passed  similar legislation by voice vote. I once again hope my colleagues will  help me in supporting passage of H.R. 447. Let's get this one built,  too.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my strong support for H.R. 627, Mr.  Cartwright's Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act. This is a  great bill that will provide a coordinated structure for our Nation's  schools to help them better navigate available Federal programs and  financing options.   Across the country, K-12 school districts spend literally billions of  dollars on their energy bills each year while an estimated 14 million  American children attend deteriorating public schools. By upgrading  these systems, we can increase efficiency and focus school funding to  achieve better educational outcomes.   This legislation passed the House previously with broad bipartisan  support, and I urge everybody to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us, sponsored by the gentlewoman  from North Carolina, would authorize FERC to extend for 6 years the  date by which the licensee for the W. Kerr Scott Hydropower Project is  required to commence construction. This is necessary because the  project's licensee was not able to commence construction by the  already-extended deadline of July 17, 2016.   Similar legislation authored by Ms. Foxx passed the House during the  114th Congress by a vote of 406-3. I hope my colleagues will support  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1109, sponsored by Representatives Walberg  and Dingell, which would add a $10 million threshold to trigger FERC  review of a merger or consolidation. This is a significant change to  current law as established through the Energy Policy Act of 2005.   Obviously, FERC should not have to rely on trade publications or on  word of mouth to know that merger or consolidation activity involving  regulated utilities is occurring. This bill, as reported by the Energy  and Commerce Committee, includes language requiring FERC to undertake a  rulemaking to develop a short, simple, notification process for  transactions above the $1  [[Page H4828]]  million mark that fall below the new $10 million threshold.   This addresses a problem, in that FERC lacked a standardized way to  acquire the information necessary to know that these below-threshold  transactions were occurring. Without that knowledge, it would be too  easy for someone looking to evade the new $10 million threshold to  break their transaction into smaller pieces and, thereby, escape  review.   I want to commend the gentleman and the gentlewoman from Michigan for  their work to address this matter. I think this is sensible legislation  that reduces the burden on industry and on the government, while  ensuring the public good is fully protected.   I urge the passage of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2122, a bill to extend the  deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project  involving the Jennings Randolph Dam, sponsored by my Energy and  Commerce Committee colleague, Mr. McKinley.   In March 2012, FERC licensed the construction of a hydroelectric  facility at the Army Corps' Jennings Randolph Dam located on the  Potomac River's North Branch in Maryland and West Virginia. The  licensee for the Jennings Randolph Dam project was not able to commence  construction by the already-extended deadline of April 2016. The bill  would authorize FERC to extend for 6 years the date by which the  licensee is required to commence construction.   FERC has no objections to this legislation, and similar legislation  passed the House by a 418-2 vote during the 114th Congress. I hope my  colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 2122, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2274, the HYdropower Permit  Extension, or HYPE, Act.   I am pleased that the House is considering this legislation, which  was recently introduced by my colleague, Mr. Peters, of the committee,  to provide the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with the authority  to grant longer periods for preliminary and construction permits and  associated extensions under sections 5 and 13 of the Federal Power Act.   Right now, as we have seen from the debating of these six bills  today, this is something that can only be done by an act of Congress on  a case-by-case basis.                                time  1615    As much as we have all enjoyed debating these extensions of time  today, it is clear that it would be more efficient and it also would  save more time in Congress if these extensions could be done directly  by FERC. I commend Mr. Peters. I hope all of my colleagues will join me  in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would do the same, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2292, a bill to extend the  deadline for commencement and construction of a hydroelectric project  involving the Cannonsville Dam.   On May 13, 2014, FERC licensed construction of a hydroelectric  facility at the Cannonsville Reservoir located on the west branch of  the Delaware River in Delaware County, New York. The licensee for this  project was not able to commence construction by the deadline of May  2016.   The additional reviews and repairs to the dam, which are necessary to  begin construction of the hydroelectric project, will delay  construction commencement beyond the expiration date of the original  license and the 2-year extension which FERC is authorized to grant.   The bill would, therefore, authorize FERC to extend up to 8 years the  date by which the licensee is required to commence construction.   Similar legislation passed the House during the 114th Congress by a  vote of 417-2. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H4831]]    Mr. Speaker, this is the last bill in our cohort of six extension  bills that we are considering today, which I hope Mr. Peters' bill will  absolve us from having to do in the future.   This bill, the J. Bennett Johnston Waterway Hydropower Extension Act  of 2017 was introduced by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson) on  May 16, 2017. It would extend the time period during which the licensee  is required to commence the construction of the project for up to three  consecutive 2-year periods from the date of expiration of the original  extension.   Additionally, the legislation defers the obligation on the licensee  to pay any annual charges required under section 10(e) of the Federal  Power Act until the project actually commences construction.   Finally, the legislation allows for the prospective reinstatement of  the license should that license expire prior to the legislation's date  of enactment.   I just have to add a few words to what Mr. Peters said earlier.  Hydropower is so important. It is such an important renewable energy  source in this country. We need to do everything we can on a bipartisan  basis to make sure that we expedite these dams, that we really work  together to get hydropower, even more important in our energy  portfolio.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will favorably consider this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased we are considering this  bill sponsored by my friend and colleague, the ranking member of the  Energy Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Rush.   I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Rush).    Mr. Speaker, my home State of Colorado has an economy  strongly based in the energy industry. Of course, my district, which is  primarily an urban district, has many, many workers who could be  working in this industry, so I want to commend both of these gentlemen  for sponsoring this legislation.   It is a good bill. We need to get it across the finish line.  Hopefully, because we are doing it early in this Congress, we can get  that done. Please vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
