 Mr. Speaker, from his very first day in  office, President Trump has worked to sabotage and repeal the  Affordable Care Act.   Despite being unable to pass a repeal bill, President Trump hasn't  stopped working to make it harder for people with preexisting  conditions to afford coverage. Last week, HHS announced that it will  allow the sale of short-term junk insurance plans that don't provide  essential coverage and exclude people with preexisting conditions.  Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions argues that such protections  are unconstitutional.   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to understand why the President, who promised  wonderful healthcare for all, is so committed to attacking the most  popular parts of the Affordable Care Act.   Constance, a constituent from my district, wrote, back during the  repeal debate, that: ``The ACA saved my life, as I would not be able to  afford my healthcare without it.''   Mr. Speaker, we in Congress need to be doing more to protect people  like Constance and all of those who have been diagnosed with a  preexisting condition.   We need to be doing more, not less                            ____________________
