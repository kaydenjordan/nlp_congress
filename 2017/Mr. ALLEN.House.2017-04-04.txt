 Mr. Speaker, as you know, I have the honor of representing  the 12th Congressional District of Georgia and the good people who live  and work there.   This week, thousands will gather in Augusta to take part in a  tradition unlike any other.   Beginning in 1934, the Masters, hosted by the Augusta National Golf  Club, has become the most prestigious golf tournament in the world.  Known for its lightning-fast greens and gorgeous azaleas, this  tournament captivates the world for both the talent of those playing  and its beauty. Since its inception, many legends have conquered the  greens to prove their skill and earn the coveted green jacket.   This year will be a little somber, as we will deeply miss another of  the great legends, four-time Masters champion Arnold Palmer. His  presence will certainly be missed on that first tee as an honorary  starter and throughout this great week.   I wish the best to all those competing in this truly remarkable event  and invite those who are traveling from far and wide to experience and  enjoy the wonderful hospitality of the 12th Congressional District of  Georgia and my home, Augusta.                            ____________________
