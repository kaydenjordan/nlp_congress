 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume consideration of the King nomination.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. today.    Mr. President, I come to the floor because Democrats  out on the campaign trail continue to spin their one-size-fits-all  healthcare plan that they call Medicare for All. The name itself is  misleading. I will state that as a doctor who has practiced medicine in  Wyoming for 24 years.   Even many Democrats in the first Presidential debate sounded confused  about their own proposal. The candidates were asked a simple question.  They were asked to raise their hands if they supported eliminating  private health insurance. That is the health insurance people get from  work. ``Just four arms went up over the two nights,'' but ``five  candidates who kept their hands at their sides,'' the New York Times  has now reported, ``have signed onto bills in [this] Congress that do  exactly that''--take health insurance away from people who get it from  work.   On one point, though, they all raised their hands. That was on the  question that was asked of all 10 Democrats in round 2 of the debate.  They all endorsed taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal immigrants.  Every hand went up.   It seems Democrats have actually been hiding their real, radical  agenda. ``Most Americans don't realize how dramatically Medicare-for- all would restructure the nation's health care system.'' That is not  just me talking; that is according to the latest Kaiser Family  Foundation poll. We need to set the record straight, and I am ready to  do that right now.   The fact is, Democrats have taken a hard left turn, and they want to  take away your health insurance if you get it from work. The proposal  abolishes private health insurance, the insurance people get from work.  In its place, they would have one expensive, new government-run system.  Still, Democrats know most of us would rather keep our own coverage  that we get from work. Even the people on Medicare Advantage--20  million people--would lose it under the Democrats' proposal. The Kaiser  poll confirms Americans' top concern is, of course, lowering their  costs or, as the Washington Post ``Health'' column put it, people  simply want ``to pay less for their own health care.''   That is what we are committed to on this side of the aisle.   Many Democrats running for President continue to promote and support  this radical scheme by Senator Sanders. The Sanders legislation would  take away healthcare insurance from 180 million people who get their  insurance through work, through their jobs. In addition, 20 million  people who buy their insurance would lose coverage as well.   You also need to know that the Democrats' proposal ends the current  government healthcare programs. Medicare for seniors would be gone.  Federal employees' health insurance would be gone. TRICARE for the  military would be gone, and the children's health coverage also would  be gone under this Democratic healthcare, one-size-fits-all plan. That  is confirmed by the Congressional Research Service.   The Congressional Research Service recently sent me a formal legal  opinion. I requested it from them. It is a formal, legal opinion,  stating: Medicare for All ``would . . . largely displace these existing  federally funded health programs'' that I just mentioned--Medicare,  Federal employees' health insurance, TRICARE, children's health  coverage. It would largely displace these existing Federal health  programs as well as private health insurance, the insurance people get  from work.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the  [[Page S4750]]  Congressional Research Service memorandum, dated May 29, 2019.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 Memorandum       To: Senator John Barrasso, Attention: Jay Eberle.      From: Wen S. Shen, Legislative Attorney.      Subject: Effect of S. 1129 on Certain Federally Funded Health           Programs and Private Health Insurance.        Pursuant to your request, this memorandum discusses the       legal effect of S. 1129, the Medicare for All Act of 2019       (MFAA or Act) on various public and private health care       programs or plans. Specifically, the memorandum analyzes       whether the MFAA would authorize the following programs or       plans to continue in their current form:        Medicare (including Medicare Advantage and Part D);        Medicaid (including the Children's Health Insurance       Program);        TRICARE;        Plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act;       and        Individual, Small and Large Group Market Coverage.        For reasons discussed in greater detail below, the Program       created by the MFAA would, following a phase-in period and       with some limited exceptions, largely displace these existing       federally funded health programs as well as private health       insurance. This memorandum begins with a description of the       key provisions of the MFAA before turning to its legal effect       on the programs and plans that are the subject of your       request.                         Medicare for All Act of 2019         The MFAA aims to establish a national health insurance       program (Program) that would ``provide comprehensive       protection against the cost of health care and health-related       services'' in accordance with the standards set forth under       the Act. Specifically, under the Program, every resident of       the United States, after a four-year phase-in period       following the MFAA's enactment, would be entitled to have the       Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) make       payments on their behalf to an eligible provider for services       and items in 13 benefits categories, provided they are       ``medically necessary or appropriate for the maintenance of       health or diagnosis, treatment or rehabilitation of a health       condition.'' Except for prescription drugs and biological       products, for which the Secretary may set a cost-sharing       schedule that would not exceed $200 annually per enrollee and       meet other statutory criteria, no enrollee would be       responsible for any cost-sharing for any other covered       benefits under the Program. The bill would direct the       Secretary to develop both a mechanism for enrolling existing       eligible individuals by the end of the phase-in period and a       mechanism for automatically enrolling newly eligible       individuals at birth or upon establishing residency in the       United States.        All state-licensed health care providers who meet the       applicable state and federal provider standards may       participate in the Program, provided they file a       participation agreement with the Secretary that meets       specified statutory requirements. The Secretary would pay       participating providers pursuant to a fee schedule that would       be set in a manner consistent with the processes for       determining payments under the existing Medicare program.       Participating providers would be prohibited from balance       billing enrollees for any covered services paid under the       Program, but providers would be free to enter into private       contracts with enrollees to provide any item or service if no       claims for payment are submitted to the Secretary and the       contracts meet certain statutory requirements.        With respect to payment for covered pharmaceuticals,       medical supplies, and medically necessary assistive       equipment, the Secretary would negotiate their payment rate       annually with the relevant manufacturers. The bill would       further direct the Secretary to establish a prescription drug       formulary system that would encourage best practices in       prescribing; discourage the use of ineffective, dangerous, or       excessively costly medications; and promote the use of       generic medications to the greatest extent possible. Off-      formulary medications would be permitted under the Program,       but their use would be subject to further regulations the       Secretary issues.        With respect to the Program's administration, the bill       would authorize the Secretary to develop the relevant       policies, procedures, guidelines, and requirements necessary       to carry out the Program. The Secretary would also establish       and maintain regional offices--by incorporating existing       regional offices of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid       Services where possible--to assess annual state health care       needs, recommend changes in provider reimbursement, and       establish a quality assurance mechanism in the state aimed at       optimizing utilization and maintaining certain standards of       care.        To fund the Program, the bill would create a Universal       Medicare Trust Fund. Funds currently appropriated to       Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employees Health Benefits       Program (FEHBP), TRICARE, and a number of other federally       funded health programs would be appropriated to the new fund.        The MFAA also includes a number of other provisions related       to the administration of the Program, including an       enforcement provision aimed at preventing fraud and abuse,       provisions relating to quality assessment, and provisions       concerning budget and cost containment.     Effect of the MFAA on Certain Federally Funded Health Programs and                          Private Health Insurance       Federally Funded Health Programs        The federal government currently funds a number of health       programs, including (1) Medicare, which generally provides       health insurance coverage to elderly and disabled enrollees,       (2) Medicaid, which is a federal-state cooperative program       wherein states receive federal funds to generally provide       health benefits to low-income enrollees, (3) the Children's       Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which is a federal-state       cooperative program that provides health benefits to certain       low-income children whose families earn too much to qualify       for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance; (4) the       FEHBP, which generally provides health insurance coverage to       civilian federal employees, and (5) TRICARE, which provides       civilian health insurance coverage to dependents of active       military personnel and retirees of the military (and their       dependents). Following an initial phase-in period, the MFAA       would prohibit benefits from being made available under       Medicare, FEHBP, and TRICARE while also prohibiting payments       to the states for CHIP. These payment prohibitions would       effectively terminate these programs in their current form.       This reading is confirmed by Sec. 701(b)(2) of the MFAA,       which redirects funding for these programs to the national       Program.        With respect to Medicaid, the MFAA would significantly       limit its scope. After the MFAA's effective date, Medicaid       would only continue to cover services that the new national       Program would not otherwise cover. Thus, Medicaid benefits       for institutional long-term care services (which are not       among the 13 categories of covered services under the MFAA)       and any other services furnished by a state that the Program       would not cover, would continue to be administered by the       states. The bill would direct the Secretary to coordinate       with the relevant state agencies to identify the services for       which Medicaid benefits would be preserved and to ensure       their continued availability under the applicable state       plans.                           Private Health Insurance         Currently, private health insurance in the United States       consists of (1) private sector employer-sponsored group       plans, which can be self-insured (i.e., funded directly by       the employer) or fully insured (i.e., purchased from       insurers), and (2) group or individual health plans sold       directly by insurers to the insured (both inside and outside       of health insurance exchanges established under Section 1311       of the Affordable Care Act). The MFAA would prohibit       employers from providing, and insurers from selling, any       health plans that would ``duplicate[]the benefits provided       under [the MFAA].'' Given that the benefits offered under       many existing private health plans would likely overlap       with--i.e., be the same as--at least some of the benefits       within the Program's 13 categories of covered benefits, those       existing health plans would likely ``duplicate'' the benefits       provided under the MFAA. Thus, this prohibition of duplicate       coverage would effectively eliminate those existing private       health plans. Employers and insurers, however, would be       allowed to offer as benefits or for sale supplemental       insurance coverage for any additional benefits not covered by       the Program. As a result, employers and insurers could offer,       for instance, coverage for institutional long-term care       services, which are not among the 13 categories of covered       services.     Mr. President, this report details how the bills cut  off funding.   The CRS memo concludes: These payment prohibitions would effectively  terminate all of those programs I mentioned in their current form.   The Congressional Research Service finds that Medicare for All  actually terminates Medicare in this country. So Democrats want to turn  Medicare, currently for 60 million seniors, into Medicare for None. It  will become Medicare for None, not Medicare for All. Plus, 22 million  people would lose Medicare Advantage. I know many of my patients who  signed up for Medicare Advantage because there are advantages to doing  it--coordinated care, working on preventive medicine. There are reasons  for signing up for Medicare Advantage. That would all be gone under the  one-size-fits-all approach that the Democrats are proposing.   That is not all. This report says the Sanders bill ends Federal  employee health insurance. There are more than 8 million Federal  workers, families, and retirees who rely on this Federal Employee  Health Benefits Program.   The Congressional Research Service says that this bill, sponsored by  over 100 Members who are Democrats in the House of Representatives and  sponsored by a number of Democrats in this body, will abolish TRICARE,  the insurance for the military. More than 9 million military members,  their families,  [[Page S4751]]  and retirees rely on TRICARE for their healthcare.   The report says the bill ends the Children's Health Insurance  Program. Nine million of our Nation's children rely on the CHIP  program.   Interestingly, ObamaCare would end as well, according to the CRS  report. After less than a decade, Democrats want to repeal and replace  their failed ObamaCare healthcare law with a one-size-fits-all system.   Again, the Congressional Research Service says the bill bans private  health insurance. One hundred eighty million people get their insurance  through work.   To sum up, hundreds of millions of American citizens--American  citizens--stand to lose their insurance, and I believe that is just the  start of the pain for American families. In the new system, we would  all be at the mercy of Washington bureaucrats. That means we would be  paying more to wait longer for worse care--pay more to wait longer for  worse care. The Democrats' massive plan is expected to cost $32  trillion. That is trillion with a ``t.'' That is a 10-year pricetag.   Guess who is going to pay for that mind-boggling bill--of course,  every American taxpayer. Senator Sanders admitted in the Democratic  debate the other night that his proposal would raise taxes on middle- class families. His proposal will raise taxes, he said, on middle-class  families.   In fact, even doubling our taxes wouldn't cover the huge cost of what  they are proposing. So Washington Democrats are planning to drastically  cut payments to doctors, nurses, hospitals, and to people who are  providing care. The bureaucrats would ration care, restrict care--the  care you get that you need--and it would be restricted in terms of  treatment as well as technology. People would lose the freedom to  choose the hospital or doctor they want.   As a doctor, I am especially concerned about the impact on patient  care. Patients could wait weeks, even months, for urgently needed  treatment. Keep in mind care delayed is often care denied. So the  Democrats' grand healthcare vision is to force you to pay more to wait  longer for worse care.   As a Senator and a doctor, of course, I want to improve your care,  make it less costly. You should get insurance that is appropriate for  you and affordable. You should be free to make your own medical  decisions. That is what it is like in America.   No question, healthcare needs to be more affordable, and Republicans  are working to lower costs without lowering standards. To me, that is  the big difference. Democrats are proposing the reverse. Their plan  would lower your standard of care and raise your costs. Democrats can  keep campaigning hard left on healthcare. That is where they are  headed.    Republicans are going to stay focused on real reforms that promote  more affordable healthcare, cheaper prescription drugs, protections for  patients with preexisting conditions, and, of course, the end of  surprise medical bills. President Trump recently took Executive action  that increases price transparency to lower the costs that patients pay.   You just need to know the facts about the Democrats' one-size-fits- all healthcare. Don't let far-left Democrats fool you. Radical  Democrats want to take away your current healthcare. There would be no  more Medicare or private plans, just a one-size-fits-all Washington  plan.   Why pay more to wait longer for worse care? Instead, let's give  patients the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower costs.  That is our goal. That is our objective, and that is what we are going  to accomplish.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
