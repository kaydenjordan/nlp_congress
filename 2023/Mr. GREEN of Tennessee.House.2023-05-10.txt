 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  383, I call up the bill (H.R. 2) to secure the borders of the United  States, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2, the Secure the  Border Act of 2023.   Last year, Republicans made a commitment to America to secure our  borders, protect our Nation, and safeguard our communities. Today,  House Republicans are delivering on that promise.   No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, it is undeniable  that we are in the midst of a severe border crisis. In just over 2  years, President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas have intentionally turned  our Nation's border into a place of chaos and devastation, one  controlled by the drug cartels.   The administration's refusal to enforce the law or implement  effective policies to secure the border has led us to this point,  completely dismantling any semblance of law and order. Over the past  several months, the members of the Committee on Homeland Security have  been hard at work crafting a solution to address the administration's  self-inflicted crisis at our borders.   With input from our colleagues across the Republican Conference, as  well as Border Patrol agents, victims of illegal alien crime and the  drug crisis, small business owners, State and local law enforcement,  and farmers and ranchers, the committee has taken the time to fully  understand Secretary Mayorkas' record-breaking humanitarian crisis.   These are the everyday Americans bearing the brunt of this crisis who  are all too often overlooked by the media and the DC beltway. The  numbers that they, and now all Americans, are facing are staggering:   More than 5 million encounters at the southwest border since  President Biden took office;   Over 1.4 million known got-aways since February 2021;   193 aliens on the terrorist watch list encountered along the  southwest border trying to enter the country between ports of entry  from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2023;   Over 14,000 pounds of fentanyl seized in fiscal year 2023, enough to  kill the entire U.S. population nine and a half times;  [[Page H2217]]    Over 61,000 criminal aliens arrested by CBP attempting to cross the  U.S. borders since the beginning of FY 2021.   And just as we think it can't get any worse, tomorrow marks the end  of the only tool that Customs and Border Protection has left under this  administration, title 42.   As we have approached the end of title 42 the past few days, CBP has  been reporting an even greater increase in the number of alien  encounters and got-aways, which are already off the charts.   Whether my colleagues on the other side want to admit it or not, Mr.  Biden and Mr. Mayorkas' border crisis has turned every State into a  border State, and the American people have had enough.   From a record number of fentanyl deaths to rising crime, it is the  families and communities across America that are left to pay the price  of this administration's open borders and antisecurity policies.   These policies are enriching and emboldening transnational criminal  organizations who have increasingly threatened the safety and security  of all Americans.   However, we are here with a solution.   Thanks to the hard work of many members across multiple committees,  H.R. 2 requires the administration to secure the border, enforce the  law, and reduce illegal immigration, once again.   Specifically, division A of the bill addresses the immediate impact  of the border crisis by focusing on mitigating and stopping the surge  of illegal border crossers and illicit drugs that are flowing across  our borders between ports of entry.   Over 30 years ago, the United States Government began building the  border barrier system. We have heard from frontline agents on the  ground that an effective border barrier system is a proven critical  component in deterring and discouraging illegal activity. That is why  H.R. 2 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to immediately resume  construction of the border wall.   The bill requires at least 900 miles of wall to be built, using the  materials that American taxpayers have already paid for, but that under  President Biden are laying unused and left to deteriorate in the  desert.   This bill makes targeted investments in border technology that not  only supplements the border wall system, but also integrates new,  advanced, and improved technologies into Border Patrol operations that  will prioritize frontline personnel safety and the detection of illicit  activity.   We know that Border Patrol agents are leaving at a faster rate than  the CBP Commissioner can hire them. Under the Biden administration,  Border Patrol agents are stretched thin, both physically and mentally.  They are overwhelmed and overworked.   Customs and Border Protection agents are leaving before reaching  their retirement eligibility because of poor working conditions and low  morale due to a horrendous lack of support from the Biden  administration and the inability to do what they signed up to do-- enforce the law.                                time  1830    During the committee's field hearing on March 15, Border Patrol Chief  Raul Ortiz testified that he needs approximately 22,000 agents to  achieve Border Patrol's mission. H.R. 2 mandates CBP expand their force  by over 3,000 agents to reach that total of 22,000 agents.   The bill also aims to return agents back to their law enforcement  duties in the field by ensuring they are not responsible for serving as  processing coordinators, something that the Biden administration is  forcing highly trained law enforcement agents to do.   The bill addresses the retention challenges that Border Patrol is  facing by providing qualified agents with a retention bonus. They need  to know that all of us in Congress have their back and appreciate their  sacrifice.   The Department of Homeland Security has made very blatant attempts to  bury the release of its monthly border statistics or withhold certain  information from the public. That is why H.R. 2 requires DHS to  publicly disclose all monthly data, including known got-aways and known  or suspected terrorists, before the seventh day of each month.   Congress will not tolerate this administration's lack of transparency  to the American people, who deserve to know who and what is coming into  our country.   To further enhance border security measures, this bill increases  support for Operation Stonegarden, a grant program that provides funds  to State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies that are forced to  deal directly with the crisis, given the administration's complete  dereliction of duty.   Under H.R. 2, Operation Stonegarden grants will be increased to $110  million per year, and we know this support can't come soon enough for  our State and local law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

Hon. Mark Green,      Chairman, Committee on House Homeland Security, Ford House           Office Building, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Green: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2794, the ``Border Reinforcement Act of 2023.'' As you       noted, the Committee on Ways and Means was granted an       additional referral on this bill. I agree to forego action on       this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor for consideration.        The Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 2794 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our       Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as the       bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks       that you support any such request.        Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration of H.R. 2794.            Sincerely,                                                    Jason Smith,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Ways and Means.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                        Washington, DC, May 2, 2023.      Hon. Mark Green,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Green: I write regarding H.R. 2794, the       ``Border Reinforcement Act of 2023.'' Provisions of this bill       fall within the Judiciary Committee's Rule X jurisdiction,       and I appreciate that you consulted with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee agrees that it shall be       discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it       may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee takes this action with the understanding that       forgoing further consideration of this measure does not in       any way alter the Committee's jurisdiction or waive any       future jurisdictional claim over these provisions or their       subject matter. We also reserve the right to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees in the event of a       conference with the Senate involving this measure or similar       legislation.        I ask that you please include this letter in your       committee's report to accompany this legislation or insert       this letter in the Congressional Record during consideration       of H.R. 2794 on the House floor. I appreciate the cooperative       manner in which our committees have worked on this matter,       and I look  [[Page H2218]]       forward to working collaboratively in the future on matters       of shared jurisdiction. Thank you for your attention to this       matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Jim Jordan,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                        Washington, DC, May 3, 2023.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2794, the ``Border Reinforcement Act of 2023.'' I       appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before       the House of Representatives, and that the Committee on the       Judiciary will forego further consideration of the bill.

I look forward to working       with you on this legislation and appreciate your cooperation       on this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Mark E. Green, MD,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Guest), the vice chair of the Committee  on Homeland Security.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gimenez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DesJarlais).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the Speaker of the United  States House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. D'Esposito).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Strong).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Greene).    Mr. Speaker, as a quick correction for the  record,  [[Page H2227]]  the bill doesn't do anything to take away healthcare services provided  by NGOs, just to clarify that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Ogles), my friend from my home State.    Mr. Speaker, again, I am compelled to correct  the Record. The bill very specifically states that family units will be  kept together. There will be no separation of children. It very clearly  is stated in the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Pfluger), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time  remains on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Luttrell), the American hero.    Mr. Speaker, I hear from my colleagues across  [[Page H2230]]  the aisle the accusations that the legislation that is before us today  is somehow xenophobic. I will remind my colleagues that the number of  countries of people who are appearing at our southern border, breaking  our laws are from over 140 countries, every single race, every single  religion, almost all the nationalities of the world. This bill is about  law and order. It is not xenophobic.   I recall when I was there on the border, maybe it was three trips  ago, some folks from Russia and Ukraine. This isn't xenophobic. This is  about law and order.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take an opportunity to correct the  record on a couple of things.   We often hear from our colleagues across the aisle that 90 percent of  the fentanyl is seized at the ports of entry. Well, if you make the  statement that 90 percent of the fentanyl that is seized is seized at  the ports of entry, that is correct. But oftentimes, what we hear from  the left, is that 90 percent of fentanyl coming into the country is  seized. We know for a fact that that math is absolutely wrong.   If you put the amount seized at the ports of entry as the numerator  and the total amount seized as the denominator, yes, that is 90 percent  of what is seized. On the denominator would be 90 percent plus 10  percent, right? But what is missing in that denominator is all of the  fentanyl that gets into our country that we have no idea is seized, so  you can't technically say we are seizing 90 percent of the fentanyl  that is coming into the country. That is factually incorrect. It makes  no mathematical sense.   In fact, the Border Patrol itself is saying that we are actually  catching about 5 to 10 percent of the fentanyl. So if it is 90 percent  of what is seized at the ports of entry, which I agree that statement  is correct, it is 90 percent of 5 to 10 percent of the total. That is  an important point of distinction.   I would also like to talk a little bit about this CBP One app that my  colleague from Mississippi mentioned and all of the other efforts that  have been elaborated on by this administration, their efforts to  maintain control of our border.   When they came into office, the budget didn't increase suddenly. The  number of border patrol agents didn't decrease suddenly. There was no  new legislation that was written.   What happened was 89 effective policies of two administrations were  completely undone by executive orders, and it resulted in an immediate  incentive to come to the United States. They did away with all of the  disincentives, the pull factors, of people coming into our country.   What happened is, people came, they tested the system, and they were  immediately released into the country. Deportations were ordered to be  halted. Over a million people with deportation orders that a legal  process had determined they were supposed to be returned, we are just  not going to deport. Phone calls went home, and people poured across  our southern border.   This incentive then was seized on by the drug cartels. They saw a  huge opportunity, and so they flooded the crossing sites with people,  interestingly enough, paying coyotes to bring them there.   That is sort of at the strategic level. They neutralized the Border  Patrol at the border crossing sites, and then the fentanyl and other  things come around between the ports of entry. That is the fentanyl we  are seizing. By the way, that is the fentanyl that has resulted in the  street price of fentanyl in Tennessee going from $95 in January of 2021  to $28 just recently, according to the sheriffs of Tennessee. That  supply-demand means more fentanyl is pouring into this country.   If you talk about 90 percent of it being seized; that is a false  statement. If you talk about the policies that supposedly are  attempting to gain or are getting border control, that is incorrect.  The incentives have allowed and empowered the drug cartels to take  advantage, neutralizing the Border Patrol at the crossing sites.   Back to the tactical level, on one of my visits in Arizona, we  actually saw a scout from the cartels. And the Border Patrol agents and  the law enforcement in that area informed us that those scouts have  military-grade encrypted radios. They have military-grade optics that  they are using and from their vantage point are observing Border  Patrol. They then notify someone else with this encrypted radio. They  send 20 to 30 people to basically overwhelm that Border Patrol agent on  the border. While that individual is tied up, they send the fentanyl.  That is when the carpet-shoe-wearing, backpack fentanyl carriers result  in drop sites just inside the border where I saw hundreds of empty  backpacks and carpet shoes, where the drugs are then placed into the  hands of the courier in the back of a truck and transported to cities  all across America, resulting in that supply.   Make no mistake about it: The actions of this administration to  remove those policies have resulted in this crisis. One of the other  policies that they so effectively have taken care of--title 42, that  will end tomorrow and will result in a catastrophe of epic  proportions--is already breaking records, and we see them massing  throughout Central America to come into the United States.   You can have good intentions of wanting to help every person on the  planet. That is great. But by making that something that taxpayers have  to do, you are basically determining what someone else should be doing  with their charity.   Maybe somebody in Tennessee, our taxpayers, wants to do something for  Gold Star families. Maybe they want to give to a different charity.  Maybe they want to give to one of the NGOs that want to do something.  But they should be the ones getting to decide, not the Federal  Government telling them how their charity should be given. That is not  freedom.   I will tell you, the policies that have been canceled that have  resulted in this crisis, that have resulted in the cartels taking over  five of our sectors of our southwest border, all on Joe Biden and  Alejandro Mayorkas. Title 42 being canceled and what is about to  happen, states of emergency in cities all across the southern border,  coming across and making every State a border State, is on Joe Biden  and Alejandro Mayorkas. I think it is really important we correct the  record on some of this stuff.   I will make one other point, and I want to warn my colleagues across  the aisle. President Biden promised to veto the D.C. crime bill.  Remember that? He said: We are going to veto that bill. The Senate  said: We are not going to vote for that. You know what our Democrat  colleagues did here in the House? They all voted ``no.''    Then the furor happened in America, and the President realized, boy,  that would be a mistake. The Senate said: Oh, my gosh, we are not going  to do that either. So the Senate voted for the D.C. crime bill.   Now, the Democrat colleagues here in the House are going to have to  go back and explain why they voted ``no'' when their party on the other  side of the aisle voted ``yes,'' and their President changed his mind  and signed that bill into law.   Now, you watch the next couple of days as the border gets worse and  worse and Americans become more and more and more aware. We are going  to pass this bill. You can vote ``no'' on it, but as those Senators get  more and more aware of this crisis and the President has to look at  what is happening to El Paso and Brownsville, he just might change his  mind again. Guess who is going to be left holding the bag?   You don't want to vote ``no'' on this bill. This bill will secure our  southern border. This isn't an immigration bill. We never set out to  handle immigration with this. That is coming. This bill secures the  border so that we can deal with the immigration issues.   What we can't do is create even more incentive with an open border.  That just does what Mr. Mayorkas and Mr. Biden have done, create more  incentive that brings more people in and overwhelms our social  services, overwhelms our schools and hospitals.   As this thing unfolds over the next few days, don't be surprised if  the President changes his mind again and you are left holding the bag.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, the American people cannot wait any longer for secure  borders and safe communities. Securing the border should not be a  partisan issue. It is an American issue. It is the Federal Government's  responsibility to do so. When they fail, Congress, a coequal branch of  government, should step in and hold them accountable. That is what we  are doing here today.   The Biden administration produced the catastrophic humanitarian  tragedy we are seeing today, dismantling all semblance of law and order  and sending a clear message to the cartels that our border is open.   We have all seen what has been happening in the past few days as  title 42 comes to an end. It is a fact that the border is in shambles.   Frontline law enforcement personnel are overwhelmed and overworked as  they are stretched physically and mentally amid this crisis. State and  local resources are quickly depleting as they attempt to do the job  that this administration has not done since its first day in charge:  secure the borders and enforce the law.   The current situation at the border is unsustainable. Yet, over the  past 2-plus years, my colleagues across the aisle have refused to hold  the Biden administration accountable for its ineffective policies, have  watched the border fall into the hands of violent cartels, and have  completely ignored the disaster that has only gotten worse by the day.   That must end today. The American people are fed up with inaction.   The Biden-Mayorkas border crisis is a national security threat that  must be addressed immediately. I encourage my colleagues to join House  Republicans in passing this very important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I will close by addressing the patriots serving on the  front lines of this crisis with no support or appreciation from this  administration. Many of us have visited the border on several  occasions, across multiple sectors, and have seen firsthand the work  our Customs and Border Protection officers and agents do every single  day to risk their lives for this great country.   To the officers and agents on the ground dealing with this crisis, on  behalf of the American people, we appreciate you. We support you, and  we have your back.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow  for morning-hour debate and 11 a.m. for legislative business.
