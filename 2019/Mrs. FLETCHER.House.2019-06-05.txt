 Madam Speaker, each day, 100 Americans are killed by  guns; 100 mothers mourn the loss of a child; 100 siblings lose a  playmate; 100 friends lose a confidant; and 100 communities are left  reeling--all in 1 day.   These deaths are 25 times more likely in the United States than in  any other high-income country, and we have seen that in the news day  after day and week after week.   One hundred days ago, this House passed the Bipartisan Background  Checks Act.   One hundred deaths per 100 days--how much longer can we stand to  wait?   It is time for the Senate to act--not one more day, not 100 more  lives.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 45 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, June 6, 2019, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
