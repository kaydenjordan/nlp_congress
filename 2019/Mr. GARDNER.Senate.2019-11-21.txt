 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a great  Coloradan, Chris Dinsdale, who will be inducted into the 2020 Farm  Credit Colorado Agriculture Hall of Fame. Chris is a banker and  cattleman from Sterling, CO, who has devoted his life to benefiting his  community.   Chris is the coowner of his own business, while also serving on  multiple boards, and is the current cochairman of the Bank of Colorado.  No matter his role, he works tirelessly to help our rural communities  grow and ensure our agricultural producers are among the most  successful in the country. His passion for Colorado can be seen in  every action he takes.   I remember commenting to Chris about some of the new banks he was  building in several towns across eastern Colorado. He smiled in  response and said that he knew some of the banks would probably never  make enough money to pay for the cost of the building but that ``the  community had been so good to them'' that he wanted to repay the town  with a beautiful new business they could be proud of. This is the kind  of person Chris is, one who puts the community before himself, the kind  of person who makes Colorado special.   Chris's knowledge and expertise in Colorado agriculture has been  recognized throughout the State, as Chris has earned several coveted  awards from his community, including--Sterling's Business Person of the  Year, Elk Businessman of the Year, and Logan County Chamber of  Commerce's Citizen of the Year Award. These awards demonstrate his  ability to not only grow his own business but his ability to create a  better Colorado through his investments in new infrastructure, as well  as tuition assistance and scholarship opportunities throughout the  Eastern Plains. The impact Chris has had and will continue to have will  benefit generations of Colorado agriculture.   I am proud to call Chris a friend, and he is more than deserving of  this great honor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a great  Coloradan, Charles Hanavan, who will be inducted into the 2020 Farm  Credit Colorado Agriculture Hall of Fame. Charles has been a bedrock to  the Colorado farming community and has been committed to upholding the  legacy of family farming.   Charles was a longtime leader within the Rocky Mountain Farmers  Union, in which he served as president from 1968 to 1970. Following  that, he spent the next 11 years as vice president. During his time, he  called on all residents, smalltown businessmen, farmers, and ranchers  in rural communities to work with one another in order to prosper. In a  memorable speech, he stated: ``We must build and not destroy our rural  towns, build and not eliminate our independent farmers and ranchers; we  need and must have a coalition for survival.'' In 1991, he was granted  honorary life membership and awarded Meritorious Service to the Rocky  Mountain Farmers Union for his countless efforts to the organization  and the community.   Furthering his commitment to rural farming communities, Charles  served with the National Association of Rural Rehabilitation Committee  Board, which helped farmers establish themselves when banks would not  offer them loans. Additionally, he served on the Colorado Highway  Commission, the Colorado Farm Service Agency State Committee, as well  as the Colorado Rural Rehabilitation Corporation. Through all of his  roles, Charles has continued to seek innovative practices to improve  agricultural operations in the state.   Charles is married to Patsy, and the two are the proud parents of 12  children, 33 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild. His father settled  on a farm south of Arapahoe in 1919, and they still own and operate  that farm today.   Charles is a true example of what it means to be committed to family  and community, and he is extremely deserving of this prestigious  honor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a great  Coloradan, Don Shawcroft, who will be inducted into the 2020 Farm  Credit Colorado Agriculture Hall of Fame. Don is a fourth-generation  Coloradan from the San Luis Valley of Southern Colorado, whose  leadership has helped push the State's agricultural industry forward.   Don graduated from Brigham Young University from the agricultural  economics department. From there, he served as the State board member  for the San Luis Valley to the Colorado Farm Bureau for many years and  was vice president for 10 of those years. In 2010, he was elected  president and in 2013 was elected to serve on the American Farm Bureau  Board of Directors. Additionally, Don has served on the Southern Farm  Bureau Casualty Board, a role in which he is on the boards of all its  wholly owned subsidiaries, which most recently include the Colorado  Farm Bureau Insurance Company.   Outside of the numerous Farm Bureau roles, Don has found time to be  the director of the San Luis Valley Health and Mountain States Legal  Foundation, further contributing his commitment to the State of  Colorado and its communities.   The Shawcroft family has been ranching in the San Luis Valley since  the late 1800s, and Don is continuing the family partnership. He is the  husband to Ann, and the two have raised 6 children and have 17  grandchildren. The first time I saw the family farm, I was struck not  only by the great beauty of the homestead, but by the pride and twinkle  in the eye of a proud Colorado farmer.   The State of Colorado is fortunate to have Don's continued commitment  to his community and the Colorado Farm Bureau, and he is beyond  deserving of this honor.                            ____________________
