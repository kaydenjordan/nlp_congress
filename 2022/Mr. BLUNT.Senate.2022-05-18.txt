 Mr. President, in late 2016, soon after the Presidential  election of that year, there was a significant portion of the political  left that began referring to itself as ``the resistance.''   Apparently, these people were bent on fighting whatever the new  President might try to do, only because of who the new President was.  There were signs in yards. There were people who painted their garage  door with ``the resistance'' on the garage door.   They weren't arguing against specific policies; they weren't making a  rational effort to win support for their side; they were just trying to  throw sand in the gears of the executive branch and interfere with how  the government serves the people. One Senator on the floor of the  Senate said: ``The resistance starts here.''   Now, they did it while trying to cloak themselves in maybe the  compelling language of ``the resistance,''as if in their minds they  were starring in the World War II movie ``Casablanca,'' where the  resistance was the heroes as they were all over World War II.   The damage ``the resistance'' was willing to do to the executive  branch of our government was bad enough. On the floor of the Senate, at  virtually every nominee the President nominated, the minority insisted  on 30 hours of debate. We finally had to change that rule to 2 hours of  debate, which those in the majority now know is a big enough challenge  without 30 hours of debate. And I think the average time used was  closer to 20 minutes, during that 30 hours, than 30 hours.   But 30 hours still had to be set aside. No other business could  occur. People were nominated early on for Ambassadors to countries, for  instance, that they eventually got to serve 1 year in because that  ``resistance'' element appeared right here as well.   Then the group of political activists began to insist that we degrade  the legislative branch as well, trying to change the Senate to get rid  of the motion to proceed. And, frankly, ever since Democrats got  control of the Senate, by the smallest margin possible, there has been  a constant discussion of why we should change that rule.   Of course, many of us understand the so-called filibuster rule is  what makes the Senate. President Biden said, when he was a Senator:         [A]t its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a       nominee or a bill, it is about compromise and moderation.    End the quote that he made at the time that I agree with now.   Many of the people who have been calling to end the filibuster  changed their tune, not because something changed in America but  because they are now in charge. And without the filibuster, we would  see wild swings in policy when different parties would take control of  the majority of the Senate, and we see that constantly in the House  now. A lot of bills pass, and very few of them get to the President's  desk. When the other party gets in control, they pass bills that  reverse what the earlier majority passes, and, frankly, very few of  them get to the President's desk either because the Senate has to take  a little more time to think about what direction the country really  wants to go in.   In the last 20 years or so, complete control has happened four times,  alternating between Democrats and Republicans. That is a lot of time  for the pendulum to swing and the potential for bad ideas to become law  without something to make us think about that before we head in that  direction.   At a time of razor-thin margins in the House and Senate, activists  should be extra careful about getting rid of institutional guardrails.  Their efforts have failed so far because there aren't enough Senators  from both parties who are willing to make that change, but that doesn't  mean they won't keep trying.   In fact, I am confident we will continue to hear that, and I am also  confident their position will change as soon as they are in the  minority and don't get what they want.   This brings us to the disappointing effort we have seen to damage the  third branch of government: the judiciary. For more than a year, we  have seen some people on the left try to apply political pressure on  the Court to rule in a particular way.   The Senator from Utah just gave us an example of that. I am going to  repeat it. It is probably worth repeating. In March of 2020, the  Democratic leader of the Senate spoke to a crowd in front of the  Supreme Court Building, and he said:         I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh,       you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.    Now, what would that possibly mean? If you are in the Supreme Court  you have got a lifetime job, so the price clearly was not losing your  job. What price was the Democratic leader suggesting and saying on the  steps of the Supreme Court you would have to pay? And this is while the  Court was inside hearing arguments on the case.   And the Leader added:         You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these       awful decisions.    That kind of language has no place and really no legitimate purpose.  [[Page S2564]]    This is not the kind of language that we need to use.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have talked about  introduced legislation to add new Justices to the Court to pack the  Court.   Judges should rule based on the law, not on their partisan  allegiance. That is not a new idea, but countries rarely manage to put  it into practice.   The American judicial system became the envy of the world precisely  because of its independence. Renowned historian of the American  Revolution Gordon Wood has described it as the creation of judges who  are ``agents of the sovereign people somehow equal in authority with  the legislators and executives.''   An independent judiciary is a critical element of the unique balance  of power the Constitution created. Justices have frequently ruled  against Presidents and parties that put them on the Court. Some of the  most prominent, politically sensitive Supreme Court cases in history  have involved Justices ruling against the parties that put them in  power, including United States v. Nixon in 1974. And Harry Truman, who  put his name on the desk that I am speaking from, would certainly have  preferred not to lose the so-called steel seizure case of Youngstown  Sheet and Tube v. Sawyer, but he accepted it without threatening any of  the Justices, without plotting to increase the size of the Court, even  though the vote against it by, for instance, Fred Vinson, the Chief  Justice who had been his Secretary of the Treasury and lifelong--in  terms of Senate service--friend and his nominee to be the Chief  Justice, voted the other way.   The supporters of these changes are calling very loudly, but, just  like the damage that they sought with their resistance of the executive  branch, their efforts to break the Senate, they could do lasting, even  permanent damage to the judiciary. Once the Court has been clearly  politicized, it would be hard to ever bring it back.   I am concerned about the anti-institutional fervor we see going on  today. I hope it does not produce the stated results and goals.   I yield the floor.
