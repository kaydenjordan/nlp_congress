 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the       Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of       H.R. 680 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.         I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered       read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered       made and laid upon the table.         Madam President, this measure provides relief through       H.R. 680 for Arpita Kurdekar and her parents, Girish and Vandana.        Arpita came here from India in 2014 to pursue higher education. Like       so many students before her, she was drawn to the strength of our       universities. She started her master's degree at the University of       Buffalo.        Heartbreakingly and tragically, in September of 2016, in a freak       accident, she was struck by a falling tree and suffered a severe spinal       injury that caused her to be paralyzed from the neck down. Her parents       came to this country from India to be at her side, to be her aid.        Remarkably, she has not only survived, but she has thrived. In fact,       she has found the strength and will and character to overcome that       paralysis. She is now a resident of Connecticut and she pursues a Ph.D.       in structural engineering at the University of Connecticut, while also       working as a graduate research fellow and research assistant. Her       research is on the cutting edge, exploring how technologies, including       virtual reality, can enhance learning opportunities in engineering and       the arts.        It is a miraculous story.        Here, she has access to physical therapy and to other resources that       she needs, and services. Of course, her parents are essential to her       performance and, indeed, her thriving as she has done. If she is forced       to return to India, she would have drastically reduced opportunities       for her and also for this country, which is benefiting enormously from       her work. She would have needed access to physical care and therapy       that were unavailable there. She would have effectively been homebound       due to the lack of accessibility for the disabled.        In all kinds of ways, her life will now be productive and rewarding       to her and to this country. That is why, in recognition of those very       difficult circumstances, the Kurdekar family has been accorded the       permanent status to stay here as a result of our passing this bill       without objection--in effect, unanimously--here. I thank my colleagues       for that action.                                           Afghan Adjustment Act              Madam President, I also want to talk briefly about the Afghan       Adjustment Act because I have just come from the Senate Swamp, the lawn       outside the Capitol, where a group representing the veterans and Afghan       allies and others who traveled across country who have been literally       on the steps of our Capitol to tell us, in effect, that we have an       obligation to the at-risk Afghan allies. Literally thousands of them       have come here and have only a limited amount of time under their       current status, the humanitarian parole, and then could be deported       back to Afghanistan and to a place where they would have targets on       their back, where they would face persecution, torture, death.        We need to give them permanent status here. We need to provide these       men and women, who have risked their lives for our country and put       their futures on the line for us, the safety and security of staying in       this country. We cannot turn our backs on the Afghan allies who managed       to escape in those frightful days last summer, nor can we turn our       backs to the at-risk Afghan allies who remain there.        I have advocated their cause. I championed their plight for the       months since we withdrew from Afghanistan. I will pledge to them, to       our veterans who have so bravely advocated this cause, and to the       Afghan allies who come to this country that we will continue this       fight.        Some of these individuals are former Afghan special forces. Some are       female members of the Afghan defense forces who accompanied our troops       and provided vital intelligence that saved countless American lives.        Overall, these Afghan allies, now at risk, worked with our troops and       diplomats and helped to save their lives and guide them.        I know from my son's own experience as a U.S. Marine Corps officer       that our men and women in combat were, in fact, saved and made secure       because of their interpreters, their guides, their translators, all who       worked with our troops and diplomats.        We must honor or commitment to them. They put their lives on the line       for us. A failure would be a stain on our national honor. Great nations       keep their promises, and that is what the Afghan Adjustment Act would       enable us to do. We need to pass it next session if we cannot do it       this session.        I regret that right now it is not part of the omnibus budget bill,       but our bipartisan group--and it is truly bipartisan and we have the       votes to pass it even with a 60-vote threshold--will continue fighting,       working for this cause.        I yield the floor.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the       Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following       nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 1171, 1189, 1190, 1191, 1192, 1193,       and 1200; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without       intervening action or debate; the motions to reconsider be considered       made and laid upon the table; and that            [[Page S9739]]            the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the       Senate resume legislative session.         I suggest the absence of a quorum.
