 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Virginia for his  leadership on this very important piece of legislation, important not  only for the Commonwealth of Virginia but for the rights of all  Americans, beginning with the original Americans.   When we talk about the Americas, we sometimes talk as if the Americas  began in the early 17th century, with Jamestown, with Plymouth, and  with the subsequent colonization of the East Coast. But, in fact, there  were millions of Native Americans here long before European  colonization. They had rich culture. They had incredible artistic  expression. They had a way of life. It was disrupted by European  colonization.   As if some genocidal policies of the 18th and 19th century weren't  bad enough in terms of their terrible impact on this population, the  racism my friend from Florida described that went on shamefully in the  Commonwealth of Virginia in the early 20th century deeply compounded  the problem by denying the identity of individuals and communities as  Native American so that the battle for them to have their rights  restored that my good friend, Mr. Wittman, is trying to right today was  made so much more difficult and complex.                                time  1445    If I destroy your identity papers, I destroy your ability to prove  who you are. That is the dilemma and that is the catch-22 in which we  find ourselves today.   This is a matter of simple justice. This is a matter of Congress  righting a wrong. It is a proud moment to stand shoulder to shoulder,  Republican and Democrat from Virginia, to want to right this wrong. And  I know we are joined by all of our colleagues and former colleagues,  including our friend Jim Moran for his great leadership in this matter.   So I am proud to support the efforts of my colleague. I urge all  Members of the House to support this legislation, and let's turn a page  in history the right way.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my friends, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) and the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly), for their leadership in bringing  this bill to the floor.   Of course, I rise in support of the bill, H.R. 2227, the Modernizing  Government Technology Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, over the past several years, we have all witnessed the  chaos and havoc that sophisticated cyber attacks can, and do, wreak on  our Nation and around the world.   Just this past week, there was a massive ransomware attack that hit  200,000 victims in 150 countries, and those numbers are expected to  grow exponentially. This is just the latest in a string of high-profile  attacks, including Sony, Yahoo, the OPM data breach, and even efforts  to influence our elections and those in Europe.   These attacks jeopardize America's safety, privacy, and cost untold  millions of dollars in the private sector and public sector as well.  These attacks affect both the public and private sector, and bad actors  repeatedly target our Federal Government. Those attacks often succeed  because Federal computer systems are so outdated that they cannot  implement network defenses as basic as encryption. Some legacy systems  go back a half a century.   The Federal Government spends nearly $60 billion a year sustaining  its existing IT systems. When agencies are forced to spend nearly 80  percent of that to maintain legacy computer systems, they have fewer  resources to modernize and reinvest. As a result, agencies cannot  afford to invest in the modern technologies that other large  enterprises need to survive. Many Federal agencies do not use cloud  computing to help secure computer networks and improve our ability to  deliver services to the American people.  [[Page H4264]]    The MGT Act we are talking about today and on which I am proud to be  one of the lead Democratic cosponsors is a critical step to help  improve the Federal Government's IT systems. The MGT Act of 2017 will  help our cyber defenders protect our most important digital resources.   This bill marries two bills from the previous Congress, both of which  I was proud to be an original cosponsor of--the IT Modernization Act  and the MOVE IT Act. The MGT Act establishes a clear role for both of  these pieces of legislation to improve Federal IT systems.   I was an original cosponsor for Minority Whip Steny Hoyer's IT  Modernization Act, which created a revolving fund using $3 billion  appropriations for Treasury to replace legacy systems.   I was pleased to join my friend, Ms. Kelly, the ranking member of the  Information Technology Subcommittee, and Mr. Hurd, on the MOVE IT Act,  which revived a proposal first discussed during the consideration of  the legislation FITARA, the Federal Information Technology Acquisition  Reform Act.   These two bills were different, but complementary, and worked,  ultimately, to join the two to create this act in front of us today,  the MGT Act. That act lays the foundation for the future of IT  modernization funding and reinvestment and investment by the Federal  Government long overdue. The act will authorize an upfront investment  to retire minimal large-scale legacy systems and affect multiple  agencies.   This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will provide mechanisms and  much-needed funding for agencies to speed up that slow process of  moving from legacy IT systems to cutting-edge, 21st century  technologies. It would also provide needed reporting requirements to  ensure that agencies are acquiring modern technology and that we can  measure that it is being done in a cost-effective way. It places an  emphasis on following the practices of private industry and moving  toward cloud computing solutions.   The MGT Act language will allow agencies to reinvest those savings,  as my friend just indicated, and that is a commonsense proposal, but  not one we find commonly in the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the act, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my friend, the distinguished whip on the  Democratic side.    May I inquire of the Speaker how much time is left on  this side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rogers of Kentucky). The gentleman from  Virginia has 11\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 5\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 5\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, I think this is an important piece in the information  technology modernization effort that our committee and this body has  undertaken for the last 5 or 6 years. One of the key pieces of  legislation undergirding today's bill is the Federal Information  Technology Acquisition Reform Act I was proud to cowrite and coauthor  with then-Chairman Darrell Issa.   I am equally proud today to have worked with my friend Mr. Hurd from  Texas, my friend Ms. Kelly from Illinois, and, of course, Mr. Steny  Hoyer, the Democratic whip, in forging this additional piece that we  believe will bring the Federal Government into the 21st century-- technologically literate and protecting the databases that protect the  American people.    Hundreds of millions of pieces of data are at risk in the current  cyber environment, and some simple but critical investments can make  all the difference. That is what we are voting for today.   I urge passage of the legislation and, again, congratulate my  colleagues and friends for working together in a bipartisan way to  bring this bill to fruition.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Federal Agency Mail Management  Act, which I introduced along with, of course, the author of the bill,  Representative Steve Russell. I want to thank Representative Russell  for working in a bipartisan manner on this legislation.   The bill would make a technical correction to clarify that the  Administrator of the General Services Administration is responsible for  managing mail in the executive branch. The Administrator of GSA has  historically had this responsibility, but when the Federal Records Act  was updated in 2014, changes made to the statute left it unclear  whether the Administrator's role had changed.   You would think it is a simple commonsense measure, but it requires  an act of Congress to clarify. Congress never intended to take away the  Administrator's authority to manage mail. The bill was approved by the  House without opposition last year. We are hoping the same will pertain  this year.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates this bill would cost the  Federal Government nothing, because GSA already processes mail for  Federal agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill and give clarity  to the GSA and the National Archives, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 195, the Federal Register  Printing Savings Act. My friend, Mr. Russell, is going to develop a  reputation around here for being just too commonsense. This bill would  prohibit the Government Publishing Office from sending printed copies  of the Federal Register to Members of Congress and other Federal  offices unless they wanted them.   The Federal Register includes rules, regulations, executive orders,  and other Federal documents. It is a very important and useful  publication. It does not make sense, however, as my friend from  Oklahoma has pointed out, for GPO automatically to send it to offices  that don't want it and end up putting it in the garbage, hopefully  recycling.   The Federal Register is available online, as my friend has pointed  out, which significantly cuts down on the need for printed copies for  most of us. This bill would reduce waste both in paper and in Federal  dollars.   The Congressional Budget Office says this bill would reduce Federal  spending by $1 million a year. It was the late Everett Dirksen of  Illinois who said: ``A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon it  adds up to real money.'' CBO also estimates this bill would result in  1,000 fewer copies of the Federal Register being printed each day.   This bill is good for the environment, good for taxpayers, and a  useful discipline for us all in terms of excess we don't need.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Russell for his leadership, his common  sense, and his collaboration on this committee, and I urge all Members  to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 653, the Federal Intern  Protection Act. In fact, it is hard to believe we need this legislation  at this point in the 21st century, but we do.   Under current law, Federal employees are protected from  discrimination on the basis of race, religion, age, and sex.  Unfortunately, interns don't qualify. They have no such protections.   I appreciate the wonderful work of our distinguished ranking member,  Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, on this important measure.  I am not surprised, and neither are my colleagues, that he would pick  up on this and see the need for this protection to be extended to young  men and women who want maybe to pursue a career or part of their career  in the Federal Government. They need these protections like the  employees they are working with side by side.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Cummings).  [[Page H4269]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to laud my friend from Maryland (Mr.  Cummings) for his perspicacity in ferreting out this issue. It is a  very important one.   The use of internships in the Federal Government is a very  underutilized tool when compared to the private sector. Many private  sector companies will use internships for recruiting the talent it  needs for the future. In many cases, 70 to 80 percent of those who  intern for private sector corporations end up being hired because they  have a carefully monitored program from orientation and recruitment to  the tasks at hand during the pendency of the internship. The Federal  Government does no such thing systematically.   At the very beginning, if we are going to use internships as  creatively as the private sector to recruit the next generation of  Federal employees, since one-third of the current workforce is eligible  for retirement over the next several years, we have to follow the lead  my friends, Mr. Cummings of Maryland and Mr. Russell of Oklahoma, have  just given us, and that is to make sure it is a safe workplace.  Otherwise, who would be attracted to it?    This piece of legislation is critical to our making Federal  internships a meaningful tool in their recruitment and retention, so  long as that workforce is protected by the same norms and same  regulations as any Federal employee.   I thank my friend, Mr. Cummings, for bringing this to our attention,  and I thank Mr. Russell for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly add my voice to that of my  colleagues in support of this important legislation. Syria is a mess.  It does affect all of us, as Mr. Kinzinger said, whether we like it or  not. It is destabilizing the entire region. I believe this bill can be  a useful tool in our diplomatic efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Frankel), my friend and colleague.
