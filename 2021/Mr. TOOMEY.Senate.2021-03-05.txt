 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1010, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my amendment would simply strike the  section that provides ``such sums as may be necessary to make payments  of 120 percent of outstanding debts to socially disadvantaged farmers  and ranchers.''   There are only two requirements to get this money. One is to have a  USDA  [[Page S1241]]  farm loan, and there are billions of dollars' worth out there, and the  other is, you must be a member of a favored racial or ethnic group,  including African American, Hispanic, Asian Americans, and some others.  There is no income test. There is no asset test. It doesn't matter  whether you are rich or poor. You don't have to have experienced any  harm of any kind whatsoever, including from COVID. You just have to be  the right race.   The senior Senator from Michigan called this provision ``an important  piece of reparations.'' This bill is supposed to be about COVID relief  and helping the people who are adversely affected by the economics of  the lockdown. Instead, we are handing out money based exclusively on  race. This is unconstitutional. It is outrageous. My amendment strikes  the provision, and I urge its adoption.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
