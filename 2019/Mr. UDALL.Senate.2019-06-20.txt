 Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition, and let me  thank the two Senators that preceded me here. Senator Merkley spoke on  this issue of whether we should be going to another war in the Middle  East, and Senator Kaine, whom I have watched since he has been in the  Senate, has been relentless and very consistent about raising the  issues of authorizations of force and relying on authorizations of  force from 2001 and 2002--what we consider very outdated in terms of  looking at the facts on the ground. I know he has been working hard-- Senator Kaine has--in the Armed Services Committee. Both of us have  been working in the Foreign Relations Committee to try to address this  constitutional issue that is really before us.   I came to the floor of the Senate 4 weeks ago warning that this  administration's reckless escalation of tensions with Iran was blindly  leading us to the brink of war. I urged this body to assert its  constitutional authority and pass my bipartisan legislation, the  Prevention of Unconstitutional War with Iran Act. I called on all of  us, Republicans and Democrats, to make it clear that the President  alone cannot wage war against Iran without authorization from Congress.   Well, here we are, 1 month later, and tensions with Iran have only  increased. The threat of conflict has only drawn closer. Today, we woke  up to the news that Iranian forces shot down a U.S. drone. That comes  on the heels of 1,000 American troops being sent to the Middle East.  Yet the Senate does nothing--nothing to assert Congress's  constitutional authority and nothing to assume the responsibility that  the Founders clearly placed on our shoulders, the people's  representatives.   The Republican leadership should not duck all debate on the military  conflict with Iran. We need to vote. We owe it to our men and women in  uniform, whose lives would be put on the line, to have this debate, to  make the hard choices, and to take the tough votes.   Today, we are calling for a vote on an amendment to the 2020 National  Defense Authorization Act. The amendment prohibits funding for military  operations against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress. I  am joined in this amendment by Senators Kaine, Durbin, Paul, Merkley,  and Murphy. My related bill has 25 cosponsors and still counting.   Article I, section 8, of the Constitution couldn't be clearer. It is  Congress and Congress alone that has the authority to declare war. This  amendment recognizing Congress's clear-cut authority should have broad  bipartisan support. Whether you support armed conflict with Iran or  believe that the war would be a disaster, you should have the courage  to cast a vote when the Constitution says it is your job.   Let's be clear. This bill does not tie our Armed Forces' hands. Our  military is highly capable, and we have an inherent right of self- defense, which this amendment clearly underscores. But we need to step  up. The situation is more urgent day by day.   The President and Secretary of State have accused Iran of being  responsible  [[Page S4160]]  for the attack on two oil tankers last week. Iran has denied that  involvement. There is a somewhat conflicting report from the Japanese  tanker owner. I do not know whether Iran, its surrogates, or another  party is responsible for this heinous action, but this administration's  itch to go to war is all too reminiscent of how we got embroiled in  Iraq in 2003 and how the disastrous tanker war of the 1980s began.   We must not make the same terrible mistakes again. We do need to find  out precisely what happened and who is responsible, but the response  need not be another endless war in the Middle East. We need a thorough  and objective investigation of this incident, as has been called for by  a number of nations, and the Senators need a real intelligence briefing  that covers sources and evidence and not just a statement of opinions  from administration officials.   If the Trump administration is entering our forces into hostilities,  then this Congress should demand that a report be submitted to Congress  in accordance with the War Powers Act. Those who wrote that act made it  clear: ``Hostilities also encompasses a state of confrontation in which  no shots have been fired, but denotes a situation in which there is a  clear potential either for such a state of confrontation or for actual  armed conflict.'' We may have already crossed this threshold. Some have  said we have.   The Reagan administration failed to submit such a report to Congress  during the tanker wars, and the Congress failed to hold that  administration accountable, despite the overwhelming evidence of  hostilities.   Now, the current administration has hinted that it does not need to  go to Congress for approval for hostilities against Iran. They seem to  believe that the 9/11 AUMF gives them legal authority for war. Many of  us in Congress today voted for that AUMF, including myself, and let me  be clear--no one who voted for it thought it would be used to justify a  war against Iran 18 years later. Congress needs to make that clear  before it is too late.   Yes, the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf, and the Gulf of Oman  should be safe from navigation. Vital interests are at stake. But I  agree with the statement issued by the U.S. Central Command in the  aftermath of this recent attack:         We have no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the       Middle East. We will defend our interests, but a war with       Iran is not in our strategic interest, nor in the best       interest of the international community.    A war with Iran is not in our strategic interest, and a majority of  Americans agree. The American people are tired of forever wars in the  Middle East that take our resources, produce no strategic gains, and,  most tragically, endanger the lives of American men and women.   In any war with Iran, we will have few allies to back us. The  international community is not behind the National Security Advisor and  Secretary of State's bellicose rhetoric. We would have to go it nearly  alone.   The administration's maximum pressure strategy is supposedly intended  to bring Iran to the negotiating table, but this strategy has  predictably failed to produce any negotiations or make any diplomatic  inroads. Instead, it is emboldening the hardliners in Tehran who also  want confrontation.   The administration's pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement was a  colossal strategic blunder. It was supposedly intended to get the U.S.  a better deal, but violating our obligations has only produced saber- rattling, brinksmanship, and the very real risk that a miscalculation  or mistake will result in an all-out war.   The United States and the world were safer with the Iran nuclear  agreement. It included strict verification requirements. The  International Atomic Energy Agency and the President's own intelligence  and defense teams agreed that Iran was complying.   The unilateral withdrawal only undermined relations with our allies,  signaled that the United States will not keep its word, and  destabilized the Middle East even more. This was a predictable result  and many warned the Trump administration about this outcome.   Iran threatens to exceed the agreement's limits on nuclear fuel  within days. While I hope Iran holds to its end of the bargain, the  United States pulling out of the agreement and reimposing sanctions has  opened the door for Iran to walk away as well.   Now we must do all we can over the next 17 months to make sure this  President does not precipitously start a war with Iran, a country of 80  million people, about four times the size of Iraq, and with proxy  forces throughout the region. A war would cost trillions of dollars and  undoubtedly American lives. With each passing day and with each  incident, the risk of a catastrophic war grows closer.   I realize some of my colleagues have a different view of the  situation. Some talk about how all options must be on the table or say  that the Iranian regime must be overthrown. I hope they reconsider and  change their minds.   If they don't, they should at least have the courage of their  convictions. If you want to empower this President to fight a war with  Iran, let's vote on that question. The American people and our men and  women in uniform deserve to know that their representatives will  debate, discuss, and vote on these most difficult of decisions. That is  why all of us in this body must demand that this amendment be heard,  debated, and voted on. Senate gridlock cannot be an excuse.   The Constitution puts this decision squarely in our court. It is long  past time for Congress to reassert its war powers authority. Our oath  demands that we make any decision to go to war. The real possibility  that this administration will precipitate conflict in Iran requires us  to face this question now. The fact that American lives will be on the  line places the moral imperative on us to debate this issue and to make  clear to the President and his administration that any decision to go  to war with Iran must be made by Congress.   I yield the floor.
