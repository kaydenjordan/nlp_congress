 Madam Speaker, I was a corpsman, that is a combat  medic, in the Navy SEAL teams for over 20 years, and I would like to  give you a different perspective.   If I were to encounter an enemy combatant on the battlefield who was  wounded, which I have, I was obligated by international law to render  medical care to that enemy combatant to the best of my ability, up to  and including to the detriment of my own troops, or I would be subject  to prosecution.    I find it absurd, I find it unconscionable that this would be a  matter of discussion in this body that we would not render medical aid  to the most innocent amongst us, an unborn child that is born alive  after the most traumatic circumstances possible.   Madam Speaker, I would implore my Democratic colleagues to remember  that this is not about a woman's access to abortion. This is about the  sanctity of life and the basic dignity of a human child.
