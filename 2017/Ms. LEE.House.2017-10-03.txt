 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 36, which is a  nationwide 20-week abortion ban. I would like to share a story about  Lindsey, a woman from California.   Lindsey ended her pregnancy at 24 weeks, after a devastating  diagnosis. When Lindsey had her 12-week ultrasound, everything looked  completely normal. But the picture was different at the 21-month  anatomy scan. Lindsey and her husband learned that their baby girl had  lethal skeletal dysplasia. Lindsey sought out additional opinions from  three maternal-fetal specialists. They all agreed that her lungs were  not developing properly and she would not survive. Lindsey and her  husband chose to end the pregnancy at 24 weeks.   Lindsey wants lawmakers to know: ``If I had to carry her to term, she  would not have survived. As her mother, it is my right to spare her  suffering, and that is what I did.''   The cruel ban on the floor today would only make these heart- wrenching situations worse for families like Lindsey's. On behalf of  Lindsey, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 36. Republicans  should stop playing politics with women's lives and focus on the real  problems facing this government and this country, and stop interfering  in the private lives of women. We must stop this ban.
