 Madam Speaker, my colleagues across the aisle have asked  why we are voting today to protect our democracy.   The answer is as clear to me as it is unimaginable to them: for the  people. This one is for the people who made today possible, for the  young people who cast their first votes in 2020 and for the seniors who  cast their first votes in 1966 after the passage of the original Voting  Rights Act.   It is for the people who, like John Lewis, put their lives on the  line on Bloody Sunday and for the people who risked their lives to  overcome racist voter suppression at the height of this pandemic.   It is for people like my mentor and professor, the late Lani Guinier,  mother of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act.   It is for the people who don't have a vote but who do have a voice.   Voting rights are preservative of all other rights. But time is  running out. We can still have a democracy, Madam Speaker, but only if  we pass this legislation.
