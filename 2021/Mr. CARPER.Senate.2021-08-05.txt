 Before the Democratic whip leaves the floor, I just want  to thank him for raising the three words ``Ohio State University.'' As  a proud Buckeye for----    No, I never say ``The Ohio State.'' We want to be humble.  But I used to be a Navy ROTC midshipman there for a number of years and  have great memories of being a part of the student body there and part  of the Navy ROTC unit.   Later, I had the opportunity, as my colleague knows, to join forces  in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982--one of the largest  freshman classes ever. It seems like yesterday. He went on to come and  serve in the Senate, and I went on to serve as Governor.   One of the things I never thought about as Governor is the job of the  Governor to nominate people to serve on the courts. I never thought  about that.   As it turns out, in Delaware, given the positions we have in  corporate law and other parts of our economy and business, judicial  appointments are over-sized. They are really extremely important.   And while I hadn't given it a lot of thought, I remember I had, I  think, 45 joint appearances with my Republican opponent when I ran for  Governor--45 in the year 1992, and not once did anybody ever ask of  either of us: What would you look for in nominating judges?   It turned out to be hugely important. I studied economics and got an  MBA, but I don't pretend to be an expert on legal matters. One of the  things that I learned--and I felt it was important--was to have a  judiciary that was diverse and that looked like Delaware. I think the  same is true here for our country for district court judges, appeals  courts, and the Supreme Court.   I wanted to nominate people who were bright and who were smart, and  intellectually curious. I wanted to nominate people who were hard  working, who brought a diversity of experiences to the bench. And  mostly, I wanted to nominate people who were able to make good  decisions--even tough decisions--and were fair and treated everybody in  their court before them with fairness.   The reputation of the nominee whom you referred to, I think she  checks all those boxes, and I want to thank you for raising her before  us here today. Thank you.   We have our colleague from Louisiana here with us today. He has  worked hard, along with 21 of our colleagues, to try to fashion a  bipartisan consensus to build on the work of, among others, the  Environment and Public Works Committee on infrastructure.   We worked hard in our committee--Shelley Capito, the lead Republican,  and myself, and 18 others--to report and later to vote on legislation  on water infrastructure here, drinking water and wastewater sanitation  legislation. We voted on it a couple months ago after reporting it  unanimously out of committee. And 89 to 2, the same bill came up here-- 89 to 2. And we have used that as one of the building blocks on which  the bipartisan infrastructure package is fashioned.   We also have in the Environment and Public Works Committee the great  support and leadership of our ranking member, Senator Capito, and the  participation of every single U.S. Senator who gathered input to help  us fashion legislation in the Committee on water, drinking water,  wastewater, and roads, highways, bridges, and climate, in order to be  able to put together a foundation, if you will, under which the Gang  of--we affectionately call it the Gang of 22--have built this  infrastructure piece along with the help of the administration and a  lot of other folks who participated.   I go back and forth on the train. I literally went home last night to  Delaware and was back here this morning. I am a bit weary, but I was  encouraged. So many times over the years, people say to me, as I am  waiting to catch a train in Wilmington or waiting to catch a train back  home at the end of the day--people say to me: Why can't you guys just  work together? Why can't you just work to get stuff done for this  country?   I think they would be encouraged by what they would have seen and the  work of not just the Environment and Public Works Committee but the  work of the Commerce Committee, the work of the Banking Committee, and  the work of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--rather  extraordinary, every one of them. Democrats, Republicans, a couple of  Independents are all working together to fashion legislation that is  going to help strengthen our economy and make our economy work better  and help provide employment opportunities to literally millions of  people at a time when we need that.   And, yesterday, I think we had the votes. Correct me if I am wrong.  But more than a dozen votes we have had this week, and more than a  score of votes on amendments to this package--this infrastructure  package. One of the things I love about it is that a bunch of those  amendments were bipartisan. It wasn't just Democratic amendments or  Republican amendments. They were amendments we offered together.   And interestingly enough, we had any number of instances yesterday,  including late last night, when we didn't have long, dragged out  debate. We actually voice-voted a number of provisions that were being  offered to us. The amendments were being offered. I am encouraged by  that.   And I note that, tomorrow morning, a lot of us--I am not sure how  many, but maybe a third of the U.S. Senate, will join together and get  on a plane--I think an Air Force plane--and we will head for Gillette,  WY, to say good-bye--say good-bye to a dear friend, and that is Mike  Enzi.   I spoke about him on the floor in the last week. So I will be brief  right here. Mike Enzi would love what we are doing. He would have loved  to have been a part of this. He was the guy who first taught me about  the 80-20 rule. The 80-20 rule--when I asked him how Mike Enzi, one of  the most conservative Republicans we had here in the Senate, and Ted  Kennedy, one of the most liberal Senators we had here in the United  States, how could they work together on the Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions Committee and get so much done--and get so much done?   I will never forget what he said. He gave a speech on the floor here  when I was presiding as a brandnew freshman Senator, years ago--20  years ago. He spoke of the 80-20 rule, and I asked him when he finished  speaking: What is the 80-20 rule?   And he said: It is the secret to Ted Kennedy and I being successful  in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--being so  successful in taking on legislation and coming up with principled,  bipartisan solutions.   And he said: Ted and I agree on 80 percent of the issues that come  before our committee. We disagree on maybe 20 percent. And what we do  on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee is we focus on  the 80 percent where we agree, and we set aside the 20 percent where we  don't agree to another day. We come back to it, and we deal with that  later on.    And it worked for them.   He would be delighted. My guess is he is tuned in today, somewhere up  there. But he would be delighted to see that this week the 80-20 rule  that Mike Enzi epitomized is alive and well on both sides of the aisle.  I hope that the spirit that has infused our work, leading up to the  work of our committees--the committees of jurisdiction--providing the  foundation on which the gang of 20 and the administration went to  work--my hope is that that spirit of bipartisanship and Mike Enzi's 80- 20 rule will continue to infuse our work here this week into the latter  part of this evening, and, hopefully, not too late into the evening.  Maybe we can wrap things up here in short order.   With that, I am going to yield the floor, and I just want to say to  everyone who is working hard to make this  [[Page S5897]]  a productive week, a productive mission: I just want to say a real  thank you, not just to the members of the relevant committees I  mentioned but to everybody, all the folks who serve here, and  especially our staff.   I like to say that people ask me sometimes--and I say this to my  friend Senator Cassidy from Louisiana, who is a truly brilliant person  and a great colleague to work with. I would like to say that about  Senator Thune, with whom I will be joining in a Bible study later again  today as we join with the Chaplain every day. There are a lot smarter  people in the U.S. Senate than me, but I am smart enough to hire really  smart people. They work hard and I work hard, and most days we get a  lot done.   For all the staff here in this body and in this building and the  committee staff out across the Capitol and around the world, we  especially thank you for your efforts.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just want to say, earlier this week--I  am almost at a loss for words. I know I normally am not standing where  I normally stand.   Earlier this week, you gave your freshman year first speech--your  first speech--and not everybody was able to hear it. A lot of people  came up. Democrats and Republicans were here. I just want to say again  how much I enjoyed it.   From an old Navy guy to a not-so-old Navy guy, we are very proud of  your service in uniform and also proud of your service here. I am  delighted that you are a member of our Environment and Public Works  Committee. We have done some really good work on this issue. I thank  you for your help and contribution.                              Disparity Studies     Mr. President, I have a couple of unanimous consent  requests. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list  of studies presenting a strong basis of evidence for the conclusion  that discrimination against minority- and women-owned businesses  continues to affect the construction, architecture, and engineering and  related surface transportation contracting markets nationwide.   These disparity studies contain rigorous statistical analyses to  determine whether business discrimination based on--whether it is based  upon race or gender, continues to exist, and a review of these studies  reveals that the answer, sadly, is a resounding yes, and, therefore,  the current Disadvantaged Business Enterprise provisions are still  warranted.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  those disparity studies   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              State and Local Disparity Studies From 2015-2021                                    Alaska         Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities       Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Study, Final Report & Final       Appendices, Prepared by the Alaska Department of       Transportation & Public Facilities Civil Rights Office       (2020).

Electric School Buses     Mr. President, I have a second unanimous consent request  I want to mention, and that is a request to have printed in the Record  letters of support for electric school buses.   I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two  letters--one from three American school bus manufacturers, and another  from 125 nonprofit foundations, businesses, health and scientific  organizations, and advocacy groups--in support of investments in  electric school buses in this bipartisan package.   Both letters highlight the fact that no other school bus technology  manufactured today reduces more emissions than electric vehicle school  buses; and both letters highlight that investments in electric school  buses would drive the demand for new electric buses and promote cost  parity between electric school buses and older technologies.   The message from these diverse groups to Congress is clear: Investing  in electric school buses supports American workers and American  manufacturers. Not only that, it cleans up our air, protects our kids  and our planet on which we live  [[Page S5900]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      July 27, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:       We are writing to urge funding for a transition to electric       school buses as part of the bipartisan infrastructure package       being developed on Capitol Hill.        Over the past 15 years much has been accomplished in       reducing emissions from older school buses using the Diesel       Emission Reduction Act of 2005. Newer buses are available       with propane, CNG and electric powertrains which reduce       emissions by as much as 100 percent compared with school       buses manufactured prior to the enactment of DERA.        The focus of these programs has been in reducing emissions       of priority pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOX)       and particulate matter (PM) but today there is serious       concern about carbon emissions. These have not been the focus       of earlier programs. We believe the technology that provides       the best opportunity to achieve both clean air and carbon       reduction is electric vehicle technology. School buses are an       ideal platform for electric drive because they have a duty       cycle that is highly compatible with electrification, they       start and end the day at the same location (simplifies       charging infrastructure needs), and enjoy a design that       allows for installation of large battery packs. They do not       have range issues as they drive daily the same well-      established routes that are well within the battery capacity       available on the bus. Electric school buses have been in       daily use since 2015, accumulating millions of miles. They       are reliably and dependably deployed in school districts       across the country and we as manufacturers and end users of       them can affirm that we are ready to meet the increased       demand. This technology is here and ready to go.        Electric school buses are being rapidly introduced but       remain more expensive than even some of the other clean       vehicle options. Manufacturers believe that a major Federal       investment will assist in driving down the cost through       economies of scale that result from high volume manufacture.       Such an investment would make electric school buses cost       competitive with other platforms in allowing greater adoption       of a technology that achieves zero emissions of harmful       pollutants and greenhouse gases.        In addition to the health and climate benefits for school       children and their communities, it would also create many       well-paying domestic jobs in engineering, manufacturing, and       sales.        Accordingly, we believe that Congress should include       substantial Federal funding for clean school buses and that       not less than half of that funding should go exclusively to       electric buses. We understand that some communities want to       use older technologies. If Congress decides to make some       portion of funding available for these older technologies, we       strongly support making it available for electric buses as       well and its related infrastructure to allow for the fastest       possible deployment of zero emission vehicle technology.            Sincerely,      Blue Bird Corporation.      IC Bus, a Navistar Company.      Thomas Built Buses.                                   ____                                                      July 27, 2021.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:       We, the undersigned organizations, representing millions of       members and companies, strongly support ensuring that the       full $7.5 billion in school bus funding goes towards school       districts to purchase electric school buses and install the       necessary charging infrastructure, as laid out in the memo by       Brian Deese explaining the Bipartisan Infrastructure       Framework. The 475,000 school buses that carry 25 million       children to school every day are some of the oldest       technology on the road. Due to their short routes, school       buses are frequently on the road for 15-20 years. Diesel       exhaust is a known carcinogen which directly and       disproportionately impacts the kids and drivers of these       buses. Reduced pollution from bus emissions has been shown to       decrease incidences of asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia and       also decreases absenteeism. Eliminating emissions from buses       should have even stronger effects.        Fortunately, electric school buses are available from       several domestic manufacturers and are being integrated into       school bus fleets across the country. The significant       investment that the government is planning to make in school       buses is critical and 100% of this funding should be spent to       help school districts to acquire these zero emission       technologies. We particularly support ensuring that       communities most impacted by air pollution are prioritized in       the application process.        We oppose any funding going to fossil fuel buses as these       buses do not eliminate tailpipe pollution, CNG and propane       buses are already cost competitive with diesel, and all new       buses purchased today will be on the road for 15-20 years,       thus ensuring long term dependence on fossil fuels. The news       story that broke last night shows that the bipartisan group       of Senators working on this legislation is planning to use       half of the school bus money to buy new fossil fuel buses for       school districts, which undermines our climate goals and       doesn't support the growth of the domestic EV bus industry.       As the climate crisis is worsening, and our kids are       breathing polluted air, we need to rapidly transition to       electric buses. The government's role is to help in that       transition. Even allowing one third of these funds to       purchase buses that run on CNG, propane, and biofuels (which       are blended in small volumes into gasoline and diesel) would       lock in up to 7.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions,       up to 88 billion pounds of carbon monoxide pollution, and up       to 12.5 million pounds of NOX, not to mention installing       fueling infrastructure that will be stranded assets as these       school districts move to electrification down the road.        Please ensure that all federal funding for school buses is       for electric buses that will both mitigate climate change and       reduce dangerous air pollution. We have an opportunity to       invest in a domestic industry, promote more good-paying jobs,       train more workers to be on the cutting edge of       transportation technologies, and reduce asthma attacks and       other respiratory ailments for our nation's school children.       We sincerely hope that Congress seizes this chance to make a       difference and puts $7.5 billion into electric school buses.

Environment     Mr. President, I would like to point out I like to work  out. I showed up at Pensacola at the age of 21 right out of Ohio State,  invited by the Navy as a midshipman. Before they put us in airplanes,  as you may recall, they put us through some really rigorous  [[Page S5901]]  conditioning. So I worked out, like, 6, 7 days a week then, and I come  pretty close to that today.   And a couple of days a week I like to run. I always like to run  outside. And all this work we were doing this last week--we were doing  a lot of work not only on the Senate floor, but behind the scenes on  electric school buses, to make sure that we would be able to provide  funding for a lot of them going forward.   And one morning, I went out running, and it was still almost dark,  and I was almost run over by two electric buses, and I said: Don't  worry, I am on your side. And I had a nice chat with a couple of  drivers.   So I came here to present this message and these unanimous consent  requests today.   I also wanted to say that we did get to work yesterday--Democrats and  Republicans working together. A bunch of amendments were adopted; one  or two not. But it was a good spirit last night, well into the night,  and good work has been done and has continued in through the evening  and again this morning on both sides of the aisle to find some  additional compromises.   I am told that several amendments are ready to be brought to the  floor. I would just say to my colleagues: Bring them. If you got  something you think is ready for prime time, whether it is Democrat or  Republican, and it is a combined bipartisan amendment, bring it. Let's  hear about it. Let's have a chance to discuss it and to vote on it.   We could be up late into the night. We are going to be up really  early in the morning. I think there is a 7 o'clock flight, maybe out of  Andrews. At least we leave from here to Andrews to go catch a 7 o'clock  flight to attend the memorial service for Senator Enzi in Wyoming  tomorrow.   I think we would be smart not to stay up half the night, and do as  much as we can this morning, and then--oh, it is noon, high noon. Get  started now. I think we will be glad that we did.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for almost two decades, I have worked on  policies to clean up dirty diesel engines, especially our Nation's  schoolbuses.   And our Presiding Officer--as am I, a recovering Governor--has  thought a lot over the years about schools and education and more than  a little bit about schoolbuses and how to get kids where they need to  go to get educated.   During a normal school year, I am told that more than 25 million  American children--more than 25 million American children--ride a  schoolbus every day--at least every schoolday to school.   Ninety-five percent of these buses are powered by diesel fuel; and  the majority are old, dirty engines that pollute the air, in many cases  make our kids sick, and impact our climate.   When we clean up schoolbuses, it is a win-win situation. Our kids get  healthier air to breath, our businesses get the message that it is time  to invest right here in America on the latest and cleanest  technologies, and we add to our toolbox for tackling the challenge of  climate change.   Electric schoolbuses make this win-win possible. Schoolbuses have a  set  [[Page S5905]]  route and can be predictably recharged. Schoolbuses, unlike other  heavy-duty vehicles, do not often travel more than 150 miles a day and,  therefore, do not have the range issues with current battery  technology.   However, electric schoolbuses today are expensive compared to diesel  buses; and, too often, buying an electric schoolbus is hard for schools  that are already strapped for cash, especially schools that serve low- income and minority populations.   The EPA Diesel Emission Reduction Act, known as DERA--the original  cosponsors of whom were George Voinovich of Ohio and yours truly--helps  schools replace dirty diesel engines with all types of technologies,  including electric vehicles.   With the death of George Voinovich, gosh, close to a decade ago, Jim  Inhofe, a colleague from Oklahoma, has taken up the torch from our good  friend George to champion through the Diesel Emission Reduction Act,  the focus of replacing dirty diesel engines, including for schoolbuses.   However, the DERA program is woefully underfunded and is not  structured specifically to meet school needs. DERA also does not  prioritize low-income schools, nor provide funds specifically for  electric schoolbuses.   With a new EPA Clean School Bus program, we can build on the lessons  learned from the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act and help make it easier  for schools to buy zero-emitting schoolbuses and other schoolbuses to  meet emission standards.   Through this new Clean School Bus program, we also will use the  Federal purchasing power to increase the demand for electric  schoolbuses, buses that are manufactured here in America in places,  among others, like Georgia, which, in turn, will bring down the overall  cost of schoolbuses for everybody.   Here is what the clean schoolbus language in this legislation does.  The Clean School Bus program amends the EPA Clean School Bus program  that was originally authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, but  never funded by Congress or implemented by EPA 16 years ago. EPA is  authorized to create a national program to fund the replacement of  existing schoolbuses with zero-emitting schoolbuses and other clean  schoolbuses through grants and rebates.   The Clean School Bus program places a priority on schools that serve  low-income students, are on Tribal lands, or are located in rural  areas, and the program can fund up to 100 percent of the cost of a new  schoolbus.   The legislation provides $5 billion in funding for this new Clean  School Bus program over 5 years, with $2.5 billion allocated  exclusively for zero-emission schoolbuses. The remaining $2.5 billion  can be used on buses that run on liquefied natural gas, compressed  natural gas, on hydrogen, propane, or biofuels, and can be used for  zero-emission schoolbuses.   My Environment and Public Works Committee staff and I, along with the  administration, worked hard to make sure that zero-emitting schoolbuses  had dedicated funding in this program and would be eligible for all  program funding. This agreement does just that.   I expect EPA to work to implement this program in a way that focuses  on pushing zero-emission technology out into the market. Technology  that uses fossil fuels is readily available and economic today and  should not be broadly subsidized by taxpayer dollars.   My hope is that this is just a down payment, and that Congress will  invest in the future even more in zero-emitting schoolbuses. Our kids  and our climate can't wait. They deserve it, and we need to deliver it  to them.   With that, I yield the floor to the Senator from Iowa.
