 Madam Speaker, I rise in full support of the equal  rights amendment and to debunk some of the nonsense being spouted by my  colleagues across the aisle.  [[Page H1425]]    This legislation is not about special rights, it is not about  preferential treatment, and it is not about erasing sex differences. It  is about finally guaranteeing equal rights, plain and simple.   Critics of the ERA know that, or at least they would if they actually  read the legislation. It is right there for all of us to see.  ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by  the United States or by any State on account of sex,'' period.   Everyone in this Capitol has a mother, and some of us are blessed to  have daughters. This amendment is about them. It is about completing  the work of generations of women before us who marched for full  equality, and it is about finishing that journey so that the next  generation will experience nothing other than full and fair rights  under the law.   I urge my colleagues to give our daughters that chance. Join us and  pass this resolution.
