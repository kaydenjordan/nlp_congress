 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Childhood  Cancer Awareness Month, which is being observed through the end of  September.   During this period of reflection, Americans from coast to coast honor  our Nation's youngest warriors in their battle against pediatric cancer  and recommit themselves to finding a cure for such a terrible disease.   One of those young warriors is a 1-year-old, Cooper Graham, of  Oceanside, New York, who is fighting the good fight at such a young  age.   Cooper is a tough little guy, always with a smile. I know that all  Long Islanders are standing in solidarity with him in his fight right  alongside Cooper's parents, Michael and Rachel, as well as his big  sister, Rylie.   During Cancer Awareness Month, we are all Coop's troops, and we are  going to stand with Cooper and all pediatric cancer warriors through  thick and thin.   Cooper, if you are listening back home, we all remain Coop strong.                            ____________________
