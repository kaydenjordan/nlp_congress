 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman  for yielding a little bit of time here at the conclusion of this  discussion. I want to thank particularly the gentlewoman from Wisconsin  for coming up with this bill on the House side and obviously those on  the Senate side that support it.   I can't say enough about the need here to do the right thing in  awarding this Congressional Gold Medal to the members of the Women's  Army Corps who were assigned to the 6888th Central Postal Directory  Battalion. It was a total of 855 Black women.   It was 1944 and 1945. They went to serve their country with  distinction and to make sure that that war would somehow guarantee  rights to all Americans, many of the rights that they did not have  themselves.   They were the largest contingent of Black women to be deployed  overseas, and they worked 7 days a week. As was stated earlier, 7 days  a week was not even enough for many of those who witnessed what they  were doing.   The Army, by its own admission, figured that the work that would be  before them would take months and months and months. We all know now,  as a result of history, that was not the case. They worked tirelessly  to support the mail that was going both ways at a time when we didn't  have internet and we didn't have all of the ways to communicate today.   So I congratulate them as a sterling group. There are just a few that  are still alive, well into their nineties today. I urge passage of this  very, very important piece of legislation.
