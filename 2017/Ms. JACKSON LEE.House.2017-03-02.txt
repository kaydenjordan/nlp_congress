 Mr. Speaker, as we begin the process that comes as a  responsibility of this House, and that is, overseeing the President's  budget and designing a budget to serve the American people, I am  raising the question of the baffling budget that seems to be emerging  from the White House.   The plus-up and elimination of sequester on the defense spending may  be worth considering. I, frankly, believe we should remove the  sequester on discretionary spending. But what is being proposed is that  the plus-up of $54 billion will be taken out of the needs, the hearts,  and minds of the American people.   The EPA will be gutted, so there will be no staff to oversee clean  water and clean air, of which so many counties and cities, like Flint  and my own community of Harris County, are in desperate need of.   What will happen to housing for senior citizens and young families?   Gutted because the Department of Housing and Urban Development will  see a drastic cut. Or Health and Human Services that helps to sponsor  federally qualified health clinics and the complete elimination of the  Affordable Care Act, which will bust the budget. Medicaid, civil  rights, and the prevention of hate crimes; the Justice Department  gutted and, as well, as Attorney General Sessions has already done, not  preventing voter fraud or voter discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, we need a budget that serves the American people. That  is the kind of budget that I will be looking to support.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chair and the managers of the bill, in this  instance Mr. Raskin and his collaborator, the Republican manager as  well. I thank them for their very thoughtful discussion. I also want to  indicate that this regulation does have a perspective of excessiveness  on a matter that can be confined to instructions to the agencies that  have the responsibility of implementing the laws that we pass here in  the United States Congress.   My amendment improves the present underlying bill by making clear  that  [[Page H1475]]  communication of information statements or claims that are generally  accepted by the scientific community or supported by empirical data is  not restricted by this bill.   H.R. 1004 directs each Federal agency to make information regarding  their regulatory actions publicly available in a searchable format on a  prominent website. That information would have to include the date a  regulation was considered, its current status, an estimate of when the  regulation will be final, and a brief description of the regulation. In  addition, agencies will be required to track the details of all public  communications about pending regulatory actions.   But it further provides that:   ``Any public communication issued by an Executive agency that refers  to a pending agency regulatory action, other than an impartial  communication that requests comment on or provides information  regarding the pending agency regulatory action,'' among other things,  ``may not--be directly or indirectly for publicity or propaganda  purposes within the United States. . . .''   I want to make sure that if an agency is telling the truth, then that  agency is not going to be charged, as was said by Mr. Raskin, using a  sledgehammer, that they can't make those communications. Take, for  example, someone claiming that global warming is a hoax, but, if you  read the facts, you will find out that a landmark 2013 study assessed  4,000 peer-reviewed papers by 10,000 climate scientists that gave an  opinion on the cause of climate change. It showed 97 percent of the  authors attributed climate change to manmade causes. That may be a  simple statement made by an agency based on science and empirical  study. That should not be prohibited.   The Jackson Lee amendment will protect Federal agency employees who  might otherwise be ostracized, marginalized, discriminated against,  wrongfully terminated or mistreated, or the whole regulation process  imploded for statements made even though the statement is externally  valid, logical, rooted in fact, or supported by empirical data,  although contrary to an administration's political agenda. I want this  to be straight up. I want these agency representatives to do what is  right, so I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I wish to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules  Committee for making the Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I also wish to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings  for their work in bringing the legislation before us to the floor.   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment to H.R. 1004.   The Jackson Lee Amendment improves H.R. 1004 by making clear that  Communication of information, statements or claims that are generally  accepted by the scientific community or supported by empirical data is  not restricted by the bill.   H.R. 1004 directs each federal agency to make information regarding  their regulatory actions publicly available in a searchable format on a  prominent website.   That information would have to include the date a regulation was  considered, its current status, an estimate of when the regulation  would be final, and a brief description of the regulation.   In addition, agencies would be required to track the details of all  public communications about pending regulatory actions.   H.R. 1004 further provides that ``any public communication issued by  an Executive agency that refers to a pending agency regulatory action,  other than an impartial communication that requests comment on or  provides information regarding the pending agency regulatory action,  among other things, may not ``be directly or indirectly used for  publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States unless  otherwise authorized by law.''   Thus, in addition to requiring each federal agency to make  information regarding regulatory action publicly available and  accessible online, H.R. 1004 places restrictions on the type and  quality of communications agencies may make.   This vague phrase--``publicity or propaganda purposes''--creates  substantial uncertainty and confusion as to what public communications  are permissible, and risks discouraging agencies from keeping the  public apprised of the important work they do on its behalf.   The Jackson Lee Amendment will protect federal agency employees who  might otherwise be ostracized, marginalized, discriminated against,  wrongfully terminated, or mistreated for statements made even though  the statement is externally valid, logical, rooted in fact, or  supported by empirical data, although contrary to an administration's  political agenda.   Under the Jackson Lee Amendment, for example, a communication that  human activity is a major contributor to climate change is not  propaganda because it is an assertion supported by an overwhelming  consensus of the scientific community.   On the other hand, a claim that there is `widespread voter fraud' in  presidential elections could be considered propaganda, because there is  no reliable and statistically significant empirical data to support  such a claim.   Federal agencies' ability to engage and inform the public in a  meaningful and transparent way regarding their work on important  science-based rulemakings that will greatly benefit the public is a  public good that we must nurture and protect.   While propaganda may corrupt information or ideas by an interested  party in a tendentious way in order to encourage particular attitudes  and responses, information, supported by facts or empirical evidence,  on the other hand, does not.   The Jackson Lee Amendment safeguards the legitimacy and transparency  of communications issued by federal agencies, ensuring that the  information disseminated to the public is accurate and reliable.   I urge my colleagues to preserve the bedrock principles of empirical  research, scientific method, and free inquiry that are indispensable to  free societies by voting for the Jackson Lee Amendment.                     [From cnbc.com, February 17, 2017]       Murray Energy CEO Claims Global Warming Is a Hoax, Says 4,000                           Scientists Tell Him So                           (By Tom DiChristopher)         Murray Energy Chairman and CEO Robert Murray on Friday       claimed global warming is a hoax and repeated a debunked       claim that the phenomenon cannot exist because the Earth's       surface is cooling.        Murray appeared on CNBC's ``Squawk Box'' to discuss       Republicans' rollback of an Obama-era rule that would have       restricted coal mining near waterways. President Donald Trump       signed the measure on Thursday in front of Murray and a group       of Murray Energy workers.        Murray Energy is the country's largest coal miner. Many of       its mines are in Appalachia, a region that would suffer some       of the biggest impacts of the rule. Murray also successfully       sued to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which       would regulate planet-warming carbon emissions from power       plants.        Asked about the economic analysis behind President Barack       Obama's energy regulations, Murray said, ``There's no       scientific analysis either. I have 4,000 scientists that tell       me global warming is a hoax. The Earth has cooled for 20       years.''        It was not immediately clear who the 4,000 scientists       Murray referenced are.        Asked for clarification, a spokesperson for Murray Energy       sent links to the Manhattan Declaration on Climate Change,       which says ``human-caused climate change is not a global       crisis,'' and the Global Warming Petition Project, a list of       science degree holders who don't think humans cause climate       change.        Murray's claim that there is no scientific analysis behind       climate change is not true.        A landmark 2013 study assessed 4,000 peer-reviewed papers       by 10,000 climate scientists that gave an opinion on the       cause of climate change. It showed 97 percent of the authors       attributed climate change to manmade causes.        His second claim that Earth is cooling is also false.        Temperatures were the warmest on record last year,       according to NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration. It was the third year in a row global average       temperatures set a record.        ``The planet's average surface temperature has risen about       2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late       19th century,' a change driven largely by increased carbon       dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere,''       NASA and NOAA said.        Climate change skeptics sometimes point to cool land       temperatures to dispute global warming. Scientists have       repeatedly noted that water covers 70 percent of the Earth's       surface, so it is highly misleading to cast temperatures on       land as a representation of global-scale temperatures.        Land also heats and cools more quickly than the ocean, The       Weather Channel noted while debunking a recent Breitbart News       article that was widely found to have cherry-picked data to       cast doubt on climate change.     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no doubt that my good friend  from Texas loves his wife. I would also suggest to him that there might  be a number of individuals who are experts that would be able to  confirm that, certainly those who are around him, and they might be  able to say that that is not propaganda or publicity, and, therefore,  his statement stands.   But when you are talking about thousands upon thousands of executive  agency staff, servants of the United States Government wanting to do  what is right, and you come down with this massive, oppressive document  that says here is what you have to do, but don't do propaganda and  don't do publicity, there should be a determination or a standard that  says if it is based in fact, you have no problem, that is information  that you can disseminate in order to edify those who may be wanting to  comment by edifying the particular regulatory scheme or structure that  you are putting forward for comment.   Why should my friends on the other side be afraid of good, strong  information to make the input valuable so that if I am dealing with a  clean air regulation that I am able to hear from those who are for and  against, but I can provide documentation, scientific documentation  about the quality of air pollution, why this regulatory scheme is  appropriate. I ask my colleagues, again, to support the Jackson Lee  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    How much time is remaining on both sides?    Mr. Chairman, let me say to the gentleman that what  we are suggesting is that propaganda can be confusing. I want truth and  honesty, and I want our agencies to be able to reach out and to help  the American people. Therefore, my amendment says that if by chance  they say something but it has facts or empirical evidence, it is not  propaganda, it is not publicity, they can go forward and protect our  water, they can protect our health, they can protect our air. Why are  we hiding on this floor?   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. It only  makes this bill more refined as to how we can help the American people  pass a regulatory scheme that enhances local communities and cities.  That is why we need the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, with all good intentions of the  underlying bill, the Regulatory Integrity Act  [[Page H1478]]  of 2017, which has a very distinguished name, I am really concerned,  and my colleague should be concerned, of the chilling effect of this  particular legislation. Let me tell you what the problem is.   My good friend from Texas Mr. Farenthold, Congresswoman Jackson Lee,  and Professor Raskin will not be bending over the shoulder of some  hardworking public servant for the Federal Government trying to  interpret what this new law means. Can I speak? Can I send information  out? What a chilling effect. What a First Amendment violation this  legislation might entail.   Take, for example, Chairman Pai of the FCC. He decided to publish the  full text of proposals and regulations that the public would otherwise  never see until after they had been finalized and approved. Suppose he  was then charged with a violation of this bill? Chilling effect,  undermining the public's ability to even understand what a very  important agency such as the FCC is doing.   My amendment simply states that nothing in this bill shall be  interpreted to prohibit any communication that is protected under the  First Amendment to the United States Constitution. For those of us who  love the Constitution, that is the First Amendment, and it is a simple,  simple statement. Your freedom of speech is protected because it  enables people to obtain information from a diversity of sources, makes  decisions, and communicates those decisions to the government.   Let me recite a 1927 case from Justice Louis Brandeis, Whitney v.  California. There is a joy in reading it because he wrote and said:  ``Freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means  indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.''   The Framers of the Constitution knew, to quote Justice Brandeis:  ``that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for  its infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and  imagination; that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds  hate.''   The question is: Some worker who is responsible for this, what will  they think?   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment that  indicates the First Amendment will not be chilled.   Mr. Chair, I wish to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules  Committee for making the Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I also wish to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings  for their work in bringing the legislation before us to the floor.   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain this Jackson Lee  Amendment to H.R. 1004.   The Jackson Lee Amendment is simple and straightforward.   It simply states that ``nothing in the bill shall be interpreted to  prohibit any communication that is protected under the First Amendment  to the U.S. Constitution.''   The amendment is necessary because not only does H.R. 1004 direct  that certain information be made publicly available by agencies  regarding their regulatory actions, the legislation also imposes  restrictions on the type and quality of communications that can be made  by agencies and agency personnel.   Mr. Chair, it is useful to explain briefly why the First Amendment's  protection of speech is central to the effective functioning of the  American political system.   Freedom of speech and a vibrant and robust democracy are inextricably  intertwined.   Freedom of speech enables people to obtain information from a  diversity of sources, make decisions, and communicate those decisions  to the government.   The First Amendment also provides American people with a  ``marketplace of ideas.''   Rather than having the government establish and dictate the truth,  freedom of speech enables the truth to emerge from diverse opinions.   In Whitney v. California (1927), Justice Louis Brandeis wrote that  ``freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means  indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.''   Free speech facilitates democratic governance because it is only  through talking that we encourage consensus and form a collective will.   Over the long run, free speech improves our public decision-making  because just as we Americans generally believe in free markets in  economic matters, we also generally believe in free markets when it  comes to ideas, and this includes governmental affairs.   Freedom of speech strengthens public confidence in the American  governmental system of checks and balances.   Speech is thus a means of empowering people, through which they  learn, grow, and share; correct errors; and remedy violations of the  public trust.   Mr. Chair, the framers of the Constitution knew, to quote Justice  Brandeis again in Whitney v. California:         that order cannot be secured merely through fear of       punishment for its infraction;        that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and       imagination;        that fear breeds repression;        that repression breeds hate;        that hate menaces stable government[.]    Free societies like the United States accept that openness fosters  resiliency and that free debate dissipates more hate than it stirs.   Not only does freedom of speech serve the ends of democracy, it is  also an indelible part of human personality and human dignity.   In the words of Justice Thurgood Marshall in the 1974 case Procunier  v. Martinez:         The First Amendment serves not only the needs of the polity       but also those of the human spirit--a spirit that demands       self-expression.    Freedom of speech is intimately connected to the human desire to  think, imagine, create, wonder, inquire, and believe.   While freedom of speech is not unlimited, the American tradition is  to view such limits with caution and skepticism and to embrace freedom  of speech as a transcendent constitutional value.   In Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665 (1972), Justice Douglas reminded  us that:       effective self-government cannot succeed unless the people       are immersed in a steady, robust, unimpeded, and uncensored       flow of opinion and reporting which are continuously       subjected to critique, rebuttal, and re-examination.    In other words, Mr. Chair, freedom of speech is fundamental to the  American identity and psyche.   And that is why I have proposed the Jackson Lee Amendment to ensure  that nothing in H.R. 1004 shall be interpreted to prohibit any  communication that is protected under the precious First Amendment to  the U.S. Constitution.   I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?    Well, let me say this.   Mr. Chair, first of all, before I yield to the gentleman from the  great State of Maryland, the reason why we need my amendment is because  this deals with speech. This regulatory bill deals with speech, what  you can say and what you cannot say.   So this is not a reflection that we need this in every legislative  initiative. I would love for it to be there. But this is a bill that  deals with what our agencies can say. And if the Chairman of the FCC  put out all of these proposals specifically so that the public could  see, just think if this bill unclarified what the protection of the  First Amendment reiterated, his speech would be chilled.   I am delighted to yield 30 seconds to the distinguished gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Again, Mr. Chair, can the Chair tell us the time  remaining.    Mr. Chair, let me indicate that the gentleman just  argued my point. Clarity is what we need. My amendment provides  clarity.   Again, what does this bill do? This bill tells Federal employees  about their speech: what level of speech, containing speech, how much  speech, what they can say, what is propaganda, what is publicity.  Therefore, I think it is important to avoid the chilling effect on  public servants who are doing the task on behalf of the American  people.   Being the American people's defendant, I believe that we should, in  fact, have this language. In Branzburg v. Hayes, Justice Douglas  reminded us that an effective self-government cannot succeed unless the  people are immersed in a steady, robust, unimpeded, and uncensored flow  of opinion and reporting which are continuously subjected to critique,  rebuttal, and reexamination. That is the protection of the First  Amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Let me reemphasize: Clarity in the First Amendment cannot be a bad  thing. This bill kills speech. Let's clarify that that speech is  protected by the First Amendment to not chill the hard work of our  hardworking Federal employees trying to provide for the safety and  security of the American people.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
