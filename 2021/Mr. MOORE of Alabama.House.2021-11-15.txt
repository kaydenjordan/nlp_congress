 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the  Senate version of my bill, the Colonel John M. McHugh Tuition Fairness  for Survivors Act.   Members of our military and their families sacrifice so much in  service to our country. As a grateful Nation, we have accepted a  responsibility to ensure that the educational needs of the survivors  and dependents of our fallen heroes are provided for.   The Dependents Educational Assistance program currently provides  $1,224 a month to eligible participants to help cover the costs of  higher education. The program is available for survivors, dependents of  certain servicemembers who died on Active Duty, or later found to be  100 percent service-connected disabled or died in a service-connected  disability.   The Colonel John M. McHugh Tuition Fairness for Survivors Act would  expand the DEA program benefits, requiring GI Bill eligible schools to  extend in-State tuition benefits to beneficiaries of the Dependents  Educational Assistance Program, bringing the rules for this program in  line with the Post-9/11 GI Bill.   It is fitting that this bill bears the name of U.S. Army Colonel John  McHugh. Colonel McHugh was tragically killed 11 years ago by a roadside  bomb in Afghanistan. The loved ones left behind by this fallen hero  have suffered unimaginable pain. The least we can do for his family and  others like him is to honor our commitment to them and ensure their  education is affordable. Colonel McHugh's family resides in my  southeast Alabama district in Enterprise. It gives me great pride to  name this bill in honor of the Colonel McHugh's legacy.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a commonsense solution to help our  heroes' families meet their higher education goals. I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.
