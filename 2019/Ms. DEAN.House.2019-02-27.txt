 Mr. Speaker, for decades, lobbyists have stifled our  national conversation about gun violence and Congress has refused to  act.   Since Parkland, Thousand Oaks, and so many others, new voices have  broken through. Student activists have marched, organized--alongside  moms--and insisted that we take their safety seriously.   This week we do just that, by passing H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112. This will  be a sea change.   And it shouldn't be controversial. Mr. Speaker, 97 percent of  Americans support background checks--that is Democrats and  Republicans--including 94 percent of gun-owning households.   Six years ago, I was there when the Pennsylvania House Judiciary  Committee held its first hearing on background checks.   In her courageous testimony, Sandy Hook mother Francine Wheeler  described losing her son Ben. She said:         When this happens to you--when my child was murdered, I no       longer have the fear to stand up and to say what is right and       what I believe.    And then Francine asked a crucial question:         If we all agree dangerous individuals shouldn't have guns,       then shouldn't we at least take the most basic steps to make       sure they don't?    I look forward to the passage of these bills.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I am delighted that we are finally at this day,  because you know the tide, you know the toll that takes place every  day. On average, every day in America, 342 people are shot: murders,  assaults, suicides, or suicide attempts. That means every single day-- yesterday, tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day--100 people, on  average, will die of gun violence and another 200 or more will  literally be wounded or shot in the crossfire.   We know that, in 2017, more than 39,000, nearly 40,000 people died of  gun violence, all kinds of gun violence. That was an extraordinary  uptick in gun violence.   I carry with me today the picture of Ben Wheeler, whose courageous  mother testified before the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in  2014.   I carry with me today a picture of Ron, the son of my dear friend,  Marge, who died of gun violence by suicide.   I carry with me, not by picture, but in my heart, the 16-year-old son  of my former student at La Salle University who was shot in random gun  violence in the city of Philadelphia.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8. In conclusion, Mr.  Chair, I long for the day when orange ribbons are obsolete and when  orange scarves are a fashion statement, not a cry for help.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background  Checks Act of 2019. My amendment clarifies that those at risk of  committing suicide would be exempt from the background check  requirement in instances of imminent threats of death or great bodily  harm.   Specifically, this legislation amends the bill to insert the line  ``including harm to self, family, household members, or others'' to the  list of instances when a person is exempt from the background check  requirement and may temporarily transfer away a firearm for  safekeeping.   The spirit of this long overdue legislation is to save lives, and I  urge my colleagues to support my amendment, which will further achieve  this goal by addressing the leading instance of gun death in this  country, suicide.   Last year, nearly 40,000 people were killed by gun violence, with  another 80,000 literally caught in the crossfire. Of those killed, over  half, more than 20,000, people tragically died by gun suicide.   And the problem has grown. Nationally, over the past years, the past  decade, the rate of suicide by gun death has increased 19 percent. This  is a problem that grips our entire Nation.   In my home State of Pennsylvania, there has been a 24 percent  increase in gun suicides over the past 10 years, claiming the lives of  over 14,000 people. These are our friends, our loved ones, young and  old, people for whom our hearts ache, people we wish we could hold just  one more time.   I offer up a picture of a dear friend of my family, Ron.   Unfortunately, very few of us are left unscathed by this problem.  While there are many factors that contribute to self-harm, the presence  of a firearm in the home increases the risk of suicide. Not  surprisingly, using a gun is the method that most often ends in death.   Guns are dangerously effective at what they are designed to do. That  is why this amendment is so important. It ensures that those in crisis  can temporarily transfer a firearm safely until the crisis has passed.  It clearly defines that a person can temporarily hand over firearms to  someone they trust while they work through this difficult time.   This clarity is needed because, in times of crisis, moments matter.  It may literally be the difference between life and death.   We are here today at a historic moment to take action against the  violence that plagues this country, our communities, and our loved  ones. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, with this  amendment, will keep guns out of the hands of those who legally should  not have them and also gives those who need a safe way to separate  themselves from their guns a way to do so.   If we have the courage to pass this legislation, the courage here in  the House and in the Senate and in the White House, it will do just  that. It will save lives.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler).  [[Page H2257]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the author of this bill, Representative  Thompson, and I thank all the tireless advocates who have worked to  bring us to this day.   I thank the good gentleman from Georgia for his comments. Clearly, he  understands the gravity and the grave nature of gun death by suicide in  this country. As you can see, that number has been escalating over the  past 10 years. That includes more than 20,000 people in a single year.   Gun violence by suicide is quite deadly. We know it, and so I thank  my colleague from the other side of the aisle for at least supporting  the spirit of what we are trying to do here.   For the greater safety of our citizens, our neighbors, our friends,  and our family members, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment  and please support this bill, H.R. 8.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
