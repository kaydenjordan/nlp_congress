 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a  young man from my district in New York's Hudson Valley who passed away  last week while serving his country.   Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Michael Kozloski, originally from  Mahopac, New York, was only 35 years old.   Michael died as a result of injuries sustained during a crane  accident while serving in Alaska.   Mike leaves behind his wife of 13 years, Brie, and four young  children.   He dedicated his entire adult life, 17 years, to protecting our  country as a member of the Coast Guard.   We all owe Mike and his family an enormous debt of gratitude for his  service and for making the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our  country.   I spoke to Mike's wife earlier today, and she told me that the  community of Homer, Alaska, has rallied to her side, even as a dozen  family members have flown in.   At a time when we ask so much of our Coast Guard families, how  fitting to be reminded that as Americans, we still rally to our heroes  and their families at these difficult times.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of us to join in prayer for Michael and his  family.   We will be closely monitoring the ongoing investigation in this  incident and offering our assistance as needed.   Our hearts go out to Michael's family, his friends at Mahopac, and  the entire Coast Guard community. We thank them for their service. We  remember Michael for his sacrifice, and we pledge that he will not be  forgotten.                            ____________________
