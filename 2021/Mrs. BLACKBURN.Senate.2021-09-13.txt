 Madam President, September 11, 2001, is a date that  is seared in the memories of those of us who lived through that day and  experienced the trauma and the fear of that day.   What has always struck me about that day and the days following, even  standing here 20 years later, is how the entire free world stood united  against what we saw as a common threat. It came to us as naturally as  breathing. We understood that as witnesses to mass murder, we shared a  duty to avenge those who had died. It may have been fear that forced us  together, but in the days that followed the attacks, we, as Americans,  rediscovered the ties that have bound us for centuries and solidified  our faith in the common cause of freedom.   But the more time that passes between each September 11 and the  September 11 attacks, the more obvious it becomes that history slips  away from those who fail to heed its lessons. The defensive action we  took as a nation in the wake of the attacks was among the most forceful  and effective the world had ever seen, but still, even 20 years later,  it is obvious that our work in Afghanistan and the Middle East is far  from over.   My colleague from Maine talked about the withdrawal from Afghanistan.  I would say, as I talk to Tennesseans, it is not withdrawing from  Afghanistan; it was the manner in which the Biden administration chose  to end the military mission in Afghanistan that didn't seem to reflect  the reality of what was going on on the ground.   Last week, I sent a letter to Chairman Reed, with several of my  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, asking for formal hearings  on the withdrawal. We need to know exactly what happened, how they were  advised. Without sworn testimony from Secretary Austin, General Milley,  General McKenzie, and General Miller, we will never be able to untangle  the chaotic course of events that led to the deaths of 13  servicemembers in Kabul and the abandonment of an unknown number of  American citizens and our Afghan partners.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record as follows:                                                     U.S. Senate,                                                  September 8, 2021.      Senator Jack Reed,      Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC.        Chairman Reed: It is necessary and appropriate for Congress       to examine the manner in which our military mission ended in       Afghanistan. We should do so with transparency, candor, and a       dedication to ascertaining the facts without regard to       politics.        We understand that in the coming months, many committees       will claim the authority to ask questions regarding our       military's withdrawal. Yet, because our committee bears the       special responsibility of authorizing and overseeing       America's armed forces, we acutely feel the obligation to       seek answers. The American people. and in particular many of       those who serve our country in uniform, are hurting, angry,       and disappointed. We owe them a clear and comprehensive       understanding of what happened, why, and how best to learn       from these events for the future. Time is of the essence.       These hearings should be our top priority when the Senate       reconvenes.        We write to formally request that the Senate Armed Services       Committee fully exercise its oversight authority by holding       both opened and closed hearings on this matter and that our       committee ask the Department of Defense to preserve any and       all records pertaining to the conclusion of our operations in       Afghanistan. In particular, we seek sworn testimony from       Secretary Lloyd Austin, General Mark Milley, General Frank       McKenzie, Jr., and General A. Scott Miller.        We owe it to our nation, those who served, their families,       and our allies and partners who fought alongside us, to       preserve the records of how our fight in Afghanistan       concluded. The insights we gather will help prevent future       loss of American blood and treasure, a solemn responsibility       and sacred trust we believe all members of our committee will       seek to uphold.            Sincerely,          Tommy Tuberville, Roger Wicker, Tom Cotton, Joni K.             Ernst, Thom Tillis, Dan Sullivan, Kevin Cramer, Rick             Scott, Marsha Blackburn, Josh Hawley, U.S. Senators.     Beyond the fact-finding mission, I plan to use these  hearings to impress upon my Democratic colleagues the importance of the  words that we use to describe our enemies, how we talk about them, how  we frame their actions.   Since day one--since day one of this administration--the Biden  administration has used their words to rehabilitate the Taliban in the  eyes of their radical base. The problem, of course, is that their  diplomatic calls for inclusivity and equality, this supports a lie  about who the Taliban actually is. The Taliban--like ISIS, like al- Qaida--is a terrorist organization. They rule by fear. They rule  through public beheadings, rape, forced marriage, brutality against  anyone who questions their regime, against anyone who disagrees with  them. Look at the way women and children are treated.   Now, in my opinion and from a lot of Tennesseans whom I have talked  with as I have been home, they feel that expecting terrorists to behave  like normal people is reckless and stupid. And they feel that some of  the actions that have come from this administration and comments that  they would have that expectation would reflect that reckless stupidity.  These are terrorist organizations.   If you need another example of this, just look at their approach to  border security. Even before the transfer of power, massive migrant  caravans had begun moving out of Central America and toward the  southern border. They were eager to take advantage of then-Candidate  Biden's promises of open borders and amnesty for all.   Where did that get us? Well, this is what we have learned. The CBP  reports that migrant encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border reached a  20-year high in July. That is right, massive numbers. They heard those  promises. So what did they do? They got to work contacting a cartel,  and they made this journey after, of course, they paid the cartel. Most  of the nearly 200,000 people our Border Patrol caught in July were  traveling alone. Families might be holding back, but the international  traffickers certainly are not holding back.   On August 29, CBP officers in Memphis found three kilograms of  [[Page S6448]]  ketamine in a shipment of furniture from France coming in because of  the cartels.   In the first week of September, CBP officers in Texas seized two  separate stashes of cocaine with a combined street value of almost  $300,000. In the month of July alone, cocaine seizures increased 91  percent, and meth seizures increased 20 percent. Why are they doing  this? They know that the border is open.   On September 8, Texas State Troopers and CBP officers stopped two  human smuggling attempts running just hours apart from each other. Our  CBP officers have made it standard procedure to scour remote terrain  for migrants who have been abandoned and left to die by their cartel  transporters. Why is this happening? Because it is obvious to everyone,  from the migrants, the cartels to the foreign officials who refuse to  police their own borders, that the Biden administration won't do  anything to stop it. Tennesseans see this as reckless. It makes no  sense.    I talked to some local law enforcement officers this week. They are  seeing an uptick in meth, fentanyl, and heroin on the streets--all  coming out of Mexico. They repeatedly say: Secure the border.   We live in the greatest Nation on Earth. We are still the world's  best example for freedom, and we are the last hope for millions of  people suffering under authoritarian rule. It is important to  understand that it doesn't have to be the way it has been when you look  at this withdrawal from Afghanistan, when you look at this open border,  when you look at the fact that, yes, this year, the border patrol has  apprehended terrorists at the southern border. That is right. It  doesn't have to be that way, but when you have weak leadership-- leadership that is not focused, leadership that says ``it is my way or  the highway''--and when you have that reckless disregard for the truth,  that can and will destroy us.   The actions of the Biden administration have already emboldened our  enemies. They have made our allies doubt our commitment to them and to  the work that they are trying to do to advance freedom for themselves-- the work that we are doing to advance freedom here in this country and  abroad.   So I would encourage my Democratic colleagues to resist the urge to  fall in line with the White House on the issue of the Afghanistan  withdrawal and to, instead, join me in demanding as many hearings as it  takes to restore accountability and transparency and to find out  exactly what happened.   What were our military advisers saying to President Biden? To Vice  President Harris? To Jake Sullivan? To Susan Rice? To Antony Blinken?  What were they telling them? What was the expectation? Did they have a  plan? Did they plan to leave Americans behind enemy lines? Did they  plan to give up Bagram Airfield? Did they plan to leave all of the  equipment for the Taliban to use? Did they plan on that? Was it  intentional that they made those decisions or was it reckless stupidity  that got us here?   I yield the floor.
