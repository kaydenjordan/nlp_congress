 Madam President, I rise today to express my strong  support for the Respect for Marriage Act, a bipartisan bill that  Senator Baldwin and I have introduced with our colleagues Senator  Feinstein, Senator Portman, Senator Sinema, and Senator Tillis.   Madam President, this bill recognizes the unique and extraordinary  importance of marriage on an individual and societal level. It would  help promote equality, prevent discrimination, and protect the rights  of Americans in same-sex and interracial marriages. It would accomplish  these goals while maintaining and indeed strengthening important  religious liberty and conscience protections.   I am proud to be the lead Republican sponsor of this legislation, and  I am grateful that a similar bill passed the House with strong  bipartisan support.   As the Senate considers and prepares to vote on this historic  legislation, I would be remiss if I did not begin by recognizing the  tremendous progress that LGBTQ individuals in this country--in our  country--have made in recent times in achieving equal rights.   It was not long ago that patriotic Americans could not be honest  about their sexual orientation while fighting to protect our country-- our freedoms--in the Armed Forces. I led the fight with former Senator  Joe Lieberman of Connecticut to repeal the discriminatory don't ask,  don't tell law.   It was not long ago in America that a person could be fired merely  for being gay. I strongly supported the Employment Non-Discrimination  Act, known as ENDA, which passed the Senate in 2013 and would have  prohibited such discrimination. Seven years later, the Supreme Court in  Bostock held that the Civil Rights Act protects employees from  discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.   And it was not long ago in America that individuals could not marry  the person whom they loved if that person were of the same sex. The  Supreme Court's landmark decision in Obergefell found that the  fundamental right to marry is guaranteed by our Constitution.   Madam President, let us remember that we are talking about our family  members, our friends, our coworkers, our neighbors. I am proud to have  stood with them, and I will continue to stand with them in efforts to  protect and secure their rights, while at the same time steadfastly  protecting and respecting religious liberty.   The Respect for Marriage Act would accomplish two primary goals.  First, it would guarantee that a valid marriage between two individuals  in one State is given full faith and credit by other States, meaning  that States must recognize a valid marriage for purposes of public  acts, judicial proceedings, and rights arising from a marriage  regardless of that couple's sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.  That means that same-sex and interracial couples can rest assured that  their marriages will be recognized regardless of the State in which  they live.   We need to remove the cloud that is now over these couples that is  causing them such consternation, as my colleague from Wisconsin has  mentioned.   Second, it would require the Federal Government to recognize a  marriage between two individuals if the marriage was valid in the State  where it was performed. It would do so by getting rid of a law that is  on the book, known as the Defense of Marriage Act, which has been  invalidated by the Supreme Court's ruling yet remains on the books.   With these changes, Federal law will provide that all married couples  are entitled to the rights and responsibilities of marriage. This  includes, for example, making medical decisions for an ill spouse and  receiving spousal benefits from programs like Social Security and  Medicare, as well as those benefits earned from service in our Armed  Forces.   To remove any ambiguity about the intent and scope of this bill, I  have worked with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as  well as with a coalition of religious organizations, to develop an  amendment designed to clarify the language and address concerns that  have been raised with the House version of our bill.   First and foremost, this legislation would not diminish or abrogate  any religious liberty or conscience protections afforded to individuals  and organizations under the U.S. Constitution and Federal law,  including the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration  Act. Through our amendment, this fact is now stated explicitly in our  bill.   The amendment also makes clear that this bill only applies to valid  marriages between two individuals. In other words, it does not  authorize or require recognition of polygamous marriages. They are  already prohibited in all 50 States. This really was a straw argument,  but we have made it clear nonetheless in our amendment that in no way  would the Federal Government or other States be required or authorized  in any way to recognize polygamous marriages.   Moreover, the amendment clarifies that the bill could not be used to  deny or alter the tax-exempt status or any other status--tax treatment,  grant, contract agreement, guarantee, educational funding, loan,  scholarship, license, certification, accreditation, benefit, right,  claim, or defense not arising from a marriage--for any otherwise  eligible person or entity. In other words, no church, no synagogue, no  mosque, no temple, no religious educational institution would have to  worry that somehow their tax-exempt status would be in jeopardy if they  do not perform same-sex marriages that are contrary to their religious  beliefs.   Let me repeat that because this has been coming up time and again.  For the first time and consistent with the First Amendment and the laws  of many States, this legislation would make clear in Federal law that  nonprofit religious organizations and religious educational  institutions cannot be compelled to participate in or support the  solemnization or celebration of marriages that are contrary to their  religious beliefs.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record at the end of my statement an excellent analysis by the 1st  Amendment Partnership.   Some have said that this bill is unnecessary because there is little  risk that the right to have a same-sex or interracial marriage  recognized by the government will be overturned by the Supreme Court.  Regardless of one's views on that possibility, there is still value in  ensuring that our Federal laws reflect that same-sex and interracial  couples have the right to have their marriages recognized regardless of  where they live in this country.   I strongly believe that passing this bill is the right thing to do,  and the American people agree. Indeed, more than 70 percent of  Americans support marriage equality, including a majority of Democrats,  Republicans, and Independents.   As I wrote in a Washington Post op-ed with my colleague Senator  Baldwin, ``Millions of American families have come to rely on the  promise of marriage equality and the freedoms, rights and  responsibilities that come with making the commitment of marrying the  one you love. . . . Individuals in same-sex and interracial marriages  need, and should have, the confidence that their marriages are legal.''    Simultaneously, we must also recognize that people of good conscience  may disagree on issues relating to marriage. For many Americans,  marriage is more than just a legal union; it is a religious institution  grounded in their faith.   As Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court,  explained in the Obergefell decision,  [[Page S6718]]  ``[M]arriage, in their view, is by its nature a gender-differentiated  union of man and woman. This view long has been held--and continues to  be held--in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here and  throughout the world.'' He went on to explain that ``neither they nor  their beliefs are disparaged here.''   The same principle applies to our legislation, and that is explicitly  acknowledged in the amended bill. Thus, it is important to me that our  bill would not affect or diminish in any way religious liberty and  conscience protections. Any interpretation of this legislation that  would limit the applicability of these protections for individuals or  entities because they have religious objections to same-sex marriages  would be contrary to the plain language of our bill.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record at the conclusion of my statement a series of letters from  religious organizations that endorse the religious liberty provisions  of our bill.   They include letters from Elder Jack Gerard from the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints, Melissa Reid from the Seventh-day  Adventist Church, Nathan Diament from the Union of Orthodox Jewish  Congregations, and from a host of other organizations: the Council for  Christian Colleges and Universities, the AND Campaign, the  Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance, the Center for Public  Justice, and Tim Schultz of the 1st Amendment Partnership. We have  worked very closely with all of them.   Madam President, in closing, let me once again salute the leadership  of Senator Baldwin, as well as Senator Portman, Senator Tillis, and  Senator Sinema, for their tireless efforts on this important  legislation.   Let's do the right thing. Let's vote to proceed to this important  bill, and let us pass it. I urge all of my Senate colleagues to join me  in supporting the Respect for Marriage Act.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  What Do Religious Freedom Supporters Get in the Amended Senate Version                   of the Respect for Marriage Act (RMA)?         1) Explicit Congressional support for the truth that       traditional marriage supporters and their beliefs are decent       and honorable. This was stated by the Supreme Court in       Obergefell, but many progressives refuse to acknowledge it.       Congress endorsing this truth in a bipartisan law is a big       deal. This can be cited in all future cases where       progressives equate traditional beliefs about marriage with       racism.        2) Demonstration that gay rights legislation will not pass       without addressing religious liberty concerns. This has been       denied by many progressive activists, who falsely use words       like ``license to discriminate''.        3) Explicit protections under federal law against non-      profit religious organizations that support traditional       marriage having to facilitate marriages that violate their       religious convictions.        4) A non-retaliation clause: the Act cannot be used by       federal agencies to punish religious organizations in any way       related to their views on marriage. Even if this clause will       be rarely used in practice, it sets a very firm floor of       religious protections that it will be difficult for future       Congresses to reverse.   Why Should Conservatives Who Opposed the Obergefell Decision Support                       the Respect for Marriage Act?         Obergefell isn't going to be overturned. After all, Justice       Thomas's concurrence in Dobbs was not signed by any other       justice. Most conservatives wouldn't want to nullify the       marriages made legal by Obergefell anyhow. Now, with       Obergefell as the legal basis for same-sex marriage, there       are no explicit corresponding religious freedom protections.       Enacting RMA will put into law real religious protections       that can't be won alone. And enactment of the amended RMA       sends a strong bipartisan message to Congress, the       Administration, and the public that gay rights can't trample       religious freedom.                 Is This a Good Deal for Religious Freedom?         Yes. Religious freedom advocates get protections that they       have sought on a stand-alone basis but been unable to enact.       Courts might grant some of these protections eventually, but       litigation is costly and takes years to see results. In       return, gay marriage advocates get something they already       have: recognition of legal gay marriages, albeit now on       statutory grounds.       Why Shouldn't Conservatives Demand Stronger Religious Freedom                          Protections in the RMA?         Senator Lee and others rightly desire to enact even broader       religious protections. But our wish list is not going to be       enacted into law all at once without major compromise. The       similar ``First Amendment Defense Act'' never moved, even       when Republicans had majorities. Any amendment demanding       broader protections is therefore a messaging device that       conservatives can vote for, even though it will not have the       60 votes needed to pass the Senate.        Conservatives should rest well still voting for the       achievable protections in the RMA, knowing that they are       still much more than conservatives have been able to pass in       the eight years since Obergefell.     Does the RMA Create New Risks for For-Proft Entities Like Wedding                                  Vendors?         No. The RMA doesn't contain non-discrimination requirements       that would put bakers and other for-profit entities providing       wedding services in jeopardy. The Equality Act would create       those risks, not the RMA. Note that there is no politically       viable way to protect these for-profit religious entities in       statute without at the same time advancing LGBT non-      discrimination (like the Equality Act). Congress can,       however, sketch out a vision of balanced fair play that this       Supreme Court will find attractive. That's exactly what the       RMA does.   Won't the RMA be Used by Progressive Activists to Sue Faith-Based Non-                  Profits, Including Adoption Agencies?         No. We share your mistrust of progressive activities. But       the RMA doesn't hand them any new litigation tools. Gay       marriage is already legal--see Obergefell. Private rights of       action to enforce legal gay marriage are already available       under Section 1983.        Crucially, the RMA allows lawsuits only against those       ``acting under color of state law.'' Neither current law nor       the RMA defines non-profits that receive government money as       ``acting under color of state law.'' Left-wing gadflies have       long sought to redefine all civil society organizations       (faith based and otherwise) as ``state actors,'' subject to       the full equal treatment requirements of the Constitution.       But they haven't gained any legal victories with this extreme       theory, and their ``case'' has at most one vote on this       Supreme Court.      Don't the Religious Protections in the RMA Lack an Enforcement                                 Mechanism?         It doesn't need one. Religious liberty amendments have       limited the RMA to avoid impacts on religion. The RMA states,       ``nothing in this act shall be construed to . . .'' and then       lists things the RMA can't do to harm religion. We understand       that progressive activists abuse the courts all the time, but       the RMA doesn't hand them any new tools and this Supreme       Court would never entertain the idea that it does.     Does the RMA Threaten the Status of Faith-Based Schools To Fully            Participate in State Funded School Choice Programs?         No. The RMA addresses recognition by the federal government       and state governments of lawful same-sex marriages as       required by Obergefell. Section 6(a) of the RMA expressly       states that it cannot be used to diminish existing religious       liberties. Section 7(a) states that the RMA cannot be used to       alter the eligibility for grants, accreditation, or       ``educational funding'' benefits for which a faith-based       entity is otherwise eligible. The RMA does not attempt to       reach all future legal disputes arising in state legislatures       over LGBT rights. But the clear ``teaching'' of the       bipartisan Senate version of the RMA is that religious       liberty in this space must be protected. The Congress is       weighing in very clearly to that effect.                                   ____                                                  November 15, 2022.      Re The Respect for Marriage Act (H.R. 8404).         Dear Senators: We are leaders of faith-based organizations       representing tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of       religious institutions. All our organizations hold to an       understanding of marriage as between one man and one woman.       Many of us privately expressed concerns about the House-      passed version of the Respect for Marriage Act.        We are gratified by the substitute religious freedom       language offered by Senators Collins, Baldwin, Sinema,       Portman, Tillis, and Romney. It adequately protects the core       religious freedom concerns raised by the bill, including tax       exempt status, educational funding, government grants and       contracts, and eligibility for licenses, certification, and       accreditation. If passed, it would continue to build on the       congressional wisdom represented by the Religious Freedom       Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA).        Attached are many statements from individual organizations.            Sincerely,      Elder Jack N. Gerard,        The Quorum of the Seventy, The Church of Jesus Christ of       Latter-day Saints.      Melissa Reid,        Director of Government Affairs, Seventh-day Adventist       Church--North American Division.      Nathan J.

We are grateful for the continuing efforts of those who       work to ensure the Respect for Marriage Act includes       appropriate religious freedom protections while respecting       the law and preserving the rights of our LGBTQ brothers and       sisters.        We believe this approach is the way forward. As we work       together to preserve the principles and practices of       religious freedom together with the rights of LGBTQ       individuals much can be accomplished to heal relationships       and foster greater understanding.                                   ____         Dear Senators Collins, Baldwin, and Portman: The Seventh-      day Adventist Church in North America would like to express       our profound appreciation for your commitment to the       protection of this nation's historical and treasured       religious freedoms in the context of the codification of       same-sex marriage recognition.        The Seventh-day Adventist Church holds a traditional       understanding of marriage as divinely established in Eden and       affirmed by Jesus to be a lifelong union between a man and a       woman. We recognize, however, that societal trends have       departed from our Church's understanding of marriage,       sexuality and family.        We are grateful for the members of Congress and their staff       who have constructively engaged with us and with other faith       institutions to ensure that the Respect for Marriage Act       acknowledges that ``reasonable and sincere people'' can have       ``decent and honorable religious or philosophical'' reasons       to maintain traditional convictions about marriage.        The Adventist Church applauds you and your fellow Senators       for the significant religious freedom protections included in       the Respect for Marriage Act, including the protection of       churches from being required to facilitate same sex marriages       and the prevention of retaliation against religious       organizations for their views on marriage.        Thank you for partnering together on legislation that       reflects bipartisan commitment to religious freedom and       diversity.                                                   Melissa Reid,                                     Director of Government Affairs,      Seventh-day Adventist Church--North American Division.                                   ____           Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America,             Advocacy Center,                                 Washington, DC, November 15, 2022.      Senators Susan Collins, Kyrsten Sinema, Rob Portman, Tammy         Baldwin.        Dear Senators: In anticipation of the U.S. Senate's       consideration of H.R. 8404 (the ``Respect for Marriage       Act''), as modified by an amendment you have offered, we       write to you on behalf of the leadership of the Union of       Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (``Orthodox       Union''), the nation's largest Orthodox Jewish umbrella       organization.        In 2015, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in       Obergefell v. Hodges, the leadership of the Orthodox Union       ``reiterated(ed) the historical position of the Jewish faith       . . . Our religion is emphatic in defining marriage as a       relationship between a man and a woman. Our beliefs in this       regard are unalterable.'' At the same time, we noted ``that       Judaism teaches respect for others and we condemn       discrimination against individuals.''        At the time, our leadership said that ``in the wake of       today's ruling, we turn to the next critical question for our       community, and other traditional faith communities--will       American law continue to uphold and embody principles of       religious liberty and diversity, and will the laws       implementing today's ruling and other expansions of civil       rights for LGBT Americans contain appropriate accommodations       and exemptions for institutions and individuals who abide by       religious teachings that limit their ability to support same-      sex relationships?        As the U.S. Senate prepares to consider H.R. 8404 the       leadership of the Orthodox Union, in light of the religious       principles reiterated above, cannot endorse the main purpose       of H.R. 8404. However, we welcome the provisions added to       this bill by your amendment in the nature of a substitute in       the Senate that appropriately address religious liberty       concerns (provisions that were absent in the version of the       bill passed by the House of Representatives).        As amended, Section 2 of H.R. 8404 recognizes that       ``diverse beliefs about the role of gender in marriage are       held by reasonable and sincere people based on decent and       honorable religious or philosophical premises.'' Section 6 of       H.R. 8404 provides that ``nothing in this act shall be       construed to  . . . abrogate a religious liberty . .  .       protection . . . available under the Constitution or Federal       law'' and further provides that no religious nonprofit entity       whose principal purpose is the advancement of religion shall       be required to provide services or goods associated with       solemnizing or celebrating a same sex marriage. Section 7 of       H.R. 8404 provides that no government official or agency can       deny a wide array of benefits--including tax exempt status,       grants, contracts, accreditation or others--to an otherwise       eligible entity or person on the basis of that entity or       person not recognizing same-sex marriage. These provisions       appropriately address the array of religious liberty concerns       raised in the context of H.R. 8404 and its operative       provisions.        Moreover, we note that your recognition that religious       liberty interests must be explicitly and substantively       addressed in the context of this kind of legislation is       itself an essential act in a nation devoted to the principles       of diversity, tolerance and religious freedom.        We thank you for your work with us and other faith partners       to craft these important legislative provisions.            Sincerely,      Mark (Moishe) Bane,        President.      Rabbi Moshe Hauer,        Executive Vice President.      Nathan J. Diament,        Executive Director--Advocacy.                                   ____       Hon. Senator Susan Collins.      Hon. Senator Tammy Baldwin.        Dear Senators: The CCCU strongly recommends that the Senate       include the attached religious freedom amendment within the       Respect for Marriage Act (S. 4556). The CCCU represents over       140 Christ-centered institutions of higher education in the       United States encompassing over 500,000 students. The CCCU's       mission is to advance the cause of Christ-centered higher       education and help our institutions transform lives by       faithfully relating scholarship and service to biblical       truth. CCCU institutions adhere to Biblical values and       traditions, including teaching the Biblical understanding of       marriage as between one man and one woman as an essential       foundation for a thriving society.        Since the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, the CCCU and other       religious and First Amendment groups have sought to both       uphold their sincere convictions regarding marriage and, in       the spirit of Obergefell, advocate for a balanced legislative       approach that preserves religious freedom and addresses LGBTQ       civil rights. This carefully crafted amendment includes both       strong religious liberty language recognized in the       Obergefell decision and non-retaliation language that ensures       this legislation cannot be used by state and federal agencies       to punish religious organizations for their sincerely held       beliefs.        This amendment provides explicit Congressional support for       the truth that traditional marriage supporters and their       beliefs are decent and honorable as was stated by the Supreme       Court in Obergefell. It also sends a strong bipartisan       message to Congress, the Administration, and the public that       LGBTQ rights can co-exist with religious freedom protections,       and that the rights of both groups can be advanced in a way       that is prudent and practical.            Sincerely,                                         Shirley V. Hoogstra, J.D.,      President.                                   ____                                                  November 15, 2022.      Re The Respect for Marriage Act.         Dear Senators: On behalf of the AND Campaign and our       coalition of pastors nationwide, I would like to thank you       for your significant efforts to protect religious freedom in       the amended Respect for Marriage Act (the ``Act''). Your       commitment to civic pluralism and the hard work of democracy       provides a model for American politics to move forward in a       healthier manner. We're thankful that you chose the path of       good faith and dignity in a time of immense division.        The AND Campaign upholds the historic Christian sexual and       family ethic, which defines marriage as a union between one       man and one woman. Accordingly, we were encouraged to see the       amended legislation acknowledge that ``diverse beliefs about       the role of gender in marriage are held by reasonable and       sincere people based on decent and honorable religious or       philosophical premises''. That acknowledgement coupled with       strong anti-retaliation language is vital to protecting the       free exercise of religion for millions of Americans who share       our worldview.        Rather than engaging in zero-sum politics, your work       demonstrates that thoughtful leaders can work through       disagreements with respect and charity. We applaud the       amended language and support the motion to proceed as       necessary for a thorough debate on the Act.            Sincerely,                                      Rev. Justin E. Giboney, J.D.,      President, AND Campaign.                                   ____                                                  November 15, 2022.      Re The Respect for Marriage Act (H.R. 8404).         Dear Senators Collins and Baldwin: The Center for Public       Justice, and our Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance,       thank you for your dedication to safeguarding religious       freedom in the context of the statutory protection of same-      sex marriage. We applaud Senators committed to bring forward       for discussion the Respect for Marriage Act so the full       chamber may discuss the proposed  [[Page S6720]]       amendment that we believe strongly protects religious       freedom.        The proposed amended Respect for Marriage Act establishes       that Congress agrees with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision       authorizing same-sex marriage that reasonable and sincere       people can hold other convictions about marriage due to their       religious or philosophical convictions. Among other strong       religious freedom protections we commend, we stress our       thanks for the bill's language specifically protecting the       tax-exemption of faith-based nonprofits and houses of       worship.        As a Christian organization, we believe in the historic       biblical understandings of marriage and human sexuality. Many       in our society hold a different view, and in Obergefell, the       Supreme Court mandated that same-sex unions be legally       recognized as marriages. Significantly, in that same opinion,       the Court acknowledged that reasonable and sincere people can       have decent and honorable religious or philosophical reasons       to maintain their traditional convictions about marriage. We       believe that it will be of great legal and cultural       significance if Congress enacts an amended Respect for       Marriage Act that adds to the U.S. Code a statement of       congressional agreement with the Court's positive view about       the supporters of traditional marriage.        The amended Respect for Marriage Act contains other       significant language embodying a congressional commitment to       protecting religious freedom in the context of affirming       LGBTQ rights. We regard adoption of the Act as the best       opportunity since the passage of the Religious Freedom       Restoration Act (1993) and the Religious Land Use and       Institutionalized Persons Act (2000) for Congress to       safeguard religious freedom with Democratic support. The       amended Respect for Marriage Act codifies what is already the       law of the land because of Obergefell while adding to the       U.S. Code new protections for religious freedom in the       context of marriage equality.        As a Christian public policy organization we are committed       to policies that respect the dignity of all people. In our       society with its many diverse communities of belief, justice       requires creative pluralist policies. The religious freedom       protections designed into the amended Respect for Marriage       Act embody this pluralist approach. We commend you and your       colleagues for your commitment to protecting religious       freedom in our changing culture.            Sincerely,      Stephanie Summers,        CEO, Center for Public Justice.      Stanley Carlson-Thies,        Founder, Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance.                                   ____                                                National Association                                                 of Evangelicals,                                                  November 15, 2022.        Dear Senators Baldwin and Collins: Thank you for diligently       working to ensure the inclusion of important religious       freedom protections in the Respect for Marriage Act, which is       currently before Congress. Your efforts, if successful, will       produce the first significant bipartisan legislation in many       years advancing religious freedom for all, including for       those who hold traditional views on marriage.        Your proposal would achieve several objectives that enhance       the religious freedom of all Americans:        Expressing congressional endorsement of the Supreme Court's       finding that those who hold traditional understandings of       marriage are decent and honorable, deserving of respect under       the law, rather than being equated with those who espouse       racism and bigotry;        Demonstrating that Americans can respect the dignity of       their fellow citizens and live in peace even when disagreeing       on fundamental issues such as the nature of marriage;        Protecting traditional marriage supporters from having to       facilitate marriages that violate their religious       convictions; and        Protecting religious organizations from retaliation by       federal agencies due to their views on marriage.        These are important, commonsense provisions that represent       a significant contribution to strengthening the legal       protections for chose who, like the members of the National       Association of Evangelicals, continue to believe that God       designed marriage as an exclusive covenantal relationship       between a man and a woman for the purpose of creating strong       families that in turn bless their community and nation. We       cherish the freedom to preach, teach, and practice these core       convictions, while respecting our fellow citizens who do not       share these beliefs.        Be assured of our prayers for you as you continue serving       our nation and defending the rights of all Americans.            Gratefully,                                                        Walter Kim,      NAE President.                                   ____                                              University of Virginia                                                   School of Law,                                                  November 16, 2022.        Dear Senators Collins and Baldwin: We are constitutional       law scholars who have studied, taught, and written about the       law of religious liberty for decades. All of us have       persistently argued for religious liberty in legislatures and       in the courts, including liberty for believers and       institutions with objections to facilitating same-sex       marriages.        We believe that H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act       (RMA), with the additional religious freedom protections you       have proposed, is a good and important step for the liberty       of believers to follow their traditional views of marriage.       Its protections for religious liberty, while not       comprehensive, are important, especially in the context in       which RMA arises.              a. the religious liberty protections are important         For several reasons, we believe the religious-liberty       protections in RMA are meaningful and important even if not       comprehensive.        1. First, RMA includes an explicit statement by Congress       that ``[d]iverse beliefs about the role of gender in       marriage''--including the belief that marriage is between a       man and woman rather than between persons of the same sex--      ``are held by reasonable and sincere people based on decent       and honorable philosophical premises'' and that such beliefs       ``are due proper respect.'' Section 2(2). This statement of       respect for the belief in male-female marriage plainly       distinguishes it from beliefs opposing interracial marriage,       which receive no such affirmation (even as the statute       protects interracial marriages).        The distinction is important for religious-freedom claims.       The Supreme Court in Bob Jones University v. United States,       461 U.S. 574 (1983), upheld stripping tax exemptions from       racially discriminatory private schools, including religious       schools, on the basis of the ``firm and unyielding'' national       policy against racial discrimination. Opponents of       traditional beliefs about marriage regularly analogize those       beliefs to racist beliefs for the purpose of resisting       religious freedom claims by traditional believers and       institutions.        Explicit congressional affirmation that the traditional       male-female definition of marriage is ``reasonable'' and       ``honorable'' would counter the analogy to racism and weaken       the ground for relying on Bob Jones to justify rejecting       traditionalist believers' religious-freedom claims.       Obergefell v. Hodges included a similar statement of respect       for traditional views, but it was dictum, and some       commentators have questioned the Court's power to declare it.       A congressional statement would be a legitimate, and       powerful, statement of national policy--one favoring respect       for (among other things) religious organizations that adhere       to traditional views of marriage.        2. RMA includes specific protections for religious liberty.       Most notable is the categorical exemption for ``nonprofit       religious organizations''--comprehensively defined to include       ``social agencies'' and ``educational organizations,'' and       ``nondenominational'' and ``interdenominational''       organizations as well as houses of worship--from having to       provide ``services, accommodations, advantages, facilities,       goods, or privileges for the solemnization or celebration of       a marriage.'' Section 6(b). The provision, although not a       comprehensive protection for acts by religious nonprofits,       guarantees that they can refuse to participate in the       category of activities most relevant to RMA's coverage:       ``solemnization or celebration of a marriage.'' The provision       bars ``any civil claim or cause of action'' based on such a       refusal: it sets no limitation on the nature or source of the       claim or cause of action barred. Although courts might       provide such protection under the First Amendment, this       provision makes the right more secure and avoids lengthy       constitutional litigation. The protection is categorical;       unlike a claim of constitutional right, it cannot be       overridden by a judicial finding of a ``compelling       governmental interest.''        RMA also explicitly provides that it does not ``deny or       alter'' any tax exemption, funding, license, accreditation,       or ``any benefit, status, or right of an otherwise eligible       entity or person''--including, plainly, of a religious       organization. Section 7(a). Those who claim that the bill       would be used as a ground for denying tax-exempt status to       organizations adhering to male-female marriage, by analogy to       Bob Jones, are disregarding the statutory text.        3. Finally, RMA both reflects and teaches that if       proponents of LGBTQ rights want any advances or legislative       protections for those rights, they must attend also to       corresponding religious-liberty concerns. LGBTQ-rights       proponents have failed to secure their goals in Congress       through the Equality Act, or in many state legislatures,       because they have been unwilling to make provision for       religious liberty. The lesson applies to conservatives as       well. Efforts like the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA)       have likewise failed repeatedly because they made no       provision for recognizing LGBTQ rights even in an incremental       way. Religious liberty has been caught in the crossfire of       warring groups unwilling to accept the smallest gain for the       other side. And religious liberty has suffered as a result,       both in its concrete scope and in its status as a fundamental       civil right that all Americans should embrace       enthusiastically.        This bill offers a chance to counter those trends and to       enact religious-liberty protections in a bipartisan measure.       RMA does not provide all the protection that traditionalist       believers seek or that they should receive. But the       protections it offers are important.     b. the religious-liberty protections are important in light of the                        context in which rma arises         Moreover, the religious-liberty protections that RMA       provides must be considered in the  [[Page S6721]]       context in which RMA arises. Three features of RMA's context       reinforce that its religious-liberty protections are       significant.        1. RMA poses little or no new risk to religious liberty       beyond those that already exist from nondiscrimination laws       combined with same-sex marriage rights under Obergefell v.       Hodges. Those rules are currently in force, without RMA (and       without the statutory religious-liberty protections it would       provide).        RMA creates no new cause of action against any private       religious entity, even one receiving funding from the state.       Only a person acting ``under color of state law'' can violate       the Act. Contrary to the claims of some RMA opponents,       Supreme Court precedent is clear that entities do not act       under color of state law--to use an equivalent term, they are       not rendered ``state actors''--simply because they contract       with the state, receive funding from the state (even the       lion's share of their funding), or are heavily regulated by       the state. Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991 (1982); Rendell-      Baher v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830 (1982). Blum, for example, held       that a privately owned skilled nursing facility was not a       state actor even though it was heavily regulated, received 90       percent of its income from Medicaid payments, received state       subsidies for its capital costs, and was doing something the       government required it to do--but what was challenged was a       particular means of doing that thing, and the government did       not require the means. ``[C]onstitutional standards are       invoked only when it can be said that the State is       responsible for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff       complains.'' Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004 (second emphasis added).       The state had not directed the specific conduct complained of       in Blum. Nor, obviously, can the government be said to have       directed a religious nonprofit's specific decision to       disfavor same-sex relationships.        2. If RMA creates no new liability, then the only way it       could make traditional believers' religious liberty less       secure is if the Supreme Court were ready to overrule       Obergefell, ending the constitutional right to same-sex       marriage, and RMA then preserved a small portion of that       right by statute. But the chances of overturning Obergefell       are small. Justice Thomas's call to overturn it, made in his       concurrence in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org., 142 S.       Ct. 2228 (2022), attracted no other votes. Rather, the Dobbs       majority opinion emphasized, in three different places, that       the overruling of constitutional abortion rights did not cast       doubt on other substantive due process precedents, because       abortion is a ``unique act'' involving termination of a       ``life or potential life.'' 142 S. Ct. at 2277; id. at 2258,       2280. Justice Kavanaugh reiterated the point in his       concurrence. Id. at 2309. Conservatives have generally urged       taking these assurances from the Dobbs majority as genuine       and reliable.        As constitutional scholars and observers, we agree. To       overrule Obergefell, the Court would have to undo thousands       of same-sex marriages entered into in reliance on that       decision or else create a two-tier system in which some same-      sex couples will be validly married for fifty or sixty years       because they married during a window of opportunity while all       future couples are barred in many states. We very much doubt       that a majority will take that step.        3. Finally, as we have already emphasized, religious-      liberty protections, however defensible and warranted, have       repeatedly failed when embodied in legislation that provides       no benefits (however incremental) to LGBTQ rights. The       question is not whether this bill provides all the       protections that traditional believers and institutions will       need in all contexts. The question is whether the bill       provides protections that are significant when compared with       new risks to religious liberty that the legislation creates.       Because we conclude that the bill's protections are important       and that any new risks it creates are quite limited, we see       it as an advance for religious liberty.
