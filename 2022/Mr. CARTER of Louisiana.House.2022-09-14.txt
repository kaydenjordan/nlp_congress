 Mr. Speaker, today, I am honored to remember  a groundbreaking public servant, personal mentor, and inspiring New  Orleanian, the Honorable Moon Landrieu, mayor of the city of New  Orleans.   A son, father, husband, grandfather, brother, and lawyer, Moon  Landrieu first served in the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1960  and next on the New Orleans City Council. He was elected mayor of the  city of New Orleans from 1970 to 1978, served as U.S. Secretary of  Housing and Urban Development from 1979 to 1982, and was a circuit  court judge.   Throughout his career, he fought for equality and justice, opposing  Jim Crow legislation and successfully outlawing segregation in public  accommodations, standing as a shining light during our Nation's darkest  times.   He passed away on September 5, but the Honorable Moon Landrieu and  his indelible impact will never be forgotten in our world.                            ____________________
