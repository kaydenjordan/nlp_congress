 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Tuskegee  Airmen National Museum in Detroit for securing $500,000 in grant  funding for its pilot training program from the Federal Aviation  Administration.   The Tuskegee Airmen National Museum was originally founded to record  and honor the unsung but substantial contributions of our Nation's  first Black military airmen.   Madam Speaker, the museum has grown to operate from three different  locations across the city of Detroit, including the Charles H. Wright  African American History Museum, historic Fort Wayne, and the Coleman  A. Young municipal airport, where it offers career training programs  for young people interested in aviation and aerospace science.   The museum takes particular pride in its community engagement around  aviation training, which has been in operation for more than 30 years.  $500,000 will go a long way in their flight training program which  is offered to young people age 14-19 in the metropolitan Detroit area  and puts students on the path toward obtaining a private pilot's  license. I wish you could have seen the excited faces when I went to  one of their events for young people, again, learning to fly.    The museum works in partnership with many of our local organizations  and universities to connect the many interested students with training  and resources.   I say this wholeheartedly, I am so proud that our own government, the  Federal Aviation Administration, sees the gem that the Tuskegee Airmen  National Museum is. Their training program and the unique opportunities  they offer to our young people is truly a huge contribution to Wayne  County, Michigan. Again, I am pleased to see the FAA see a tremendous  value in their work.                                 War in Yemen     Madam Speaker, I rise today to uplift the Yemeni people  who have been suffering from the inhumane and violent war. We are  approaching the eighth anniversary of the start of the war in Yemen.   We must stop U.S. participation in this war. It is far past time for  us to reiterate our support for ending U.S. ties to and support for the  Saudi coalition.   After over 10 months now without airstrikes in Yemen, the Yemeni  people want to ensure that these airstrikes never resume.   Indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets, including hospitals,  schools, water treatment plants, as well as blockading Yemeni ports-- committed largely with U.S. weapons and logistical support--have  resulted in what the U.N. has described as the world's worst  humanitarian crisis with millions of Yemenis pushed to the edge of  famine.   Again, the United States must stop any participation in this horrific  war.   Over 11,000 children have died of hunger or been maimed as a result  of the conflict in Yemen, according to UNICEF, an average, Madam  Speaker, of four a day since the escalation of the conflict in 2015.  Across Yemen, 23.4 million people are in need of humanitarian  assistance.   The Yemeni-American families in my district are devastated to see  their families, their native cities, the neighborhoods they all grew up  in completely ripped apart with death, famine, and violent attacks.   ``May Allah cure you.'' ``Allah yshfeekom.''                      Violence Against Women in Politics     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Women's History  Month. I cannot think of any better way to recognize and honor women  than to take active steps in protecting them.  [[Page H1213]]    This week, I am reintroducing House Resolution 801 that recognizes  violence against women in politics is a global phenomenon now and that  more research should be conducted to examine its extent and effects in  the United States.   There is a disturbing rise of violence against women in politics. We  have all experienced it in this Chamber. The never-ending string of  ignorant, hateful, and downright threatening rhetoric against  colleagues in this room is extremely unacceptable, and it is the same  kind of hate that is directed against countless women all around the  globe, especially women of color and those with cross-cutting  identities.   Madam Speaker, women have been on the frontlines of social justice  movements around the world and throughout our Nation's history.  Violence against women in politics is a specific, gendered phenomenon,  stemming from a resistance to increased political participation by  women intended, again, to undermine women as political actors.   According to the ``2018 Violence Against Women in Politics Report''  by U.N. Women and U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human  Rights, it says that women of color are increasingly more affected by  this crisis.                                time  1015    A recent study by U.S. mayors found that women mayors are more likely  than men to experience most types of violence and abuse and indicates  such incidents are not out of the ordinary for women in U.S. politics  generally.   In honor of Women's History Month, I urge my colleagues to support  this resolution.                            ____________________
