(b) Study.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security       shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a study of       the adequacy of allowances provided to employees of       Department of Homeland Security frontline operational       components (as such term is described in section 836 of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002, as added by subsection (a)).       Such study shall be informed by a Department-wide survey of       employees from across the Department who receive uniform       allowances that seeks to ascertain what, if any, improvements       could be made to the current uniform allowances and what, if       any, impacts current allowances have had on employee morale       and retention. Such study shall also consider increasing by       25 percent, at minimum, the uniform allowance for first year       employees and by 50 percent, at minimum, the annual allowance       for all other employees.        (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 835 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 836. Requirements to buy certain items related to national                security interests.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2083, the Homeland Procurement  Reform Act, or HOPR.   I am proud to have introduced this bipartisan legislation to reform  the way the Department of Homeland Security procures uniforms and  protective equipment for its personnel. The aim is to improve the  quality of uniforms and equipment issued to Department frontline  personnel by encouraging the procurement of domestically sourced  uniform items.   Today, DHS has more than 60,000 uniformed men and women. Less than  half of those uniforms are made here in the United States. Under this  legislation, at least a third of DHS funds spent on uniforms are to be  used to purchase goods manufactured by American small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, my bill is good for homeland security, and it is good  for small American businesses.   Additionally, in response to concerns expressed by frontline  personnel about how quickly they exhaust their annual uniform  allowances, my bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to take  a hard look at the adequacy of the allowances. In studying the issue,  the Secretary is required to determine what improvements can be made to  the current allowances and what impacts the current allowances have had  on employee morale and retention.   H.R. 2083 is endorsed by the Warrior Protection and Readiness  Coalition and the National Border Patrol Council, and it passed out of  committee unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee  and Representative Mast from Florida for their contributions to and  support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to the goal of ensuring that at least a  third of all uniforms and protective equipment is provided by American  small businesses, this bill also addresses concerns expressed by DHS  frontline personnel.   Component personnel often deplete their annual uniform allowances  before the conclusion of the year and have experienced delays in  receiving basic uniform items, such as duty shirts, belts, and socks.  H.R. 2083 would put DHS on a path to improving its processes and  delivery of uniform items for its vital frontline personnel.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this bipartisan legislation that will  ensure that the men and women protecting our Nation have the best  equipment that they can.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support of this process,  and once again, I ask for their support.  [[Page H4372]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2609) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish the Acquisition Review Board in the Department of Homeland  Security, and for other purposes.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101 et       seq.) is amended by inserting after the item relating to       section 835 the following new item:  ``Sec. 836. Acquisition Review Board.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every year, the Department of Homeland Security invests  billions of dollars on major acquisition programs to execute its  critical missions. It acquires systems vital to homeland security,  including ships for the U.S. Coast Guard and baggage screening systems  for the Transportation Security Administration.   However, DHS' acquisition activities are on the Government  Accountability Office's ``High Risk List'' because of management and  funding concerns. In fact, according to GAO, only 10 of the 24 major  acquisition programs have approved schedule and cost goals and are on  track to meet those goals.   Given these challenges, it is critical that DHS review its major  acquisition programs for proper management, oversight, and  accountability.   This bill, the DHS Acquisition Review Board Act of 2019, seeks to  strengthen the role of the Acquisition Review Board, or ARB, to improve  acquisition outcomes within the Department of Homeland Security. The  ARB has the potential to help ensure that DHS does not pursue programs  that it can't afford or that do not meet established cost, schedule,  and performance thresholds.   Mr. Speaker, the enactment of H.R. 2609 is one mechanism within the  Department to help ensure that programs are on time, on budget, and in  line with the Department's mission.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for that  fine piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close  after the gentleman from the State of Texas (Mr. Crenshaw) closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2609 has the potential of fostering  accountability and uniformity within the Department's acquisition  programs.   A version of this legislation was passed by the House by a voice vote  in the 115th Congress, and I urge my colleagues to do the same again  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2590) to require a Department of Homeland Security overseas  personnel enhancement plan, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2590         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H4374]]            SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2590, the DHS Overseas  Personnel Enhancement Act of 2019.   A key feature of how the Department of Homeland Security carries out  its border security mission is the deployment of personnel abroad to  help ensure that threats are identified and addressed before they ever  reach our borders.   For our part, Congress has a role to play to ensure the Department  has the right policies and resources to keep Americans safe, both at  home and abroad.   H.R. 2590 builds on the existing Federal mandate that requires DHS to  have a 3-year strategic plan for overseas deployment of DHS personnel.  The mandate enacted in 2017 was authored by the chairman of the  Committee of Homeland Security, Representative Thompson.   H.R. 2590 would strengthen the strategic plan by requiring DHS to  provide regular congressional briefings about overseas personnel.  Following the first briefings, DHS would be required to submit a  strategic plan to enhance the effectiveness of its overseas personnel  deployments to Congress.   Subsequent briefings would track DHS efforts to enhance the  effectiveness of its personnel in foreign locations.                                time  1600    During committee markup of this bill, Democrats offered amendments to  ensure that DHS prioritizes efforts to mitigate the risks and  counterintelligence threats facing DHS personnel living overseas. As  amended, it requires DHS to report on foreign efforts to influence our  personnel and maintain practices to guard against these threats,  including counterintelligence and cyber threats.   Pushing our borders out to mitigate threats to the homeland before  they ever reach our shores is an important endeavor and one we should  all support. Providing the basic information in H.R. 2590 will help  Congress better understand who DHS is deploying overseas and to what  end and how we can best support components with overseas missions.   I would note that DHS has yet to provide Congress with a 3-year  strategy required by statute and requested by Chairman Thompson years  ago. I hope that we do not have to wait much longer before receiving  this strategy and additional information about how DHS is using its  workforce overseas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank my colleague  from New York (Mr. Katko) for this fine piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. I am prepared to close after  the gentleman from New York closes as well, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, by passing H.R. 2590 today, Congress can ensure that our  borders are being pushed out to mitigate threats to the homeland and  that DHS overseas personnel are being deployed effectively and  efficiently.   I would also add that this measure was passed by the House in the  115th Congress by a vote of 415-0. I hope that my colleagues will lend  their support and join me in passing this legislation again today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
