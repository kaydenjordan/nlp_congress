 Madam Speaker, as someone who was on the battlefield  of nearly every civil rights fight of the last century, Mr. John Lewis  taught us that our Nation is always a work in progress, always  perfecting our Union.   Through it all though, regardless of what he faced, John Lewis always  walked gracefully with the wind, following the words of Isaiah: ``They  shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary;  they shall walk and not faint.''   My friend, our hero, John Lewis never grew weary, no matter what the  fight, including his last.   It was a remarkable blessing, as we heard tonight, from so many, to  serve with your hero, to have him meet and hug your children, to meet a  true American hero. There was none like him in this Chamber, and I  think there never will be.   I will never forget the last hug that I got from him when I told him  how much he meant to me; how much I appreciated his counsel; when he  visited, how much I appreciated him coming to my district to speak with  my community, and just all he did for all of us.   And he whispered back, as he said to so many others, ``Just stay  strong, my brother.''   Mr. Lewis, that is the least we can do for you is to always stay  strong.   Congressman Lewis was an American icon, as we all know. But he was a  gentle giant, and his life's work will live on forever. His presence,  his humble kindness will always loom large over this House and over our  great Nation.   As Congressman Lewis said: ``If you see something that is not right,  not fair, not just, you have a moral obligation to do something about  it.'' And I think we all need to remember that, especially now. I know  that I will.   Thank you, Congressman John Lewis, our friend. God bless you.
