 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Preserving  American Justice Act to ensure that foreign governments face serious  consequences if they assist their citizens to escape legal  accountability in the United States.   Recently, Oregon's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, uncovered that  five Saudi nationals with criminal charges departed the Nation before  facing justice. These men were arrested for serious crimes including  vehicular murder of an innocent teenager, sexual assault, rape, and  child pornography. According to news reports, U.S. government officials  believe the Saudi government helped these five men with actions ranging  from posting bail to facilitating their escape from the United States.  These reports claiming the Saudi government is whisking away criminals  facing justice in Oregon show a shocking disdain for our Nation's  criminal justice system. Given the disturbing similarities in these  five cases, a thorough investigation is essential to better understand  the involvement of the Saudi government.   When anyone commits a crime in the United States, they must be held  accountable. The Trump administration has failed to explain what, if  anything, it is doing to ensure these men face American justice. That  failure is completely unacceptable. Foreign governments cannot  disregard our laws and abuse diplomatic privileges by helping criminals  escape. No one is above the law, and I am committed to making sure the  Saudi government understands that it cannot behave this way here in  Oregon or anywhere in the United States.   The legislation I introduced today would direct the Department of  Justice to investigate these five cases and bring to light the  involvement of the Saudi government. If the Department of Justice  concludes that the Saudi government was involved, then my bill would  bar Saudi Arabia's leaders from the United States until their  government returns the suspects who have fled. The legislation would  also create a major tax penalty on governments and sovereign wealth  funds for any country that help its citizens escape American justice.  More broadly, my legislation would help Americans understand how  widespread this practice is, direct the Department of Justice to  maintain a list of any foreign governments that help their citizens  evade American justice, and create tough consequences for those  governments and their leaders.   I believe that my colleagues who talk about ``putting America First''  would agree that foreign governments cannot undermine American laws.  I'm all for doing more to protecting Americans from real threats and  ensuring that the victims of these crimes get the justice they deserve  in an American court of law. So I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting measures that would hold foreign governments accountable.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Preserving  American Justice Act to ensure that foreign governments face serious  consequences if they assist their citizens to escape legal  accountability in the United States.
