 Mr. Speaker, as our Nation honors  National Police Week, I rise today to remember a fallen officer,  Lieutenant Aaron Crook of the Bluefield Police Department.   This week, the name of Officer Crook, along with 359 of his fallen  brothers and sisters in blue, will be added to the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington. As our Nation honors  our police officers for their sacrifices, we give thanks to the life of  Officer Crook, whom we sadly lost last May.   Lieutenant Crook was born in Summers County, graduated from Bluefield  State College, and proudly served in the United States Marine Corps  Reserve for 6 years. After serving his Nation, he exchanged his Marine  uniform for that of the Bluefield Police Department in 2008.   Lieutenant Crook was an outstanding police officer and devoted family  man. He loved the outdoors and would never pass up an opportunity to go  fishing. In fact, the city of Bluefield is planning to rename a lake in  his honor so his legacy can carry on through one of his favorite  pastimes.    His memory is kept alive by his wife, Whitney; his kids, Brycen and  Paislee; his extended family; the Bluefield Police Department; and so  many others.   He will never be forgotten. Our State and country lost a good man,  and Officer Crook is missed each and every day. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
