 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McGovern for yielding me  the time.   Mr. Speaker, I often quote George Santayana, who warned: ``Those who  cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.''   The insurrection on January 6 was the worst attack on our  Constitution since the Civil War. While the secessionists were defeated  in 1865, our Nation's experiment with multiracial democracy during  Reconstruction did not last.   It was extinguished by the Lost Cause mythology that minimized the  evils of the secessionists and raised monuments to the leaders of the  Confederacy that they established. These willful circumventions and  misrepresentations were used as justification  [[Page H5745]]  for avoiding accountability and violently stripping African Americans  of constitutional rights.   We are at risk of repeating that history today. Just as the Lost  Cause laid the ideological groundwork for Jim Crow and all its  inhumanities, the big lie seeks to justify nullification laws that seek  to suppress votes and establish autocratic rule.   The former President and his enablers are using the big lie to deny  the horror of January 6. They are attempting to obstruct and subvert  the select committee's work and to prevent a full accounting of their  efforts to undermine our democracy.   We know from our history that when our government is attacked,  failing to hold the perpetrators accountable emboldens them. Allowing  their myths to gain currency incentivizes them. And underestimating  their disregard for their fellow citizens enables them to deny those  citizens their constitutional rights.   I urge adoption of this resolution so that we avoid repeating the  past, at least that part of our past that dehumanizes our fellow  citizens. We must act to strengthen our democracy and build a better  future for our country so that it can once again be the envy of the  world.
