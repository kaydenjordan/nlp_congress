 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan  Congressional Ukraine Caucus, I rise to reaffirm transatlantic  solidarity in advance of President Biden's meeting with Russian  dictator Vladimir Putin.   I am so thankful to President Biden, who is personally committed to  liberty in Ukraine. I was proud to travel with him and Senator McCain  to Ukraine in 2015, for President Poroshenko's inauguration.   As President Biden knows well, Vladimir Putin is an enemy of liberty.  Ukraine faces its seventh year of brutal Russian aggression that has  led to over 14,000 deaths. Putin's thugs gunned down liberty defenders  like Boris Nemtsov and so many more freedom lovers.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record Amnesty International's deeply  troubling human rights report on Russia.                                   Russia         Russian Federation        Head of state: Vladimir Putin        Head of government: Mikhail Mishustin (replaced Dmitry       Medvedev in January)        The COVID-19 pandemic exposed chronic under-resourcing in       health care. The authorities used the pandemic as a pretext       to continue the crackdown on all dissent, including through       amendments to a vaguely worded law on ``fake news'' and       tightening restrictions on public gatherings. Peaceful       protesters, human rights defenders and civic and political       activists faced arrest and prosecution. Persecution of       Jehovah's Witnesses intensified. Torture remained endemic, as       did near total impunity for perpetrators. The right to a fair       trial was routinely violated while legal amendments resulted       in a further reduction in judicial independence. Reports of       domestic violence rose sharply during COVID-19 lockdown       measures, although the draft law on domestic violence       remained stalled in Parliament. LGBTI people continued to       face discrimination and persecution. Thousands of labour       migrants lost their jobs during the pandemic but were unable       to leave because of border closures. Evidence emerged to       corroborate allegations of war crimes by Russian forces in       Syria.                                  BACKGROUND         The economic downturn, underpinned by falling oil prices,       dwindling investment and foreign sanctions, and exacerbated       by the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a further impoverishment of       a growing proportion of the population. Discontent widened,       with a slow but steady increase in protests. The government       continually faced, and ignored, mounting allegations of       corruption at all levels. Measures announced by President       Vladimir Putin and his government, like extended fully paid       leave for all workers in response to COVID-19, failed to       address people's broader concerns.  [[Page H2727]]         The authorities introduced multiple amendments to the       Constitution, with the apparent purpose of removing legal       restrictions on President Putin's participation in future       presidential elections.        Russia maintained a strong influence on its immediate       neighbours, and its occupation of Crimea and other       territories continued.                               right to health         The COVID-19 pandemic placed further strain on the health       care system, exposing chronic under-resourcing. A shortage of       hospital beds, key protective and medical equipment and       medications, together with the delayed wages of health       workers, were frequently reported across the country.       Official and independent numbers on infection and mortality       rates varied greatly, indicating government under-reporting.      Health workers        Whistle-blowers from among health workers and other groups       faced reprisals, including disciplinary measures and       prosecution for ``fake news''.        Doctor Tatyana Revva was arbitrarily reprimanded and       threatened with dismissal after she repeatedly complained       about the shortage and inadequacy of protective equipment.       Police considered and dismissed ``fake news'' allegations       against her following a complaint from the hospital's head       doctor.      Prison conditions        Health care and sanitary provisions in penitentiary       institutions remained inadequate and further exacerbated by       the pandemic. Although the authorities implemented       restrictive and additional sanitary measures, they did not       take measures to reduce the prison population. Official       COVID-19 figures in custody were considered unreliable by       independent monitors.                             freedom of assembly         Freedom of peaceful assembly remained constrained with       further restrictions introduced in December. The rules       relating to public assemblies and single-person pickets were       further restricted in response to the pandemic, and some       regions banned them outright. Public protests were typically       small but regular, despite reprisals. There was a sharp       increase in the numbers of single picketers arrested and       prosecuted.        On 15 July, over a hundred peaceful protesters against       constitutional changes were arbitrarily arrested and at least       three severely beaten by the police in Moscow. Dozens were       heavily fined or detained for five to 14 days.        The 9 July arrest of Sergey Furgal, who in 2018 had       defeated the pro-Kremlin candidate to be elected Governor in       the Far East Khabarovsk Region, prompted weekly peaceful mass       protests in Khabarovsk as well as solidarity protests across       Russia. Unusually, tens of thousands were allowed to march       repeatedly in Khabarovsk before police made the first arrests       on 18 July. On 10 October, police dispersed the protest for       the first time, arresting at least 25 people, with at least       five later sentenced to several days in detention. The       protests in Khabarovsk were continuing at year's end.        In December, peaceful protester Konstantin Kotov was       released following his imprisonment in 2019 for ``repeated       violation'' of regulations on public assemblies. In January,       the Constitutional Court had ordered a review of his case,       and in April, the Moscow City Court reduced his sentence from       four years to 18 months. Others prosecuted for the same       offence included political activist Yulia Galyamina, who was       given a two-year conditional sentence in December, activist       Vyacheslav Egorov standing trial in Kolomna, and protester       Aleksandr Prikhodko from Khabarovsk. In December, Aleksandr       Prikhodko's case was dropped.        While police routinely used excessive and unnecessary force       against protesters, they also allowed anti-protester violence       by other groups. In Kushtau, Bashkiria, peaceful       environmental activists who opposed a local mining project       were repeatedly assaulted, with impunity, by private security       staff, occasionally operating alongside police. Late on 9       August, around 30 private security guards and around 100       masked men attacked a camp of 10 environmental activists.       Police were called but did not intervene. This triggered       further local protests which forced the closure of the mining       project in late August.                            FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION         Restrictions on freedom of expression continued. On 1       April, amendments to the so-called ``fake news'' law, first       passed in 2019, criminalized dissemination of ``knowingly       false information about circumstances posing a threat to the       lives and security of citizens and/or about the government's       actions to protect the population.'' Individuals face up to       five years' imprisonment if dissemination of information       leads to bodily harm or death, with hefty fines for the       media. Hundreds of people were fined under administrative       proceedings, and at least 37 faced criminal proceedings under       this law, many of them critical civil activists, journalists       or bloggers. At least five media outlets were prosecuted. The       newspaper Novaya Gazeta and its chief editor were fined       twice, in August and September, for publications about COVID-      19 and ordered to delete respective articles online.      Journalists        Harassment, prosecution and physical attacks against       journalists continued. On 30 June, police in Saint Petersburg       assaulted reporter David Frenkel at a polling station and       broke his arm. On 15 October, a journalist from Khabarovsk,       Sergei Plotnikov, was abducted by masked men, driven to the       woods, beaten and subjected to a mock execution. He reported       the incident to the police once released but by year's end,       he had not been informed about any investigation.        A journalist from Nizhnii Novgorod, Irina Slavina, faced       routine harassment by the authorities. On 1 October, her home       was raided and searched, and police summoned her as a witness       in a criminal case against a local activist under the       ``undesirable organizations'' law. On 2 October, she died       after self-immolating in protest in front of the regional       police headquarters.        On 6 July, a military court in Pskov convicted journalist       Svetlana Prokopieva of ``public justification of terrorism''       and fined her RUB500,000 (US$6,300) for her public comments       on repressive policies that may have motivated a 17-year-old       to blow himself up near the Federal Security Service building       in Arkhangelsk.      Internet        Censorship of the internet continued. In June, the European       Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Vladimir Kharitonov v.       Russia and three other cases ruled that internet-blocking       measures were ``excessive and arbitrary'' and violated the       right to impart and receive information. A court in Moscow       fined Google RUBl.5 million (US$18,899) in August and RUB3       million (US$40,580) in December for its search engine listing       ``dangerous content'' banned by Russian authorities. In       December, President Putin signed a law introducing sanctions       on foreign internet platforms for blocking Russian media       content. Another law passed in December introduced       imprisonment for libel committed via the internet.      Repression of dissent        Opposition activists and other dissenting voices faced       severe reprisals. As part of the politically motivated       criminal case against opposition leader Alexei Navalny's       AntiCorruption Fund, 126 bank accounts belonging to his       associates were frozen in January, followed by criminal and       civil libel cases against Alexei Navalny and others. On 20       August, Alexei Navalny was taken ill on a flight from Tomsk.       He was urgently hospitalized, and later flown to Germany       where he was diagnosed with poisoning by a military-grade       nerve agent. The Russian authorities failed to investigate       the poisoning.        Siberian shaman Aleksandr Gabyshev, who had vowed to       ``purge'' President Putin from the Kremlin, was on 12 May       confined to a psychiatric hospital after he refused to be       tested for COVID-19. He was discharged on 22 July following       criticism in Russia and abroad.        In June, political blogger Nikolay Platoshkin was placed       under house arrest on criminal charges of ``calls to mass       disturbances'' and dissemination of ``knowingly false       information'' for planning a peaceful protest against       constitutional amendments.                            human rights defenders         Harassment, prosecution, and physical attacks against human       rights defenders remained commonplace.        Activists Alexandra Koroleva, in Kaliningrad, and Semyon       Simonov, in Sochi, were charged and faced possible       imprisonment for non-payment of arbitrary and heavy fines by       their respective NGOs.        Journalist Elena Milashina and lawyer Marina Dubrovina were       assaulted by a mob in a hotel in Grozny, Chechyna, on 6       February. A formal investigation started in March but was       manifestly ineffective. Meanwhile, Chechen head Ramzan       Kadyrov issued thinly veiled death threats against Elena       Milashina, with impunity.        Lawyer Mikhail Benyash's appeal against his criminal       conviction--which could lead to disbarment--started in       October and was still ongoing at year's end.                            freedom of association         Laws on ``foreign agents'' and ``undesirable       organizations'' were actively used to smear independent NGOs,       deprive them of funding and severely penalize their members.       In December, further draconian legislative changes were       signed into law, including to extend the ``foreign agents''       provisions to NGOs staff, unregistered groups and       individuals.        In April, the education NGO Projectoria was forced to       register as a ``foreign agent'' to avoid fines while its       foreign donor, Project Harmony, was declared ``undesirable''.        In October, activist Yana Antonova from Krasnodar was       sentenced to 240 hours of forced labour for association with       an ``undesirable organization'', re-posting Open Russia-      branded materials online and taking part in single person       pickets. She was subsequently fined again under new       administration proceedings.                        freedom of religion and belief         The prosecution of Jehovah's Witnesses under ``extremism''       charges escalated, including in occupied Crimea, with a       growing number of convictions, and longer sentences. At       year's end, 362 people were under investigation or standing       trial, 39 had been convicted and six were imprisoned. Artem       Gerasimov, for example, was sentenced on appeal in June to       six years' imprisonment and a fine of RUB400,000 (US$5,144)       by the de facto Supreme Court of Crimea.                       torture and other ill-treatment         Torture and other ill-treatment remained pervasive, and the       number of perpetrators convicted was negligible. Prosecutions       were typically for ``abuse of authority'' and resulted in       lenient sentences.  [[Page H2728]]         Twelve former prison officers from Yaroslavil colony were       sentenced to up to four years and three months' imprisonment       after a leaked video showed an inmate being beaten in 2017.       Six of them were immediately released on account of time       already spent in detention. The former head and deputy head       of the colony were acquitted.                                unfair trials         Violations of the right to a fair trial remained common.       Detainees were denied meetings with their lawyers and a       number of trials continued to be closed to the public, with       the COVID-19 pandemic being often abusively used as a       justification.        In February and June respectively, seven young men from       Penza, and two from Saint Petersburg, received sentences of       up to 18 years' imprisonment under trumped-up terrorism       charges over their purported involvement with a non-existent       organization called ``Network''. Numerous allegations of       torture and other ill-treatment, and of fabrication of       evidence, were ignored.        Constitutional and legislative amendments further eroded       the right to a fair trial, including by giving the President       power to nominate the judges of the Constitutional and       Supreme Courts, and initiate the appointment of all federal       judges and dismissal of senior federal judges.      Counter-terrorism        Counterterrorism legislation was widely abused, often to       target dissent.        Journalist Abdulmumin Gadzhiev, from Dagestan, remained in       custody under fabricated charges of financing terrorism and       participation in terrorist and extremist organizations. His       trial started in November.        In occupied Crimea, allegations of membership of the       Islamist organization Hizb-ut-Tahrir (labelled as a       ``terrorist'' movement by Russia in 2003) were widely used to       imprison ethnic Crimean Tatars. In June, Crimean human rights       defender Emir-Usein Kuku lost the appeal against his 12-year       prison sentence. In September, another Crimean human rights       defender, Server Mustafayev, was sentenced to 14 years in       prison.        In September, 19 men from Ufa, Bashkira, convicted for       alleged Hiz-ut-Tahrir membership and sentenced to between 10       and 24 years, lost their appeal, with one defendant's       sentence reduced by a year.                       violence against women and girls         Proposals to introduce legislation on domestic violence       remained stalled in Parliament, while NGOs reported a sharp       increase in domestic violence following COVID-19 lockdown       measures.        In June, the ECtHR held a Polshina v. Russia that       deficiencies in the legal system related to domestic violence       violated the prohibitions of torture and discrimination. The       Court underlined Russia's consistent failure to investigate       abuse, and years-long tolerance of ``a climate which was       conducive to domestic violence''.     rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (lgbti)                                   people         LGBTI people continued to face discrimination and       persecution. Constitutional amendments redefined marriage as       a ``union between a man and woman'', reinforcing existing       limitations on same-sex couples.        LGBTI rights activist Yulia Tsvetkova was fined RUB75,000       (US$1,014) for posting online her drawings in support of       same-sex couples and faced other penalities, including       ongoing presecution for pornography relating to her body       positive drawings featuring female genitalia.                               migrants' rights         Over a third of foreign labour migrants reported having       lost work owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, and thousands were       stranded in Russia due to related border closures. In April,       a presidential decree eased work permit and residency rules       for migrants and refugees, and temporarily suspended forcible       returns of foreign and stateless individuals. Some regional       authorities ceased temporary detention of migrants, although       new decisions on forcible returns were also reported.                               unlawful attacks         Evidence including witness statements, videos, photographs       and satellite imagery of seven air strikes against medical       facilities and schools by Russian forces, and four by Syrian       or Russian forces, between May 2019 and February 2020 in       Syria, corroborated allegations of serious violations of       international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes.     Madam Speaker, a successful meeting with Putin can only  be accomplished proceeding from a position of strength.   While I am deeply concerned the administration waived Nord Stream 2  sanctions, I am pleased President Biden invited President Zelensky to a  White House visit. I am also grateful the administration announced $150  million in security assistance to Ukraine.   This week, President Biden has an opportunity to pivot from the Trump  administration's disastrous legacy that left the transatlantic  relationship in tatters. The Congress and our caucus stand ready to  work with the administration to counter Russian aggression by  increasing Ukraine's security and democracy assistance.   Onward liberty. Onward Ukraine.                            ____________________
