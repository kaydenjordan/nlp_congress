 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Protection from  Abusive Passengers Act, a bill that is aimed at eliminating the rash of  violence and abuse that is occurring on commercial flights across the  country. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Representative  Eric Swalwell of California, who is introducing companion legislation  in the other body. The goal of our bill is to send a clear signal that  individuals who engage in serious abusive or violent behavior on an  aircraft or at an airport security checkpoint will be banned from  flying.   Since 2020, we have seen an extraordinary increase in the number of  cases of violence and abuse against crewmembers and airline passengers.  In 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration received 5,981 reports of  ``unruly passengers.'' Those complaints led to 1,124 investigations,  nearly the same number of investigations as the previous 10 years  combined. From those investigations, the Federal Aviation  Administration, FAA, has initiated 350 enforcement actions and proposed  $5 million in fines. In February, it was widely reported that the FAA  had referred 80 cases to the FBI for criminal investigation. Clearly,  these are not minor infractions. Here some recent examples:   In December 2021, the FAA proposed a record $52,500 fine against a  passenger who tried to open the cockpit door on a Delta flight from  Honolulu to Seattle, struck a flight attendant twice, and threatened  him.   The FAA also proposed a $45,000 fine against a passenger ``for  throwing objects, including his carry-on luggage, at other passengers;  refusing to stay seated; lying on the floor in the aisle, refusing to  get up, and then grabbing a flight attendant by the ankles and putting  his head up her skirt.''   It proposed a $30,000 fine against a passenger on a Jan. 3, 2021,  flight from Atlanta for ``allegedly interfering with the flight  attendants' deplaning procedures upon arrival. He attempted to gain  entry to the flight deck by physically assaulting two flight  attendants, threatening to kill one of them, and demanding them to open  the door.''   Last December, a passenger on Southwest Airlines pleaded guilty to  punching a flight attendant in the face multiple times in a May 2021  incident in Sacramento. According to prosecutors, the flight attendant  was taken to a hospital with injuries that included a swollen eye, a  bruised arm, and a cut under her eye that had to be stitched. She also  had three chipped teeth, two of which: had to be replaced with crowns.   Such actions in any setting would be deplorable and reprehensible,  but on an airplane, such behavior can also represent a real threat to  all passengers. Clearly, the existing regime of civil and criminal  penalties has not been enough to deter the upsurge in cases. We need to  send a signal that such types of behavior will not be tolerated.   The Protection from Abusive Passengers Act would require the  Transportation Security Administration, TSA, to create and manage a  program which bars passengers who are fined or convicted of serious  physical violence and abuse from flying. Transparency and notice will  be provided to banned individuals, including guidelines for removal.  The bill would also permanently ban abusive passengers from  participating in the TSA PreCheck or Customs' Global Entry programs.   The bill provides appropriate fairness and due process by ensuring  that only  [[Page S2043]]  individuals who have been assessed a civil or criminal penalty for  abusive and violent behavior will be included on the list of banned  fliers. The bill also requires the TSA to explain how it will maintain  its list of banned fliers, provide an explanation of how long the  individual may be barred from flying based on the severity of the  offense, and provide how the individual can seek to be removed from the  list of banned fliers.   I believe this bill strikes the appropriate balance to assure  fairness and transparency while sending a strong signal that violent  and abusive behavior will not be tolerated. I am pleased that the bill  is supported by both labor and the airlines, including American  Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines, the Association of Flight  Attendants-CWA, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants,  Transport Workers Union of America, and the Transportation Trades  Department of the AFL-CIO. I hope that my colleagues will join me in  supporting this important bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Protection from  Abusive Passengers Act, a bill that is aimed at eliminating the rash of  violence and abuse that is occurring on commercial flights across the  country.
