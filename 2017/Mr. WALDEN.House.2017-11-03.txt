The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) and the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a very, very important  public health bill, H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. This  legislation funds a 5-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance  Program, known as CHIP, along with a 2-year extension of community  health centers and numerous other critically important public health  programs.   This bill will deliver quality healthcare and peace of mind to  millions of Americans. The patients and families helped by this  legislation are our neighbors and our friends. More than 8 million  children receive CHIP-funded coverage, and more than 25 million  patients are served by our community health centers and other important  programs.   This 5-year funding of CHIP marks one of the longest extensions of  the program since it was created 20 years ago. The policy we are  considering mirrors the bipartisan policy that has been introduced and  voted out of our sister  [[Page H8457]]  committee in the United States Senate.   Funding for these important programs expired September 30. The  committee worked on a bipartisan basis well before this deadline to try  and reach a bipartisan agreement on a range of policies to offset the  costs of this very critically important funding extension.   Three times, at the request of the Democrats, we delayed committee  action--three times. We tried to find offsets that were agreeable as we  have always been able to do before. Unfortunately, that was not the  case this time. These delays meant Congress went past the deadline of  September 30.   While States still have rollover CHIP funds available and the next  wave of community health center funds won't go out until next year, we  cannot wait any longer. Patients cannot wait any longer. Patients need  care, these critical programs need funding, and we must move forward.   In my district alone, there are 12 federally qualified health center  organizations, with 63 delivery sites. They leverage $41 million in  Federal money in order to serve more than 240,000 patients in Oregon's  Second District. These health centers--and I have visited many of  them--are prevention and public health in action, often serving as the  main provider of care for people for hundreds of miles around.   We are also extending the National Health Service Corps and the  Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program. Now, Mr.  Speaker, these are really important workforce programs that place  qualified providers into some of the most underserved areas of our  country.   In addition to community health centers and the workforce programs,  this bill extends the funding for the Special Diabetes Program and the  Family-to-Family Health Information centers, the Personal  Responsibility Program, and the Youth Empowerment Program. These  locally based, patient-centered organizations provide comprehensive  services to those most in need.   Moreover, this legislation eliminates 2 years of the across-the-board  cuts to Medicaid allotments called for under the Affordable Care Act,  ObamaCare. We delay those cuts for disproportionate share hospitals for  2 years. Medicaid DSH funding represents an important component of many  State Medicaid programs and is particularly relied upon by many States  to help provide additional resources to key safety net providers.   Now, while this relief is only temporary and does not address the  larger structural challenges under ObamaCare, it would give Congress  time to explore what budget-neutral approaches there might be to  allocate existing DSH dollars on a more equitable and fair basis. In my  State alone of Oregon, hospitals have told me this relief in this bill,  just for them, represents $6.8 million over the next 2 years that they  can use to help low-income people get access to hospital care.   Now, in paying for this package--and this is the area where we have  the most disagreement with the Democrats--we have taken a fiscally  responsible approach, like using existing funding streams for  prevention and public health efforts, ensuring high-dollar lottery  winners are removed from the Medicaid program so its limited resources  can be prioritized for the most vulnerable, and stopping individuals on  the Affordable Care Act's exchanges from gaming the system.   The bill also asks Medicare's wealthiest 1 percent, people who are  retired and making $40,000 a month--not a year, a month--to pay about  $135 more for their Medicare just on parts B and D that is already  subsidized by 75 percent, just a little more so we can fund children's  health insurance for 5 years.   While it was not ultimately possible, unfortunately, to reach  consensus on some of the policies to offset the new funding in this  bill, there is broad bipartisan agreement on the core policies  contained in this legislation, and I believe there is bipartisan  support for many of the reasonable and fiscally responsible offsets  contained in H.R. 3922.   Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation. This is long-overdue  legislation. It reflects the good work done by your House Energy and  Commerce Committee, and I urge my colleagues to put politics aside  today and ensure these vital programs get the funding extensions they  need. We are over the deadline. It is time to act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I call on my next person to say  something here, there are 17,000 children in Mr. Pallone's district and  14 health centers that, if he votes ``no,'' he will be voting against.   By the way, the offset he recommended, people who are watching this  need to know, would violate statute and it would be a PAYGO violation.  That is why it was not acceptable.   See, this is the problem we faced. We delayed three times at their  request only to be offered up a pay-for that violates statute and  violates our PAYGO rules. We could not accept that. We have to operate  within the law like everyone else in America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  respond.   Mr. Speaker, my friend, and she is my friend from California,  obviously was not aware of the fact that it was her party, her leader,  who asked us on three occasions to delay bringing this to the floor,  including you could look at the CQ article from October 23 where Mr.  Pallone says he hopes it doesn't come to the floor.   This was a bipartisan agreement not to bring it until we could try to  work these things out. We were all trying to figure out how to get this  done.   When it comes to Medicare, remember, we are talking about people  making $40,000 a month paying $135 a month more. We can fully fund  children's health insurance for millions of children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the conference chairwoman.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  tremendous leadership on the reauthorization of CHIP, including many  vital public health programs.   CHIP provides healthcare coverage for some 9 million children--more  than a million in Washington State. We all need to remember how  important this program is for the health of some of the most  vulnerable.   Some States, like mine, are expecting to run out of CHIP funding  soon. It is crucial that we move forward now.   This bill also reauthorizes the Teaching Health Center Graduate  Medical Education program, providing funding for 2 years, with a robust  increase. This not only preserves current programs like the Spokane  Teaching Health Center, but it also provides funding for the creation  of new programs in communities that need them.   Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a real difference to those who need  healthcare, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out there are about 50,000  kids that Mr. Green may be voting against today in the Houston area if  this goes down and we can't get this over to the Senate and work it out  with them. Twice he has voted to cut the Prevention Fund and use it for  other purposes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson), a very important member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), an incredible advocate for children and  healthcare in America.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before I call on my next colleague, I just want to point out that, in  Ms. Schakowsky's district, all we are talking about here is seniors  making $41,000 a month--a month--would pay an extra 135 bucks so we can  fully fund children's health insurance, community health centers. All  these programs in here are funded. We use the Prevention Fund, which is  not allocated out in the out-years. It is just a pot of money you can  use for prevention and wellness. We actually use that to fund this as  well.   This is why we have been unable to reach agreement with the  Democrats. It is sad they have made this partisan.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Speaker, there they go again: delay, delay, delay;  and vote against kids, vote against their hospitals, and vote against  their doctors. That is why we couldn't get agreement.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentleman's sincerity. We work well together on lots  of issues. He has also voted to use this Prevention Fund for other  purposes in the past, as have I.   We don't touch the Prevention Fund for 2018, and there is $400  million left in 2019, and billions thereafter for the very important  programs the gentleman has articulated. We don't use all the money. We  leave money behind for these other purposes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do think it is important to note that my  friend, and he is my friend from New Jersey, has twice voted to use  this Prevention Fund for other purposes, including the 2012 middle  class tax cut.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton).   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from  Michigan, I would just point out that when Democrats joined Republicans  in voting for the 2012 middle class tax cut, we used $6.3 billion out  of the Prevention Fund they now say they never touched, yet they have.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, once again, my dear friend from California  has twice voted to use these Prevention Funds for other things. By the  way, when we use them for community health centers, they are doing this  work on the ground, helping people with opioid addictions and other  healthcare issues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, sabotaging the Affordable Care Act; what we are doing is  putting off planned cuts to our hospitals that take care of low-income  people that those cuts called for under the Affordable Care Act. We are  putting those off so they can serve these low-income people. That, in  their language, is sabotaging the Affordable Care Act.   On the issue of using the Prevention Fund, my friend from California  who just spoke, has twice voted to use the Prevention Fund, including  for tax cuts in 2012 and for the 21st Century Cures Act last year. Now  we are using it for community health centers and children's health  insurance programs. This is an appropriate use of a fund that gets  replenished by law every year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto  Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), whose constituents and herself have  suffered such damage, such destruction as a result of the hurricanes.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act.   I wanted to begin by first thanking Chairman Walden and Dr. Burgess  for their leadership in moving forward this critically needed  legislation. I am particularly thankful for those in the leadership and  all of my colleagues in the Energy and Commerce Committee for including  a $1 billion allocation to temporarily address Puerto Rico's impending  ObamaCare-created medical cliff, while also providing another year of  the disproportionate share hospital relief.   To put things in perspective, when we arrived in this Congress during  January of this year, more than 1 million Puerto Ricans were facing the  imminent possibility of losing their healthcare coverage due to a  funding shortfall resulting from ObamaCare's disparate application to  the island.   We moved quickly during the appropriations bill, and they allocated  $295 million to improve that situation. In this bill, we are allocating  $1 billion for Puerto Rico's Medicaid program. This is an important  step, but we still need to secure a permanent and equitable solution to  Puerto Rico's longstanding Medicaid inequalities, and that means  changing the FMAP for the island.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   How cynical what we just heard. How cynical.   Ms. Velazquez has 43,000 children in CHIP, $2 billion in DSH cuts in  her district, 43 health centers, and she is going to vote against $1  billion for the citizens of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands because  that is not enough.   Yes, we need to do more, so her answer is vote ``no'' today and deny  $1 billion.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Wow. We are fully funding CHIP for 5 years. We are fully funding our  community health centers for 2 years. We are taking care of programs  for our citizens who have diabetes. And the pay-for that they are  objecting to most is we are asking the wealthiest seniors in America,  those making $40,000 a month, to pay $135 more for their Medicare so we  can do this work that is so important.   How ironic. How cynical. This is a pay-for that has been used before  for other programs. President Obama himself suggested in a budget that,  instead of the top earners, the $480,000 a year, a couple making over  $800,000 a year pay a little more as we do here, take it all the way  down to $80,000 a year.   We didn't do that. We just said, if you are making $480,000 a year,  roughly $40,000 a month, you will pay $135 more. They will not vote for  that cut to fund children's healthcare. We will.   That is what is going on here. This is where we could never get them  off dead center to make this bipartisan. It is a tragedy this is not a  bipartisan bill as it always has been. I, three times, delayed moving  this forward, including crossing the deadline of September 30, to try  to find common ground that would be bipartisan, and we could never get  there because they would never yield in a way where we could find  common ground.   So we must go to the Senate from here and we must get our work done  for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I get a time count, please, on how much  each side has remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 45 seconds  remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 4\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I will just point out that the gentleman who  just spoke has voted to cut the Prevention Fund before to use it for  other purposes.  [[Page H8464]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let's get this back where it belongs. We are  fully funding the Children's Health Insurance Program for 5 years and  community health centers for 2 years. The only sabotage of the  Affordable Care Act going on here today is stopping cuts for hospitals  in our districts that serve low-income people that would otherwise  occur under the Affordable Care Act. We do that for 2 years.   The Democrats don't think seniors making $40,000 a month--$40,000 a  month--should pay an extra $135 for their part B and part D Medicare so  we can take care of our community health centers and children who need  health insurance.   We delayed this bill coming to the floor at a bipartisan request to  find a bipartisan solution that was elusive, sadly. We have never had  this problem before, but we have it today. We must act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Community  Health and Medical Professionals Improve Our Nation (CHAMPION) Act of  2017 (H.R. 3922).   While I support reauthorizing funding for the Children's Health  Insurance Program (CHIP), the Federally Qualified Health Centers  (FQHCs), and various other important public health programs, I oppose  this bill because it cuts funding for public health, puts families at  risk of losing their health insurance, and weakens Medicare.   The health of children and expecting and new mothers is something  that we can all agree on. In my home state of Minnesota, CHIP funding  is essential for providing healthcare to 125,000 low income children  and 1,700 expecting and new mothers. Minnesota also depends on FQHC  funding with over 190,000 people receiving care from one of the more  than 70 community health centers in my state last year.   Unfortunately, House Republicans have turned these bipartisan issues  into an opportunity to divide us. The offsets included in this  legislation are unacceptable to me and to Minnesota families.   Once again, Republicans are using this legislation as yet another  opportunity to weaken the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by cutting $6.35  billion from the Prevention and Public Health Fund over the next ten  years. This fund, created by the ACA, directly funds our nation's  prevention, preparedness, and response capabilities.   If these Republican cuts become law, the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention would be forced to provide less funding to cities,  states, and tribes to rapidly address public health crises. This money  includes funding for vaccines, flu prevention, and addressing the  opioid epidemic. When my home state of Minnesota had to recently deal  with a serious outbreak of measles, our community health officials  utilized these federal resources to rapidly contain the spread of  disease. Simply put, this irresponsible offset leaves American  communities more vulnerable to, and unprepared for, outbreaks of  disease.   In addition, this bill takes aim at yet another ACA provision by  shortening the 90-day grace period for individuals to pay premiums  before their insurer can terminate their coverage. The current grace  period allows low and moderate income families experiencing temporary  financial difficulties to remain covered by their health insurance.  Shortening this grace period from 90 days to 30 days would cause nearly  700,000 Americans to lose their health care and bars them from  purchasing health insurance until the next season.   I am also concerned by the provision that introduces means testing to  Medicare. A key strength of Medicare is its universal nature. All  Americans pay into Medicare and all Americans should receive at least  some benefit from it. This provision breaks that guarantee and sets a  dangerous precedent for the future. I am also concerned that it could  weaken the Medicare risk pool and increase costs for the taxpayer.   Mr. Speaker, even the Majority concedes that this bill is unlikely to  pass the Senate due to the partisan nature of its provisions.  Republicans need to stop playing games and reauthorize these programs  before Minnesota faces a critical December 1 deadline to continue  coverage for children and expecting mothers.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure and instead to work  together to fund CHIP and community health centers.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong opposition to the bill being considered on the floor today, H.R.  3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. Unfortunately, this deceitfully  named measure to reauthorize the Children's Health  [[Page H8465]]  Insurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers (CHCs) will  reauthorize these programs through FY19--but does so by kicking  thousands of Americans off private insurance.   Like many of my colleagues, I strongly support CHIP, CHCs, and other  critical public health initiatives. However, the bill in its current  form was drafted as yet another attempt by Republicans to undermine the  Affordable Care Act in order to justify its repeal. The bill is  misguided in its attempt to cut $6.35 billion over ten years from the  Prevention and Public Health Fund in order to fund the extension.   H.R. 3922 also reduces grace periods from 90 to 30 days, putting more  than 688,000 low- and moderate-income individuals at risk of losing  their state Marketplace coverage for simply paying their premiums in  the second of third month of the existing grace period. This grace  period is essential to low-income households that are barely making  ends meet. By reducing the current grace period, Republicans are  exposing thousands of families to risk due to a lack of health  coverage. It is frankly disgraceful that we would even consider  undermining these important public health programs in such a manner.   Mr. Speaker, CHIP, CHCs, the National Health Service Corps, and other  programs funded under this measure are vitally important to our nation  and the public health of our citizens. As the first registered nurse  elected to Congress, I understand the critical need for proper long- term funding of our public health centers and programs. However, these  cuts to the Prevention and Public Health Fund represent a purely  political move by the GOP to undermine the ACA. I oppose this  controversial offset, not my support for health centers across America.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure so that we can find offsets  driven by policy, not politics, in order to sufficiently fund our  health centers and promote public health for all.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on House consideration  of H.R. 3922, Championing Healthy Kids Act, which would reauthorize the  State Children Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP).   As the founder and chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am  well aware of the work that went into creating this important program.   I joined with members of the bipartisan Children's Caucus to champion  the worthy goals of S-CHIP.   Congress and President Clinton responded to the needs of 10 million  children in the United States who lacked health insurance, S-CHIP was  created in 1997 to insure children in families with too much income to  qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford private insurance.   I voted for the S-CHIP program when it came to the floor for a vote  as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.   I worked tirelessly along with other members of the House to make  sure the S-CHIP program was created.   I voted to extend the life of the program when Congress reauthorized  S-CHIP in 2009 under the Children's Health Insurance Program  Reauthorization Act and again when it became part of the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.   The program represented a grand bargain that allowed Democrats and  Republicans to agree that healthcare for the nation's children was a  laudable and achievable goal.   H.R. 3922, Championing Healthy Kids Act, is not a reauthorization of  the S-CHIP program it is political theater at its worse.   The leadership of the House is betraying all that this body has done  for 20 years to sustain and improve S-CHIP.   The bill before the House is political theater and not real  legislating--a partisan attack against Medicare that has no place in a  real bill about healthcare for children.   I am a strong supporter of S-CHIP and would vote for that program any  day it is brought to the House Floor.   This imposter S-CHIP bill is not worthy to be considered by this  body.   The motion to recommit this bill should be supported so that the  offensive offsets could be removed so that the bill can be brought back  to the full House for consideration.   After weeks of negotiations to reauthorize the Children's Health  Insurance Program (CHIP), Community Health Centers (CHCs) and other  important public health programs, which have always been bipartisan  priorities, House Republicans have decided to bring a partisan bill to  the Floor.   This bill will only further delay the reauthorization of these  programs, many of which expired on September 30th.   The bill passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee at the  beginning of October with no Democratic support.   Democrats in Committee instead offered a package that invests in our  children and safety net providers, and does not sacrifice the nation's  health.   Democrats have made it clear for weeks that the pay-fors in this bill  are problematic.   Rather than working toward a bipartisan agreement, Republicans  revised their bill to include even steeper cuts to public health  programs, in addition to undermining the Affordable Care Act (ACA).   The bill includes woefully inadequate funding for Medicaid programs  in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are facing  unprecedented demands on their health care systems following the  devastation caused by Hurricane Maria.   Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello last week requested $1.6  billion annually to deal with the state's underfunded Medicaid program  that is expected to be further strained by the short- and long-term  health implications of the natural disaster.   The approximately $1 billion over two years in Puerto Rico Medicaid  funding included in the Republican bill is not only insufficient, but  it would also require Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to match  those dollars at a time of increased demand and revenue collapse in  both territories, exacerbating delays in recovery.   This bill also seeks to cut $6.35 billion to the Prevention and  Public Health Fund (PPHF).   The Prevention Fund was created by the ACA to make national  investments in prevention and public health, to improve health  outcomes, to enhance health care quality, and reduce health care costs.   It has been used to increase awareness of and access to preventive  health services, such as cancer screenings, tobacco cessation and  childhood vaccines--as well as concentrating on preventing chronic  disease to help more Americans stay healthy.   Cutting these funds will have a devastating impact on public health  initiatives at the federal, state and local levels.   Republicans are also shortening the grace period for missed premium  payments from ninety days to thirty, which would result in up to  688,000 people losing health coverage.   House Republicans are insisting that in order to provide some of our  most vulnerable Americans with coverage, it must be paid for by  cancelling the health insurance of other Americans after a single  payment is missed.   While Republicans are pushing for tax cuts for the wealthy that  explode the deficit, when it comes to health coverage for children and  low-income Americans, Republicans are insisting that it be paid for at  the cost of weakening our health care system and pushing other  Americans off health insurance.   States have begun to use emergency funding, cut benefits, and will  soon begin sending disenrollment notices to thousands of families if  CHIP is not reauthorized.   Republicans' decision to advance a partisan bill rather than a  compromise has very real consequences for families across the country.   In 2016, 35,626,329 children in the United States had healthcare  coverage under S-CHIP or the Medicaid Child Program.   In 2016, although the state of Texas had 38 percent of our children  covered under the S-CHIP program, there were still 9.2 percent children  without health insurance coverage.   Paying for this package by weakening health care in America:   Shortening the grace period for missed premium payments will cause up  to 688,000 Americans to lose their health coverage.   Cutting $6.35 billion from the Prevention Fund will have a  devastating impact on public health initiatives at the federal, state  and local levels.   Requiring Medicare means testing of 100 percent for beneficiaries  making over $500,000. This provision will take away a benefit American  seniors have paid into their entire lives.   These offsets are even more egregious since they are being considered  just one week after House Republicans began the process of passing tax  cuts for the wealthy that is not offset and will add $1.5 trillion to  the deficit.   Instead of reauthorizing these programs, House Republicans wasted  time attempting to repeal the ACA.   There are better ways to pay for S-CHIP that do not put the guarantee  of Medicare at risk our nation's seniors.   1. Reduce tax expenditures for the top 1 percent of income-earners-- Our current tax code imposes higher tax rates on income earned through  hard work while providing preferential treatment to unearned financial  gains and allowing billions of dollars of stock profits and other  capital gains to pass tax-free to heirs of multi-million-dollar  fortunes. Reducing the benefit of these tax expenditures would help  rebalance the tax code so that it stops favoring wealth over work. CBO  has determined that 17 percent of the benefits of major ``tax  expenditures'' go to households in the top one percent of income  earners at a cost of more than $1.5 trillion over ten years. We could  reduce this benefit to pay for needed national priorities.   2. Cancel the tax break for corporate jets--Repeal tax breaks such as  those for corporate jets, which are allowed a faster depreciation  [[Page H8466]]  schedule than passenger and freight aircraft. Based on past Joint  Committee on Taxation estimates, repealing the tax break on corporate  jets alone would raise $3 billion over ten years.   3. Restrict deductions for egregious CEO bonuses when employees don't  get a raise--Repeal the exemption to the $1 million limit on  compensation for CEOs and other specified corporate employees that a  publicly traded corporation can deduct as a business expense, unless  their workers are getting paycheck increases that reflect increases in  worker productivity and the cost of living. Based on Joint Committee on  Taxation estimates, just limiting the deductibility of excessive CEO  compensation would raise $12 billion over ten years.   4. Close loopholes in the U.S. international corporate tax system  that encourage companies to invert, and ship jobs and profits  overseas--Prevent U.S. companies from ``inverting'' and pretending that  they are based in other countries purely to reduce their taxes. Enact  proposals that would limit the ability of corporations to reap  substantial tax benefits by shifting operations, capital, intellectual  property, and jobs overseas for tax purposes or to shelter their  profits from U.S. taxation in foreign tax havens. Based on estimates of  past proposals, over $500 billion over ten years could be raised under  such proposals.   5. Close the ``carried interest'' loophole taxing hedge fund  managers' compensation at lower capital gains rates--End the loophole  which allows certain investment managers at hedge funds and private  equity firms to pay capital gains tax rates (up to a maximum of just 20  percent) on income received as compensation for services they provided,  rather than ordinary income tax rates up to 39.6 percent that all other  working Americans pay on the compensation they receive for their labor.  Past estimates show closing this loophole would raise over $19 billion  over ten years.   States have begun to use emergency funding, cut benefits, and will  soon begin sending disenrollment notices to thousands of families if  CHIP is not reauthorized.   It is time for the House Leadership to stop playing politics with  health insurance coverage for our nation's most vulnerable children and  pass a clean S-CHIP bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 601, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit     Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the  motion to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's point of order is reserved.   Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from South Carolina is recognized  for 5 minutes in support of his motion.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of  order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of a point of order is  withdrawn.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of  order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of a point of order is  withdrawn.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion  to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for  5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, today, Members of this House can deliver  peace of mind to parents of over 8 million low-income children who  depend on the Children's Health Insurance Program. The House can extend  funding for important public health programs, including resources for  the critical work community health centers do in our communities and in  my district and yours. This bill will help deliver much-needed  healthcare resources to our friends and fellow citizens in the Virgin  Islands and in Puerto Rico.   Yet we have heard complaints about how this package is paid for.  Well, let us be clear how this bill funds healthcare for kids and  important public health priorities like community health centers.   In paying for this package, we have taken a fiscally responsible and  reasonable approach. Our bill funds kids' healthcare by allowing States  to dis-enroll lottery winners--these are winners making $80,000 or  above--from the low-income Medicaid program. We ensure high-dollar  lottery winners are removed from the Medicaid program so that those  resources can go to Medicaid-eligible, low-income people in our  districts.   Our bill directs funding from the Prevention and Public Health Fund  to finance important prevention and public  [[Page H8473]]  health needs, like funding the National Health Service Corps, Teaching  Health Center Graduate Medical Education, Family-to-Family Health  Information Centers, and community health centers. If these are not  important programs for prevention, wellness, and public health, I don't  know what are.   Our bill before us today, which I predict will have bipartisan  support, directs funds from the Prevention Fund for important public  health priorities that have long had bipartisan support. We are using a  bipartisan fund to pay for bipartisan healthcare support for health and  wellness, which was its intent from the beginning.   Most recently, nearly every House Republican and Democrat supported  this idea just a year ago. Just a year ago, when we passed the 21st  Century Cures Act, we said: Here is a health and wellness fund and a  Prevention Fund that makes sense for cures, make sense for, we believe  today, our community health centers, and for Children's Health  Insurance.   Our bill also asks the wealthiest among us, the 1 percent of  beneficiaries, those making $40,000 a month, over half-a-million  dollars a year--that is an individual--to pay a little more to help  fund health insurance for low-income children. I think they are willing  to do that, and I think we should be as well.   On multiple budgets, President Obama said this is a reasonable way to  pay for other priorities. That was bipartisan. It is bipartisan today.   These reasonable pay-fors have been opposed by some in the Democratic  leadership. Some House Democrats want to use children's healthcare and  funding for community health centers as a bargaining chip for a bigger  end-of-the-year goulash, yet kids and our frontline providers can't  wait any longer.   In just a few weeks, States like Minnesota run out of funding for the  Children's Health Insurance Program. At the request of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, we have agreed to postpone it time and  again, but time has run out. The negotiations did not end as we all  hoped they would.   But we can't wait any longer. It is time for this House to deliver  peace of mind to the families that rely on these critical programs. It  is time to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to  recommit and to approve the underlying bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and mentor, the  gentleman from South Carolina, for his kind words and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we deal with important issues every day in this House,  but there are few issues as meaningful to so many lives as the  Children's Health Insurance Program.   At this time the divisions in this House mimic those in our nation.   And on many issues, those divisions can be challenging to bridge.   One of my top priorities as a new Member of this body is to help  bridge those divides, instead of widening them.   I hope that my colleagues--both Democrats and Republicans--will tell  me if I fall short on that commitment.   One of the few things that does not divide us is the importance of  children's healthcare and the CHIP program.   When it was signed into law 20 years ago, this landmark legislation  meant so much to me.   First, as a mother of then 9-year-old, Alyssa, and 11-year-old, Alex  I deeply understood the fear a parent could feel with a sick child and  no insurance.   But also because at that time, I was the Deputy Secretary of Health &  Social Services for Delaware.   And I had the honor of helping implement the law and seeing thousands  of children who had never had healthcare get the coverage they  deserved.   From the 600,000 children across the nation who were the program's  first enrollees in 1998 to the nearly 9,000,000 children in 2016.   Kids across this country owe their yearly check-ups, their  immunizations, and their doctor's office lollipops to this program.   And in Delaware we owe a big debt to the CHIP program, Medicaid, and  the Affordable Care Act.   Today, 97 percent of Delaware's children obtain medical coverage  because of these programs.   In 1997, the legislation passed in a Republican Congress with a  Democratic President, highlighting how this truly was not a partisan  issue.   That's why it's disappointing to me that we aren't moving forward on  renewing the Children's Health Insurance Program with that same  reasonable, bipartisan approach.   The bill before us today forces us to choose between healthcare for  children and healthcare for other vulnerable populations.   Choosing between prevention and healthcare for kids is unacceptable-- particularly in a nation as great as ours.   I have spoken to many of you over the past 10 months.   I know that the people I have met in both political parties know--in  their hearts--that we should not play games with the healthcare of our  children.   I know that it may seem hard to oppose one's party leadership. But  today I ask you to consider whether this is one of those rare times . .  . those rare subjects . . .   Where we can come together to stand up for the those in need . . .   And to stand up for a clean reauthorization of the Children's Health  Insurance Program.   That's what our motion to recommit does.   Let's step back and consider whether we can use our common desire to  deliver healthcare to our children, as a moment to surprise the public  . . .   To set a new tone for how we deal with one another . . . and how we  address issues on which both of our parties fundamentally agree.   Please join with me on this vote to put our children first--they're  watching.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
