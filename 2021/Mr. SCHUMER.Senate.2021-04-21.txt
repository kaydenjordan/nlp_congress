 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 60; that the nomination be confirmed; that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening or debate; that no further motions be in order to the  nomination; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; and that the Senate resume legislative section.    Mr. President, yesterday, a jury of former police  officer Derek Chauvin's peers determined that he was guilty of  murdering George Floyd, confirming what was plain to the millions of  Americans who watched his murder on video--9\1/2\ excruciating minutes  that documented the senseless and unnecessary loss of one man's life in  broad daylight.   Our country was forever changed by the horrendous video of Derek  Chauvin killing Mr. Floyd. His searing final words, screaming for air,  calling for his mother, are etched in our memory. This guilty verdict  serves as an official proclamation of what so many of us have known for  nearly a year: George Floyd was murdered by an officer who was sworn to  protect and to serve but who, obviously, didn't.   The brutality of George Floyd's murder, yet another in a seemingly  endless string of tragedies, sparked a summer of protest unlike any we  have seen in American history, elevating a long-building movement for  more justice in policing. Americans of every age, color, and creed took  to the streets in peaceful protest--from Minneapolis to Maine and Los  Angeles to Atlanta, and including in my own home city of New York. A  community of global citizens would soon join them in protest. In  foreign capitals--from Rome, Paris, and London to Amsterdam, Berlin,  and Mexico City--the name George Floyd would echo through the public  square. This was not only a fight for justice but a fight against the  mistreatment, discrimination, and outright bigotry that Black men and  women suffer at the hands of State power, not just here in America but  around the globe.   The death of George Floyd provoked such a reaction because folks in  those  [[Page S2090]]  communities knew a George Floyd of their own. Names of friends and  colleagues who were tragically killed or suffered the brutal sting of  racism sprang to their tongues. They still do.   Philando Castile, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Trayvon Martin, Eric  Garner, Daniel Prude, Sandra Bland--each circumstance different, the  underlying tragedy much the same. Their names, and countless others,  serve as a reminder that a single verdict in a single trial will never  be enough.   It wasn't long ago that excessive force by police was never caught on  iPhones or body cameras. It was out of sight and often beyond the reach  of the law, which gave almost reflexive deference to police officers  who were brought to trial, if they were ever brought to trial.   So this was an important event for the American justice system. Not  only were the events concerning George Floyd caught on camera, but the  offending officer was tried and convicted in a court of law. Let it  serve as the proper deterrent--a deterrent that should have existed  long ago--to the kind of egregious misconduct that led to George  Floyd's death.   However, and most certainly, we should not mistake a guilty verdict  in this case as evidence that the persistent problem of police  misconduct has been solved or that the divide between law enforcement  and so many of the communities they serve has been bridged. It has not.   We must remain diligent in our efforts to bring meaningful change to  police departments across the country, to reform practices and  training, and the legal protections that grant too great a shield to  police officers guilty of misconduct.   We also must remain diligent in striving to root out the racial bias  in our society: in our healthcare system, in jobs, in housing, in the  economy, in the boardroom and at the ballot box, on our streets, and in  our schools.   This goes way beyond party or political faction. Racism strikes at  the very core of this country. Justice--true justice--will not come  until we finally banish the ancient poison of racism from the American  soul.   The Senate will continue that work as we strive to ensure that George  Floyd's tragic death will not be in vain. We will not rest until the  Senate passes strong legislation to end this systemic bias in law  enforcement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a related subject, part of that  effort, though modest, is installing committed, experienced,  compassionate civil rights leaders in positions of power in the Justice  Department, our Nation's top law enforcement Agency. It just so happens  that, today, the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Ms. Vanita  Gupta to be the next Associate Attorney General.   Not only is Ms. Gupta the first woman of color to ever be nominated  to the position, she is the first civil rights attorney ever to be  nominated to the position--the third ranking official in the Justice  Department. That is shocking, really. We never have had a former civil  rights attorney serving in such a position of prominence at the Justice  Department. In that sense alone, Ms. Gupta would bring a long overdue  perspective to our Federal law enforcement Agency.   Just to give you a sense of Ms. Gupta's commitment to civil rights  and racial equity, in her very first case after law school, she won the  release of several African Americans who had been wrongly convicted by  all-White juries in Texas. Her clients later won a full pardon from  Texas Governor Rick Perry.   At a time when our country needs to make strides against racial  injustice, how can we not install one of the Nation's top civil rights  lawyers at the Department of Justice? How can our colleagues not rise  to the occasion--our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and  vote for her? I am so, so troubled by the fact that they are virtually  unanimously against such a fine person who is needed so much at this  time.   Yes, but, unfortunately, Ms. Gupta might be the first nominee in this  Congress where the vote falls entirely down on party lines. I hope it  doesn't come to that. The effort to elevate highly qualified civil  rights attorneys like Ms. Gupta should be bipartisan.   I urge my colleagues--all of them, and particularly my friends on the  other side of the aisle--to vote in favor of Ms. Gupta's nomination  today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different matter here, for nearly a  century, America's national security and economic security has been  grounded in our scientific and technological superiority, often  supported by smart investments by the Federal Government. But in recent  years, countries like China have closed the gap with the United States.  If we fail to respond, they will overtake us, with drastic consequences  for our workers, businesses, allies, and partners around the world.   It is long past time for the United States to make the next wave of  investments to fix dangerous weak spots in our economy and preserve our  place as the world leader in science and technology, which then leads  to millions of good-paying jobs here in this country.   So, today, I am proud to join with my friend the Republican Senator  from Indiana, Senator Young, and several of my colleagues from both  sides to reintroduce the Endless Frontier Act. It is a big, bold, and  bipartisan initiative to propel American science and technology into  the 21st century. Let me stress that last point. This bill is  bipartisan.   As Senator Young and I have worked on the bill over the past several  months, several Senators from both sides have been added as original  cosponsors: six Democrats and six Republicans. That is because there is  a bipartisan consensus that the United States must invest in the  technologies of the future to outcompete China. Whichever nation  develops new technologies first, be they democratic or authoritarian,  will set the terms for their use. The stakes for personal privacy and  personal liberties, as well as for national security, economic  security, and minority rights around the globe, are simply enormous.   So at the center of this legislation is a $100 billion investment in  research, commercialization, and workforce training in the kinds of  technology that will play an outsized role in the future-- semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and 5G, to  name a few.   Another $10 billion would foster the development of technological  hubs around the country. We want to see Silicon Valleys across the  country, from my home State of New York and upstate to communities in  the South, to the Midwest, to other places that rarely get the  attention they merit despite the potential of their workforces, their  institutions, and their links to the global economy.   Technological growth in jobs should not be limited to a few centers  in America, and this bill attempts to spread it to other communities as  well. It will also strengthen the critical supply chains in the United  States and with global allies and partners. The Endless Frontier Act is  exactly what we need to reinvigorate American science and technology,  to promote our national security, and to create the jobs of the future.   I have committed to put a bipartisan, competitive-related bill on the  floor of the Senate. The Endless Frontier Act will be a central part of  that legislation. We will also push for emergency spending to implement  the bipartisan semiconductor manufacturing provisions in last year's  Defense bill.   Another potential component, led by Senators Menendez and Risch, is  being marked up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week.  This is exactly what our Republican colleagues have asked for when it  comes to regular order.   We are marking up bipartisan bills in committee and considering  bipartisan amendments here on the floor. We have just seen this back  process play out on the anti-Asian hate crimes bill this week, and next  week we are going to follow it up with a water infrastructure bill that  is also thoroughly bipartisan.   Our efforts to cement another century of American economic leadership  should be no different--thoroughly bipartisan.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, first I just want to say, before I move  on a motion to discharge, it is really so good to have Vanita Gupta now  installed as Associate Attorney General. To have someone with such a  background in civil rights at this time in American history is so  important and so vital to the country.   I am so glad that the Senate has now approved her and she can do her  vital job, including dealing with the systemic bias we have seen in  policing and in law enforcement throughout the country. So it is very  good news for the forces of equality and justice in the country.    Madam President, I ask that the motion to reconsider be  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate and  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee  on Armed Services being tied on the question of reporting, I move to  discharge the Committee on Armed Services from further consideration of  the nomination of Colin Hackett Kahl, of California, to be Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy.    I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided  during the quorum call.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  motions with respect to amendment 1445 and S. 937 be withdrawn; that  when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 937 on Thursday, April 22,  the following amendments be reported by number and they be the only  amendments in order: Cruz-Kennedy No. 1456, Lee No. 1425, Blackburn No.  1458; further, that at 11:30 a.m., the Senate vote in relation to the  amendments in the order listed; that amendment No. 1445, as amended, if  amended, be agreed to; the bill be considered and read a third time;  and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, with 60  affirmative votes required for adoption of the amendments and passage  of the bill, with 4 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each  vote, all with no intervening action or debate; and, finally, that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.

I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 30, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration  and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 143.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, April 22; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of S. 937, as  provided under the previous order.    For the information of Senators, there will be four  rollcall votes in relation to the COVID-19 Hate Crimes legislation  beginning at 11:30 a.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the provisions of S.
