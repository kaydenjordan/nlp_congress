 Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act, which I have  introduced with my friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin.  Our legislation aims to help ensure that our seniors and disabled  citizens have timely access to home health services available under the  Medicare program.   Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives,  and clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important  roles in the delivery of healthcare services, particularly in rural and  medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be in  scarce supply.   In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in 1997, authorized  Medicare to begin paying for physician services provided by those  health professionals as long as those services are within their scope  of practice under State law.   Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered  nurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home  healthcare services for their Medicare patients. Under current law,  only physicians are allowed to certify or initiate home healthcare for  Medicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the  patient's case as the nonphysician provider.   In fact, in many cases, the certifying physician may not even have a  relationship with the patient and must rely upon the input of the nurse  practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or  certified nurse midwife to order the medically necessary home  healthcare. At best, this requirement adds more paperwork and a number  of unnecessary steps to the process before home healthcare can be  provided. At worst, it can lead to needless delays in getting Medicare  patients the home care that they need simply because a doctor is not  readily available to sign the requisite form. The inability of these  advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants to order  home health care is particularly burdensome for our seniors in  medically underserved areas, where these providers may be the only  healthcare professionals who are readily available.    For example, needed home healthcare can be delayed for up to days at  a time for Medicare patients in some rural towns in my State of Maine,  where nurse practitioners are the only healthcare professionals and the  supervising physicians are far away. A nurse practitioner told me about  one of her cases in which her collaborating physician had just lost her  father and, therefore, understandably, was not available. But here is  what the consequence was. This nurse practitioner's patients  experienced a 2-day delay in getting needed care while they waited to  get the paperwork signed by another doctor.   Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ludicrous that she  can order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute facility but  cannot order home healthcare. How does that make sense?   One of her patients had to wait 11 days after being discharged before  his physical and occupational therapy could continue simply because the  home health agency had difficulty finding a physician to certify the  continuation of the very same therapy that the nurse practitioner had  been able to authorize when the patient was in the facility.   Think about that. Here we have a patient who is in a rehab facility,  for example, or a subacute facility or a nursing home--a skilled  nursing home--and that patient is ready to go home, but the chances of  successful treatment of that patient--of that patient regaining  function--is going to be diminished if there is a gap between the  physical and occupational therapy and the home healthcare nursing that  the patient would receive at home if there is no physician available to  do the paperwork.   So that simply does not make sense. I would wager that it leads to  additional cost for our healthcare system because, if that essential  home healthcare is not available in the patient's home, the tendency is  going to be to keep the patient in the facility for a longer period of  time to avoid the gap in treatment. Yet we know that it is much more  cost effective to treat the patient in his or her home. We also know  that for many patients, that is their preference as well. They would  rather be in the comfort, security, and privacy of their own home.   The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act would help ensure that  our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care they need and when  they need it, by allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners,  clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives to order home  health services.   It only makes sense. They can order it when the patient is in certain  facilities, but then they lose the right to order it when the patient  goes home? That just doesn't make sense. These are skilled  professionals who know what the patients need, and we should not be  burdening the system with unnecessary paperwork.   Our bipartisan legislation is supported by the National Association  for Home Care & Hospice, the American Nurses Association, the American  Academy of Physician Assistants, the American College of Nurse  Midwives, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, and the  Visiting Nurse Associations of America.   A lot of times we deal with healthcare issues that are  extraordinarily complex, and it is difficult for us to figure out what  the answer is. This is not one of those cases. This is a commonsense  reform that will improve and expedite services to Medicare  beneficiaries, whether they are our disabled citizens or our seniors.  It will help them get the home health care they need without undue  delay.   I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this  commonsense bill.   Seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have five requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.
