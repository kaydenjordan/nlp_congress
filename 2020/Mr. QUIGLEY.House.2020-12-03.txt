 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1380,  the Big Cat Public Safety Act, and I am grateful for the bipartisan  support it has received. I also want to thank my staffer, Max, who  worked so hard on this measure.   The Big Cat Public Safety Act has been endorsed by the Fraternal  Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and numerous other  State and local law enforcement agencies because 500-pound carnivores  pose a serious and very real threat to first responders, law  enforcement officers, and entire communities around the country. The  photo behind me is not staged.  [[Page H6133]]    This bill is also endorsed by the Humane Society of the United States  and countless other animal welfare organizations because lions and  tigers do not belong in urban apartments or in cages in suburban  backyards and because private citizens simply do not have the resources  to care for dangerous animals that are meant to roam over hundreds of  square miles.   As was stated, this bill is supported by the AGA and is not opposed  by the Zoological Association of America, the trade association for  small roadside-type zoos, because ripping newborn cubs from their  mothers moments after their birth to use them as props in photos is  already cruel enough, but once they are too big to be safely held,  brutally killing them is just wrong.                                time  1930    Nearly 65,000 Americans have signed a Change.org petition calling for  the immediate passage of this bill because the Netflix series ``Tiger  King'' showed the world in stark relief how exploitive, dangerous, and  inhumane this tiny so-called industry is.   This bill should be served by every American because right now  taxpayers shoulder the cost of monitoring and regulating private  owners, and when big cats are rescued from horrific conditions or  simply abandoned by overwhelmed owners, they pay for the care and  feeding of these cats.   Madam Speaker, I thank the many Republican Members of Congress who  support this bill, which is cosponsored by more than half the House.   I urge every Member to stand with the law enforcement community and  stand up for those that need our help but cannot ask for that. Please  vote for this bill.
