 Leader Hoyer expressed, I think, everybody's feelings  about   John Lewis.   I lost a hero and a friend, a cohort in good trouble, and a  colleague. It is said, when you come to the House, you sometimes walk  with giants, rarely do you get to walk with a saint. John Lewis was a  saint. He was heavenly. He embodied the spirit of Martin Luther King  and Mahatma Gandhi. He exhibited that in his work, his life, his votes,  his advice to his colleagues.   There is no good time to die, but   John Lewis lit a fire that has  turned into a tremendous blaze, and I am fortunate that I have been  able to feel the warmth and share it with him.                            ____________________
