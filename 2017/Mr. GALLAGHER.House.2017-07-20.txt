 Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge and thank  Chairman McCaul for his leadership in undertaking this effort as we  take the next step in advancing the 2017 Department of Homeland  Security authorization bill.   As part of this broader legislative effort, I sponsored the  Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program Act because I believe we  need to make sure that our Intelligence Committee has the best and most  robust training in the world in order to keep our Nation safe.   In 2015, the Department's Chief Intelligence Officer identified the  need to strengthen the workforce at the agency by giving intelligence  analysts the tools they need to succeed. I served as an intelligence  officer for 7 years in the Marine Corps and worked in the Intelligence  Committee, including at the National Counterterrorism Center, and the  Drug Enforcement Administration, so I know firsthand the value of  intelligence analysts gaining experience in different mission areas in  order to broaden their ability to do their jobs more effectively for  the American people.   This program does that. It encourages analysts to gain experience in  all of the various agencies that are part of the larger DHS community.   With authorization, this bill will ensure that we are building and  strengthening the expertise among employees  [[Page H6117]]  at the DHS in order to keep the country safe.
