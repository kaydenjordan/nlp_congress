 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for  rollcall vote No. 195, adoption of the Lee amendment to limit the  availability of funds for the support of Ukraine (376). Had I been  present for the vote, I would have voted nay.   I was necessarily absent for rollcall vote No. 196, adoption of the  Cornyn amendment to provide for an investment screening mechanism  relating to covered sectors (931). Had I been present for the vote, I  would have voted yea.   I was necessarily absent for rollcall vote No. 197, adoption of the  Rounds amendment to amend the Defense Production Act of 1950 to include  the Secretary of Agriculture on the Committee on Foreign Investment in  the United States and require review of certain agricultural  transactions (No. 813). Had I been present for the vote, I would have  voted yea.   The Rounds-Tester amendment adds the Secretary of Agriculture to the  Committee on Foreign Investment. If the committee determines that  investments by foreign adversaries into agricultural real estate or a  U.S. business engaged in agriculture or biotech would result in control  by the foreign adversary, it requires the President to prohibit the  transaction. I support this amendment's efforts to protect critical  agricultural assets, but I am concerned that the amendment as drafted  merits additional review to avoid unintended risks of discrimination  based on national origin or citizenship. While I will support this  amendment and its objectives, Senators Rounds and Tester understand my  concern and have agreed to continue working with me and our colleagues  to resolve these concerns before Congress sends a final bill to the  President.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I recently traveled to Vilnius,  Lithuania, for this year's NATO Summit. It was a fitting location;  Lithuania has had an extraordinary journey breaking free from the  tyranny of the Soviet Union and becoming a thriving democracy. The  visit also had a deep significance for me personally. One hundred and  twelve years ago, my mother came to the United States from Lithuania.  Although she never saw her homeland again, she always carried it in her  heart.   Just a few decades before my mother arrived in the United States, a  Lithuanian Jewish couple, Ida and Arie Krinsky, immigrated to the  United States. They settled in Chicago, where Arie toiled in a  sweatshop to make a living and support his wife and seven children.  Eventually, the Krinsky family changed their surname to Crown. Three of  the Crown sons, Henry and his brothers Irving and Sol, established a  sand and gravel company, the Material Service Corporation, that would  grow into a business empire before merging with General Dynamics.   When Henry Crown passed away in 1990, his obituary in the New York  Times referred to him as ``the billionaire whose life exemplified the  Horatio Alger rags-to-riches story of American industrialists.'' It is  a legacy that has been preserved and expanded by his children. To this  day, the Crown family  [[Page S3610]]  is widely known for its socially conscious investment and philanthropic  efforts, and as a pillar of the Jewish community from Chicago to  Israel.   Tragically, late last month, James ``Jim'' Crown, Henry's grandson,  passed away in a car accident on his 70th birthday. Born to Renee and  Lester Crown, Jim went to high school in Winnetka, attended Hampshire  College in Amherst, MA, for his undergraduate studies, and graduated  from Stanford Law School. He began his career at Salomon Brothers,  eventually becoming vice president of the Capital Markets Service  Group. It was during his time on Wall Street that Jim met and fell in  love with Paula Hannaway, an investment banker. In 1985, the two  married and returned to Chicago to join the family business.   Jim was chair and CEO of Henry Crown and Company, a privately held  company dealing in securities, real estate, and other investments. He  also was a member of the board of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Jim was one of  Chicago's most prominent philanthropists and a longtime member of the  board of trustees for the University of Chicago, serving as chair from  2003 to 2009.   In early 2003, Jim had breakfast with a young Illinois State senator  who was gearing up to make a run for the U.S. Senate. Some might have  seen an inexperienced newcomer with almost no chance of success. But  Jim saw what others did not. In Jim's words, ``I was just taken with  his sensibility, his intelligence, his values, and how he conducted  himself during that campaign.'' That young State senator, Barack Obama,  would not only win that seat but go on to become our Nation's first  Black President. And Jim was one of his earliest supporters.   Jim represented the best of finance and business; he knew that  success went well beyond profits and bull markets. He understood the  importance of giving back. In 2021, Jim and Paula made history with a  $75 million donation to the University of Chicago's School of Social  Work, reportedly the largest ever private donation to a school of  social work. Today, the school has been renamed the Crown Family School  of Social Work, Policy, and Practice. Jim's father Lester Crown said,  ``[Jim] was the leader of our family both intellectually and  emotionally, and he looked out for everybody.'' I would add that  ``everybody'' stretched far beyond Jim's own family.   And just before his passing, as the head of the Civic Committee and  Commercial Club of Chicago, Jim was working to convene Chicago business  leaders to focus on ways to address violent crime, to make Chicago  ``the Safest Big City in America.'' The strategy centered on investing  in the communities most impacted by violent crime, expanding community  violence intervention programs, and committing to expand economic  opportunity, all with the goal of breaking the cycle of trauma and  ending generational poverty. While Jim may be gone, I hope his work  will be continued to make this a reality.   Jim is survived by his loving wife of 38 years, Paula; their  children, Torie, Hayley, Summer, and W. Andrew; and two grandchildren;  as well as his parents Renee and Lester; four sisters Patricia, Susan,  Sara, and Janet; two brothers Steve and Daniel. To the entire Crown  family and all of those who knew and loved Jim, Loretta and I send our  deepest condolences.   Thank you, Jim, for all that you did for the city of Chicago; it will  not be the same without you.        (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was       ordered to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to thank someone who  is critical to the functioning of the U.S. Senate--and who has been  instrumental in the lives of many of us Senators, staff, and the entire  Senate community for more than two decades.   At the end of this week, Sharon Cohen will be retiring after many  years of service in the Senate Dining Room. The Senate Dining Room will  be a very different place without her, and we will all miss her.   Sharon is wonderful--kind, caring, and dedicated. Since joining the  Senate Dining Room, she has won over everyone she has met with her  warmth, patience, and dedication--both to her work and to anyone with  whom she interacts.   We have all had people who touched our lives, providing guidance  during difficult times, or even just a friendly face on long days.  Sharon provided all of that--and more--to Senators, staff, and the  colleagues who worked beside her every single day.   Throughout her many years of service, Sharon has worked just as hard  as anyone else in the Senate--in fact, she has probably worked harder.  She never missed a day of work, never showed up late, and never called  out sick. Her colleagues always trusted that they could rely on her. It  is one of Sharon's many qualities that will be missed in the Senate.   And she was willing to go above and beyond to support fellow workers,  both new and old, and lend a hand no matter the task. While her work  may not have made headline news every day, Sharon is one of the many  unsung heroes that make the Senate run.   Soon, Sharon will be enjoying her well-earned retirement, but true to  form, she will stay busy. In fact, she has already started her next  role: grandmother to a beautiful new grandchild. She will spend her  retirement caring for Trent, or as she refers to him, ``her little  man,'' alongside her daughter Angie.   I know I am not alone when I say I will miss Sharon's cheerful  presence in the Senate Dining Room. We all are grateful for her many  years of hard work and dedication to this body and our country. We wish  her all the best as she embarks on a new adventure.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, for most Americans, April 1 is  April Fools' Day, a day of pranks, misleading headlines, deception, and  trickery. While that also is true for Illinoisans, in 2007, the  Illinois General Assembly gave Illinoisans something else to celebrate:  Cheap Trick Day, in honor of the rock and roll band.   For nearly 50 years, Cheap Trick has been part of the American  soundtrack, lighting up car radios on cross-country drives, blasting  through speakers at weddings, and now playing in the next generation's  wireless headphones. Through it all, Cheap Trick has kept their  listeners humming along to popular tunes like ``Surrender'' and ``The  Flame.''   But before they were rock and roll legends, they were just a band  from Rockford, IL. In 1973, guitarist Rick Nielsen, bassist Tom  Petersson, original vocalist Randy Hogan, and drummer Bun E. Carlos  came together to form Cheap Trick. The band came up with their name  after attending a Slade concert. Following the English rock band's  show, Tom remarked that Slade used ``every cheap trick in the book''  during their set. The name stuck, and the group would go on to become a  regular on the Billboard charts.   In 1974, Robin Zander joined the band, replacing Hogan as lead  vocalist. While they started out playing shows across the Midwest-- Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa--they would go on to tour the  world, opening for the likes of Kiss, Kansas, and Queen. But it was a  six-date tour of Japan in the spring of 1978 that changed everything.   Cheap Trick put on the performance of a lifetime before raucous  crowds at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, Japan. They released the  performances as a live album, ``Cheap Trick at Budokan,'' which went  triple-platinum, selling more than 3 million certified units. The album  included the smash hit ``I Want You to Want Me,'' which decades later  remains a mainstay on classic rock radio stations across the country.  In 2020, the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress  selected ``Cheap Trick at Budokan'' as one of just 25 recordings to  join the National Archives for that year.   And in 2016, Cheap Trick was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of  Fame, receiving rock and roll's highest honor and taking their place  next to their own musical idols, The Beatles. In addition to leaving  behind an impressive discography, the band also has helped shape the  sound of the next generation of great bands. Groups like  [[Page S3611]]  Pearl Jam, Guns N' Roses, Nirvana, and Green Day, all have credited  Cheap Trick as an influence.   Cheap Trick has since become a true family business with Daxx, Rick's  son, on the drums and Robin Taylor, Robin's son, floating from guitar,  bass, and background vocals. The band is still on the road, playing for  crowds from all generations looking to enjoy the nostalgic rock sounds  of the 80s. As of this year, Cheap Trick has performed more than 5,000  concerts and sold more than 20 million albums.   Aside from April 1, soon, the band will have another date to  celebrate. August 15 will mark 50 years of Cheap Trick. No matter how  many sold out shows, world tours, or records sold, Cheap Trick will  always be a band that got its start in Rockford, IL. I congratulate  Cheap Trick on a half century of hits.                            ____________________
