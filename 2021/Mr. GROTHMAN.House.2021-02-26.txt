 Mr. Speaker, three things before you print another $1.9  trillion in this bill. If you look at the monetary supply in the last  year, M1 is up 67 percent and M2 is up 25 percent. You are inviting  inflation big time.   Secondly, I have got one local official who asked me for a million  bucks. He is getting $21 million. Another one is asking me for  $800,000. He is getting $20 million. Ask your local people if they need  all this money.   Third, I wouldn't even take it to the Senate because there is no way  you can spend all this money. I would put some of this in  infrastructure, just as a tip.
