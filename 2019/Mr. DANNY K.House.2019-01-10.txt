 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to  a dear friend and one of the most revered ministers of the gospel that  the Chicago metropolitan area has ever known.   Reverend James Bass was born on May 7, 1920, to the late Frank and  Hattie Bell Bass in a rural Mississippi town.   James began school at the age of 6 in a little church house near  Sunflower River Road, where he attended with his two brothers and one  sister. His first teacher, Mr. Lee, taught all of the classes that were  in session when the farming seasons were not in force.   As a little boy, James loved playing marbles, pitching horseshoes,  and playing church, with him preaching. He also would preach the  funeral for any of the animals that died and became known as the boy  preacher.   Every Sunday, James attended church with his family in their mule- driven wagon. In 1929, he officially joined church after sitting on the  mourners bench during a revival. He continued to grow and develop, got  a job at the church as custodian, and attended and graduated from the  Booker T. Washington High School in Ruleville, Mississippi.   In 1938, James revealed his calling and preached his first sermon as  a full-fledged minister at the age of 18.   On December 7, 1941, James was drafted into the military and served 3  years in the U.S. Army during World War II. He carried no weapon and  continued his ministerial work.   After being discharged, he returned home and enrolled at Tougaloo  College in 1948, majoring in history. He attended the Mississippi  seminary in Jackson in 1951. He became pastor of the Mt. Israel Baptist  Church in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where he sponsored a radio broadcast  for senior citizens and those who were sick and shut in.   In December of 1955, James was invited to Detroit to preach a revival  at Canaan Baptist Church. On the way back, he stopped in Chicago to  visit his brother and sister and was honored to preach at the Greater  Open Door Baptist Church.   In August of 1956, Reverend Bass organized a small mission. The  mission grew, and the Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church was founded  in September of 1956.   He returned to Chicago and commuted between Chicago and Mississippi  for 6 years, and, after fasting and praying, he decided that his type  of ministry really needed to be in a large urban city.   In 1967, Reverend Bass and Helyn Maxine Julius were united in holy  matrimony and were blessed with two children, Vincent in 1968 and  Vikkeda in 1970.   Under Reverend Bass' leadership, Mt. Olive grew into a substantial  Baptist church, with significant influence in the community.   When Dr. Martin Luther King came to Chicago and lived on the West  Side, Reverend James Bass was there with him and stood shoulder-to- shoulder when others sleeked away or refused to stand.   Reverend Bass was known as an activist, independent-minded preacher  who used his pulpit effectively to foster something called liberation  theology. He will be remembered as one who knew that the doors of the  church must be open both ways: inside so that people could come and be  spiritually nurtured, but also outside so that they could use the  information for the benefit of themselves and their communities.   For more than 90 years, Reverend James Bass preached what he called  the gospel. He was an effective messenger, and what a messenger he was.  May his soul rest in peace.                            ____________________
