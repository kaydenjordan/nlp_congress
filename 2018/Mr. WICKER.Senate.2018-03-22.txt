 Madam President, I, too, wish to join my colleagues in a  tribute to our retiring statesman, Senator Thad Cochran.   First of all, I have been asked by Phyllis J. Anderson, Tribal Chief  of the Mississippi Band of Chocktaw Indians, to have printed in the  Record a proclamation that was adopted only recently about Senator  Cochran in appreciation for his 46 years of public service as a Member  of the House and of the Senate, and I ask unanimous consent that the  proclamation be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians   A TRIBAL PROCLAMATION IN RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION OF THE HONORABLE                          THAD COCHRAN--March 2018         WHEREAS, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians recognizes       and honors The Honorable Thad Cochran for his 46 years of       dedicated public service as a Member of the U.S. House of       Representatives and distinguished U.S. Senator representing       the State of Mississippi, including Choctaw citizens of our       great Tribe; and,        WHEREAS, Senator Cochran has faithfully served, as both       Chairman and Member, on Committees important to Mississippi       and to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, including the       Committees on Appropriations, Indian Affairs, Agriculture,       Nutrition, and Forestry, Judiciary, Rules and Administration,       Ethics and the Labor and Human Resources; and,        WHEREAS, Senator Cochran has achieved a wide-ranging       legislative record and valuable legacy that reflects the       needs of Mississippi, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw       Indians, and the nation.        WHEREAS, Senator Cochran's work has helped to create jobs       and spur economic growth in Mississippi and has continuously       supported tribal sovereignty and self-determination which has       contributed to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians being       one of the largest employers in our State; and,        WHEREAS, Senator Cochran's work has also promoted progress       in our nation's rural communities, including on our nation's       Indian reservations, through various programs for economic       and educational development teacher training, vocational       education, libraries, university-based research and       development, conservation of the environment and our       wetlands, forestry, health care and criminal justice; and,        WHEREAS, Senator Cochran, who also served in the U.S. Navy,       has worked to protect the U.S. Armed Forces and our men and       women in uniform, as well the Navy's shipbuilding programs       and military bases and installations in Mississippi. Now,       therefore, be it        RESOLVED, that I, Phyliss J. Anderson, by the authority       vested in me as Tribal Chief, do hereby honor the legacy of       the Honorable Thad Cochran and extend the sincere gratitude,       appreciation, and many blessings of the Mississippi Band of       Choctaw Indians to Senator Cochran upon his retirement after       five decades of public service in the U.S. Navy, U.S. House       of Representatives and U.S. Senate.                                            Phyliss J. Anderson,                                      Tribal Chief, Mississippi Band                                                of Choctaw Indians.     Madam President, I would note that the last paragraph of  this document says: ``Resolved, that I, Phyllis J. Anderson, by the  authority vested in me as Tribal Chief, do hereby honor the legacy of  the Honorable Thad Cochran and extend sincere gratitude, appreciation,  and many blessings of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to  Senator Cochran upon his retirement after five decades of public  service in the U.S. Navy, U.S. House of Representatives and U.S.  Senate.   Signed by Phyllis J. Anderson, Tribal Chief.   Back in December of 1937, Thad Cochran was born in the little town of  Pontotoc, MS, population 1,832. He was born in the delivery room of the  Rayburn Clinic. Some 13\1/2\ years later, I was born in the delivery  room of the Rayburn Clinic in Pontotoc, MS.   During the campaign, some years later in 1994, when I was first  trying to be a Member of the House of Representatives, Senator Thad  Cochran and I went around the northern part of the State and told many  people that he and I were born not only in the same town and not only  in the same clinic but born in the same room, the delivery room of the  Rayburn Clinic. We thought that was the truth. As it turned out, we  found out later from our moms, the Rayburn Clinic had moved down the  street; so while we were both born in the delivery room of Rayburn  Clinic, that clinic itself had moved. It just points out how long  Senator Thad Cochran and I have been friends and how long our families  have been friends and how well associated we have been down through the  years.   Senator Alexander mentioned that campaign in 1968, and then he  mentioned that he was a candidate for Congress successfully in 1972. I  was honored, as a college student, to go door-to-door for Senator  Cochran during that 1972 campaign.   Yesterday was National Poetry Day. Perhaps it is appropriate for me,  today, to quote a couple of poets, the first being Henry Wadsworth  Longfellow who said:       Lives of great men all remind us      We can make our lives sublime;      And departing, leave behind us      Footprints on the sands of time.    As Thad Cochran departs the Senate in a few days, I think it is  appropriate for us to reflect, as my friend from Tennessee and my  friend from Texas have already done, and as others will do, about the  great footprints Senator Thad Cochran will have left in the sands of  time for our Nation.   Because of Thad Cochran, our Nation's defense is stronger today.   Because of the efforts of our colleague from Mississippi, my senior  Senator, Americans are healthier today and will continue to be  healthier.   American agriculture is stronger today because of the efforts of this  ``quiet persuader'' in the field of agriculture; and our economy, as a  whole, is stronger because of the many efforts of Senator Thad Cochran  and before that, Representative Thad Cochran in the U.S. House.   I am just very grateful. We are all grateful for all he has done.   Senator Cochran acknowledged in his statement about his impending  retirement that health had become an issue for him, and it was time to  move on.   I told reporters and I told Members who asked me--I said it is a  bittersweet moment, it is a poignant moment for me to hear such things.  These sorts of things happen, and we all face health issues at some  point.   Alfred Lord Tennyson, in his magnificent poem ``Ulysses,'' said:       Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'      We are not now that strength which in old days      Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;      One equal temper of heroic hearts,      Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will      To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.    I say to my friend Thad that we appreciate the fact that he has been  strong in will and, though time and fate have happened to Thad Cochran  and will happen to me and to all of us, what abides is the legacy he  has left of being a ``quiet persuader,'' of being a person of  accomplishment, of being a gentleman who has made this country and its  citizens better off, and I thank him.   I yield the floor.
