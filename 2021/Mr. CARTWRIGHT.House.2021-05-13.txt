 Mr. Speaker, this week I was so proud to announce  that $330 million from the American Rescue  [[Page H2275]]  Plan is on its way to my district to keep frontline public workers on  the payroll; that $50 million is coming to my district to help our  colleges, universities, and their students recover from this horrible  pandemic; and that advance monthly child tax credit payments--a tax cut  for working families with children--stand to benefit 126,000 children  in my district alone.   These are more than just numbers on a page. They represent the  promise of life returning to this country as part of the American  Rescue Plan which has put checks back in pockets, put people back in  jobs, put the shots in the arms, and put our kids back in the schools.   This is the American Rescue Plan, and it is working.                            ____________________
