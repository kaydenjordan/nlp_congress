 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   The Senate passed the bill with all 50 Democrats and 19 Republicans  voting yes. Now, it is time for the House to follow suit. Then we can  send the bill to President Biden, who played a critical role in  crafting this legislation.   In Congress, we have been talking about investing in America's  infrastructure for decades, to the point that it has become a punch  line. Now, we are finally on the cusp of taking action to match the  rhetoric.   Passage of this bill will prove the two parties can still work  together in partisan times. It will show the American people their  elected leaders can govern in a competent and constructive way, despite  their differences.   The bill will provide my home State of Florida with better roads and  bridges, improved rail and bus options, modernized air and seaports,  high-speed broadband, and clean drinking water. It will improve quality  of life  [[Page H5516]]  and create good-paying jobs, helping to diversify our economy and  sustain our growing population.   The bill will also make historic investments to combat climate  change, an existential threat to our planet, our country, and the  Florida way of life.   I urge my Republican colleagues to abandon their cynical quest for  political advantage and to vote for this good bill. I ask my Democratic  colleagues to discard their ill-fated effort to gain leverage over  members of their own party and to vote for this good bill.                            ____________________
