 Madam Speaker, I rise to lament the failure of the  For the People Act, H.R. 1, in the United States Senate. It is a sad  week that this has happened.   H.R. 1, the For the People Act, ought to be a bipartisan American  goal. It ought to be a bipartisan American goal that we get big secret  money out of politics. It ought to be a bipartisan American goal that  we protect people's right to vote throughout this land. It ought to be  a bipartisan American goal that we end gerrymandering and let the  people choose the politicians instead of the politicians choosing their  voters.   I am here to say that we are not done with the For the People Act and  its goals. Let's make it bipartisan and let's make it an American goal.                            ____________________
