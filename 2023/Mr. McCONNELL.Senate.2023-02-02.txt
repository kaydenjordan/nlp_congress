 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, at this time 1 year ago, the Democratic  Party was in the middle of a hysterical meltdown over a new voting law  in the State of Georgia.   The President of the United States declared that the State's modest  changes to election procedures were ``Jim Crow 2.0.'' He said the law  was about ``voter suppression and election subversion.'' He said  citizens should doubt ``whether your vote counts at all.'' The sitting  President of the United States said lawmakers' positions on this bill  would define--listen to this--whether we were ``on the side of Dr. King  or George Wallace . . . John Lewis or Bull Connor . . . Abraham Lincoln  or Jefferson Davis.''   The Senate Democratic leader said his fellow U.S. Senators who are  Republicans were ``supporting the reenactment of those Jim Crow laws.''   My colleague from New York, as the Senate majority leader, is  supposed to safeguard and steward this institution. Instead, he tried  to destroy the Senate and ``nuke'' the 60-vote threshold so that  Democrats could take over all 50 States' election laws on a partisan  basis. And, believe it or not, 47 of the other 49 Democrats went right  along with him.   The liberal hysteria spread to the press and the private sector. Woke  activists started talking about boycotting companies like Coca-Cola and  Delta Airlines. Major League Baseball caved and moved the All-Star Game  out of Atlanta, directly harming the local economy, all for the sake of  symbolism.   Republicans said this was unhinged, phony outrage over a commonsense  law that would make it both easy to vote and, of course, hard to cheat.  Democrats said the new voting rules were evil and racist and the  literal death of democracy.   Well, the facts are now in. We have hard evidence. After the new bill  took effect in early 2022, the State of Georgia held a primary  election. Do you know what happened? Record turnout for a primary.   Then, last November, Georgia had a general election. What happened? A  new record for ballots cast in a midterm.   Oh, some might say: But that doesn't tell us anything about the  voting conditions. Maybe there were terribly long lines. Maybe there  were sinister road blocks, and voters persevered in spite of them.   Ah, but alas, except an academic research center at the University of  Georgia spent weeks--weeks--conducting a major survey of Georgia voters  after the election. Let's take a look at what they found.   Seventy-two percent of all Georgia voters--and 73 percent of Black  voters, specifically--said their voting experience was ``excellent.''  Ninety-two percent of all voters--and 92 percent of Black voters,  specifically--said either that voting had gotten easier since the prior  election or that there was no difference. Ninety-two percent of all  voters in Georgia said that voting had either gotten easier or that  there was no difference between that election and prior elections. More  than 70 percent of Black voters in Georgia said they waited less than  10 minutes to cast their ballot.   This is all with the supposed ``Jim Crow'' law in action: record-high  turnout, lightning-fast voting lines, a supermajority of African- American voters rating their experience under the new voting rules as  ``excellent.''   Ah, but here is the icing on the cake. The same Democratic Party that  cheered Major League Baseball from moving the All-Star Game out of  Atlanta--listen to this--now has Atlanta on the short list for the next  Democratic National Convention.   Here is what happened. We were right, and they were wrong. But it  goes beyond that. These people actually lied. They invoked our darkest  history and slandered half the country because they wanted more power  for themselves.   Some of the most powerful people in our entire country, including the  President of the United States, staked their personal credibility to  these claims. President Biden screamed from a podium that the bad old  days of Jim Crow were back. Over this?   The majority leader from New York tried to destroy the Senate. Over  this?   The American people were subjected to months of baseless, pointless,  media haranguing. Over this?   And the country is supposed to go on pretending like nothing  happened? We are all supposed to take the President, Vice President,  and Senate Democrats seriously the next time they start shouting and  waving their arms about the next supposed crisis? I don't think so. I  don't think the American people will forget who kept their credibility  and who lit theirs on fire.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on an entirely different matter,  today, Ranking Member Capito of the Environment and Public Works  Committee will introduce an important resolution on behalf of millions  of American farmers, ranchers, and builders.   Two years ago, the Biden administration picked up an Obama-era  crusade to micromanage the small businesses that help feed, clothe, and  power America. Literally, on President Biden's first day in office, he  signed an Executive order that began tearing down the regulatory  certainty that Republicans had worked hard to restore for American  workers and entrepreneurs.   And in December, this crusade yielded a new rule from EPA that  enacted a dizzying new definition of which temporary, tributary, and  upland waterways fall under the Federal Government's authority. There  is a case before the Supreme Court on this very subject right now. The  Court's ruling in Sackett v. EPA will provide new clarity on just how  far Federal bureaucrats can stretch their powers to meddle in working  Americans' business under the Clean Water Act.   But instead of waiting to see whether a massive expansion of the  regulatory state would be legal, the Biden EPA went ahead with their  new rule. Can you imagine why Washington Democrats would be in such a  rush to get ahead of the law?   So what does this latest power grab by Washington Democrats mean for  working people out in our country? Well, for starters, it means that  cattlemen, contractors, and all sorts of folks have now had to put up  with three--three--major changes to Federal regulation on the lands  where they do business in just the past 8 years.   Democrats' relentless attempts to step on State and local authorities  in their own backyards has left small business owners across America  chasing moving goalposts. The Biden administration's latest rule means  it will be harder for farmers in Kentucky to figure out which ditches  on their property are subject to the whims of Washington bureaucrats.  It will create new headaches for builders in West Virginia trying to  make sure they dot every ``i'' and cross every ``t'' on much needed  development projects. It will mean ranchers out West may discover that  every ditch and low-lying puddle they own--even ones that only hold  water when it rains--is now the business of EPA.   And as every American who has tried to create jobs or build something  knows, redtape doesn't just cost valuable time. Legal experts project  the Biden administration's latest overreach would raise the cost of  development and infrastructure projects near waterways by--listen to  this--a million dollars an acre.   So while President Biden takes a victory lap on infrastructure  projects made possible by bipartisan work, this latest salvo in  Washington Democrats' war on working Americans would devastate the sort  of small businesses that actually build the infrastructure projects.   But it isn't going unanswered. Twenty-five Governors, representing  fully half the States in our country, have  [[Page S216]]  condemned the EPA's waters of the United States rule. And here in the  Senate, West Virginia's own Senator Capito has consistently led our  efforts to cut the overreaching regulatory state back down to size. She  sponsored the legislation that would have codified the last  administration's commonsense fixes. She spearheaded Congress's brief to  the Supreme Court as it considers this issue.   And today, she will introduce her Congressional Review Act resolution  to give every one of our colleagues the opportunity to protect the  future of transformative infrastructure, energy, and agriculture  projects in their States.   West Virginia should be proud that one of their two Senators is  committed to reforms that get more of Washington's messes out of their  way. I am proud to support Senator Capito's resolution. I would urge  each of my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
