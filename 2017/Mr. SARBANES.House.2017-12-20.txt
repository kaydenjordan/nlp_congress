 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?    I am opposed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Sarbanes moves to recommit the bill, H.R. 4015, with       instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith,       with the following amendments:        Page 14, strike line 23.        Page 14, line 25, strike the period and insert ``; and''       and after such line insert the following:        ``(C) does not include proxy voting recommendations on       shareholder proposals related to political campaign       contributions of a company.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Maryland is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment is about promoting greater transparency  and shareholder review of political campaign activity of public  corporations.   As we have heard, the underlying bill would create new restrictions  on proxy advisory firms that would erode their capacity to provide  reliable, independent advice to public company investors: institutional  investors such as pension funds that serve firefighters, teachers, and  police officers. My amendment would restore the ability of advisory  firms to provide research and vote recommendations regarding a public  company's spending on political campaign contributions.   Over the past half a century, public companies have increasingly  entered the political arena, spending huge sums on political  contributions and campaign activity. Court rulings like Citizens United  and SpeechNOW.org have opened new avenues of influence for corporate  America and have worked to amplify the role of public companies in our  politics. Mr. Speaker, the public is becoming increasingly anxious  about this.  [[Page H10329]]    Fortunately, in recent years, some shareholders and public interest  organizations have successfully put pressure on public corporations to  adopt shareholder review of corporate political activity, stemming the  tide of unchecked political spending from public corporations. Yet the  underlying bill would unwind that progress, giving corporations direct  influence over proxy advisory firm recommendations to shareholders  regarding political activity, knocking down yet another pillar of  political accountability in our politics.   Mr. Speaker, we need more, not less political accountability from our  Nation's corporations. As this week has shown, corporate America has an  outsized influence in our Nation's public policy. Look no further than  today's vote on the GOP tax scam or yesterday's further deregulation of  some of our Nation's largest financial institutions.   There is no mystery as to why this has happened. A sophisticated  corporate influence economy involving campaign contributions,  aggressive lobbying, a web of trade associations, corporate-backed  think tanks, and outside political organizations has sprung up in  Washington to shape who runs for office, who wins office, and the  policies we in Congress adopt.   Mr. Speaker, Americans hate this system. They hate the arrogance with  which monied interests exert their influence on our politics and our  government. They feel that their voice, the voice of the people, is  ignored while Big Money insiders have their way on Capitol Hill. They  want us to change the corrosive status quo.   Mr. Speaker, we can take a small step forward with this amendment to  restore the American people's faith in our ability to stand up to  corporate power. We should adopt this modest, but important change to  an otherwise flawed piece of legislation.   At a minimum, we should protect the opportunity for institutional  investors to receive independent research and advice when it comes to  the political activity of public companies. It is about transparency.  It is about accountability. It is about the public interest.   Mr. Speaker, to that end, I urge my colleagues to support the motion  to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
