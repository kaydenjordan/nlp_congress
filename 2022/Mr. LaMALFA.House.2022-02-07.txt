 Madam Speaker, this last week, a 13-year-old young man  was verbally berated in his school classroom in Grass Valley,  California, in my district, by a substitute math teacher, all because  he was wearing a mask that had the thin blue line on it, which is known  all over the country and internationally as being the one symbol that  supports law enforcement.   The flag--it is an American flag adapted to that--is a sign that just  shows support for our law enforcement, who we know protect us from  chaos and anarchy, and they help uphold ideals of justice, freedom,  bravery, and solidarity.   The boy's father and stepmother are members of law enforcement, so it  is natural that he would be wearing that mask, not only in general for  law enforcement but for his parents. Then we have a grown adult in a  classroom setting who attacks this boy because he says he wants to  compare this to the new Confederate flag. It is ridiculous. He berated  a child.   We are all raised to respect law enforcement, and this is what is  going on in the classroom. I commend the school district for not  bringing that substitute teacher back anymore.   Hang in there young man and your parents.                            ____________________
