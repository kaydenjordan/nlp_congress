 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California (Mr.  Lowenthal) for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today in support of H.R. 4266, the Acadia  National Park Boundary Clarification Act. I am proud to be an original  cosponsor of this bipartisan bill, which was introduced by my colleague  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin).   While you have already heard from Mr. Poliquin a lot about the  importance of the intertidal zone, about the livelihood of clam diggers  and wormers, and about the Acadia National Park, because our State is  so important and we love our park, I am pretty much going to say it all  again.   Maine is very proud to be home to Acadia National Park. This national  treasure is a place where the mountains actually meet the sea. When you  climb those mountains, you see miles of clear, blue ocean dotted with  literally some of the hundreds and thousands of islands off the coast  of Maine, one of which I am lucky enough to live on, not the one where  Acadia National Park is.   But millions of people visit Acadia National Park every year to  experience the incredible natural attractions, the hiking, and the  climbing. But they also come there to be in downeast Maine. Downeast  Maine is full of very many tight-knit communities, and those tight-knit  communities are full of hardworking men and women, many of whom make  their living on the water; and it is really hard work. Some of them are  hauling lobster traps every day so that we can enjoy the wonderful  lobster that is only delicious if you get it from the State of Maine.  But many of them are bent over digging in the mud for clams, for other  species, and for bloodworms; and it is really hard work.                                time  1730    H.R. 4266 would clarify a number of points to strengthen the park's  relationship with the surrounding communities that we have been talking  about. Most importantly, this bill will ensure that clammers, wormers,  and other traditional harvesters can continue to work in the places  where, frankly, they have worked for generations, many of them working  alongside their sons or daughters when they go out every day.   In the spring of 2016, the harvesters were shocked when the park  staff began prohibiting them from working  [[Page H1520]]  along the coastline within Acadia's boundaries. There was no warning  about changing a practice that had, frankly, gone on for decades. I  appreciate the fact that park officials quickly ended their  enforcement, but the actions sent shock waves throughout the area.   Washington County is the poorest county in Maine, and families there  simply just can't afford to lose any source of income. H.R. 4266 would  give the communities a sense of security by very explicitly stating  that harvesters have a right to work within the park. It is a critical  step to ensuring that Acadia National Park remains an attraction not  only for its natural beauty, but for its unique way of life.   Again, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Poliquin, for recognizing  the issue, for working with his harvesters, and for moving this  forward. I am proud to be an original cosponsor. I urge its passage and  urge all my colleagues to support it.
