 Mr. Speaker, I take the floor tonight, along with many of  my colleagues, to fight back against an attack on the rule of law and  our democratic institutions.   Right now, the investigations into Donald Trump and the prior  investigation into Hillary Clinton have been infected with the virus of  severe bias.   Hillary Clinton went under investigation for the mishandling of  classified information and her dealings through the Clinton Foundation,  which was essentially investigated by her own fan club. Meanwhile,  Robert Mueller obtained his team by fishing in the never-Trump  aquarium.   Only through the antidote of transparency can we end this erosion of  the rule of law and restore the American people's confidence in the  institutions that we must trust to live in a civilized society.  [[Page H9831]]    The people in this country have a right to know what has happened  within the FBI, the Department of Justice, and within Robert Mueller's  team as he probes the President and his transition. But there is so  much in hearing after hearing that members of the Judiciary Committee,  the Intelligence Committee, and the Oversight Committee have been told  we don't have a right to know as the Representatives of the people.   Let's begin with the tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch and former  President Bill Clinton.   We as the American people apparently don't have a right to know what  was truly discussed. In information and reports that have been  submitted to the Congress, there is extensive redacted information. So  we don't get to see the substance of those communications between  Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton. It is deeply  troubling.   We also don't get to know what the informant would tell us who had  information about Russia's attempts to impair the United States'  uranium assets through the now infamous Uranium One deal.   We know that there was an informant. We now know that informant  wanted to come forward and give information about bribery and kickbacks  that undermine America's interests.   Unfortunately, people at the Justice Department who still remain in  substantial positions of power went and sought a gag order so that the  Congress wouldn't learn what was happening and so the American people  wouldn't learn what was happening.   Then we learn that an inspector general who wanted to raise the flag  of concern regarding the deeply troubling conduct of Hillary Clinton  was essentially shut down.   Mr. McCullough has now given interviews upon his departure from the  intelligence community indicating that he went to James Clapper. He  said that these mishaps, these potential violations of law, were  serious and that they put America's national security in jeopardy. What  he heard back from Mr. Clapper was that these revelations would create  heartburn for the Clinton campaign.   It is ludicrous, when we have got potential bribes and kickbacks, and  we have got the Clinton Foundation functioning essentially as a  passthrough money laundering operation, that we wouldn't have all of  the information that an inspector general would bring forward.   Mr. McCullough gave interviews where now he said that his family, his  job, his agency, his mission was threatened by people in the deep  state. That is not the America we need to live in. Transparency is the  antidote to this type of corruption and this type of truly intolerable  conduct.   Here is what we do know. We do know that the Democratic National  Committee was off paying for a salacious and false dossier from the  Fusion GPS company about the current President, Donald Trump. We don't  know whether or not the FBI contributed funds toward that cause.   Think about that for a moment. When we asked the Attorney General and  the FBI Director, were taxpayer funds used to go and obtain a dossier  to discredit the President both before and after his election, we were  told that we don't have a right to know and that the taxpayers don't  have a right to know if their money was used in this way. It is  troubling.   We also know that Nellie Ohr, the wife of a top Department of Justice  official, Bruce Ohr, was actually getting paid by Fusion GPS, the  company that ultimately produced this false dossier.   If that is not a conflict of interest, if that doesn't impair the  credibility of this investigation, I don't know what does.   We also don't know who is in charge. We asked questions to the  Attorney General regarding the nature of his recusal. Can the Attorney  General appoint a second special counsel to evaluate the Clinton  Foundation?   We got contradictory answers.   So as we prepare for the Deputy Attorney General Mr. Rosenstein's  testimony before the Judiciary Committee tomorrow, we don't know if it  is Mr. Rosenstein who can appoint a special counsel. We don't know if  it is the Attorney General who has the power to do that.   We do know that the American people want it. Harvard University  released a poll that said over 60 percent of the American people  believe there should be a second special counsel to investigate Clinton  and the Clinton Foundation, largely as a consequence of this  intractable bias that we continue to see in the intelligence community.   So let's look at that bias as it is applied to Mr. Mueller and his  team.   We have no idea how Bob Mueller picked the members of his team. I  asked FBI Director Christopher Ray: Did people get on the Mueller team  because they hate President Trump? Was there any vetting? Was there any  review? Did we look at political contributions, political activity or  activism from these folks?   The FBI Director would not answer my question.   So here we are, unclear as to whether or not the standard to  investigate the President was a preexisting bias against him.   Mr. Speaker, I don't believe that it is a coincidence that the  Mueller team is populated by people who bring that bias with them and  who seemingly have acted upon it.   Mr. Weissmann, who is Mueller's number two, attended Hillary  Clinton's election night party. Are you really telling me we couldn't  find a number two in the Mueller investigation who wasn't at Hillary  Clinton's election night party? For goodness sake.   We also know that Mr. Weissmann sent emails to Sally Yates, praising  her for directly defying an order from the President. That should have  disqualified Mr. Weissmann, but we don't know if that was, in fact, the  qualifying factor that led him to be on this team.   Aaron Zebley is also a member of the Mueller team. He represented  Justin Cooper, who set up the Hillary Clinton email server. Could we  not have found people for the Mueller team who were not involved in  setting up an email server for Hillary Clinton?   He also used a hammer to smash BlackBerrys, destroying evidence. Mr.  Zebley may be a witness, yet he is on the Mueller team.   Jeannie Rhee. She defended the Clinton Foundation against FOIA  requests and now is involved in persecuting the President. In fact,  over half of the members of the Mueller team have financially  contributed to the campaigns of Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, or  both, and none of them contributed to Donald Trump.   I don't think it is a coincidence. I think it is ridiculous that the  Congress doesn't have any information about how these people were  selected, how they were vetted, how they were approved.   But it is not just the Mueller team. It is also the Department of  Justice. Bruce Ohr, the head of counter intelligence, meets with  Christopher Steele, who is the author of the dossier during the  campaign. Then after the campaign, he meets with Glenn Simpson.   All the while, Bruce Ohr, working at the Department of Justice, has a  spouse getting paid by the very people developing these lies about the  President to discredit him. It is smoking-gun evidence of bias and  conflict of interest.   But it is not just the Mueller team and the Department of Justice. It  is also the FBI. Andrew McCabe is the current Deputy Director of the  FBI. When he was the assistant agent in charge of the Washington field  office, he was sending out emails just weeks before the 2016 election  saying that the Hillary Clinton investigation would be given special  status, that it would be handled by a small team at headquarters.   What that means is that Hillary Clinton got different treatment than  any other American who would have been charged with the mishandling of  classified information in the Washington, D.C., area.   Absolutely outrageous. That special treatment didn't lead to a more  rigorous review. We know now that James Comey was drafting the  exoneration statement before even interviewing key witnesses, including  Hillary Clinton herself.                                time  1730    Then you have Peter Strzok, also at the FBI. Mr. Strzok has now been  discredited and demoted because he was sending 10,000 text messages  back and  [[Page H9832]]  forth with his mistress about how much he loved Hillary Clinton and  hated President Trump. I don't think it is a coincidence that Mr.  Strzok is the person who went in and changed the term ``grossly  negligent,'' which is a crime, to ``extremely careless,'' in the  exoneration statement about Hillary Clinton.   The Attorney General needs to do his job. He needs to appoint a  special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton because she was never  investigated in earnest in the first place. He needs to tell Robert  Mueller to put up or shut up.   If there is evidence of collusion, let us see it. We are almost a  year into this investigation, and the only thing I see is a bias that  continues to erode our institutions and our rule of law, and this  Congress should stand for it no more.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Jody B. Hice).   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz) for yielding.   I am greatly honored to be here to participate in this important  discussion. We all want transparency, and for that to be in our  government is critical to all of us. I am honored to be on the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee where this is part of the  responsibilities entrusted to us.   But after repeated scandals and misconduct, it is patently obvious to  me that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plays by her own  rules, and simply does so because of her own status, her own positions  of power and influence in the government, and has been in those roles  for decades. She has been getting a free pass to follow or ignore the  law as she chooses, whereas it seems, on the other hand, as has already  been discussed this evening, President Trump and his administration  seems to get a special counsel just for sneezing. It is insane what is  going  [[Page H9833]]  on, and we, as Americans, must prioritize equal justice under the law.   Lady Justice must remain blind, and her scales must remain balanced.  This is a fundamental principle for all of us as Americans--something  we cherish and something we hold on to--and we are watching it change  right before our eyes. It seems as though Lady Justice is peeking  underneath that blindfold, and that is simply unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored that we are coming to draw attention to  this horror and this change that is taking place. The principle of  blind justice is one of the most basic fundamental principles that we  have in this country, and without it we are watching individuals like  Mrs. Clinton and her allies act above the law and get away with things  they simply ought not be getting away with. And the truth is, a breach  of justice for one is a breach of justice for all of us.   Let me give you a quick example. Back in August of 2016, The New York  Times reported on generous foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation,  and this was done while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. That,  in itself, ought to raise some red flags, shouldn't it? Foreign  countries. And then we find out that many of these foreign countries  had already tremendous human rights violations: Kuwait, for example,  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and several others, just to name a few, yet they  are giving tons of money to the Clinton Foundation, while she is  Secretary of State.   And then the Clintons say: Well, we were open; we disclosed all of  the information about who was giving what. They tried to convince us  that they went above and beyond to disclose their donors, but they did  not do so.   For example, we found they failed to disclose $2.35 million in  donations from a family foundation that was linked to the mining  company, Uranium One, which we happen to be talking about tonight.   Well, who is Uranium One?   Of course, we know by now that this is a company that was taken over  by Russia's state-owned nuclear energy firm, Rosatom, another decision  that was signed off by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.   The dots are pretty easy to start connecting. We, at least, have some  red flags here.   Furthermore, there was a whopping $145 million given to the Clinton  Foundation by Uranium One's owners. I don't know about everyone else  here, but I would certainly know it if I received over $100 million  from Russian donors. Talk about Russian collusion. Shall we talk about  it? Let's have this discussion. That is the whole point of what we are  talking about here this evening. I would also be very concerned that  someone receiving this kind of money was free of bias or coercion when  they are getting this type of money.   But let me land the plane here. There is a full-fledged investigation  going on here into President Trump's interactions with Russia, but  where is the investigation on Hillary Clinton's activities with the  Russians?   The Obama administration attempted to sweep this situation under the  rug. They let her off the hook. That is a disgrace. It is in complete  disregard for our Nation's laws. And, perhaps, that in itself ought to  be something else that is looked into: the Obama administration's role  in all of this.   I am grateful that Attorney General Sessions is taking these  allegations seriously. I am hopeful that we can get to the bottom of  this and ensure that justice is served.    The FBI must investigate this thoroughly. We must have transparency  to make sure that Hillary Clinton is held accountable and reaffirm that  no one is above the law.   Enough is enough. We have got to go into this further.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz) for  his leadership on this.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan)  for joining us on the floor this evening. I particularly thank him for  his work in the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee. The  gentleman is correct. We just want our questions answered. We just want  to know: Did these things occur that would seem to evidence collusion  on the part of the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign with  Russians to influence the outcome of the election?  [[Page H9834]]    But our own Justice Department and our own FBI won't answer those  questions. Tomorrow we have Mr. Rosenstein before the Judiciary  Committee. I hope he does give us answers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Biggs), a fellow member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs) for his leadership on the Judiciary Committee. He is absolutely  right. We have to get answers to these questions. And if we don't, then  Congress can never have confidence in the outcome of any investigation.  And if we can't have confidence, then our constituents, the American  people, certainly can't either.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), another member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas. His  perspective as a former prosecutor and former judge certainly sheds a  tremendous amount of light on the stark days that we found ourselves in  with this biased effort against the President of the United States.   I would also like to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Jody B. Hice), and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) for  their contributions not only to this Special Order, but to this  critical discussion we are having in the country.   I will conclude with this, Mr. Speaker. Tomorrow, the Deputy Attorney  General will raise his right hand and swear to be truthful before the  Judiciary Committee, and we will ask these tough questions about  coordination with Democrats and the DNC and, potentially, the FBI to  gin up this false information about the President.   We will ask why a senior official at the Department of Justice had a  spouse who was working for the company that was trying to discredit our  President both before and after the election. And I hope he doesn't  give the same answers that we heard from the Director of the FBI, Mr.  Wray.   Mr. Wray said in response to almost all these questions: Well, we  have got an inspector general. Inspector generals sniff around all  these things, and if there is something wrong, we will make reforms  after we hear back.    The time is now. The danger to our country is clear and present if we  allow our duly-elected President to be undermined by these unfair and  biased tactics. So I am hopeful that we will move past the jargon and  just give straight answers to the American people to these very  legitimate questions that so many of our constituents are asking.   We should also remember that the inspector general process is far  from perfect. We heard from an inspector general, Mr. McCullough, who  said that, when he brought forward claims, he was threatened, his  family was threatened, his job was threatened, his agency was  threatened, and that he did not have an opportunity to tell the  American people the truth.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve the truth. The truth is that  there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. If there  was any collusion, it was the Democrats, it was the DNC, and it was  this nexus between Mr. Ohr and his spouse working for the very people  who were engaged in these devious tactics.  [[Page H9836]]    We deserve better, and we are going to be demanding better tomorrow  in the Judiciary Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
