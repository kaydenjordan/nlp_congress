 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer an amendment to the  INVEST in America Act to provide local transit agencies the flexibility  to develop large-scale transit improvement plans.   As Congress discusses legislation to reimagine and rebuild our  country's infrastructure and transit systems, the amendment I am  offering today provides additional flexibility, as transit agencies  group transit improvement projects together and allow more than one  project to be developed and financed at a time.   Specifically, if an agency pays more than the required 20 percent of  local funds to pay for a federally qualified project, the extra funds  they used on that project will be counted as a credit on another  project.   This will ensure that local agencies are able to maximize both the  Federal and local funds available to them to deliver large-scale  regional transit improvements.   As we reimagine and rebuild our country's infrastructure, this is  precisely the type of Federal-local partnership that will deliver the  highest value for our investment as we work to build for our future.
