 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we are grieving yet again today another  horrific mass shooting in a church in Texas--over 25 dead, others still  clinging to life. We were barely past our stage of grief as more than  50 people were shot dead and 500 were injured at a country music  concert in Las Vegas. Of course, every single night in this country,  parents and brothers and sisters go to bed having lost their loved  ones, and 90 people die every day from guns in this country.   I just think it is worth stating that this happens nowhere else other  than in the United States. This is not inevitable. This is not  something that we should accept. We are not impotent or helpless to try  to change the scope of tragedy that is crippling for families that have  to go through this.   I want everyone to take a quick look at this pretty simple chart. The  United States has more guns and more gun deaths than any other  developed country. It is not close, we are not even in the neighborhood  of any of our other G-20 competitor nations. While the President told  us the other day that this is a mental illness problem, one cannot  explain this outlier status through a story of mental illness because  none of these other countries have any lower rate of mental illness.  There are just as many people who are mentally ill in these countries  as there are in our country.   We cannot explain it by the attention we pay to mental illness. We  spend more money on treating mental illness than these countries do.  This isn't a mental illness problem. We have to do better in treating  people who have psychological disorders in this country, but the reason  that we are an outlier nation when it comes to the number of gun deaths  and the epic scale of our mass tragedies is explained by something  else.   Here is a quick story. This graphic shows the States that have  background check requirements on all gun sales in the private sector,  and here are the States that have no background check laws beyond those  that are required in Federal law. It is a fundamentally different story  when it comes to gun-related homicides. In the States that have  background check laws, the average rate of homicide is substantially  lower--substantially lower--than in States that haven't background  check laws. That is because in this country, with the loosest, most lax  gun laws in the industrialized world, private citizens are able to get  their hands on weapons that are designed not for hunting and not for  shooting for sport but to kill. These tactical assault-style weapons  are being used over and over in these mass tragedies, and more people  end up in harm's way.   Smarter gun laws--just making sure that the right people have guns,  not the wrong people--lead to less gun deaths. It is time for us to  admit that this is a uniquely American problem and that it deserves our  attention rather than our silence, which has been our response every  single session that I have been a Member of Congress.   This poster shows but a few of the faces that have been lost to gun  violence in this country. My small town of Sandy Hook is a broken  community. It is a beautiful, wonderful community, but it is a broken  community. The ripples of grief that come with losing that number of  children--beautiful children--all at one time never really gets  repaired. That small community in Texas, Sutherland Springs, will  suffer that same fate. It will be a community that will not ever truly  repair itself, having lost so many beautiful people at one moment. You  can't rewind the clock.   It is increasingly impossible for me to continue to go back to  Newtown, CT, and tell the people of that community that even after mass  murder after mass murder in this country, at a scale that occurs in no  other Nation, our response as a body is to do nothing. It is a level of  callousness that is frankly unexplainable to the victims of this  violence, and this macabre club of families that have had to deal with  the consequences of gun violence is getting bigger and bigger and  bigger.   Why? Because the number of people who die by guns is not going down.  It is not leveling off. It is exploding. Every year, more people--not  less people--are killed by guns in this country, and it seems to be the  only problem in which there is zero interest in this body to solve.  When a terrorist plows into civilians with a truck in New York City,  Republicans in this body are talking about policy change within hours,  but after somebody walks into a school or a church or a shopping mall,  we are told that there has to be a restraining order on policy debate  for days. It is ridiculous, and it is offensive to the families who  have gone through this.   So, let's just for a moment set aside the issues that I will admit  are unlikely to come up for a vote in this body between now and the end  of this session. I think it is unbelievable that universal background  checks, supported by 90 percent of Americans, can't get a vote here. I  don't think there is another issue like that in the American public,  where 90 percent of Americans agree on something and Congress can't  even conceive of getting it done.   The only place where background checks is controversial is in the  Congress. Every single gun owner I talk to  [[Page S7036]]  in my State wants to make sure that criminals and people who are  seriously mentally ill can't buy guns.   Similarly, let's admit what is happening here. It is not a  coincidence that the same kind of weapon is used every single time in  these shootings. These are copycat shootings in which people see the  kind of destruction that comes with an AR-15-style weapon, and they use  it again in order to maximize the lethality.   Wake up. Wake up to the reality that these weapons are being used to  murder with speed and power, and the killers are watching what happens  in Sandy Hook, what happens in Texas, what happens in Orlando, what  happens in Las Vegas, and they are repeating the process. They are  replicating the weapon. They shouldn't be in the hands of civilians.  You can have plenty of fun hunting without an AR-15 or AR-15-style  weapon. So let's set aside universal background checks and assault  weapons for a moment. I get the politics of this place. I understand  those are unlikely to pass.   Why, then, can't we work on the things that we know we agree on? I  have listened to dozens of Republicans in the House and the Senate  claim that they are for making real the prohibition on automatic  weapons. People shouldn't have fully automatic weapons in this country.  Nobody should be able to do what that guy did at an upper story window  in a hotel in Las Vegas, and the law that we all passed is being  ignored by companies that are selling these aftermarket modifications  that turn semiautomatic weapons into automatic weapons. The company  that sold the modification took it off the market, but only for a  couple of weeks. They are back to selling bump stocks again because we  have signaled that we are not going to do anything about it.   It is not enough to just tell the ATF to do it. Why? Because the law  is vague. The ATF said it was vague in 2010. All we have to do is  clarify it, but aftermarket modifications that turn semiautomatic  weapons into automatic weapons shouldn't be legal. It seems we have  agreement on that because I have listened to many Republicans saying  they are willing to take that step. Let's take it and stop talking  about it. Put legislation on the floor that says you cannot have an  automatic weapon in this country. Let's do it. We agree on it.    I didn't agree with the President yesterday when he said it is a  mental illness problem, but similarly we could work together to make  sure that people who are seriously mentally ill don't buy weapons. That  is the second noncontroversial policy proposal on which we could work  together. Let's just admit we are going the wrong way, not the right  way.   Earlier this year, Republicans passed a piece of legislation that  allowed for 75,000 people in this country who have serious mental  illness to be able to get off the list of prohibited purchasers and  start buying guns again. These are people who were judged to be so  mentally ill that they couldn't deposit a check. They were given  conservator status for Social Security purposes. These are people who  were so mentally ill, so limited in their cognitive abilities that they  couldn't take a Social Security check and deposit it. Those people were  prohibited from buying guns. This Congress passed a law earlier this  year to say that those people who can't deposit a check should be able  to go buy an assault weapon.   If we are serious about trying to stop people with mental illness  from getting weapons, let's work together on that instead of moving  backward.   Finally, it is an open secret that the existing background check  system is broken. Let's not pretend we just woke up yesterday in  amazement that the records of people who are seriously mentally ill or  have been convicted of crimes aren't ending up on the background  checklist.   I am holding in my hand the data that is available to every single  one of us about the records that are being uploaded onto the background  check system. For the Department of Defense, it is a whole bunch of  zeros. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force--zero, zero, zero, zero, zero,  zero, zero.   Similarly, States aren't doing their part either. Connecticut  uploaded 363,000 felony records onto the NICS system over the course of  2016. Colorado uploaded 10 felony records in 2016. New York uploaded  57,000 domestic violence records in 2016. North Carolina uploaded 261.  There weren't 261 people in North Carolina who were convicted of  domestic violence crimes in 2016; it is just that only 261 people went  up on the list. Many other States, like the Department of Defense, have  zeros in all of these columns. Many States are uploading no records  onto the system.   Now, admittedly, NICS tries to get those records through other means  when States don't give it to them, but it is an open secret that the  NICS system is broken. Congress at least tried to make some changes.  After the Virginia Tech shooting, Congress did pass a NICS improvement  bill, but it has not worked. It gave the Department of Justice the  power to withhold Federal funding if States don't upload records.  Despite the fact that there are a handful of States that have uploaded  no records to NICS--zero--no State has been penalized under that 2007  law. That is not a Republican or a Democratic problem. The Obama  administration didn't penalize States, and Republican Presidents didn't  penalize States. Why don't we work together on that?   A couple of years ago, the House passed additional funding to help  States, other jurisdictions, upload records. Why don't we find a way to  work together to at least make the existing background check system  work?   This feeling of helplessness that people have in this country, this  feeling of impotence that nothing can be done to change the trajectory  of violence in this country, the regular scroll across the bottom of  your TV screen telling you news of the latest mass shootings where  little kids and senior citizens are being gunned down in churches and  schools--that sense of helplessness isn't real; it is a fiction, an  invention of the gun lobby designed to make this place feel as if there  is nothing that can be done in order to make sure that they can  continue to make these obscene amounts of profits. There are things we  can do.   I understand that despite the popularity of background checks with  the public, we are probably not going to get a vote on that, but let's  work together to make sure that automatic weapons can't be in the hands  of civilians. Let's make real the very simple premise that seriously  mentally ill people shouldn't be able to buy guns. Let's fix the  background check system so that, as Republicans tell us over and over  again, at least we can enforce existing law. There are ways that we can  stop this slaughter, and I don't know how we live with ourselves, how  we sleep at night as a body if, in the face of these massacres, we  don't even do the stuff we all agree on.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, whenever a Higher Power is looking down on  us as we move through our daily lives, I imagine that He probably  doesn't see political borders. I imagine He probably doesn't care much  about the distinctions that we create to tell the difference between us  and others. He probably doesn't care much about walls and fences. He  cares about us as people. He looks at us, at how we conduct ourselves,  and at how we treat others.   We spend a lot of time here talking about the arbitrary divisions  between us, but in the end, when we face our Maker, it probably is just  about how we treated those around us, whether we tried to make their  lives a little bit better.   So I am on the floor this afternoon to talk about a handful of my  constituents who need our help, young people who we have labeled with  the term Dreamers, who came to this country not by their decision but  by the decision of their parents, when they were very, very young. They  are Americans in every sense of the word. They are beautiful, beautiful  young men and women, and they want us to see them as the beautiful  individuals they are. They don't want to be labeled. They don't want to  be put into the middle of a divisive political dialogue. They just want  our help.    We all hear from them because there is no State that doesn't have  these kids. There are 800,000 who have officially registered under the  existing law that provides them with protection. They are in every  single congressional district.   I thought it would be useful for my colleagues to hear from just a  few of them today because they can tell the story of why we need to  give citizenship, permanent protection, to these kids at the very  least, if not their parents and others who have been waiting for a long  time for comprehensive immigration reform. They can tell this story  better than I can.   Vania from Willimantic is a student at Eastern Connecticut State  University. I want to read what she wrote to me. She said:         I was born in Mexico, and I was brought to the United       States at the age of 3 and have been living in Willimantic       since. I am 19 now. I grew up in Willimantic, Connecticut,       and I consider it my home. It's where I grew up, where I went       to school, where I made friends, and where all my memories       are.        As an undocumented student in the United States, you are       constantly unsure of what your future may hold, but not       because you're indecisive or unsure of what you are going to       do, but rather because you don't ultimately have power of       your own future. At a young age I always knew I wanted to go       to college; however, I also knew that because of my status, I       might have not been able to carry out that goal. However, I       didn't let it discourage me. I like many other undocumented       students did the best we could and constantly strived to be       the best at anything we did, and now, thanks to DACA, all       that hard work has finally begun to pay off.        See, DACA is more than just a legal status; it is the       puzzle piece that many of us have been missing in order to       reach our goals. It has allowed me to get a Social Security       number, a driver's license, but more importantly, a higher       education.  [[Page S7050]]         Growing up, I constantly had all my teachers say to me: Do       good in school, try your best at anything you do, stay out of       trouble, and you are guaranteed to go far in life.    Let me step out of her comments for a second. Boy, if that is not an  encapsulation of the American dream--``do good in school, try your best  at anything you do, stay out of trouble, and you are guaranteed to go  far in life''--I don't think I could find a better way to encapsulate  what we hope is the story for every single child in this country.   Vania said:         So that is exactly what I did. Most other DACA recipients       did the exact same, but it currently doesn't seem enough for       this government. There is no longer a fight for a work permit       but rather a fight for my human rights. I am just as worthy       to live here and carry out my goals as any other natural born       citizenship. I have done my best, consistently contributed to       society in a positive way. This is my home. I deserve to feel       safe here, and I will continue to fight for that until I do.    Mirka is from Wallingford, CT, and she is a Southern Connecticut  State University student. She said:         I came here from Mexico sixteen years ago. I am currently a       senior at Southern Connecticut State University, studying       bilingual education.        We need more good people in bilingual education.        I just started student teaching last week, but all that is       in danger. Besides being able to get a license and work       permit, DACA has allowed me to follow through on my passion       of becoming a teacher. It has given me hope that I have a       future career in education and that I can live my life       without fear of deportation.    An in-need profession--bilingual educators. Somebody willing to  devote their life to our kids needs our help.   Faye in Norwalk says:         I am one of the more than 800,000 DACA recipients in the       United States. I am from Trinidad and Tobago and have been in       the United States almost 19 years. I live in Norwalk, CT, and       I have lived there for about 16 years. It is home to me.    You hear that over and over again: It is home to me.         I am currently a Lead Radiology Scheduler, and I have a       second job working at Ulta, both of which I enjoy. My goal in       working both jobs is to purchase my first home.    That is another very critical component of the American dream--home  ownership.         Growing up, I wanted to be a homeowner. I wanted a place       that I could call mine, and with DACA I saw that as a       possibility. Now I'm not sure when or if that would come       through, but I still will continue to work hard because in my       heart I know God is bigger than even this moment, and I know       that we will be victorious. Even in a land that would not       allow me to claim it as my home, I want to buy a house of my       own to call my home. One day I will be called American not       just among my undocumented community but by a Nation.    I mean, listen, we have some very articulate people in this body,  Republicans and Democrats. I am not sure that any of us could write  something that poignant, that beautiful, and that compelling: I am not  sure if any of that will come through, but I am going to continue to  work hard because in my heart I know that God is bigger than even this  moment, and I know that we will be victorious. Even in a land that  would not allow me to claim it as my home, I want to buy a house to  call it my home. One day I will be called an American not just among my  community but by my Nation.   There are 4,900 DACA recipients in just my State alone. I have met a  lot of them. Frankly, maybe not everyone is as beautifully articulate  as Faye, but, boy, they have done some very impressive things with  their lives, maybe in part because they always knew that their status  here was in jeopardy and they had to make the most of their time in the  United States, not knowing when it would end, knowing that they had  opportunities here in the United States that they simply would not and  could not have if they ever went home, especially those kids who came  here when they were 3 years old, going back home to a place where they  might not even speak the language--they certainly know no one--a place  where opportunity is farther off even for those who were born there.  They worked hard, and they hustled a little bit more, knowing that they  might be at risk of some day being pushed out of this country.   They are Americans. Every single one of these students, these  Dreamers, use the phrase ``This is home.'' And they want our help.   I think this is a moral issue, first and foremost. It is how we treat  each other. These people are our neighbors. They are our coworkers.   Eight hundred business leaders--CEOs from companies such as Walmart,  Target, Facebook, Pepsi, Kaiser--want them to stay here because they  are their employees. They know how much they add to the economic bounty  of this country. They wrote to us and asked for us to provide permanent  protection for these kids.   Seventy-five national colleges and universities, including all the  ones in my State--Yale, Trinity, Connecticut College, the State  universities--said the same thing. They want to educate these kids.  They see them. They see what stellar students they are, and they just  can't imagine the United States deciding to send 800,000 of these  incredibly capable kids away.   One hundred eighty-six civil and human rights groups running the  gamut say: This is a moral and civil rights issue. Let these kids stay.   Because of President Trump's decision to telegraph the end of the  temporary protection for these students, the burden is now on us,  Republicans and Democrats, to do something and do something soon. It is  hard to describe the psychological toll on these kids right now. I  mean, it was bad enough when they were pushed into the shadows. It got  a little bit better when they got temporary protection. But now that we  have put a clock on, now that they have revealed themselves to the  world and put themselves on a list that can allow them to be targeted,  there is a little bit of their soul that atrophies every day as they  wonder whether we are going to come together and do the right thing.  Part of the reason part of them is crumbling inside is because they see  themselves as being made political pawns in a bigger game here.   It would be so easy for us to decide to protect these kids. Just do  it now. Don't wait until the end of the year. Don't wait until this  issue is mixed together with all sorts of other must-pass legislation.  Just come together right now and step up and give these kids some  degree of confidence that they can be here.   I have heard so many of my Republican colleagues say they want to do  that. Why wait? Why push this up until the last minute? Do it right  now. It is the right thing to do.   In the end, whoever is up there does not look at borders. He looks at  us. He looks into our soul. He thinks about how we treat those who need  our help and our protection. And no one needs our help and protection  more than these kids right now--5,000 of them in my State and 800,000  of them across the country.   So my plea is simple, Mr. President: Let's do this and do this now.  Let's give permanent protection, citizenship, pathways to citizenship,  to these beautiful boys and girls, men and women. Don't make this issue  about politics. Don't make it about parties. Don't make these kids a  bargaining chip in a bigger game. Just do the right thing. I promise  you, if you do, you won't regret it.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
