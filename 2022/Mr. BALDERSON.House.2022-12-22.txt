 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to our  colleague and my dear friend, the Representative from Ohio's Seventh  Congressional District, Congressman   Bob Gibbs.   Throughout his more than 20 years of public service in both the Ohio  legislature and Congress, Bob has been a steady and strong advocate for  his constituents and a trusted voice on agriculture and waterway  issues.   While we will miss seeing him here on Capitol Hill, I know he is  looking forward to many new adventures and time spent with his  grandkids back on the farm.   To his bride, Jody, get that honey-do list updated. He is all yours  now.                            ____________________
