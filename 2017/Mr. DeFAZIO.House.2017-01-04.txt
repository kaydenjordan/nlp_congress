 Mr. Speaker, during this last Presidential election  year, there was a tremendous amount of discussion about the Nation's  infrastructure and the need for investment to make America more  competitive and move goods and our citizens more efficiently.   There wasn't a lot of particular discussion about ports, but they are  an incredibly important part of our infrastructure. More than $470  billion of exports went through America's ports. Three-quarters of our  exports are waterborne through these ports around the United States.   Now, the Corps of Engineers says that, of our 59 busiest ports  depicted here, they are fully available less than 35 percent of the  time, and that is even before we begin to deal with the larger cargo  ships that are going to be coming through the expanded Panama Canal to  the Southeast and other ports in the United States, and that is because  of a lack of funding.   Now, obviously, that is a very difficult problem. We are estimating  about a $20 billion shortfall over the next 10 years in funding. Where,  oh where, could Congress find that money? Actually, we already have it.   Now, Congress, in its wisdom in 1986, with the cooperation and  consent of shipping interests, imposed a tax, an ad valorem tax, on the  value of imports. It is a very small tax, but it adds slightly to the  cost of any good that any American buys every day that is imported.   Now, Americans are paying the tax and Congress is stealing the money.  Yep, that is true--for stupid purposes, no less. We are pretending to  make the deficit smaller by collecting twice as much tax as we invest  in our ports.   Meantime, we are forgoing the investment that is needed in those  ports to become even more efficient and more competitive in the world  economy. Congress is collecting the tax, yet the Budget Committee and  the appropriators here in the Republican House are saying: Let's hide  that money over here. We will put it in the Treasury harbor maintenance  trust fund. Don't worry. It's there. Some day we might spend it.   Nine billion dollars today--$9 billion--that would address half of  the long-term shortfall in our ports. This could be an incredible boon  for shippers, for American competitiveness, and for jobs in this  country. We don't have to levy a new tax. All we have to do is spend  the tax that is being collected from the American people by jacking up  the price of imported goods for the purpose for which it is lawfully  intended.   Now, the appropriators don't like it because, hey, they don't get to  mess around with it, and the Budget Committee doesn't like it because  that means they either have to look like they have another half a  billion dollars a year of deficit or they would have to raise some  funds somewhere else to spend somewhere else.   But the point is this money should be spent as intended. So today I  am sending a letter to President-elect Trump. He has said time and time  again he wants to invest in our infrastructure. Obviously, it is going  to be a little longer term before we get to surface because we are  going to have to raise additional revenues there to deal with our  crumbling roads, bridges, and transit systems.   But for our ports, we don't have to wait. Day one, he can send a  message to Congress saying: Hey, get off your butts down there and  spend that money for the purpose for which the tax was collected. Stop  gouging the American taxpayers and shorting our ports.   It's time to do things a little differently around here, and I am  hopeful that the President perhaps will tweet about this and get some  action out of the Republican majority like he did yesterday in  reversing them on a rather drastic change to the rules of the House.                            ____________________
