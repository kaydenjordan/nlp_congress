 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of all women across  the Nation, to ensure they will be paid fairly based on their work  performance, not their gender.   Mr. Speaker, I am blessed with three young daughters. My oldest  daughter, `Ale'aokalani, who, as we speak, is studying at Juan Diego  High School in Draper, Utah, is preparing to embark on her own journey  as a grown woman. She is smart, talented, and, most of all, a hard  worker.   But right now, in our country, she and my two younger daughters are  faced with insurmountable odds that no amount of hard work or diligence  can overcome. As Native Hawaiian women, they are estimated to only make  63 cents to every dollar that their White male peers would make working  the exact same job.   The Paycheck Fairness Act guarantees they will no longer have to  fight for the same rights and paychecks as men.   Mr. Speaker, equal pay for equal work, it is as simple as that.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on April 15, 2021, I was unable to vote on  the first three votes in the series because I had unavoidable conflict.
