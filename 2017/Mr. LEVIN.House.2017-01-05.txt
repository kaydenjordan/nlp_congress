 Mr. Speaker, any measure that seeks to promote a peaceful  resolution to tensions between Israelis and Palestinians--whether  coming from the United Nations or from this Chamber--should provide a  balanced picture of the facts on the ground and the challenges  confronting both sides. The recent UN Security Resolution on Israeli  settlements failed that test by blaming Israel almost solely for  impeding a two-states solution for peace and by using prejudicial  language that places an unfair burden on Israel in depicting the basis  for future negotiations. Calling any settlement activity by Israel  since 1967 a major obstacle to peace, as the UN resolution does,  ignores the reality that geographical adjustments will have to be made  as part of any two-states solution reached by parties through direct  negotiations.   However, the resolution before us today is also not balanced in that  it too ignores conditions on the ground. Expressing the sense of  Congress to repeal the UN Resolution does not focus on the increasingly  fragile state of the two-states solution, and on conditions that make  its potential achievement increasingly difficult to obtain. Prime  Minister Netanyahu has called his government the most pro-settlement in  history. President-elect Trump further diminishes chances for the two- states solution by choosing envoys who undercut the prospects for peace  by expressing support for major settlement expansions, and whose  opposition to a two-states solution reinforces opposition within the  Israeli government. These positions threaten to continue to move  momentum dangerously away from the possibility of a two-states  solution.   I believe that the two-states approach, as challenging as it is to  achieve, is the only way to ensure a Jewish and democratic state of  Israel living in security with a non-militarized Palestinian state. It  is important for peace in the Middle East and U.S. national interests.   This resolution is at present the only vehicle to express my concerns  with the UN resolution, and I will therefore support it. However, I  will continue to speak out on further actions that I believe will  diminish the chance of a two-states solution and on other issues vital  to peace in the Middle East.
