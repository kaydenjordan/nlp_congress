 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Yoho) for yielding to me, and I appreciate very much the work that  is done by Dr. Ted Yoho here in this Congress.   I would like to have the Members know, Madam Speaker, that Ted Yoho  gets up every day and grinds away with an eye towards making America  great again and putting us in the right place. And I recall a meeting  that he called together here, kind of an off-campus meeting about how  we are going to save America from a Congress that doesn't seem to want  to look to the horizon, let alone over the horizon.   There is a lot of common sense that has been put together in this  immigration policy, and I want to carefully evaluate all of the  components of it. I know that we are in discussions right now about how  it might even be improved a little bit, but I am open to this  discussion, and I think he has brought up some very important points.   I will add one that I hope can be incorporated into this, to take the  E-verify mandatory piece of this and expand it into a bill that I have  had before this Congress a number of years. It is called the New IDEA  Act, and it would work actually seamlessly with what has been described  here tonight in that I incorporate the language in it, which is this:   When an employer--we put together a committee, a three-way team, the  IRS, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland  Security, and require them to work together for the cause of enforcing  immigration law and, in addition to the penalties that have been  suggested here, deny the deductibility of wages and benefits paid to  illegals.   I would give the employer safe harbor if they use E-verify, but if  they are then using illegal labor, the IRS, in a normal audit, not an  accelerated audit, then would come in, run the Social Security numbers  and identifying information of the employees who are listed in the tax  forms through the E-verify program.   If they can't be verified, the IRS then could deduct the wages and  benefits paid to them, remove it as a business expense, which puts  those dollars, wages, and benefits paid to illegals into the gross  receipts where they show up as net income. That makes it taxable.   When we first did this math, it would be, if you would take a $10-an- hour illegal and deny the deductibility of that under the old tax  policy, it would take us to a $16-an-hour illegal. We also would have  interest and penalty, and there is a 6-year statute of limitations.   Madam Speaker, I got to this conclusion by asking the question: What  agency, what department is most respected, and maybe even most feared,  by the American people?   Since I have been drug through audits a few too many times, I will  tell you that the business people, the employers in this country, they  don't want the IRS looking into their books, and they don't see that  they can negotiate much of a compromise with the IRS.   So I think giving a 6-year statute of limitations on that, you  accumulate that liability, and it makes it far more likely that  employers will voluntarily go in and clean up their workforce. That is  something that, had that been done years ago, we wouldn't be in the  situation we are in today.   The labor situation that we have, it is a bit more complex down in  the southern part of the United States than it is up in the heart of  the heartland where I am. And that is that we seem to be able to find  the people to climb in the tractor, in the combine, or in the trucks  and get our crops in the ground; we get them back out again; and it is  a little smoother up that way.   The labor situations that we see in places like Florida and  California and Arizona, all those States, and many more in particular,  that is a different kind of a situation.   What I would suggest, though, is that temporary workers be required  to be bonded. I introduced legislation to do that, and I hope that is  something we can discuss, as well, is incorporating it into this  proposal.   I pointed that out to the President in a meeting in the Oval Office  sometime back. He seemed to respond very favorably to that suggestion.  I pointed out that he actually has the authority to go forward with a  bonding program now. And so I noticed that, a few weeks later, he  issued an order that directed the executive branch to do the research  and put the pieces together so that they can activate a bonding  program.   But think of it this way: Whether you are going to be a guest worker  in the United States or a visitor to the United States, you need a visa  to come to America to do that.   So when you apply for that visa, you post your credit card, just as  if you walked into a hotel and they say: Your room is paid for, but we  need a credit card so we can hold for any incidentals that might come.   You post that credit card on your visa application to temporarily  come to America, and if you go back under the terms of the visa, then,  fine, the hold is released on that credit card; but if you overstay  your visa, then that credit card is charged for that fee, and that fee  goes into an enforcement fund in order to enforce the immigration laws  we have in this country.   We need the rule of law restored in the United States of America. No  place, in all of our law, is it less respected than it is in  immigration law.   And as I listened to some of the rhetoric over here on the floor  tonight, it still is breathtaking to hear how intentionally the terms  ``legal'' and ``illegal'' immigrant are conflated so that the very  meritorious legal immigrant who respects our laws, that meritorious  legal immigrant is conflated into the same term with the one who has  disrespected our laws. The one who has disrespected our laws gets  assigned the same merit that exists for those who respect our laws and  want to come to America for an opportunity to succeed and to prosper.    But I make another point, Madam Speaker, that I don't hear in this  dialogue on immigration, and that is that America has a unique vigor.  We have a unique vitality. We have a can-do spirit. And a lot of that  vitality, vigor, and can-do spirit comes from the legal immigrants who  have had the aspiration to come to America.  [[Page H7455]]    And I would say that, if there is a family of 10 siblings, boys and  girls together, if one of them has the ambition and the eagerness to  respect our laws and come to the United States, the one who chooses to  self-select to come here is going to be the one in that family who has  the most ambition, the most vigor.   That is one of the reasons why America is a can-do country, because  we have gotten that quality of people who self-selected as legal  immigrants to come to America.   So I appreciate the gentleman's work on the immigration policy, and I  look forward to examining all of the language there and have an open  dialogue on this. But I also applaud the very diligent effort that has  gone forth on this issue and many others.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Yoho), and I would add that, one of the things that crosses my  mind, as I talk and listen here this evening, is that the Social  Security numbers, multiple uses of a single number--it might even be  all zeroes, and all zeroes might be used a thousand times in America,  or more.  [[Page H7456]]    So I hear these stories, and some of the employers will say: Well, we  have followed all of the laws that we are required to follow.   But common sense isn't something that we hold them accountable for,  apparently, and so the Social Security Administration, under Barack  Obama started issuing no-match letters.                                time  1800    No-match letters used to go out to say this Social Security number  that you are using isn't a match. Then it should go to the employer,  too, and I believe it used to.   I understand that the Trump administration may be picking that back  up again and issuing the no-match letters, but that is not where it  should stop. That is where it should begin.    In 1986, when the Amnesty Act was signed by Ronald  Reagan, there was a requirement that each employer would have I-9  documents that would be filed.   As soon as applicants came in, we took a copy of their information.  We took the I-9 documents. We kept them in our files carefully. Any  individual who came in and applied, we had the right file, expecting  INS--Immigration and Naturalization Services, at that time--personnel  to be at our door anytime, poking through all of our records, which  records are probably still sitting in my archives somewhere.   That was going to work. They believed it was going to work. What  happened was, slowly along the way, the ACLU filed lawsuits, and people  kind of ducked and dodged. They found a way to rationalize a way around  it until they got around to: Well, as an employer, I can't be required  to make a judgment call. If I am looking at a picture of someone, I  can't be sure that that is the face of the person who is in front of  me.   They would make the presumption that was best for their business  interests rather than best for the law enforcement part of it.   Then, if ICE doesn't show up when the no-match letters come through,  because they are not cooperating with the Social Security  Administration to go through those records when it is very probable  that when a Social Security number is being used maybe in 10 places, in  10 different towns, you can't get to 10 jobs simultaneously. It should  make sense that nine or at least eight of those are phony. They ought  to go in and identify those employers and employees and, if there are  law violations, bring charges against them.   That hasn't been happening for years in this country. It needs to  happen.   This component that you proposed looks to me like it is an  improvement, to segment off some of this, but I still say we need to go  into the Social Security no-match and fix that.    Madam Speaker, I wanted to add another piece to  this. This is an observation that I think applies across this country  and a lot of places today.   Some of my constituents made a practice of going out through the  parking lot at the packing plant and picking up the check stubs on  payday that were dropped down on the asphalt. Then, they stack a bunch  of them up, put them in a big manila envelope that would kind of spring  like an accordion, and mail it off to me.   Here it comes in my mailbox. What is this? There is no letter, no  message, no return address. Just my address on there and all these  check stubs with no names on them.   But the withholding, it tells me, is zero, zero, zero. No State  withholding. No Federal withholding.   What that tells me is that we have a lot of people who are working  unlawfully in America, that when they apply, they claim the maximum  number of dependents, so there is zero withholding at the wage scale  they have for Federal income tax or State income tax.   Yet, they still say they are paying taxes. Well, yes, there is sales  tax. I suppose, in the rent, you are paying a share of the property  tax. Some of those things are taking place. But that is another place  the system is gamed by using Social Security numbers.   I am hopeful that the gentleman has zeroed in on a way to address  that.    Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to have the  opportunity to address you here on the floor of the United States House  of Representatives and continue some of this dialogue.   I am changing the subject a little bit here this evening, Madam  Speaker. I wanted to take up the topic that had this House of  Representatives tied up in knots last January, about January 15 or so.   I was the direct subject of those things, and it has to do with, to  refresh people's memory, a misquote on me that came out of The New York  Times that alleged that I had tied three phrases together. Two of them  are odious ideologies, and one of them is one of the most meritorious  ideologies that the world has ever seen. Those two, it was a misquote  by The New York Times.   I believe that I have introduced a document that has been publicly  available since sometime last March 6, it is dated, that makes it very  clear that The New York Times misquoted me and that a lot of the media  out there that went into a hyperventilation fit was jumping on an issue  that we have seen the pattern of many times over.   I came across a little comment about The New York Times that said,  ``All the news that fits the narrative.'' Well, that seems to be what  happened last January 10, when they wrote a story on me about all the  news that fits the narrative, the narrative that they had created, not  necessarily the facts.   I would point out, Madam Speaker, that there has been a whole series  of narratives out here that turned out to be inactionable or, perhaps,  false. I would say that the biggest one and the one that tied America  up in knots the longest and most intensely were the allegations against  Justice Brett Kavanaugh.   Of all of the folks who had accused him, none of their allegations  held up. They were not corroborated in any way. It was clear that he  was targeted because they didn't want a conservative constitutionalist  sitting on the bench.   I am very thankful he is sitting on the bench, and I am also very  thankful and grateful of the way he conducted himself throughout those  hearings.   That is not the first time we have seen this. I felt great sympathy  for Justice Clarence Thomas when he endured what he referred to as a  high-tech lynching back in the early 1990s. The allegations made  against him were hyperventilation of the first order, and it was maybe  the worst that we had seen.   I go back even further to Judge Bork, who became a verb when he was  ``borked'' by the United States Senate. Allegations against him became,  at a certain point, untenable and unsurvivable, from his career  standpoint.   These people that I have mentioned so far were all wronged.   Let me put another one in, Madam Speaker: Covington Catholic boys  down here by the Lincoln Memorial, standing there, respectfully and  patiently, while a musical device was being pounded in front of one  young man's face.   That turned into better than a week of intense media assaults and  attacks, verbally and keyboard-wise, against those Covington Catholic  boys because the media's narrative fit their narrative.   All the news that fits their narrative, but not the truth, and not  stepping back to take an objective look to try to understand what is  going on.   It is seldom that the world is as bad as the media would like to tell  us that it is. The Covington Catholic boys were exonerated when the  camera was panned back, and we looked at it as America within the full  context of what was going on. They were patiently enduring and  experiencing something that I am sure was a unique experience for them.    They hadn't spent time to speak of here in Washington, D.C. They  hadn't been involved in a demonstration of that kind. Just innocent  young men, clean-cut, one of them wearing a Make America Great cap,  probably more of them doing that, and patiently there.   People would say: Have you ever seen such a punchable face? I would  call it a very innocent face of a young man who kept a tight little  smile on his face while he waited for that drum to be finished being  beat in front of his face.   I would add another one about that same period of time, Madam  Speaker, Michael Cohen, the President's attorney at that period of  time, or former attorney. The news media was all over that Michael  Cohen had been directed to lie to Congress by the President of the  United States, Donald Trump. That was a story that lived for 4 or 5 or  more days until the truth came out that that narrative was false.   False narratives on Justice Kavanaugh, false narratives on the  Covington Catholic boys, false narratives on Michael Cohen.   Then, we had, at about the same time, the story on Jussie Smollett,  who said that he had been attacked and, apparently, attempted to be  lynched by some folks of the opposite race that he is.   It turned out that, when we saw the videos of who was buying this  rope and the other material in the store not very far from there, those  folks were not there to attack Jussie Smollett because of anything to  do with race. It had to do with what surely appears to be a hoax. Now,  we have a Federal investigation into the prosecuting attorney in  Chicago who found a way to turn Jussie Smollett loose.   That is another case where the narrative that was delivered by the  media day after day after day was false, but it was the narrative that  told the story that they wanted to be told, all the news that fits the  narrative.   We have another one here that just recently passed behind us just a  few days back. Georgia State Representative Erica Thomas made an  argument and cried in front of the media that she got into an  altercation in a store and was told by a man to ``go back where you  came from.''                                time  2015    And after that was scrutinized, and after the video was watched, and  after the people that were witnesses there finally came forward and got  their narratives out, we found out that that story wasn't true either.  It was all the news that fit the narratives of The New York Times and  others, but it wasn't true, and she finally admitted it.   I have just listed some along here.   Madam Speaker, here are some other stories that were put before us  where there has been no consequence and no action taken; there is  Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia, just across the Potomac, who was  either the fellow in blackface or the fellow in the KKK costume. We are  not sure which but, apparently, he is one of them, but no action was  taken on that.   That was a long time ago. I am okay with acknowledging what took  place; looking at the man that he is today. But the hyperventilation  around that was very intense, and it was also a narrative that the news  media wanted to be true.   I believe one of those two things seems to have a lot of legs.   Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, multiple accusations of sexual  assault; no action down there.   The Attorney General Mark Herring confessed that he was in blackface.  No action down there. So there is a stalemate in Virginia.   No consequence for these three allegations in Virginia. No  consequence so far for Jussie Smollett. No consequence so far for Erica  Thomas. We saw all those things.   Madam Speaker, by the way, I will point out that I have not been  critical of the statements made by Members of Congress, no matter how  much press they have gotten.   The Quad Squad has gotten a lot of press for certain statements. They  do have a right to freedom of speech. But with regard to AOC, and Ilhan  Omar, and Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley, some of those statements  that are made are on their face pretty stark.  [[Page H7458]]    I think our job here in America is to recognize that people have a  right to freedom of speech. It is a constitutional guarantee.   I sat with some people that were, I will say, significantly seasoned  in the world and in the business world. These folks were out of Europe.  And I said to them: You need constitutional protection for freedom of  speech in the same way, along the lines that we have in America,  because we are protected. We can say what we want to say; freedom of  speech, religion, the press, and to peaceably assemble, and to petition  the government for redress of grievance. That is America.   The ability to express our thoughts and our ideas and freely exchange  them with others generates other ideas. Bad ideas drift by the wayside  after they are examined in open public dialogue; and good ideas get  legs, as you saw tonight with Congressman Yoho lifting his immigration  bill up before everyone for an opportunity to debate.   Good ideas sustain themselves. Bad ideas, if you have a rational  public that believes in the age of reason--and we need to be sustaining  this age of reason--then the world gets to be a better place.   If we suppress thoughts and we suppress dialogue, if we tell people  they don't have freedom of speech, if we punish them for exercising  their constitutional right to freedom of speech, it diminishes all of  us because then we don't have competing ideas. We only have the  repetition of politically correct utterances; and that is not going to  sustain the greatest nation the world has ever seen. It was built on  these freedoms.   America was built on freedom of speech, religion, and the press, the  Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, the property rights  that are in the Fifth Amendment, no double jeopardy, you face a jury of  your peers. And the rights that are not enumerated in the Constitution  devolve to the people or the States respectively.   We are built on free enterprise, capitalism, and Judeo-Christian  values. We are descended from the full flow of Western civilization  that comes here to America; and today we are the flagship of Western  civilization.   Now I have named all of this, but I want to state, again, AOC, Ilhan  Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, and every other Member of this  United States Congress, and everyone in the United States of America  has a God-given right to freedom of speech, and thought, and  expression, and religion, and assembly, and press. And if we don't  protect those rights, America devolves towards the Third World, not  ascending onward and upward into the shining city that was so well and  eloquently envisioned by Ronald Reagan.   So if we disagree with what someone says, we can state our opposition  and our reasons why; and we need to have respectful disagreement here  in this Congress.   The debates that have taken place here over the years have shaped the  fabric of America. We often say this is the greatest debate body in the  world here. I am not as convinced of that today, or this year, as I was  up to this point.   When I see that there was a false allegation made against me, a  misquote in The New York Times, intentional or not, has turned into  something that is supposedly a fact; and then, the things that are  clearly not facts are repeated over and over again by a media that  wants their narrative to be true.   So there was a resolution that came to the floor here in the House  that was--I am named in the first paragraph. This is H. Res. 41, on  January 15 of 2019, and it starts out this way: ``Whereas, on January  10, 2019, Representative   Steve King was quoted as asking, `White  nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization--how did that  language become offensive?' ''   That is part of the quote, not all of it. It is not even quoted in  the context that the article quoted it in. But that is actually a true  statement that is a quote that was published in The New York Times, and  that is what it says, Whereas,   Steve King was quoted as saying this.   And then there are a whole series of whereases here that reject the  odious ideology that White supremacy and White nationalism--there are a  whole lot of other odious ideologies, and some of them are openly  defended here on the floor of this House of Representatives, not either  one of those, not by me, and not by anybody.    I agreed with those whereases all the way down. In fact, the  rejection that I had put into this Congressional Record the previous  Friday was more clear and more stark, and it rejected those odious  ideologies more distinctly and more effectively than the resolution  that was introduced by Mr. Clyburn.   All those whereases I agree with. I got down to the resolve of this  resolution. It says: ``Resolved, that the House of Representatives once  again rejects white nationalism and white supremacy as hateful  expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that  define the people of the United States.''   Agreed again.   So, Madam Speaker, I am making this point that the world seems to  forget that I supported this resolution, because it was true. All it  said about me was that The New York--that I had been quoted as saying  that. That is true. The New York Times quoted me as saying that. I  don't have any reason to disagree with this. I voted for it, and I  asked all of the Members to vote for it for a number of reasons; but  one of them was, I didn't want to see this Congress split over  something like this.   Why are we policing something of this nature?   Why does Congress think that we should police the speech of Members  on the floor here, especially if it doesn't violate the rules, or  outside these Chambers?   Never in the history of the United States House of Representatives  has a Member been removed from committees because of even an accurate  quote by the press outside these walls. It didn't take place in this  building or on the Capitol grounds in any way whatsoever.   Never has even an accurate quote been used to sanction a Member of  Congress.   So we have, instead, a misquote that was in a 56-minute telephone  interview with The New York Times reporter who asserted--and our  Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that he talked to him on the  phone--he said he could type as fast as anybody can talk and he can  punctuate accurately. So I am wondering why he stopped me a couple of  times in that 56-minute interview and asked me to repeat a sentence so  that he could get it right.   In fact, I am going to guess that there isn't anybody that can take a  conventional typewriter and type accurately and punctuate accurately at  the speed that I talk in a normal conversation.   In fact, the wonderful Christy over here, and her magic keyboard, can  barely keep up at about 250 words a minute when I am rolling along. And  I feel a little sorry for her, but I like her a lot.   And so that is my point: There is no reporter that is even capable of  doing that. But he has convinced Kevin McCarthy that he is the ``magic  finger man'' and he couldn't possibly make a mistake; not with a  hyphen; not with comma; not with a voice inflection.   Oh, by the way, this is going be a little harder now, Christy,  because Zig Ziglar used to use this to describe how things can be  misconstrued. And I am saying that this quote was more than  misconstrued. It just happened to fit the narrative that The New York  Times and a number of other liberal organizations wanted.   But Zig Ziglar would put it out this way: There are four different  ways, and it is going to be printed all the same way in the  Congressional Record, and then I am going to explain what is different.   But, Madam Speaker, for those that are, say, watching on C-SPAN, to  understand how language works, it works like this: He would say, I  never said she stole the money, with the emphasis on the word ``she''.  That says one thing: I never said she stole the money.   Another way to say the same words are: I never said she stole the  money, with the emphasis on the word ``stole''.   Another one is, I never said she stole the money, with the emphasis  on the word ``I''.   And the last one is: I never said she stole the money, with the  emphasis on the word ``money''. There are four different meanings that  come out of exactly the same words.  [[Page H7459]]    And Kevin McCarthy, and a handful of others, believe that somehow the  punctuation that was in The New York Times, and the hyperventilation  that emerged on the punctuation of The New York Times, is justifiable  to attempt to disenfranchise 755,000 Iowans. And he doesn't remember or  acknowledge that more people voted for me in the last election than  they did Kevin McCarthy, or the chair of the Republican Conference.   And the legitimacy that was conferred upon me was conferred after any  other allegation other than this misquote that happens to be of The New  York Times.   Now, I would add, handling language in this way is this way; that the  dialogue that went on in that 56-minute interview was a dialogue that  the reporter refuses to even speculate as to what question it was that  he might have asked me.   I'm pretty sure that he didn't have that typed out in his notes  either, so he doesn't know the question.   But I am going to submit that it was about the discussion that had to  do with the weaponization of language; the weaponization of language  that has been calculated by the left.   And I happen to know that there was a meeting in the Mandarin Hotel  here in Washington, D.C. that commenced on November 12, 2016; and that  was going to be a meeting on how to exploit the Hillary presidency if  she was going to be President-elect on that day, when that 3-day  conference began.   But as it turned out, it was President-elect Donald Trump that they  had to react to and figure out how they were going to take the highest  levels of the Democratic Party that emerged in the Mandarin Hotel,  including George Soros, whose picture was on the front of the article  written by Politico on that day.   Out of that came a number of weaponization strategies; one of them  was the resistance movement. And you saw demonstrations in the streets  all over America that commenced shortly after that, all the way through  the inauguration, and for a month or two after that, all these  demonstrations.    The idea was, don't let Donald Trump govern. If you weren't  successful in beating him in the election; if--let's just say, Peter  Strzok and Lisa Page and those who said they weren't going to ever let  it happen, and the rest of that cabal, they fell short in the election,  but they continued to try to deny Donald Trump the opportunity to rule  and to function as the President of the United States.   Madam Speaker, that topic has been before us intensively as recently  as yesterday.   And so, the strategy that came out of the Mandarin Hotel in that  conference that began with the Democratic Party at the highest levels  there, including George Soros and the DNC, on Sunday, the 12th of  November--it happened to be Charles Manson's birthday, I happen to  know. I don't know why I know that--but it was about the weaponization  of terms.   Our discussion in that interview with The New York Times was about  the weaponization of terms. And I have spoken of the weaponization of  terms before that in an interview with The Christian Science Monitor,  and there, it is a clear quote that rolls along that says: It is about  weaponizing these terms.   Madam Speaker, I use the terms--if I can find it here, The Christian  Science Monitor article. It was using the terms Western civilization or  Western culture as that--why is it that they are trying to turn that  into a pejorative term? And that interview was clearly done in The  Christian Science Monitor, and it is clear that that would be the topic  I was talking about; not advocacy for odious ideologies, but instead  wondering why it would be that the left would be seeking to weaponize  the very meritorious term, Western civilization. That is clearly the  case.   And I have been attacked for defending Western civilization, but I  have never defended White nationalism or White supremacy.                                time  2030    I would point out on this chart, Madam Speaker, when was it used? I  mean, when were these terms used within our dialogue? Here is one. This  is a quote from me.   We went through LexisNexis and went on back and asked from the year  2000 up until the end of 2018 how many times was I quoted as ever using  the term ``white nationals'' or ``white supremacy?'' You can see down  here in the red and in the green, it goes clear on out to the end of  2018--never. Not one time was I quoted as using either one of those  terms that identify the odious ideologies in all the LexisNexis  searches that were there.   It makes it implausible that, unless those terms were fed to me by  The New York Times, it is very unlikely that they would have ever been  uttered in that interview. But I said I am defending Western  civilization. I have been consistent and clear on that, Madam Speaker.   And so this chart, the blue line shows the utilization of ``Western  civilization,'' the times that I have been quoted using the term  ``Western civilization.'' Instead of zero times being quoted as using  ``white nationalism'' or ``white supremacy,'' ``Western civilization''  totals, that number shows on here, but here is the utilization of it,  and it totals 276 times.   So to keep it simple, I boiled it down to the text here. I was quoted  as saying ``Western civilization'' in The New York Times--number of  times quoted as saying ``Western civilization,'' 276 times since the  year 2000 the press has quoted me as using that term. I am fine with  that. I proudly defend Western civilization, consistently. But when did  I ever say ``white nationalism'' or ``white supremacy'' or any  derivative thereof? Zero times, zero.   So it is pretty clear that when The New York Times plugs that in, I  was likely responding to the utilization of those terms in a question  if those words were even said at all.   And here is another little chart. The leader made a point that, well,  you know, that I had defined ``white nationalism,'' and I had defined  it in an earlier interview by saying that it is a derogatory term and  it implies racism, but it might have meant something different, I said,  1, 2, or 3 years ago.   This is an October 20 interview with Dave Price on WHO.   So I went back and looked, how often was the term ``white  nationalism'' used historically, going back to the year 2000 on  LexisNexis? And you can see this line staying down here near zero, all  these years from 2000 all the way up to 2015.   You would say in today's vernacular, virtually zero times--virtually  no times, excuse me--not zero, but virtually no times was the term  ``white nationalism'' even used in our dialogue until you get to 2016  where it jumps up.   These numbers really are 1 to 200 times a year throughout all the  publications, all the writers, all the things that show up on  LexisNexis that searches everything in print, including the blogs all  the way back.   So this is virtually none, 1 to 200 times a year by everybody. And  this isn't identified to my utilization.   Then, in 2016, it jumps from virtually none up to 10,000 times a  year. And then when you go to 2017, it jumps all the way up to 30,000  times. And in 2018, it is still up there at 20,000 times.   So 10, 30, 20,000 times used, virtually unused before. And I  explained and asserted that they are weaponizing that term, and they  are injecting it into the political dialogue and using it as a  pejorative term against anybody they can stick this label on.   And that is exactly what was going on, and that is exactly what I  defined in that interview that was so objected to by the minority  leader of the House of Representatives. I was far more right than I  thought.   It was a general understanding I had. Now when I go back and look at  the facts, I just nailed it cold as to what is going on.   The left is weaponizing terms. I was explaining that. I explained it  accurately, more accurately than I thought I had, and what is my reward  for being so precise? And my reward for being so accurate, my reward  for defending Western civilization is a pejorative decision that is  unprecedented in the history of the United States Congress to stifle my  freedom of speech and to limit, to the extent they could, my ability to  be reelected going into the future.   That is the kind of thing we can't have in this Congress is for  someone to be sitting in leadership that thinks that they have the  authority to determine who is not going to represent people outside of  their own district. That  [[Page H7460]]  is destructive to our constitutional Republic.   The voice of we the people elects the Representatives, and when they  do so, they have a right to the full-throated representation, and that  has been denied so far this year because of the arbitrary and  capricious and false conclusion that has been drawn by Kevin McCarthy.  And so that situation needs took rectified.   Anyone who has read this 6-page fact-check document, not one person  has found a hole in it. Not one rational person has found a hole in it.   Those that did read it and considered it said: You make some good  points; yes, it makes sense. Well, we maybe have to find a time to fix  this, but it is not very convenient right now.   My point is, Madam Speaker, that if you find that somebody has been  locked up in jail and the DNA tests prove that they are not guilty, you  don't wait until they have a good job. You open up the doors and you  give them back their freedom. And in this case, you give back to the  people of Iowa the full-throated representation of their senior Member,  the dean of the Iowa House of Representatives.   And one of the things my constituents like about me is they always  get the straight, unvarnished truth whether they like it or not. And  they will come up and they will say: I don't agree with you on  everything, but I know that you are telling me the truth; I know you  are working hard; and I know that you are objective in this, and we  need somebody that we don't have to wonder what they are saying.    I don't ever dance around with words. I tell people what I think and  what I know; and I give them the good news when it is there, and I am  eager to do so, and I give them the bad news when it is time because  they deserve the straightest of answers.   We are straight talkers in the Midwest. We are descended from people  that came across the prairie to live free or die out there in the  plains, and we built a pretty good place. It is the best place in the  world to live and raise a family.   We have people that are coming back. When they are young, sometimes  they will go off and look at the rest of the country or the world, but  they come back, especially when it is time for the kids to go to  school, and they contribute back to the community, generation on top of  generation on top of generation.   That is some of the things that I have worked to establish.   In the time I have been here in Congress, we have taken Iowa into  number one, the Fourth Congressional District into number one in the  production of renewable fuels and energy. By the time you add together  the ethanol, biodiesel, wind and, now, solar, we produce more BTUS of  energy than any other congressional district that is a renewable  outside of this.   We have gotten transportation routes that have been set up, four-lane  Highway 20 is done. We rank in the top first or second or third in corn  and soybeans and in pork and in egg production, right at or near the  top in all of that. It is a wholesome place.   When I look outside from my place, I see no neighbors, but I never  had a bad one. And we have got a crop that looks great this year.   When I see all those little kids boiling up to the front of our  church to put their dollar in the basket, those kids are going to grow  up in those communities, too, and we are going to have generation after  generation that replicates and improves upon the success that we have  had.   But we can't do that if we are going to live in a country where there  is an arbitrary censorship taking place and no opportunity for me to  even defend myself.   Innocent until proven guilty? Well, that is true for a whole bunch of  these people that I named, but   Steve King, instead, is guilty by  accusation, guilty by false allegation, even now that I have proven to  the House of Representatives that, beyond any reasonable question, this  was a misquote. It was something that was ginned up, and it created a  political lynch mob.   It is time to cut the rope and get me back in full force of where my  constituents deserve, to give them the fullest representation that is  there.   I will face any accuser any time, and I will deliver all the facts;  and if anybody can find a hole in this 6-page fact-check document or  any other statement that I have made, I would be very happy to look  anybody in the eye to answer those questions.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate your attention to this matter here this  evening, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 39 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, July 26, 2019, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
