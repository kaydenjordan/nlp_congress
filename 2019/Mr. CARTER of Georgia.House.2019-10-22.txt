 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Blood  Cancer Awareness Month this past September.   Including leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and  more, around 14,000 Americans are diagnosed with blood cancer types  each month.   Although a staggering statistic, doctors and researchers across the  globe have made significant advances since the 1960s. For some blood  cancers, survival rates have more than quadrupled.   As with any illness, early detection is important; so I encourage  everyone to see their doctor, get a check-up, and discuss whether they  have had any symptoms that could be related to blood cancer.   Mr. Speaker, if you have had bone pain, frequent nose bleeds, or tiny  red spots on your skin, I especially encourage you to see a doctor.   I will continue supporting researchers to make further advances in  eradicating these diseases.                National Disability Employment Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October  2019 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month.   Workplaces that welcome the talents of all people, including people  with disabilities, are a critical part of our efforts to build an  inclusive community and a strong economy.   In the First Congressional District of Georgia, I want to especially  recognize Goodwill Southeast Georgia, which is working to raise  awareness about disability employment issues and celebrate the many and  varied contributions of people with disabilities.   Activities they are working on this month reinforce the value and  talent that people with disabilities add to our workplaces and  communities while affirming Goodwill Southeast Georgia's commitment to  an inclusive community.   I encourage employers, schools, and other community organizations  around the country to observe this month with programs and activities,  and to advance the important message that people with disabilities are  capable of surpassing any obstacle.                                time  1030                       Congratulations to Scott Isaacks     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Scott Isaacks for receiving the inaugural South Carolina Hospital  Association Drive to Zero Harm Leadership Award.   As director and CEO of the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center in  Charleston, South Carolina, Mr. Isaacks oversees 3,100 employees, who  are some of the best that the VA has to offer.   The first award of its kind in South Carolina, Mr. Isaacks and his VA  medical center are being recognized for their exceptional work in  creating a culture of high reliability and eliminating harm from all  facets of care.   This high-quality care is particularly important to the First  Congressional District of Georgia because of the large number of  veterans using the VA medical center there in Charleston. Our veterans  are our Nation's heroes, and they deserve the best when they return  home, which is why I am so proud to see Mr. Isaacks working hard to  achieve this goal.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Isaacks for his service to our veterans and  congratulations on his award.                      In Remembrance of James W. Boykin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. James W. Boykin, who passed away at the age of 80 on October 3.   In Jesup, Georgia, nearly everything and everyone seems to have been  impacted by Mr. Boykin.   During his term serving as Wayne County commissioner, he was a  staunch supporter of projects to boost recreation activities, and now  there is even a community lake named in his honor.   He took over his father's construction company in 1975 and worked to  grow the business for over 25 years, being largely responsible for its  size and success today. But whether in business, government, church, or  simply playing sports, Mr. Boykin was always well-respected and  continuously mentoring all who knew him.   Through all of his passion to improve his community and the lives of  others, he never let his four battles with cancer ever impact his  attitude or dedication.   I am proud to have had someone like Mr. James Boykin in the First  Congressional District of Georgia. His family and friends will be in my  thoughts and prayers during this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor three  American heroes who lost their lives this weekend in a training  accident at Fort Stewart in the First Congressional District of  Georgia.   The incident happened at approximately 3:20 a.m. Sunday morning when  the Bradley Fighting Vehicle they were riding in rolled off a bridge  and was submerged in a stream. Three soldiers were killed and three  others were injured.   The heroes who lost their lives that day were Sergeant First Class  Bryan Andrew Jenkins of Gainesville, Florida, Private First Class  Antonio Gilbert Garcia of Peoria, Arizona, and Corporal Thomas Cole  Walker of Ohio.   Sergeant First Class Jenkins was born on December 29, 1977, and had  served in the Army since 2001.   Corporal Walker was born on August 5, 1997, and had served in the  Army since 2016.   Private First Class Garcia was born on August 1, 1998, and had served  in the Army since 2018.   This is a tragic and devastating loss for our community and for our  Nation. These servicemembers gave everything for their Nation,  including their lives.   Please join me praying for their family, friends, and the entire 3rd  ID community.   The sacrifices of our military families are greater than most of us  will ever know.   We also pray for healing for the soldier injured in the incident.  These men represent the greatest among us.   It will take time to grapple with this loss, but I know the Fort  Stewart and 3rd ID communities are strong in their resolve. We are with  you in this most difficult time.   I am glad to be joined tonight by my fellow members of the Georgia  delegation and Representatives from the hometowns of these heroes.   Please join me in honoring these heroes. I ask that all Members and  guests in the gallery rise for a moment of silence.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to support  President Donald J. Trump.   The Democrats' entire impeachment process has been a sham since day  one. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who was in  charge of leading the inquiry, has lied to the American people.   Chairman Schiff made up his own version of the President's call with  Ukraine. He lied about his dealings with the whistleblower and has  misled the country about the Trump campaign and Russia for years.   Unfortunately, House Democrats again put partisan politics over the  good of our Nation last night by blocking a vote to censure and condemn  Adam Schiff. The chairman in charge of this ridiculous impeachment  inquiry must be held accountable for blatantly misleading the American  people.   We have all seen the transcript of the call between President Trump  and the President of Ukraine. There was nothing there. So my Democratic  colleagues are left with making up their own stories and seeing what  people will believe.   Democrats won't even allow noncommittee members to attend depositions  and interviews, nor will they specify their authority to do so.   Madam Speaker, our country deserves better.                            ____________________
