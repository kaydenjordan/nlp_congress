 Mr. Speaker, DACA recipients are our neighbors.  They are entrepreneurs, college graduates, educators, and healthcare  providers.   DACA recipients are helping our country lead in science, technology,  and medicine. Jorge Cortes is one those DACA recipients.   Jorge came to the United States from Colombia when he was a teenager.  Despite his undocumented status, Jorge worked hard. He contributed to  his community and eventually graduated from Florida International  University.   After graduating, he quickly established himself as an entrepreneur  in Miami's technology and social innovation sector, eventually  employing upwards of 15 people. For his entrepreneurship and  leadership, Jorge was awarded the keys to both Miami-Dade County and  the city of Miami.  [[Page H2500]]    A path to citizenship for DACA and TPS recipients like Jorge, would  add $1.2 billion, annually, to Florida's economy.   In our discussions about DACA, immigration reform, and the economy,  it is easy to forget that DACA recipients are also people. DACA isn't  just the right thing to do for our economy, it is the moral thing to  do. It is time that our immigration system treats all of them as  people, too.
