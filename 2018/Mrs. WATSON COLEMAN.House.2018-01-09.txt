 Mr. Speaker, last week, New Jersey said its  final good-bye to a tireless advocate, dedicated leader, and wonderful  man who just happened to also have been our Governor. Brendan Byrne,  our two-term Governor, never let the weight of his office bog him down.  He will be remembered for his wit, his passion, and the force of his  will.   Governor Byrne helped inspire and instill honorable characteristics  of public service into generations of New Jerseyans. I consider myself  blessed to be among them.   It is a bittersweet moment to bid farewell to Governor Byrne. I will  long keep Ruthie and Tom and the entire Byrne family in my thoughts and  in my prayers as their loved ones and, indeed, New Jersey has suffered  a tremendous loss.                            ____________________
