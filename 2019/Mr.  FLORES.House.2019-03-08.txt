 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. James Earle of  College Station, Texas, who passed away on February 4, 2019.      The online version has been corrected to read: As I close today,  I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country, for our  veterans, for our military, and for our first responders who keep  us safe at home. 1245 HONORING DR. JAMES EARLE
