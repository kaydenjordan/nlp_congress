 Mr. President, the Senate is taking the next critical  step in passing the comprehensive, fiscally responsible budget before  us. It is pretty obvious that this is a good budget, and that is true  whether you are looking at it from a fiscal perspective or an economic  one.   Take the fiscal side first. It reins in government spending. It  protects Social Security. It complies fully with the previous spending  caps, while also providing for an increase for defense resources if a  bipartisan agreement can be reached. In short, it is a fiscally  responsible budget that will help put the Federal Government on a path  to balance.   On the economic side, this budget can help our country realize better  and more sustained economic growth, which is critical, given the last  decade of missed opportunities for the middle class. One way this  budget can help our economy is by providing legislative tools to  advance tax reform.   As I have said many times before, tax reform represents the most  important thing we can do today to get our economy reaching for its  true potential. Tax reform is all about getting America going again and  growing again. It aims to take more money out of Washington's pockets  and put more money in middle-class pockets, and it represents a once- in-a-generation opportunity to replace a failing tax bill that holds  Americans back with one that works for them. Passing this budget is  critical to getting tax reform done so we can strengthen our economy,  after years of stagnation under the previous administration.   I know Members are eager to continue proposing amendments to this  budget. We already adopted some good ideas yesterday. For instance, the  Senate adopted an amendment offered by Senator Heller to provide tax  relief to American families with children so they can have more money  to make ends meet.   We also adopted an amendment from Senator Collins to provide relief  to small businesses, which have been responsible for the creation of  about two-thirds of the net jobs in recent years. That is according to  statistics from the Small Business Administration. Both of these  amendments reinforce the goals of the tax reform framework developed by  the President, his team, and the tax-writing committees in Congress.   Today we will consider more ideas from colleagues on both sides of  the aisle. I want to thank, particularly, Chairman Enzi and the members  of the Senate Budget Committee for their good work in getting us to  this point. The budget they produced is important to our fiscal and our  economic future. I look forward to passing it soon.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I say to colleagues, the consent  agreement that was just entered allows us to see the light at the end  of the tunnel. If Senators will stay in the Chamber, we will do these  10-minute rollcall votes and wrap it up.    Mr. President, tonight we completed the first step  toward replacing our broken Tax Code by passing a comprehensive,  fiscally responsible budget that will help put the Federal Government  on a path to balance. The budget also gives us the tools we need to  strengthen our economy after years of stagnation under the previous  administration.   We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to replace a failing tax  code that holds Americans back with one that actually works for them.  To middle-class families across America, we have a very simple message.  We want  [[Page S6630]]  to take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more in yours.   With this budget, we are on a path to delivering much needed relief  to American individuals and families who have borne the burdens of an  unfair tax code for entirely too long. I want to particularly thank  Chairman Mike Enzi and the members of the Budget Committee and the  staff for their extraordinary work on this budget.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany H.R. 2266.
