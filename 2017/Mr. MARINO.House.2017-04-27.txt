 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to attend votes on April 27,  2017 due to a family medical issue. Had I been present, I would have  voted as follows:   ``Yea'' for rollcall vote 229.   ``Yea'' for rollcall vote 230.   ``Yea'' for rollcall vote 231.   ``Yea'' for rollcall vote 232.   ``Yea'' for rollcall vote 233.   ``Yea'' for rollcall vote 234.                            ____________________
