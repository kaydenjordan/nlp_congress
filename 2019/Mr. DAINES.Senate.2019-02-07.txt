 Mr. President, I am here to urge my Senate colleagues to  support S. 47, a lands package that includes over 100 locally driven as  well as nationally important bills--specifically, two very important  priorities for Montana. The first is the Land and Water Conservation  Fund, and the second is the Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a critical tool in protecting  and expanding access to what makes Montana so special; that is, our  public lands. This program works with willing landowners. You see, when  you look at a map of landowners in Montana, it becomes oftentimes very  checkerboard in nature. You have sections owned privately, sections  owned by the State government, sections owned by the Federal  Government. What LWCF does is allows willing landowners to provide more  access to public lands, as well as increasing outdoor recreation  opportunities for cities and towns. It helps multigenerational farmers  and ranchers and loggers continue to work their land.   Yet, without permanent reauthorization of this critical program, it  will continue to expire, Congress after Congress, putting so much of  what makes Montana the ``Last Best Place'' at risk because in Montana  public lands are a way of life. For Cindy and for me, we can think of  no better experience than to put backpacks on and head up to the  Beartooth Wilderness, for example, during the weeks of August.   This is about teaching future generations of Montanans to love the  outdoors and to spend time outside because we can access these public  lands, just the way my parents did with me growing up in Bozeman and  just the way I did with our four children.   It is not just about a way of life. It is also about our economy  because public lands help spur a $7 billion outdoor economy in Montana.  That creates thousands of jobs in our State, and they supply almost  $300 million in State and local tax revenue. People all over Montana  know the importance of this program, and we can't keep kicking that  proverbial can down the road on this critical program for Montana. It  is time we permanently authorize this program once and for all.   This lands package also has a bill called the Yellowstone Gateway  Protection Act. In Montana, we are grateful to be the home of our  Nation's very first national park; that is, Yellowstone.   There are some places that are just too special to mine. The Paradise  Valley--by the way, it is aptly named the ``Paradise Valley.'' Think  about this. The Yellowstone River starts down in Yellowstone Park and  comes to the north and runs through Paradise Valley. It eventually ends  up in Missouri, but this Paradise Valley and the Gardiner Basin are on  the doorstep of Yellowstone National Park. This bill is one example of  the over 100 land exchanges, conveyances, or designations nationwide  that are critically important to local communities as they facilitate  economic development and are locally driven ways to resolve land use  challenges.   Let me talk about locally driven. The Yellowstone Gateway Protection  Act is a great example of something that is locally driven--the  community, the landowners, the elected leaders. They are strongly  supporting this act that I hope we pass in the U.S. Senate, get over to  the House, and then soon onto the President's desk.   This bill also secures other wins for our sportsmen's heritage by  including provisions that will ensure our Federal lands are open for  access and only closed with consultation that comes from our States.   This bill will also help curtail the fringe litigation that halts  commonsense active forest management by shining light on who gets equal  access to Justice Act funds and Judgment Fund payments. The bill  strengthens partnerships for our national parks like the 21st Century  Conservation Corps Act.   Simply stated, this bill is a historic win for Montana and the West,  but don't take my word for it. The sportsmen groups across the country  are calling this bill a historic achievement for conservation--groups  like the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, like the Rocky  Mountain Elk Foundation, like the American Fly Fishing Trade  Association, like the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, the Boone  and Crockett Club, the Trust for Public Land, Montana groups like  Businesses for Montana Outdoors and the Montana Outdoors Coalition, and  the list goes on.   I urge my colleagues at this moment--this moment when we have divided  government in Washington, DC--that we can come together. There is  nothing as bipartisan that I have seen in a long time here than this  lands package, Republicans and Democrats  [[Page S1108]]  who are coming together to get this bill done.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote to support  this lands package. It is long overdue that we get this done for  Montana and for our Nation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Marlo Pronovost and Carli Toresdhal for their impact on the  Gallatin and Stillwater Counties.   Marlo and Carli are two sisters from Bozeman, MT. Born and raised in  Montana, they both attended Bozeman High School and have stayed close  to the area throughout their lives. Later in their lives, the two  sisters both married members of Montana law enforcement.   Marlo met her husband 20 years ago, while working as a journalist at  the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. Assigned to cover the Bozeman Police  Department, they quickly fell in love. Carli met her husband also in  Bozeman, where he worked in marketing and at the county jail, later  becoming a police officer. He has now been a sergeant for 12 years.   Throughout their lives, Marlo and Carli were faced with the biggest  challenge of being married to members of law enforcement--the unknown.  They stayed strong in overcoming those challenges due to the sense of  community between other members of Montana law enforcement and their  families. Marlo and Carli relied on the Montana law enforcement  community to back each other, regardless of the color of the uniform or  department.   I applaud Marlo and Carli for their dedication to Montana. They  stayed strong for their communities and have made a lasting impact on  the State of Montana.                            ____________________
