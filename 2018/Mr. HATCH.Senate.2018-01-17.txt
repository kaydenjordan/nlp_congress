Funding the Government     Mr. President, as we move closer to the expiration date  for Federal Government funding at the end of the week, there is no  shortage of rancor in the air. Pundits and partisans have, for weeks  now, been arguing incessantly about a wide range of issues, all of  which, in one way or another, have been tied to the fast-approaching  deadline. Don't get me wrong, there are legitimate issues at play this  week. These debates, to the extent they are focused on solutions, are  meaningful, and I am optimistic we can find solutions.  [[Page S220]]    Today I would like to talk about some of the more positive  developments we have seen recently with regard to healthcare aspects of  the current debate. As we know, last night, leaders in the House  unveiled a legislative package that would keep the government funded as  well as address some bipartisan healthcare priorities, including some  issues I have personally been working on for some time. I am hoping the  House will pass this legislation in short order and that the Senate  will quickly follow suit.   Let me talk about some of the specifics in the package. First, the  House bill would extend funding for the Children's Health Insurance  Program for 6 years, which is the longest extension since the creation  of the program. As I am sure the Presiding Officer knows, I am the  original author of the CHIP Program. Twenty years ago, Senator Ted  Kennedy joined with me to draft the original CHIP legislation and to  move it through Congress on a bipartisan basis. I have maintained my  commitment to this program for the past two decades, even during times  when others sought to change it dramatically from its original purpose.   During this Congress, as the chairman of the Finance Committee, I  have been working with colleagues on a long-term reauthorization of  CHIP, despite some contrary claims that I and the Republican leadership  had somehow neglected or forgotten about the CHIP Program and had no  intention of reauthorizing it. It is no secret that I have taken some  flak in some corners of the Senate from colleagues looking to get some  political mileage out of the issue I have worked so hard to keep  bipartisan, but I will remind my colleagues that this past September,  the Finance Committee's ranking member, Senator Wyden, and I introduced  a long-term, bipartisan CHIP extension bill that was overwhelmingly  reported out of the committee. A number of my colleagues, including  some who were on the committee and voted in favor of that bill, seem to  have forgotten this legislation had been drafted and reported. We have  endured a number of speeches and television appearances from colleagues  accusing Republicans of ``abandoning children in need.'' My gosh. This  is even though our friends on the other side were entirely aware that  the effort to reauthorize the program had been continually moving  forward.   The House's bill is identical to the legislation Senator Wyden and I  introduced last fall, except that the funding continues for 1 more  year. As I noted, it extends CHIP for 6 years. We have never gotten  such a long extension since the creation of the program over 20 years  ago.   I hope my colleagues in the Senate, particularly those who have been  so outspoken and righteous in their condemnations of Republicans  regarding CHIP will support this legislation. It would be odd to see  them vote it down after all the acrimony we have endured over the past  few months.   In addition to the historic CHIP reauthorization, the House  legislation addresses some other long-term priorities of mine: the  taxes imposed by the so-called Affordable Care Act. Under the bill, the  job-killing medical device tax will be delayed for another 2 years.  This foolhardy tax, which has been criticized and condemned by Members  of both parties, will come back into effect at the start of this year.   Eliminating this tax has been an important cause to me since the day  ObamaCare was signed into law. Utah is home to some of our Nation's  most innovative medical device companies, and the United States has led  the world in developing lifesaving and life-improving medical  technology, an advantage that was threatened by this poorly crafted and  irresponsible tax. I would like to see the medical device tax repealed  entirely. I have introduced a number of bills to that effect over the  years, but until we get that done, it is important that we keep  shielding American consumers, patients, families, and job creators from  the impact of this tax. The House bill would prevent the medical device  tax from hitting any device innovators and their customers until 2020  at the earliest.   The House package also extends the delayed impact of the so-called  Cadillac tax, which is another one of ObamaCare's ill-advised shots  aimed at the middle class. Again, Members from both parties have  expressed concern and opposed this tax. Previous delays have received  broad bipartisan support. The House bill would put off the impact of  the Cadillac tax through 2021, and I am hopeful this delay receives  bipartisan support in the House and Senate.   Finally, the bill would pull back the health insurance tax, which is  another reckless tax provision, for 2019. This tax targets small  businesses and middle-class consumers. There is not even a set rate for  this tax. There is a revenue target, and the rate moves around from  year to year in order to raise a specified amount. The results are  increased costs passed along to insurance beneficiaries in the form of  higher premiums and increased burdens on small businesses. The House  bill will give additional relief from this tax starting in January of  next year so insurers can lower premiums before the 2019 filing period.   So, as we can see, in addition to keeping the government open, the  legislative package unveiled last night in the House would address some  key bipartisan healthcare priorities.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  approach. Given their recent statements on some of these issues and  their past votes, I think many Democrats would have a hard time  explaining to their constituents why they oppose these measures.   While there are still a number of healthcare priorities that must be  addressed as quickly as possible, including Medicare extenders, I am  very pleased to see the House moving forward with a long-term extension  of CHIP and relief to some of the most burdensome ACA taxes. I have  been working with my colleagues in both parties and in both Chambers to  bring these efforts to fruition. Once again, I hope all of my  colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation once we receive  it from the House.   Having said that, let me make my second set of remarks.                                 Immigration    Mr. President, I rise to speak on immigration reform. For nearly 20  years, we have been talking about the Dreamer population. We have been  talking about border security for just as long. It is time we did  something, and there is a lot of desire among my colleagues to find a  path forward to make a deal, but as I said at yesterday's Judiciary  Committee hearing, to do that, we need to be realistic.   To my Democratic friends, I say it is time to stop pushing for a  clean Dream Act. As a matter of simple political reality, it is not  going to happen.   To my Republican friends, I say we are not going to get the Sun, the  Moon, and the stars. We should push for the best deal we can get, but  we shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. So let's be  realistic, and I say that to both sides, as one who has made a lot of  deals in my time.   Here is where I am on the issue.   First, we need a deal that has broad support. I hope we can get that  support from both sides. Certainly, with the Republican majority in  Congress, any deal that moves forward must have broad Republican  support and be supported by the President.   Second, we should be wary of false deadlines. There has been a lot of  discussion that we need to have a bill done by this date or that date,  even though those dates have nothing to do with relevant program  deadlines. We should not create a false cliff and then plunge over it  in a rush to get something done right this second. A deal on DACA is a  deal worth doing, and it is worth doing right. Moreover, a deal on DACA  should not just be about DACA.   Third, we need a deal that is going to help our economy. Our goal  here should be to strengthen our country. We do that by supporting  communities and families and by ensuring that law enforcement has the  tools it needs to keep our country safe, but we also strengthen our  country by helping businesses thrive and create good, high-paying jobs  for our workers.   Fourth, we need a legislative solution for DACA. We can't keep  kicking the can down the road and relying on dubious legal authority to  keep individuals in our country. It is not fair to them, and it is not  fair to others who are seeking to enter our country legally.   Fifth, we need meaningful improvements to border security and  interior  [[Page S221]]  enforcement, not a figleaf, not window dressing--real reform. There has  been a lot of talk about a wall. To those who are unwilling to  entertain any deal that will have wall funding, I say: Let's not let  something that would amount to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the  Federal budget scuttle a once-in-a-generation deal.   Sixth, we need to close loopholes and reduce fraud and abuse. One  area that has been particularly susceptible to these problems is the  diversity visa lottery. I have long been skeptical of the program. In  fact, I introduced legislation in 2011 to sunset the program unless  changes were made to cut back on fraud and abuse.   Another area that constitutes an enormous potential loophole is the  ability of individuals to come to our country illegally but then use  family relationships to absolve themselves of the consequences of their  illegal actions. I think it is a problem to allow people who come into  our country in open violation of our laws to turn around and avail  themselves of our Constitution and laws to backdoor themselves into  lawful status. We need a better system than that.   Finally, I think high-skilled immigration needs to be part of the  discussion. There has been a lot of talk recently about merit-based  immigration. Well, high-skilled immigration is merit-based immigration.  It is immigration targeted at the best, the brightest, and the most  highly educated.   Next week, I plan to reintroduce my Immigration Innovation Act, or I- Squared Act. This bipartisan legislation, newly updated for this  Congress, will better align high-skilled visas with market demand so  that employers are able to hire the talent they need. It will help end  our stupid practice of educating people here in the United States and  then sending them back home to compete against us, and it will stop  some of the troubling abuses we have seen with the H-1B visa program.  We should welcome the best and the brightest in the world, regardless  of their origin. My I-Squared Act will help us to do that.   Our immigration laws are a mess. They are a morass of conflicting and  confusing obligations that reflect past Congresses' pet projects and  idiosyncrasies, rather than any real overarching principle. I want a  system that makes sense. I want a system that is merit-based. I want a  system that doesn't penalize people who were brought to our country  illegally through no fault of their own but that also discourages  future unlawful entries. Surely, we can have a system that does both.  Surely, we can find a path forward that is fair and just to the Dreamer  population but that reduces future illegal immigration. Surely, we can  design a system focused around economic growth rather than arbitrary  allocations of visa numbers, and, surely, we can create an immigration  policy that focuses on what individuals will contribute to our country  rather than where they came from or who they know.   In short, as I said earlier, we should welcome the best and the  brightest in the world, regardless of their country of origin. That  should be our mantra as we move forward.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                               Order for Recess     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. today.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
