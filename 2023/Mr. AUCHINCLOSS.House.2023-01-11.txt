 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the changes the  House rules package made to the Office of Congressional Ethics. OCE is  a critical independent ethics watchdog, and it is a poor indication of  the GOP's commitment to integrity that House Republicans have gutted  the OCE as their first act in the majority.   The Republican rules package term limits the members of the OCE  board, and in doing so removes the three Democratic members of the  bipartisan board, giving Republicans a majority of seats instead of  maintaining an even partisan divide. These rules also require the OCE  to hire staff within a month, which requires a vote of four board  members, guaranteeing a partisan lean amongst most staff.   With these rules changes, my Republican colleagues are deviously  turning the Office of Congressional Ethics into a zombie, alive in name  but unable to execute its vital mission of investigating misconduct and  ridding Congress of corruption.   After 14 failed Speaker votes and the undermining of independent  ethics reviews, House Republicans have demonstrated their commitment to  dysfunction and poor governance.                            ____________________
