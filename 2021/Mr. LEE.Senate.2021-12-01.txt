 Madam President, I was going to give a speech first. I am  now going to invert the order and do my unanimous consent request first  in deference to my friend and colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Armed  Services be discharged from further consideration of S. 2842 and that  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask that  the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, our Armed Forces have been asked to work  miracles over the last 18 months. During a global pandemic, in the face  of natural disasters, and facing dangerous missions, our men and women  in uniform have risen to the challenge just as they have so many times  throughout our history. Many of our servicemembers have contracted and  then recovered from COVID. Now these heroes--the same heroes--are being  placed in a corner by this administration.   President Biden's COVID vaccine requirement for the Armed Forces does  not grant our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines the respect that  they deserve. As the Senate debates our annual National Defense  Authorization Act, it would be a huge mistake not to consider this  mandate's impact on our retention and recruitment of servicemembers  and, thus, on our military's readiness to secure our national security.   This mandate, tied with President Biden's more sweeping general  vaccine mandate, is something that, in combination, has put millions of  Americans in so many difficult, untenable, unfair positions. In most  cases, these are hard-working, everyday Americans. They are mothers and  fathers, husbands and wives who are just trying to put food on the  table during difficult economic times. These mandates are forcing  millions of our fellow citizens into second-class, unemployable status,  placing countless of our neighbors on the economic and social fringes  of our society, even more than what they were already experiencing with  rampant inflation caused by excessive government spending to the tune  of trillions of dollars.   Now, I have heard from hundreds of Utahns, in recent days, who are  concerned about losing their jobs--losing their jobs not just in  general, not just in the abstract, but specifically due to these  mandates. Some of these individuals are heroic members of our military.  These servicemembers were rightly praised for serving during a pandemic  and serving in dangerous conditions, on dangerous missions, but now  they are being forced out, often with limited or no retirement benefits  because of the President's mandate.   Let me share with you just a few of their stories.   One soldier told me his story. He has been in the Army now for 18  years--  [[Page S8845]]  nearly two decades. He never received a single reprimand, whether  written or otherwise. He honorably and proudly served his Nation. All  along, he was planning on retiring upon reaching two decades of  service. He is almost there at 18 years--just 18 months shy, in fact,  of reaching that really important milestone in his career. Now, because  of the vaccine mandate, he is at risk of losing his benefits and of not  even receiving an honorable discharge.   Regarding his situation, he said: ``This will cause a substantial  loss in pay and quality of life for myself and a large number of others  I know.''   Another soldier who reached out to my office has served for 10 years  in the military. He has been informed, despite his many years of  successful, faithful Active-Duty service, that he will not receive an  honorable discharge if he declines to comply with the vaccine  requirement. Accordingly, he asked to resign from the military. Now,  his commanders made clear that he would be barred from resignation. He  sought a personal religious exemption. He was summarily told his  exemption request would be denied.   Of his situation, he said: ``To be backed into a corner with two very  bad options is both disheartening and sad, especially with what I have  sacrificed and what my family has sacrificed on behalf of the  military.''   Another soldier reached out to my office in a similar situation. This  soldier has children who experienced complications with receiving the  vaccine. This soldier also has a child with significant learning  disabilities, whom he is worried about providing for.   He said:         This really could be a life-changing event for my family,       and I feel strongly enough about it that I will risk all my       benefits not to take it. I just wish I had a choice.    These stories are just barely scratching the surface of the countless  thousands of servicemembers in similar positions.   The Department of Defense has begun prohibiting unvaccinated members  of the National Guard from receiving Federal pay or benefits. These  guardsmen risk being marked absent from training drills if they are not  vaccinated. This move has the effect of pushing the unvaccinated out of  the National Guard. Approximately 10,000 marines remain unvaccinated.  That is around 6 percent of the Corps. Losing these capable  servicemembers and showing unvaccinated Americans that they should not  join our Armed Forces makes our military less capable. It threatens its  ability to do what only the military can do. In total, there are  reports of approximately 60,000 unvaccinated servicemembers who risk  discharge under less than honorable conditions due to this mandate-- 60,000.   The Department of Defense, for its part, refuses to provide the  number of servicemembers who have applied for vaccine exemptions, but  there are reports that even some of the few Americans in military  uniform who have received exemptions are seeing those exemptions  revoked. That is chilling to say the least. Relatively few of them are  getting them granted, and some of those who have had them granted are  seeing them revoked. Now, these servicemembers, like millions of other  Americans whose employments have also been put at risk, all deserve a  better option.   That is why, today, I am asking that the Senate pass my Respecting  Our Servicemembers Act. That is why I came to the Senate floor and why,  a few moments ago, I asked unanimous consent that we pass it. I know  not everyone is going to agree on every issue here and that we are not  going to agree, perhaps, on every issue pertaining to the mandate, but  I think we at least ought to be able to agree on this one. We ought not  to be mistreating those upon whom our safety depends.   This bill that I brought forward to try to pass today would prohibit  the Secretary of Defense from requiring COVID vaccination for our  military. I am grateful to my colleagues Senators Braun and Tuberville  for joining me. This is now the 18th time I have come to the Senate  floor, asking that the Federal Government take a tempered, reasoned  approach--an approach that is noticeably absent from that which the  President has chosen to pursue.   As I have said every time I have done this, I am not anti-vaccine. I  believe the development of the COVID vaccines is something of a medical  miracle. I am vaccinated, my family is vaccinated, and I have  encouraged everyone around me to get the vaccine. I have also  acknowledged that it is not my decision, and it is certainly not a  decision that should be forced on them by the Federal Government and  certainly not by a single person acting within the Federal Government  who shouldn't be exercising that authority unilaterally.   Whether or not vaccines should be mandated by the Federal Government  is, of course, an entirely different, free-standing question. Our  military servicemembers deserve the right to make this medical decision  for themselves without the threat of losing the ability to care for  themselves and provide for their families. They currently face being  forced out of the military--out of military service and also out of the  benefits that they have earned. To add insult to injury, they are also  threatened with the risk of a less than honorable discharge, all for  the supposed grave sin of deviating--of daring to deviate--from  Presidential, medical orthodoxy.   We are better than this. This is not something we should be doing.  Everyone knows it. Deep down, we know it is wrong. You know, according  to a recent Axios poll, only 14 percent of the American people agree  with President Biden's apparent assumption that someone should be fired  as a consequence of declining to get the vaccine. That is wrong. That  is why I came here today. That is why I will be back as many times and  as long as it takes to end these mandates.   It is unfortunate that this legislation, which should be easy to  pass, wasn't able to pass today. It is unfortunate that it drew an  objection. The American people don't want this, and our national  security is undermined by it. I find that most unfortunate, and I will  continue to fight it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
