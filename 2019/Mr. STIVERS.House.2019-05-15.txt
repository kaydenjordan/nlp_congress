 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding  constituent of the 15th Congressional District, Mr. Bill Dunlap, as he  retires from his role as deputy director of the Athens-Hocking-Vinton  317 Board.   Madam Speaker, it is not news that we are facing a drug epidemic in  this country. Families from Ohio to Oregon are torn apart by addiction,  and we can't hope to overcome this crisis without outstanding  individuals on the ground in each of those communities, without people  who are compassionate and dedicated to their neighbors, without people  like Bill Dunlap.   I have had a chance to see Mr. Dunlap's work firsthand over the  years. We have collaborated on drug task forces, and other community  initiatives, and I can't say enough about his dedication and commitment  to combating the drug crisis.   I can say without a doubt, Athens, Hocking and Vinton Counties--and  truly, all of southeastern Ohio--are better and healthier places as a  result of his efforts.   Madam Speaker, I am incredibly grateful for Bill's service and his  leadership. I wish him the best in his next chapter.                            ____________________
