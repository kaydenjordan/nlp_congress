 Mr. President, Canadian historian Michael Bliss wrote in  his 1982 book, ``The Discovery of Insulin,'' that ``[w]ith insulin, the  stone was rolled away, and diabetes became a matter of the quality of  life, not speed of death.''   For thousands of years, human beings have battled diabetes. When the  pancreas stops producing insulin, all kinds of bad things happen--heart  attacks, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, foot disease, foot  amputations, small blood vessels throughout the body being impacted by  that high blood sugar. In some cases, within months, individuals waste  away, fall into diabetic comas, and die.   All that changed about a century ago thanks to the work of four  Canadian scientists--Frederick Banting, Charles Best, J.B. Collip, and  John Macleod. These four men discovered how to extract, develop, and  refine a pure form of insulin that could be injected into the human  body. It changed the world.   Thirty million Americans--almost 10 percent, 9.4 percent, of the  American population live with type 1 or type 2 diabetes today. Of those  30 million, 7.4 million depend on insulin for their survival, but one- quarter of the people who depend on insulin for their survival have had  to ration their insulin in the past year because of the extraordinary,  over-the-Moon cost of this drug that was developed a century ago.   Rationing the drug, and therefore producing episodes or enduring  levels of high blood sugar, has extensive health consequences. It does  a lot of damage. Diabetic Americans are being gouged by the drug  companies, and it needs to stop.   Today I am introducing, in partnership with Senator Durbin, the End  Price Gouging for Insulin Act to end this egregious practice. I want to  ensure that every single one of those 7.4 million Americans who need  insulin to survive can afford it. I want to ensure that not a single  person has to ration their insulin. I can tell you that vision of every  person having affordable insulin is what the four scientists who  invented it nearly 100 years ago envisioned. They didn't ask for great  wealth from their work. They did receive recognition. A Nobel Prize  went to two of them for their role in this. They certainly weren't  asking for huge payouts or a high price. Do you know what they did? For  the health of humanity, they sold their patent to the University of  Toronto for $3 to make insulin available to the world. All they cared  about was saving lives. They wanted everyone who needed it to have it.   What do we see today? Almost a century later, the price of insulin is  going higher and higher with the extensive greed of the companies that  produce it. Over the last decade, the companies selling the four most  popular types of insulin have tripled the price of their product-- essentially the same product. They tripled the price. Nova Nordisk has  two of these drugs; Sanofi has one; Eli Lilly has another--and they all  tripled the price.   In 2012, the average price of insulin was about $234 a month. By  2016, it was $450 a month. Now we have seen it continue to rise since  2016. They have some explanations. There are some who say: Well, it is  due to their vast input into research and development. Remember, these  are drugs invented a century ago. Sure, there are slight variations,  yes, but the money is going largely to profit.   There are those who say the price is higher because more people need  it. More people buying it means more efficiencies, which means the  price should drop. The nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute looked at  the rising cost of insulin and said the excuses given by the drug  companies just straight out aren't true. ``It's not that individuals  are using more insulin or that new products are particularly innovative  or provide immense benefits. Use is pretty flat,'' said Ms. Fugelsten  Biniek, one of the authors. ``And the price changes are occurring in  both older and newer products.''   The reason the prices are going up--the companies are charging more-- is because they can because we don't negotiate the price of drugs in  America by law for Medicare.   These companies have some tricks up their sleeve. One is that when  the generic competition gets all lined up, they proceed to pay the  generic companies not to produce the generic drug, resulting in  sustaining the price gouging in America.   Now, I think this practice is ``pay to delay.'' I think it is a  horrific predatory practice. It is a noncompetitive practice. It should  be against the law, but we are not doing our job to make it against the  law, apparently.   The other thing is they make slight changes. They produce a new  patent on every tiny, microscopic change--it is called the evergreening  of patents--so then they can line up a vast array of lawyers and say:  If you produce generic insulin, we will go after you in every which  way. We have more lawyers than you have, and we have deeper pockets  than you have. So good luck.   The result is a continuation of the extensive price gouging of  Americans. A quarter of those 7.4 million Americans who need insulin to  treat their diabetes are rationing their prescriptions. Sometimes that  means just straight out skipping the doses altogether.   Folks from Oregon have written to me, people like Richard from  Beaverton, OR.   Richard needs three lifesaving medications to get by, including the  insulin Humalog, which costs over $1,800 a year. Richard doesn't have  $1,800 to spare. He is 77 years old, blind, and recently finished chemo  treatments for bladder cancer. Through it all, he has continued to work  odd jobs to supplement his Social Security to be able to put food on  the table for him and his wife, to be able to keep their house, and try  to pay for those prescriptions.   Another constituent whom I will call Antonio is 58 years old and is  living with type 1 diabetes, but like so many others, he has trouble  affording the prescription. Antonio either uses insulin samples that he  finds in his truck, which are about 10 years old, or he rations out the  insulin that he does have to make it last until his monthly disability  check comes in, which is when he can afford to get a new refill on the  prescription.   This is a terrible strategy for managing an illness. It has led to  hospital stays, diabetic ketoacidosis, kidney failure, visual  impairment, and other diabetes-related ailments. Yet, from Antonio's  perspective, what can he do? He can't afford the massive price  increases these major drug companies have put on insulin. As for the  generic he would like to buy, those same companies are blocking it from  coming to market.   There is also Maria. Maria has sores on her feet because of her  diabetes. She has been to the emergency room several times for foot  infections. It turns out that her feet keep getting infected because  she is forgoing her insulin to be able to afford basic necessities for  her family--food, the cost of her housing, and transportation.   It turns out Maria's insurance doesn't cover the $50 copay on  diabetic shoes or her insulin or the injection medication that she  takes to reduce her insulin needs, all of which would have reduced or  eliminated the need for Maria to go to the emergency room. Yet her  insurance does cover the emergency room visits. So, time and again,  with her not being able to afford the medicine, that is where Maria  ends up.   Another Oregonian whom I will call Phillip is living with type 2  diabetes. He said he takes less insulin than his doctor has prescribed.  Why? He isn't able to afford the prescription. Yet Phillip doesn't want  his provider to know any of this, because he is embarrassed about it.  So his blood sugars are  [[Page S6480]]  routinely at high levels and are doing a lot of damage to his body. It  has led to the diabetic-related complications of severe kidney damage,  visual impairment, peripheral vascular disease, and heart disease.   Think about this for a moment. The pharmaceutical companies are  gouging him on the price, but it is Phillip--he who has the diabetes-- who feels embarrassed. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Shouldn't  the companies be embarrassed about gouging Americans? I think so. The  drugmakers are profiting off of sick Americans, and their predatory  practices are designed to keep competitors from coming to the market.  These are American citizens who are being affected while living in one  of the wealthiest nations on the planet--the United States of America.  Yet they can't afford a century-old drug that is meant to be freely  shared with the world.   It doesn't have to be this way. The same kind of insulin that costs  $373 here in the United States costs $47 in Australia. Why? The  Australian Government negotiates the price. It is past time we stood up  for the American people and put an end to the price gouging of  Americans.   In France, the drug Lantus is $47. In Australia, it is $54. In  Germany, it is $61. In the United Kingdom, it is $64. In Canada, it is  $67. In the United States of America, it is $373. That is six times the  median price of the drug in these other developed nations.   Why don't we insist that the companies that get all kinds of benefits  from being here in America sell to Americans at the median price or at  the average price--either one--which is what they sell to the rest of  the developed world? Why is it a fair price for every other country,  but it is gouging for Americans?   Americans pay the price. Those who have diabetes but who cannot  afford that insulin start rationing it and start to see the devastating  impacts on their bodies--from the kidneys, to the vision, to the feet,  to the heart disease. Then they end up in the hospital, as well, with  there being more costs to the U.S. healthcare system. Don't we care  about the health of Americans? Are we here to protect greed for these  companies or the health of Americans?   Senator Durbin and I have introduced a bill that says you can't  charge more in America than the reference price that is charged in key  developed countries around the world--Canada, Australia, Japan--or  charge more than the median price in the group of eight of the largest  European nations. It doesn't even have to be the lowest price in the  world under this formulation. This is called a reference price bill,  wherein we essentially attach ourselves to the fair prices charged to  the rest of the world.   The drug companies will say: We want to make more money so we can do  more research.   Well, raise your price on these other countries while you are  dropping the price for the United States. That is a pretty simple  solution that ends the price gouging in the United States of America.   If a company violates this reference price, then it pays a fine of 10  times the difference between the reference price and the price it  charges Americans. Where does that money go? It goes to the research  and development of new drug products in our bill.   That is the vision. There is no reason that Americans should be  paying six times the median price of other developed countries--six  times. This is not 6 percent more or 60 percent more, which would be  outrageous. This is six times the price charged to other developed  countries.   It is way past time that we stood up for the American people, not the  greed of the pharmaceutical companies. It is way past time that we  stood up for sick Americans like Richard and Antonio and Maria and  Phillip and millions more in every one of our States. Millions of  Americans are forced to ration their insulin or skip doses altogether  because of corporate greed. It is way past time to end the price  gouging of Americans.   Let's put this bill on the floor, and let's pass this bill for our  citizens across this great land.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Canadian historian Michael Bliss wrote in  his 1982 book, ``The Discovery of Insulin,'' that ``[w]ith insulin, the  stone was rolled away, and diabetes became a matter of the quality of  life, not speed of death.''
