 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky.   This did pass our committee on a unanimous basis.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B.  Maloney) for her leadership and for her other areas of leadership on  our committee. As a very senior Democrat, her counsel is always  important; her leadership is always important.   This is indeed, as was described, Mr. Speaker, in many respects, a  technical correction that needed to take place. We need to ensure that  our family offices, that those investment funds can be put to their  highest and best use to help grow the economy.   I was happy that the ranking member used the phrase ``unintended  consequences'' because, indeed, Mr. Speaker, from time to time, there  are unintended consequences of regulation.   We do wish to ensure that these family offices that otherwise meet  the definition of accredited investors have the full range of  investment opportunities before them. This bill will do this.   Again, it came out on a strong bipartisan, indeed, a unanimous basis  from the Financial Services Committee, and so I would urge all Members  of the House to adopt it.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B.  Maloney), the author of the bill and the sponsor of the bill.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 3972, and I am very thankful to gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Hensarling), the chairman, and the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member, for their support and  assistance on this legislation.   This bill is very simple. It makes what I consider to be a technical  fix to the rules for family offices.   Family offices are entities that are established by wealthy families  to manage their own money and to provide financial services to their  family members.   The original family office was created by John D. Rockefeller 135  years ago and still exists in the district that I represent. So family  offices have a long and storied history in this country and have become  important sources of liquidity for our markets.   It is also important to note that family offices do not pose a  systemic risk and did not cause any problems in the financial crisis,  so they don't pose any safety and soundness risk to the financial  system.   Family offices aren't regulated by the SEC as investment advisers  because they don't have traditiona clients or outside investors. They  invest money in their funds like most investment advisers.    A family office is just that: a family office managing its own family  money. Their clients are primarily family members, and disputes between  family members are better handled either internally by the family or  through State courts, which have laws to govern disputes between family  members.   Prior to Dodd-Frank, the SEC had been exempting family officers and  offices from the Advisers Act for decades on a case-by-case basis. In  Dodd-Frank, we codified the exemption for family offices and required  the SEC to write a rule formally defining ``family offices.'' The SEC  finalized that rule in 2011, so family offices, to meet the SEC's  definition, do not have to register with the SEC or as investment  advisers.   However, a problem has now come up that we did not anticipate. We  assumed that every family client or a member of the family would  qualify as a sophisticated accredited investor under the SEC rules. But  it turns out that there are very limited circumstances in which a  family client of a family office may not actually qualify as an  individual accredited investor.   For example, a 19- or 20-year-old member of a wealthy family may be  in his or her first job after school and may not be making enough money  to qualify as an accredited investor, which is over $200,000, annually.   The real problem is, under the rules we have now, if just one of  these family clients--a young person, in most cases--in a family office  is not an accredited investor, then the entire family office is not  considered an accredited investor and, thus, cannot buy any securities  that are limited to accredited investors, like privately issued stocks  or bonds. My bill would fix this by just clarifying that all family  offices and family clients are, in fact, accredited investors.   The bill does not allow that any 19- or 20-year-old can go out on  their own and buy securities. It is limited to accredited investors  that can only be done through the family office.   The bill also includes some important limitations: The family office  has to have at least $5 million in assets, which is the same limitation  that applies to trusts in the current accredited investor rule. The  family office also has to have its investments directed by a  sophisticated investment professional, which provides yet another layer  of protection.   So, really, this bill is very narrowly tailored and provides what I  consider to be a technical fix that will allow family offices to better  serve their own family members.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3898, the Otto Warmbier  North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act, which our committee, the Financial  Services Committee, passed on a unanimous basis.   I thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who is leading this  debate today, for his leadership on our committee and for this bill. I  also thank his ranking member, Ms. Moore, the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin, for her work on this bipartisan bill as well.   I also think that it is a good and proper thing, Mr. Speaker, that  this bill is named after Otto Warmbier, a young life that was  tragically ended far too soon, who, in his untimely demise, has become  an international symbol of the crushing brutality of the North Korean  regime.   So it is with his memory that this bill is designed. And, simply put,  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today represents the toughest set of  financial sanctions ever directed against the nuclear armed North  Korean regime, a regime that still represents a clear and present  danger to the global community.   The sanctions our committee is bringing to the House today target  foreign financial institutions that, in some way, are connected to  North Korea's economic activity--activity that ultimately allows this  rogue regime to both develop and proliferate weapons of mass  destruction.   Under H.R. 3898, those foreign financial institutions are going to be  confronted with a choice. As my colleague from Kentucky put it, they  can either do business that benefits North Korea or they can do  business with the United States, they cannot do both.   Given the far-reaching impact of the sanctions, our committee does  not take them lightly. They are reserved for the gravest threats to our  national security, and their application should be targeted at clear  and achievable goals. That is why H.R. 3898 cuts off virtually any path  that North Korea can take to generate hard currency, yet it holds out  the prospect of sanctions relief, if there are real and verifiable  limits to the regime's weapons program.   As punishing as these sanctions will be, there is a way out for North  Korea, if it chooses to take it, and that is to comply. Otherwise, the  Kim regime and its foreign enablers will learn that hostility towards  America carries enormous cost.    Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his  effort, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this vitally needed  legislation.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking  member for yielding and for her leadership on this committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3898.   In August, I was part of a congressional delegation led by Senator  Markey that visited South Korea, Japan, and the border between China  and North Korea. It is just a short drive from Seoul, a city of about  10 million people, to the DMZ, which is the border line with North  Korea. Standing there, you understand and see firsthand that even  though the United States would prevail unquestionably in any armed  conflict, the casualties suffered by South Korea would be horrendous.   Later, I hosted a meeting with Congresswoman Wagner with South Korean  Foreign Minister Kang here in the Congress. From these two meetings, I  came back more convinced than ever that we have to leave no stone  unturned to solve the most dangerous problem of our times peacefully  through negotiations.   I firmly believe that the only way to drive North Korea to the  negotiation table is to increase the financial pressure on this  reckless rogue regime, which is what this bill does. It is one of the  toughest sanction bills financially we have ever considered, and may be  the toughest.   The fact that the dollar is the world's Reserve currency gives our  country a very important bit of leverage. Companies doing business all  over the world want to be paid, need to be paid, in dollars, not in any  other currency. So if we restrict international and U.S. financial  institutions from doing business with North Korea, then no matter how  determined they might be to continue their destabilizing reckless  course, they simply will not be able to get the dollars to buy the  tools of terror that they need on the international market.                                time  1430    This is not the kind of action we should ever take lightly. This is  not a tool to use, an action to take indiscriminately. But in this rare  case, in the case of North Korea, such action is not only justified, it  is necessary for the defense of our Nation and the defense of other  nations.   If North Korea cannot buy the materials necessary to build long- range, nuclear-tipped missiles because they just don't have the  dollars, then every country, every person on this globe can breathe a  little easier and be a little safer.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman from New York.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this is really an  urgently needed bill that not only directly addresses our own security  needs, but also does a great service to the community of nations.   I would like to thank my friend, Mr. Barr, for all of his creative  and hard work on this bill. I thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking  Member Waters for their leadership and support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.
