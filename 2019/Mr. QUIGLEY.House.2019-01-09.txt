 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 28, I call up  the bill (H.R. 264) making appropriations for financial services and  general government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and  for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Now that Democrats have taken the majority in the House, we have  shown our intention to govern responsibly and have already illustrated  real leadership at every turn, a welcome change after fighting through  2 years of chaos and obstruction, which culminated in a reckless  shutdown.   At the end of the day, the President's beloved border wall is the  issue solely responsible for this irresponsible shutdown, and it is an  absolute disgrace and a disservice to all Americans to allow this  broken campaign promise to hold all other key funding bills hostage.   From delays in the processing of Federal loan assistance applications  for small businesses and the uncertainty created for taxpayers during  tax season, to regulatory agencies like the FTC not being able to  pursue the vast majority of consumer protection investigations, I have  seen firsthand how this shutdown is impacting the communities around  the country, as the chairman-designate of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Appropriations.   Due to the shutdown at the SEC, companies have been announcing  delays, and investors are concerned that IPOs for companies such as  Uber will miss a key first quarter deadline.   We can put a stop to this chaos that is rattling our communities and  our economy. This bill before us today is fiscally responsible and  makes hard choices among competing priorities. It provides a total of  $23.688 billion in discretionary resources, an increase of $265 million  over the fiscal year 2018 level.   The bill rejects the President's proposed elimination of the  Community Development Financial Institutions Fund and cuts to the Small  Business Administration, which provides necessary resources to spur  economic growth, particularly in underserved communities.   The bill provides a pay increase for civilian Federal employees in  2019, while putting a stop to the excessive raises to the Vice  President and other high-ranking administration officials.   In addition, the bill includes backpay for Federal employees  furloughed during this shutdown.   One key feature of this bill is the total lack of controversial  policy riders. This is a clean appropriations measure squarely under  the jurisdiction of this committee.   Again, most importantly, this bill will reopen the Department of the  Treasury, which includes the IRS as well as the Securities and Exchange  Commission, Small Business Administration, and multiple other agencies  that have a direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of American  families, businesses, and communities.   By passing this bill, we will be able to get more than 130,000  workers back to work and receiving a paycheck. It is long past time  that we reopen government, and this bill does exactly that for a number  of critical agencies that Americans rely on every day.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Lowey), the distinguished, newly minted, first-ever  chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman-designate of the Appropriations  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), chairwoman of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez), the chairwoman of the Small Business  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist), my distinguished colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia), my distinguished colleague, and the cradle of  leadership on the Cook County board.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the distinguished chairman of the Ways and  Means Committee.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is interesting to hear a discourse on functioning government as we  look back at 2018 when my colleagues across the aisle operated under  103 closed rules. Circumstances today are of an exigent manner. The  government is not functioning. Lives are at risk. The time for  leadership, the time to not stymie ideas, and the time for functioning  government is apparently gone. So we must act and we must act quickly.   If we are talking history, let's go a little further back. In the  history of the United States, when one party was in control of the  White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, there has  never been a shutdown until this administration.   So today, when all of those opportunities are passed, we now hear  that it is somehow a shame that government isn't allowed to function.  The government isn't functioning. It has to be open. Then we can begin  operating under open bills and in a manner in which everyone would like  to see on a bipartisan basis.   But right now, there is real danger out there for the American  public. So we are now into the 19th day under this President's  shutdown, the second longest shutdown in the Nation's history and  already the third one under this administration.   Mr. Speaker, we are here to govern. We are here not to play games.  Let's do our job for the American people. Let's support this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, responsibly funding the Federal Government  is one of the most important duties of Congress. The previous majority  failed to do the most basic task of keeping the lights on.                                time  1515    On day 19 of the 116th Congress, we Democrats are here to reopen  Federal agencies shuttered by the President's shutdown.   This legislation, which has already garnered strong bipartisan  support in the Senate, will ensure that the Federal Government is open  and working for the American people.   Now, as to perfection, it is not perfect. I have not been here for a  perfect piece of legislation. What is critical to take from that  argument, though, is the fact that any one of us can argue that there  isn't some measure absolutely critical to them and they are not going  to vote for it because of that.   Respectfully, someone has to be the adult in the room and get things  done. Someone has to respect the process, the importance of what the  government does, and the needs of the American people. You can't kick  the ball in the forest preserve and go home. You have to move forward.   This is the way to operate, the manner in which the Senate has  already done, a manner in which we can accomplish and move forward  together to try to get this better, hopefully, next year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I simply encourage my colleagues to vote  ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.
