 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the distinguished Mr. Wilson for yielding as well.   Madam Speaker, I am so pleased that this legislation has such strong  bipartisan support on the floor of the House. It removes all doubt in  anyone's mind that we are all committed as a Nation, as a Congress-- House and Senate--in terms of this legislation. I thank both gentlemen  for their leadership.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate that the gentleman is working with the  ranking member, Mr. McCaul, on this important issue as well, and I  thank him for affording me this opportunity today.   Madam Speaker, 81 years ago, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came  here to the Congress of the United States, to the House of  Representatives, where I am proud to say my father, Thomas D'Alesandro,  served as a Member of Congress. And President Franklin Roosevelt  delivered a bold and historic request.   In his 1941 State of the Union Address, President Roosevelt explained  that democracy itself was under dire threat not only in Europe, but  around the world. And he called on Congress to lend a hand to our  Allies overseas, bolstering their defenses so they could defeat the  evils of fascism.                                time  1530    It was this initiative that would be enacted just two months later  that undeniably turned the tide of the Second World War. And the Lend- Lease program would help propel the allies to a victory that preserved  the promise of democracy for generations to come.   Today, we see an echo of that chapter in history as a murderous  tyrant seeks to conquer its neighbor and dismantle its democracy. And  this moment demands we summon a commitment to respond.   The Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 revives this  pivotal program, waiving time-consuming requirements and the President  authority to send critical defensive resources to Ukraine.   It is important to note that it is about time. Time is very important  when lives are at stake.   In doing so, we enable the administration to move faster to bolster  Ukraine's security forces, empowering them to repel the Russian  invaders; protect innocent civilians; and preserve their cherished  democracy.   As war rages on Ukraine, every minute matters. It is about time. This  strong action could mean the difference between lives saved and lives  lost. In any given battle, it could mean the margin between victory and  defeat.   It is with astonishing unity that the Senate sent us this important  legislation after passing it with a unanimous vote.   And as we hope to secure a strong bipartisan vote here in the House,  let us salute the leaders of this legislation, Chairman   Gregory  Meeks, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He acknowledged  his ranking member, Mr. McCaul from Texas; Congressman   Joe Wilson of  South Carolina, who is managing the bill on the Republican side today;  and Congressman   Steve Cohen, who helms the Helsinki Commission and  played a role in this legislation.   Madam Speaker, restoring the Lend-Lease authority is just the latest  action proudly taken by this Congress to strengthen Ukraine and to  decimate Russia. We have delivered billions in humanitarian security  and economic assistance for Ukraine, including the $13.6 billion in the  latest supplemental, and more to come, as our President has put forth a  request earlier today that we will turn into legislation, turn into  support democracy in Ukraine and, therefore, democracy in the world. I  salute the President for his leadership.   These resources are already--of the $13.6 billion, are already  reaching communities on the ground and helping Ukraine repel Russian  forces. But we need to do more.   As we prepare to take up the President's new supplemental request, we  are moving in lockstep with the administration and our allies to  isolate Russia and devastate its economy.   From severing normal trade relations to banning the import of Russian  energy, our strong actions in the House and in the Senate have made  Russia weaker in every way. And the House took its first steps to  prosecute Russian war crimes so the perpetrators can be held  accountable for the unthinkable, grotesque, diabolical atrocities.   Later today, with the blessing of the Embassy of Ukraine, we will  unveil in the Speaker's Dining Room--and we invite our Members to come  and their guests--a photo exhibit that captures many of these  atrocities.   These haunting photographs show the horror and heartbreak of Russia's  callous aggression of Ukraine, and serve as an important reminder of  our moral duty to continue to take swift, decisive action to help.   Going back to Lend-Lease, upon the enactment of the historic Lend- Lease law in March of 1941, Franklin Delano Roosevelt called upon the  conscience of our country when he declared: ``The light of democracy  must be kept burning. It is not enough for us merely to trim the wick  or polish the glass. The time has come when we must provide the fuel in  an ever-increasing amount to keep the flame alive.''   Madam Speaker, our task today remains the same.   I do want to acknowledge also another item, and I thank Mr. Chairman  and others for their support of this. We are doing Lend-Lease today. We  talked about what we did in the omnibus bill, the supplemental, $13.6  billion.   We talked about severing our purchase of oil. We have talked about  severing our normal trade relations. But we also did something  yesterday when we did what I call ``seize and freeze.'' Seize the  assets of the oligarchs and the Russians, that money, and freeze it.  And when it thaws, to use that money to help rebuild Ukraine after the  victory over the Russians.   So, again, we are thinking of what we need to do in humanitarian  assistance;  [[Page H4600]]  what we need to do in economic assistance; what we must do in security  assistance, weapons, et cetera. But we have to do some other aspects as  well.   Our task today, again, remains the same as it did with the original  Lend-Lease. Make no mistake. Russia invaded with the stated goal of  ending liberty and self-governance in Ukraine. Yet, with unimaginable  courage and determination, the Ukrainian people are putting their lives  on the line for democracy; not only for their own nation, but for  democracy writ large for the world.   It is about freedom versus dictatorship; autocracy versus democracy.  The Ukrainian people are making the fight for all of us. We must help  them.   So, it is our duty to honor their heroism at the front lines of the  battle for freedom by helping to fuel this righteous fight.   It is with endless admiration for the Ukrainian people and their  leadership, President--just everybody. I won't start naming names. All  of them. We have had visits from so many of them--and their unyielding  commitment to keeping alight democracy's precious flame that I urge a  strong, bipartisan ``aye'' vote for this vital legislation.
