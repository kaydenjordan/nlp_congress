 Mr. Chairman, this is a nearly 50-year-old temporary  program. It is indicative of everything in Washington: Nothing ever  dies here. We just spend more and more money.   The DOT literally picks winners and losers, where neighboring  airports have to compete against the Federal Government, which  subsidizes routes for the very same market. Approved subsidies include  funding leisure routes. That is not essential. That is leisure.   Flights on EAS routes are relatively empty compared to nonsubsidized  flights, and the obvious outcome of subsidizing these routes is that  they are not economically viable. That is why they are subsidized. It  is because nobody really needs them. There are other options that are  reasonable.   The industry continues to suffer from a pilot shortage, a mechanic  shortage, labor all across the board, ATC, et cetera. All we are doing  is making it worse by misallocating these resources.   Pilots are flying planes to places where there aren't any customers,  and they are canceling routes where people need to fly.   The bill does make significant improvements. However, the program  remains inherently unfair and represents a significant misallocation of  resources at a time when we can ill afford to do so.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes the section that  allows the administration to consider expanding the CLEEN Program.   Now, as a reminder, in the CLEEN Program, the FAA provides awards to  industry to develop and integrate technology that will reduce noise,  emissions, and fuel burn.   Now, looking over some of the projects, some of them aren't  completely useless: improvements to wing performance and thermal  efficiency for turbines may well contribute to cost savings. But that  actually begs the question: Why can't these projects be funded by  private industry alone?   Surely, if they improve fuel efficiency, that is a clear profit- driven motive to invest in new technologies.   The program also funds the development of ``alternative'' jet fuels  which is just another facet of the left's crusade to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions to meet completely arbitrary and unscientific targets.   The administration aims to achieve ``net zero'' greenhouse gas  emissions from the aviation sector by 2050.   Mr. Chairman, I want you to think about that because you won't be  flying when that happens.   The so-called sustainable aviation fuel is critical to achieving this  foolhardy goal.   However, this fuel doesn't change the physics of an engine. The  engine still emits carbon dioxide. Instead, emissions are actually  produced out of waste products cooking oil and agricultural waste  instead of fossil fuels, and then the engine burns that. That is what  you are paying for, Mr. Chairman. The program makes taxpayers pay for  that fuel.   These fuels are extremely expensive and not widely adopted, as low as  0.1 percent at last counting. The CLEEN Program acknowledges these  shortcomings.   Phase II simply furthered the understanding of key biofuel properties  in demonstrating the viability of them. So it acknowledges it is  actually not really changing anything, but we are just spending a lot  of money burning cooking oil in an aviation engine.   There is absolutely no reason we should actually be expanding this  program that is pouring taxpayer dollars into technologies into which  the public sector is unwilling to invest.   They are unwilling to invest because there is no money in this. The  only way it works is if the taxpayers pour all their money into it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, my friend on the other side of the aisle is  a good man. He is just, I think, misdirected on this occasion.   I will be clear. I don't want the administrator to be spending time  approving this contract or that contract. I don't want him doing any of  it.   As far as hydrogen, I marvel at this premise that somehow the  government is the only one that can figure this out. Somehow this  country figured out and invented the internal combustion engine, the  lightbulb, the airplane, and went to space.   But heaven forbid we figure this out without the government and  without these taxpayers being forced to pay for it.   The third phase of the CLEEN Program is awarding more than $100  million for aircraft and engine companies to develop and demonstrate  aircraft technologies that reduce fuel use, emissions, and noise.  Relating to sustainable aviation gas, CLEEN funds are trying to  research higher blends of biofuels to petroleum-based fuels which can  affect seal performance.   On average, this fuel costs three to five times more than  conventional jet fuel. We already have the jet fuel. It is already  efficient. It is already clean. We have already reduced emissions more  than all the other countries combined. We already met the Paris climate  accords requirements without being in the accord.   Now, other barriers to adoption include risks related to adoption,  including safety.   Mr. Chairman, as a person who has sat behind the stick and who has  been up in the air, I can tell you the pucker factor is pretty high  when the engine quits. I don't know about you, but I don't want to be  experimenting with fuel while I am up in the air, and I don't want the  pilots up front to be forced to experiment with it because the  government says so.   We have something that works. The private sector can figure this out.  They can invest in it, they can pay for it, and they can perfect it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chair, we don't need to provide more subsidies to  support this climate smart agriculture practice and production of  aviation biofuel feedstocks.   It actually makes your food more expensive because we are burning  your fuel in an aircraft instead of pumping it out of the ground where  the fuel has come from and has worked very, very well.   There are up to $3 billion in DOE loan guarantees. I want to win the  race, too, but the Federal Government picking winners and losers  ensures that we probably will lose the race because we are going to  pick the wrong one, as the Federal Government normally does.   Once again, this is an absurd policy. If it were viable at all, the  private sector would invest in it.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just like the last amendment, this amendment recognizes the fact that  our country is out of money. We are borrowing money to pay our bills,  and we are paying for things that we can't afford. We are paying for  things that these folks can't afford.   Mr. Chair, this amendment reduces the authorization levels in section  101, which is airport planning; section 103, which is operations; and  section 1111, which is research and development.   The authorization levels in the underlying bill represent a  significant increase from the levels set by Congress in the 2018  reauthorization bill.   For example, the underlying bill raises the authorizations by  significant  [[Page H3837]]  amounts from FY 2023 to FY 2024: 101 by $650 million, 103 by $1.2  billion, and 1111 by $41 million.   This amendment reduces the growth of these authorization levels while  still increasing the funds authorized for FAA, resulting in a net  savings of nearly $5 billion.   If we are going to raise the level, understanding and recognizing  inflation caused by out-of-control spending in this place, we are going  to recognize and understand that the FAA still has to continue to  operate, but we are not going to raise it so much.   Our national debt is out of control, and it is this mindless, rapid  growth of spending in Washington that has put our Nation on the brink  of catastrophe.   Moreover, this massive increase in funding is not resulting in a  safer or more efficient FAA mission. That is their mission: safety,  more efficiency. It instead represents a significant misallocation of  resources to woke and green missions at the expense of safety and  financial sanity.   We must reorient the FAA back to its original mission and ensure the  funding we provide to them is appropriate to meet the moment while not  wasting taxpayer resources.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from the other side of  the aisle, but I want to clarify. It is not a cut. We are actually  increasing the spend; just not as much.   Now, I know in Washington, oh, my goodness, who knew the request was  up to $4 billion? I imagine they would take more than $4 billion if we  gave it to them.   We are broke. Hello, America. Wake up, everybody. I have a news flash  for you. We don't have anymore money. We are borrowing money to pay the  bills. We are borrowing money to pay for things that we can't afford.  That is what we are trying to fix here.   If you want to save some money somewhere else and spend it here, I am  all ears. Let's talk about it. Something has to give. These people  can't afford any more. They are not getting more out of this.   I have been in the room. I used to sit on appropriations in the State  House. I know how it goes. Well, we spent this much this year or last  year. We are just going to add some more this year.   Nobody goes through line by line and says, oh, well, this costs this  much more because concrete costs X and labor costs Y. Nobody does that.  They just add money to it.   It is all arbitrary, and we know it. Everybody in this place knows  it. That is why we should spend less because we don't have the money to  spend.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chairman, since my good friend brought it up, it was a  bipartisan agreement. So the world knows that it was a bipartisan  agreement here, known in Congress as what is called a four-corners  deal: two on their side, two on our side.   There are 435 Members of Congress. I wasn't involved. I wasn't one of  the four. You weren't one of the four. Nobody else here was one of the  four.   They decided to spend all these billions of dollars. They didn't come  to me and say, well, we need this much for concrete and this much for  research, because they decided, and this is what is in the bill. Heaven  forbid anybody challenge it.   Mr. Chair, we do not have the money. We should reduce the  authorization. It is still an increase, just not as much, and it  recognizes the fact that our country is broke.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes the word  ``vertiport'' from the definition of ``heliport'' for the purposes of  AIP funding, the same funding that the gentleman on the other side of  the aisle just mentioned that we need so much of.   As a helicopter pilot, I am very interested in the funding for  heliports, but vertiports are going to use some of that funding;  meanwhile, not paying anything in.   Let me tell you, Mr. Chair. Vertiports exist for the purpose of  advanced air mobility and electric vertical takeoff and landing or  eVTOL vehicles, which only exist in prototype and other nascent stages.   Mr. Chair, eVTOL is so immature in its development that there is a  reality index that actually exists--an Advanced Air Mobility Reality  Index.   The reality index ranks companies and essentially determines whether  there is a reality that these things are ever going to even come to the  market, be produced, and be viable. Is that something we should be  investing in?   These are ranked and combined to describe the likelihood of the  aircraft certification and production on scale. Again, this is a  ranking of the likelihood that these things even get produced, much  less used.   Furthermore, if these vehicles become the norm, Jetson style like  their proponents envision, allowing AAM vehicles to receive the  benefits of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund without paying into it,  evokes the same debate we are currently having about the government- mandated transition to electric automobiles which don't pay into the  highway fund. They don't pay in, but they use it.   The same thing here. These vehicles want to use it, but they don't  want to pay into it. They are robbing from everybody else that has to  use it that actually currently exists and are used.   I haven't even gotten into the drawbacks of the potential vehicles,  but how about being concerned about adequate storage for hazardous  materials to respond to lithium and other critical mineral-related  fires?   The fires are challenging enough for firefighters to address on the  ground or at sea, let alone having them occur between skyscrapers.   If you wonder, do these fires actually exist, you can just search the  internet. It is widely known. You can see the electric vehicles burning  at the charger, burning people's garages, burning and burning and  burning. There is a problem because they are unstable.   If you want to get in the air and fly in one of these things, God  bless you, but your money is going to be transferred to deal with these  things that don't pay into the fund. They don't pay anything in, yet  they are going to draw money out.   This system works when the users pay into it. That is how it works.  Otherwise, these folks up here are going to have to pay extra because  there is not going to be enough money in the fund to pay for all of it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the clarification,  and I marvel at the fact that we can include the definition and the  term in preparation for something that right now doesn't really exist  practically. It is in people's minds, and it is on a computer. There  are prototypes out there.   We can do that, but we can't find any way to charge and make sure  they are paying their fair share into the fund that they are going to  use the infrastructure of, right? The infrastructure is created by the  fund, and they are going to use it, but they ain't going to pay. We  can't figure that out, but we sure can make sure that they have access  to everything else that everyone is paying for.   Ladies and gentlemen, in Washington, D.C., this is how things go  awry. This is how you go broke. This is how you can't afford things  that you need to do, like pay for your highways, filled now with  electric vehicles that are not paying into the system, paying nothing  for the roads that they are on, weighing thousands of pounds in excess  of most of the regular cars that are using the road now and are paying  the fee.   Do you know what we are going to do because we are so brilliant and  because that is working so well? We are going to double down and do it  in the air, as well. That is awesome.   It is not awesome, ladies and gentlemen. Do you know what else is not  awesome? Most of the materials sourced in this stuff come from the  Communist Chinese, made by slave labor, whether it is the actual slave  labor in concentration camps in east Turkistan or whether it is the  child slave labor in the Congo feeding the Chinese machine, feeding the  machine here so we can virtue signal that we are doing everything  clean, that we are electrified and are not going to charge anybody for  it. Somebody is going to pay.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Graves of Missouri) having assumed the chair, Mr. Flood, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  3935) to amend title 49, United States Code, to reauthorize and improve  the Federal Aviation Administration and other civil  [[Page H3839]]  aviation programs, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________
