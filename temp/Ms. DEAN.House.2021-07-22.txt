 Mr. Speaker, last week marked a year since our country lost  a giant and a friend to all, John Lewis.   Republicans and Democrats of both Chambers rightfully used our  platforms to memorialize a man who gave so much, and as many say, he  was the conscience of our caucus.   Mr. Lewis nearly lost his life at the age of 25 to those on the other  side of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in March of 1965 as he nonviolently  protested voter suppression laws.   And he dedicated the rest of his life to justice, equality, and  protecting the right to vote.   Mr. Speaker, 66 years later we are again on that bridge. Seventeen  States have passed 28 laws to make it more difficult to exercise our  constitutional right to vote.   We must act.   So I say to my colleagues that stand in the way of the John Lewis  Voting Rights Act, would you also have stood on the other side of that  bridge?   Mr. Lewis understood we could not wait for those on the other side of  the bridge to join us. We must secure, protect, and expand the right to  vote for all Americans to truly honor Mr. Lewis' life, legacy, and our  democracy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for offering me this  minute and a half, and I thank him for his leadership for bringing this  bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the ALLIES Act. This bill will save  lives and protect our allies. It will also honor our commitment to the  region. Thousands of Afghans have served as interpreters, drivers, and  guides to assist U.S. troops. Their service and commitment have been  consistent over the 20 years that now marks the longest U.S. war in  history.   The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa, or SIVs, allows people who worked  for or on behalf of the United States Government to seek lawful  permanent residence in the United States. But as we prepare to remove  our troops, the Taliban continues to target our friends. The ALLIES Act  of 2021 provides for an additional 8,000 SIVs to accommodate everyone  who currently could be an eligible candidate in the pipeline. We have  an opportunity and a moral obligation to save the lives of those who  served us.   As we draw down our military presence in Afghanistan, many who served  alongside our troops continue to face increased threats because of  their service to us. We must do the right thing by our brave allies.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Crow for his service and his  leadership on this bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the  bill.
