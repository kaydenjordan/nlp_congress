 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Team USA  and to recognize the contributions of so many Minnesotans at the 2018  Olympic Winter Games in South Korea.   I am happy to be joined here by my Senate colleague from Minnesota,  Senator Smith. Why are Senator Smith and I here today? We are here  because we had an incredible Olympics, with Minnesota really leading  the way when it came to the gold medals.   Of course, our State is no stranger to the Olympics. We have sent  athletes to compete in women's basketball and cycling. But it shouldn't  be a surprise that it is the Winter Olympics where the bold northern  State really shines. We have a couple of things going for us. The  weather is kind of cold. There is snow, so people are able to practice.  We also have a great athletic program at our high schools, and we have  a lot of team spirit, which is especially helpful in the teams we were  a part of that won the gold, including men's curling and women's  hockey.   Of the 243 athletes who were on Team USA, 23 have ties to Minnesota,  making it the third highest represented State. These athletes competed  at the highest level and showed the world just what our State could do.  If Minnesota were competing as a country, it would be tied for 12th,  globally in the number of gold medals won. But we are not a country; we  are a proud State. This success is something all Minnesotans can  celebrate.   Mr. President, here are some examples for you. Winning a gold medal  was a first for Afton native Jessie Diggings and a first for the United  States. Her road to the Olympics started on the cross-country skiing  trails that cover Minnesota. Jessie worked to keep spirits high in  training and during the Olympic competition. She put glitter on her  cheeks as a reminder of what made her fall in love with cross-country  skiing as a little girl. Her relentless energy and drive were on full  display. She and her teammate, Kikkan Randall, became the first  Americans to bring home a gold in cross-country team history. It is no  surprise that they voted Jessie to be the flag-bearer for the closing  ceremony.   Jessie and Kikkan weren't the only American women to bring home gold.  The women's hockey team won their first gold medal since 1998.   It is no coincidence that the ``State of Hockey'' sent some serious  talent. The American team included six current or former Gopher College  players and two current or former Minnesota Duluth players. From  Warroad to Minnetonka, the Minnesotans on Team USA brought pond hockey  toughness and the experience that comes from growing up on the ice.  This gold medal will help inspire the next generation of hockey players  in Minnesota.   I want to make a special note of our incredible goalie, Maddie  Rooney. If anyone stayed up--which I did--to watch that shootout at the  end, she showed such poise and such grace under pressure.   I also want to make a little note of Warroad, MN, which produced the  incredible Gigi Marvin, along with many other gold medalists from the  past.   While Americans were fans of hockey well before the 2018 games, these  Olympics helped introduce the country to a sport already loved by so  many Minnesotans--curling. I will note that Senator Cornyn of Texas  sent out a tweet saying that curling was an obscure sport. I don't  think anyone thinks that anymore. They might think it is kind of an  interesting sport, but it has gone from obscure to cool. A lot of that  has to do with the men's curling team. Four out of five of the members  of that team were from our home State of Minnesota. In that game, the  match went from 1 to 4 in the morning or midnight to 3. I can't tell  you how many Minnesotans were up all night watching that and  celebrating the gold medal.   The success of Minnesotans has been inspiring, and I know Senator  Smith agrees. From frozen ponds to backyard hills, Minnesota helps  bring the winter athlete out in everyone.   I congratulate Team USA and all Minnesota athletes who made these  games such a success.   Senator Smith.    Mr. President, I know Minnesotans will look forward to  Senator Smith's actual first speech, but I think it is a tribute to our  State that her first appearance on the Senate floor was about all of  these Gold Medals in hockey and curling and skiing.   Thank you.                            ____________________
