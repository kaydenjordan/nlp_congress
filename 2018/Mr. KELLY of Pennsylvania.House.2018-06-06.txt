 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to  acknowledge Chairman Shuster's leadership on this, and thank the entire  committee and all the staff. I sure appreciate all the hard work.   This amendment allows the Army Corps of Engineers to strongly  consider the large number of recreational boats that use the locks on  the Allegheny River in my district when prioritizing operation and  maintenance projects.   River communities on the Allegheny, like Kittanning, Ford City,  Freeport, East Brady, and others, rely on recreational boating for  their economic well-being. In recent years, the Army Corps of Engineers  and a local nonprofit, the Allegheny River Development Corporation,  have developed a successful private-public partnership. Their  partnership has resulted in private money being raised to keep the  locks operational only on summer weekends and for recreational use.  This amendment will allow the Army Corps of Engineers the flexibility  it needs to help keep the locks open throughout the summer tourism  months once again.   Speaking on this issue, a commissioner in Armstrong County once said  to me: ``You know, Washington has taken away our coal jobs, now they're  trying to take away our river.''   Because of the hard work of people like Linda Hemmes and other  community leaders, the river is still open to thousands of boaters who  enjoy the Allegheny River on summer weekends. But even the weekend lock  operations are still very much at risk, and it is my hope that this  amendment will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize funding  so the river remains passable all summer long for decades to come.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of  my time.
