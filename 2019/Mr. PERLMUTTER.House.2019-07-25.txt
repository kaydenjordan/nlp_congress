Sec. 3.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of July 26, 2019.                                time  1215     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met last night and  reported a rule, House Resolution 519, providing for consideration of  H.R. 3877, which is the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the  Budget, and provides for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 549, the Venezuela  TPS Act of 2019, also under a closed rule. The rule provides 30 minutes  of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary, and one motion to  recommit, with or without instructions.   Finally, the rule provides same-day authority through the legislative  day of tomorrow, Friday, July 26, 2019.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are here today to bring up two important  bipartisan pieces of legislation. Let me start with H.R. 3877, the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.   For months, House Democrats have negotiated with the White House and  the Senate in order to agree on budget levels for fiscal year 2020 so  Congress can complete all the appropriations bills and avoid another  governmental shutdown like we saw at the beginning of this year.   Despite resistance from my friends on the Republican side of the  aisle, the House is well underway with the appropriations process. We  have passed 10 of the 12 appropriations bills, which fund nearly 96  percent of the Federal Government.   Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to take up any of the 12  appropriations bills and, in fact, none of the bills have even been  marked up by the Senate.   The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 will set overall budget levels to  avoid drastic cuts next year and allow House and Senate appropriators  to negotiate final bills to avoid a shutdown and provide certainty to  Americans and all the Federal employees who work for them.   Importantly, this bill will also raise the debt ceiling for the next  2 years. Put simply, we cannot put in jeopardy the full faith and  credit of the United States of America. This bill rightfully provides  the Treasury Department the ability to continue paying our bills and  honor the commitments the U.S. has already made.   While Members on both sides of the aisle may not like everything in  this deal, it is a compromise which supports critical investments for  all Americans and, I believe, sets us on a strong path forward this  fiscal year.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 549, the Venezuela  TPS Act of 2019. This bipartisan bill was debated on Tuesday under  suspension of the rules, and I was disappointed more of my friends from  the other side of the aisle didn't join every Democrat, 37 Republicans,  and 1 Independent, to help get to the two-thirds vote required under  suspension.   Venezuela is currently in crisis. Their democratic institutions have  been corrupted under the Maduro regime and, according to the U.N.  Refugee Agency and the International Organization for Migration, more  than 4 million Venezuelans have fled the country.   I want to applaud the work of Representatives Darren Soto, Mario  Diaz-Balart, and my friend, Donna Shalala, from the Rules Committee,  for their work to advance this bill to provide temporary protected  status for Venezuelan refugees already in the United States. That is  why I am glad we have included this bill in the rule today, to ensure  this bill passes the House as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, overall, this rule provides for consideration of two  very important measures we need to get done before the upcoming  district work period. I urge all my colleagues to support the rule and  the underlying bills.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Cole for his comments, particularly  about the Venezuelan TPS legislation, as well as the Bipartisan Budget  Act of 2019. Truly, these are two bills that are supported by both  sides of the aisle. Neither one is exactly perfect, but they are both  good, and that is the kind of legislation we need to get through this  body to the Senate and to the White House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Shalala), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would just say to my friend, Mr. Kustoff, he and I served together  on Financial Services, and there is agreement here. In fact, this  resolution that he described as a great stepping stone, we just took  and passed the resolution 2 days ago with 398 ``aye'' votes in favor of  that.   Today, though, we are here to focus on two other things, both of  which are substantial measures in and of themselves, and we can look  forward to other measures involving the anti-BDS movement or whatever  we may be, but to deal with anti-Semitism.   But today we are here, really, to applaud a deal that was cut among  all of our leaders, Democrats and Republicans, that eliminates drastic  cuts, approves funding, or funding levels, for the next year to 2  years, and allows America to move forward without the real potential of  shutdown like we had for 35 days when the White House, earlier in this  year, refused to deal on certain subjects and appropriations.  Thankfully, we got through that.   I think, at this point, cooler heads have prevailed, and we are  moving forward on the Bipartisan Budget Act; and then, as Ms. Shalala  said, we are dealing with, really, a humanitarian crisis that exists in  Venezuela, at this point, to provide temporary protected status to  those who fled their country, who are in America, many of whom are in  Florida, to provide them some protection while they are here and to  make sure that they can comfortably, if you will, remain here and not  fear that they are going to have to be deported back to Venezuela,  where we know there is a lot of strife and danger.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just want to continue to focus on what is before us today, and what  is before us today is dealing with the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela  and dealing with the budget of the United States of America, two  accomplishments, both bipartisan, that I think will really assist and  protect so many people who fled Venezuela to America, and particularly  to Florida, but also provides for funding caps that help us with  veterans, with infrastructure, with foreign affairs across the board,  with our military.   The President tweeted the other day that the Bipartisan Budget Act  was a real accomplishment for veterans and our military, and I agree.                                time  1245    I am sorry that Mr. Zeldin and Mr. Cole would like to bring up  something else.   In fact, I was fortunate enough to be in the chair when the BDS bill  and the resolution, H. Res. 246, I think it was, was being debated and  passed by an overwhelming majority and it really was a huge  accomplishment, which I am afraid the arguments that the gentleman is  making now minimize what was accomplished just 2 days ago.   I think we need to remain focused on these major pieces of  legislation that will guide America for the next 2 years and will  protect Venezuelans who fled their country for at least 18 months.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for his  comments. I almost thought he was going to support the rule. I just  felt it was moving in that direction, but not quite, but I do want to  thank him.   And, particularly, I think, during the 35 days that we were in  shutdown mode at the beginning of this year, there were a lot of hard  lessons learned by a lot of people, and there were a lot of people who  suffered, starting with the people that needed assistance in one way or  another by Federal employees who were, in effect, sitting at home  waiting for us to open the government again.   So, Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman, I think that hard lesson-- and we met pretty much every night in the Rules Committee, the  Appropriations Committee, the gentleman is an appropriator--that was  something that weighed heavily on all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to applaud the Republicans and Democrats, our  leadership, and the White House in coming up with a compromise.   I know there will be some on my side that will not support this for a  variety of reasons, and I know there will be some on Mr. Cole's side as  well, but, hopefully, we can garner enough support--and I think it will  be strong support--today for both of these pieces of legislation that  are brought up under the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for joining me to speak on  the rule and these pieces of legislation.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 549, the Venezuelan TPS  Act, which we already know is supported by a bipartisan majority in  this House.   We also need and must pass H.R. 3877, the Bipartisan Budget Act of  2019. This legislation will raise the debt ceiling for 2 years and  increases discretionary spending caps for fiscal year 2020 and fiscal  year 2021. The deal achieves parity between increases in defense and  nondefense spending and lets the House and the Senate get back to  negotiation on all of the appropriations bills so that Congress can  fulfill its constitutional duty of funding the government.   As we look ahead to the next several weeks, which we will spend in  our districts visiting with constituents and touring local businesses,  I look forward to sharing with my constituents that despite our  disagreements and everything that they may see on TV, we can still come  together and get things done on behalf of America.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                      Amendment to House Resolution 519         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON WITHDRAWALS OF UNITED STATES                     FORCES FROM SYRIA AND AFGHANISTAN.         (a) Findings--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The foreign terrorist organization al Qaeda,       responsible for the attacks of September 11, 2001, maintains       a presence in Afghanistan.        (2) The Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham, better known by       its acronym ISIS, flourished in the chaos unleashed by the       civil war in Syria and at one point controlled extensive       territory in Iraq and Syria.        (3) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have murdered       thousands of innocent civilians.        (4) Al Qaeda, ISIS, and their affiliates have proven       resilient and have regrouped when the United States and its       partners have withdrawn from the fight against them.        (b) Sense of Congress--Congress--        (1) acknowledges that the United States military and our       partners have made significant progress in the campaign       against al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham       (ISIS), and honors the contributions and sacrifice of the       members of the United States Armed Forces who have served on       the front lines of this fight;        (2) recognizes the continuing threat to the homeland and       our allies posed by al Qaeda and ISIS, which maintain an       ability to operate in Syria and Afghanistan;        (3) expresses concern that Iran has supported the Taliban       in Afghanistan and Hizballah and the Assad regime in Syria,       and has sought to frustrate diplomatic efforts to resolve       conflicts in these two countries;        (4) recognizes the positive role the United States and its       partners have played in Syria and Afghanistan fighting       terrorist groups, countering Iranian aggression, deterring       the further use of chemical weapons, and protecting human       rights;        (5) warns that a precipitous withdrawal of United States       forces from the ongoing fight against these groups, without       effective, countervailing efforts to secure gains in Syria       and Afghanistan, could allow terrorists to regroup,       destabilize critical regions, and create vacuums that could       be filled by Iran or Russia, to the detriment of United       States interests and those of our allies;        (6) recognizes that al Qaeda and ISIS pose a global threat,       which merits increased international contributions to the       counterterrorism, diplomatic, and stabilization efforts       underway in Syria and Afghanistan;        (7) recognizes that diplomatic efforts to secure peaceful,       negotiated solutions to the conflicts in Syria and       Afghanistan are necessary to long-term stability and       counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East and South Asia;        (8) acknowledges the progress made by Special       Representative Khalilzad in his efforts to promote       reconciliation in Afghanistan;        (9) calls upon the Administration to conduct a thorough       review of the military and diplomatic strategies in Syria and       Afghanistan, including an assessment of the risk that       withdrawal from those countries could strengthen the power       and influence of Russia and Iran in the Middle East and South       Asia and undermine diplomatic efforts toward negotiated,       peaceful solutions;        (10) requests that the Administration, as part of this       review, solicit the views of Israel, our regional partners,       and other key troop-contributing nations in the fight against       al Qaeda and ISIS;        (11) reiterates support for international diplomatic       efforts to facilitate peaceful, negotiated resolutions to the       ongoing conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan on terms that       respect the rights of innocent civilians and deny safe havens       to terrorists;        (12) calls upon the Administration to pursue a strategy       that sets the conditions for the long-term defeat of al Qaeda       and ISIS, as well as the protection of regional partners and       allies, while ensuring that Iran cannot dominate the region       or threaten Israel;        (13) encourages close collaboration between the Executive       Branch and the Legislative Branch to ensure continuing       strong, bipartisan support for United States military       operations in Syria and Afghanistan; and        (14) calls upon the Administration to certify that       conditions have been met for the enduring defeat of al Qaeda       and ISIS before initiating any significant withdrawal of       United States forces from Syria or Afghanistan.        (c) Rule of Construction--Nothing in this section shall be       construed as a declaration of war or an authorization of the       use of military force.        Sec. 6. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 336.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
