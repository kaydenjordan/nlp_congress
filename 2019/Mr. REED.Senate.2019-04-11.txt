 Mr. President, I want to take a moment to join in the  celebration of National Library Week. This year's theme, ``Libraries =  Strong  [[Page S2428]]  Communities,'' is fitting. Every day, our libraries help make our  communities stronger and more vibrant, as they innovate and mobilize  resources to provide programs and services that meet ever-evolving  community needs.   That is why I have been proud to work during my time in the Senate on  ways to support our Nation's libraries. Last December, on a bipartisan  basis, I secured passage and enactment of my legislation to reauthorize  and enhance the Museum and Library Services Act. This law authorizes  Federal funding, a relatively modest investment, through the Institute  of Museum and Library Services, IMLS, to enable libraries and museums  to work in partnership at the State and local levels and with  nonprofits, universities, businesses, and others to support, educate,  enlighten, and enrich our communities. For libraries, this law seeks to  ensure they are equipped to serve community needs, in areas such as  workforce, economic, and business development; digital and financial  literacy; critical thinking; and new and emerging technologies.  Critically, this new law ensures that increases in library formula  funding will be shared more broadly across States and specifically  smaller ones like Rhode Island.   Just last week, I hosted a conversation with our State's library  professionals to follow-up on a similar roundtable I held in Rhode  Island in 2016 as I began my work on the Museum and Library Services  Act. It was inspiring to hear the many ways in which our libraries are  hard at work transforming themselves to serve their diverse  communities.   I was glad the director of IMLS, Dr. Kathryn Matthew, could join us  for this event. We have a special duty in Rhode Island to elevate the  work of IMLS, which is one of my predecessor, Senator Pell's, many  lasting gifts to our Nation.   While the President's budget proposes to once again eliminate funding  for IMLS, I have been able to instead secure an increase of $11 million  for this agency over the last 2 years. There is broad, bipartisan  support for the work IMLS does, and I am continuing to work with my  colleagues to increase funding so we can advance IMLS's mission.   My work on libraries extends to ones in our schools, which also need  our care and attention. Studies show that effective school library  programs, staffed by a certified school librarian, have a positive  impact on student achievement and educational success. Knowing how to  find and use information are essential skills for college, careers, and  life in general. A good school library, staffed by a trained school  librarian, is where students develop and hone these skills.   Yet, according to the American Library Association, while 91 percent  of the over 90,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools  in the Nation have a school library, only 61 percent have a full-time  librarian. A National Education Association report about trends in  school libraries found that students in the highest poverty schools  were less likely to have libraries at their schools and there were  significant disparities in staffing at schools with high percentages of  minority students. Access to an effective school library program,  staffed by a certified school librarian, is an issue of educational  equity.   In 2015, I was pleased to work with the library community and my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that our main Federal  elementary and secondary education law continued to specifically  address the critical equity issue of public school libraries. Since my  time in the other body, I have worked hard to ensure Federal support  for our school libraries and I continue to fight for increased funding  for the Innovative Approaches to Literacy, IAL, grant program  authorized in the Every Students Succeeds Act, ESSA. IAL provides  competitive awards to school libraries, as well as national not-for- profit organizations to support children and families in high-need,  underserved communities. By providing age-appropriate books, supporting  parental engagement programs, and reinforcing professional development,  the IAL program helps to support literacy skills to ensure children are  best positioned for success.   I encourage all of my colleagues to visit their local libraries and  school libraries to see firsthand that libraries are no longer quaint  and quiet places to find the latest books, although they still offer  plenty of that. They are community hubs providing innovative  programming and services to spark creativity, boost learning and STEM  education, promote the use of emerging technologies, and develop new  career pathways. In sum, they are strengthening our communities, our  States, and our Nation.                            ____________________
