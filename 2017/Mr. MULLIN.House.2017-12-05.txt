 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe for allowing this to  come to the floor and Leader McCarthy for his leadership in bringing  this bill to the floor. I also want to thank my fellow Senators from  Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe and Mr. Lankford, for their great work in getting  this passed in the Senate.   As the sponsor of H.R. 42, the House companion bill to S. 1266, I  urge my colleagues to support and vote in favor of today's bill.   Nearly a year ago, we debated this bill on the floor and saw it  passed by voice vote. I look forward to another strong response from  the House in sending this bill to the President's desk and it becoming  law.   This bill simply authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to  contract with nonprofit organizations that accredit healthcare  organizations in order to investigate VA medical centers.   This bill would allow the VA to get a second opinion from outside of  the agency in order to get the best information and provide the best  care for our veterans. Just like how patients sometimes need to get a  second opinion on their diagnosis, the VA should not be above bringing  in a second opinion.   Our veterans deserve care equal to the finest civilian hospitals, so  let's bring more transparency to the VA by allowing them to invite the  people who evaluate those private hospitals to take a look at the VA  and make recommendations when problems arise.   This is a commonsense bill that will help improve the care for our  veterans, and I hope all will support it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.
