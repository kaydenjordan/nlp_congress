 Madam President, we are debating, last week and this  week, the authorization for the use of military force authority that  was granted in 2002, which is a really important debate that we are  seeing right here on the Senate floor.   By the way, it is a good-faith argument. There are Members on both  sides of the aisle making different arguments.   There is not a topic, in my view, more important than the issues at  stake here--how to use military force; when to use military force; is  it authorized by the President to use military force?--because, as to  the issue of the U.S. Government sending young men and women into  harm's way to defend our country's interests, there is nothing more  important, in my view--nothing more important.   I appreciate the time and the debate here on the floor. It is also  important because it wraps into--when you talk about young men and  women going into harm's way overseas, one of the biggest harms to  American service men and women over the past 20 years has actually been  from Shia militia groups supported by Iranian terrorist organizations.  Now, it doesn't always seem to make sense in that Americans who were  killed in Iraq and wounded in Iraq were often--and I will give some of  the numbers here--killed and wounded because those who did the killing  and wounding were supplied by Iranian terrorist groups. In particular,  the Quds Force, which was led by Qasem Soleimani, during the course of  the Iraq war, killed over 600 American servicemembers and wounded over  2,000 with very sophisticated IEDs that were supplied by the Iranians  to their proxies in Iraq.   So what does any of this have to do with the 2002 AUMF for Iraq that  we were debating last week and will debate this week? Well, the answer  is everything, everything.   We eventually figured out--we, the United States--that these very  sophisticated IEDs, which are called explosively formed projectiles or  penetrators, EFPs, were actually, as I mentioned, caused by the  Iranians. It took some time to figure this out because, like so many  things, the Iranian terrorists in Tehran and the ayatollahs lie--they  lie--and they denied it. ``Oh, we didn't have anything to do with  that.'' Well, they actually had everything to do with that. Again, the  best and brightest in America, in my view, for many years, during the  Iraq war, were being killed by Iranian terrorists and being led by  Qasem Soleimani, who was the head of the Quds Force, that was doing  this.   During that time of 2005 to the middle of 2006, I was serving as a  Marine Corps staff officer to the commanding general to the U.S.  Central Command, General Abizaid. I was deployed to many parts of the  CENTCOM AOR with the CENTCOM Commander. Probably the biggest concern,  no doubt, was of these incredibly effective, brutally efficient EFPs  that were killing and wounding so many of our best and brightest. To  this day, it is just remarkable to me that so few people even know  about this or talk about it--the killing and maiming of thousands of  American troops by the Iranians and the Quds Force, led by General  Soleimani.   Again, what does this have to do with the 2002 AUMF? Everything.   What happened during that time?   Well, when we figured out it was the Iranians doing this, we--we,  again, the national leadership--never really retaliated against Iran at  all. Imagine that. We knew that they were killing and wounding  thousands of our best and brightest, and the United States did not do  anything to establish deterrence. As a matter of fact, during that  time, we lost deterrence, and it became clear that Iran, with good  reason, started to think: Hey, we can kill American servicemembers with  impunity. There is no price.   So they did.   When you lose deterrence with a terrorist regime that likes to kill  Americans and has a history of killing Americans, it is not a good  thing, especially for the young men and women who are serving our  country in dangerous places.   I remember, early on in my Senate tenure here, in a briefing we had  in the SCIF, I asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs: Do you think we  have lost deterrence? There have been 600 Americans killed and over  2,000 wounded. Do you think the Iranians believe they can kill as many  American servicemembers as they can--again, America's best and  brightest--and not pay a price?   The Chairman said: Yes. The Chairman said: Yes.   I remember that very distinctly.  [[Page S973]]    So the whole point is, How do you reestablish deterrence? Because, if  you reestablish deterrence, you are going to save lives, and you are  going to protect your servicemembers.   Again, there is nothing more important that we do as a country than  making sure the men and women who go defend our country--who defend us,  who defend our interests--are protected, are lethal, are the best  trained. But it is difficult because, when you lose deterrence, it is  hard to get it back. Well, we did get it back, and I certainly applaud  President Trump and the Trump administration.   When Qasem Soleimani was back in Iraq, scoping American forces to  kill--by the way, a lot of them during that time were from Alaska--in  early January 2020, the Trump administration said: The joke is over.  This guy with the blood on his hands of thousands of our best and  brightest--he is not doing it again.   And he was killed during a daring strike on January 3, 2020. He was  looking to kill more American troops in Iraq, and he got killed. I  think it was justified and an important signal to send to everybody  around the world that you can't go around killing American troops and  not expect to have retaliation against you or your country. That should  be basic. That should be basic. Every U.S. Senator here, today, should  agree with that 110 percent.   The Trump administration said: We are not going to allow this  anymore, and the guy who is responsible for killing so many Americans  and wounding so many Americans--he is going to pay.   And he did, with his life.   The legal authorization for that very justified killing was the 2002  AUMF that we are debating right now. OK. That was only 3 years ago that  that happened. So it is very relevant to the issue of deterrence and  very relevant to the issue of Iran.   For some of my colleagues to say: Well, it is old. It has nothing to  do with anything that is happening right now, they couldn't be more  inaccurate. This matters, and it matters today. For those who say it  doesn't, they don't know this history or they don't want to know this  history or they haven't been watching the news for the last 96 hours.   Some of us are concerned about the very debate we are having here,  which is to say: Let's remove the authorization that we used to kill  Soleimani. Let's get rid of it. Hmm, what kind of signal does that  send? Could this signal maybe we are not worried about deterring Iran  anymore? Could this signal that removing this authorization, this 2002  authorization that, again, was used to regain deterrence with Iran--if  we got rid of it, would this embolden Iran?   Well, as I mentioned, in the last 96 hours, we have had Iranian  proxies unleashing deadly attacks on American servicemembers and  American contractors. That is happening right now. Is it a coincidence?  I don't know. One American is dead, and five have been wounded with  these brazen attacks. Some of us thought this actually might happen. It  is happening. It is happening.   Unfortunately, there was a little bit of something going on last week  that we are going to get to the bottom of. Trust me. On the Armed  Services Committee, we are going to get to the bottom of it because,  last Thursday, when we were debating the AUMF, these vicious attacks  started at 6:30 a.m., DC time. It was on the day we were debating the  AUMF--all day Thursday. We didn't hear about it until the close of  business Thursday. Was somebody hiding that information from us? It was  pretty relevant information. We are going to find out about that.   I am going to be offering an amendment to the AUMF tomorrow, and I  believe every U.S. Senator should vote for it. Here is why: I believe  that the 2002 AUMF clearly helped with deterrence. It was the  authority, in addition to article II, to take out one of the biggest  terrorists, heck, in the 21st century. That is for sure. He killed more  Americans than any other terrorist. That is for sure.   So the question is, Will removing this AUMF lessen American  deterrence against Iran's malign activities?   That is what my amendment asks the Director of National Intelligence  to do--to look at that question and certify the answer. If the answer  is no, then this new AUMF or the removal of this AUMF can go forward.   Again, it is a really simple question: Ask the DNI, for the next 30  days, to look at this question: Will removing the 2002 AUMF lessen  American deterrence against Iran's malign activities?   Why wouldn't every U.S. Senator want to go: ``That is a really good  question. Heck, we are seeing it in the Middle East right now--in  Syria. Maybe this is going to embolden Iran. Heck, maybe we shouldn't  do it. Maybe, by doing this, we are going to put American  servicemembers' lives at risk. Hmm. Maybe we shouldn't do it. Let's ask  the DNI''?   That is it. Why wouldn't you want that?   I was just talking to a couple of the proponents of this AUMF debate.  Again, I have a lot of respect for them, but I asked them: Why wouldn't  you want this? Wouldn't you want to know? Just wait 30 more days. I  know you have been trying to get this removed for years. Wait 30 days.  Send it to the President's own Director of National Intelligence and  ask her: Review the intelligence. Review what you are hearing with the  chatter among the Iranian proxies who are trying to kill Americans and  who have killed Americans. Is any of this related to the removal of the  AUMF? Then give us an answer in 30 days, and if the answer is no, this  can move forward. If it is yes and this will hurt our deterrence  against Iran, then we shouldn't be doing this.   That is all my amendment is asking. It simply says: As for the  authorization for use of military force--the AUMF--of 2002, if it is  voted on to be repealed, which it looks like it will be, it will go  into effect after the Director of National Intelligence certifies in an  intelligence assessment to Congress that the repeal will not degrade  the effectiveness of U.S.-led deterrence against Iranian  aggression. Who could be against that? We should have 100 U.S. Senators  wanting to know the answer to that question, especially given what just  happened over the last 96 hours, because maybe this debate is  emboldening the Iranian proxies and terrorists. Maybe it is not. So  let's get the answer.    My amendment would also make sure that it is 100 percent clear that  if the 2002 AUMF is repealed, the United States can fully retaliate  against the Iranians or any Iranian threat if they are threatening our  country or our people.   I know that most of my colleagues here agree with that. We negotiated  that language with some of my Democratic friends and Republican  friends. So it is just that and this issue of asking the DNI to certify  that what we are doing on the Senate floor right now is not going to  undermine our deterrence against Iran and, oh, by the way, put more  American lives at risk.   It is simple. I would be shocked if any Senator voted against wanting  to know the answer to that basic question.   I am asking my colleagues to just think hard. Don't you want more  information? Can't you wait 30 more days to get President Biden's DNI  to certify that what we are doing right here in the Senate is not going  to undermine deterrence and put more American lives at risk? I hope  that all of my colleagues would agree with that and vote on my  amendment.   Finally, I will just say, the deterrence that we regained with the  justified killing of Soleimani has clearly been slipping away,  particularly once the Biden administration came into office, and it is  a concern.   I was on a recent bipartisan codel to the Middle East, and the No. 1  issue we were hearing about in every single stop by every single leader  was the malign activities of Iran. You name the country we were in--and  we were in a lot of them, all the Abraham Accords countries in Israel-- Iran was the No. 1 topic and how aggressive they are getting.   The lifting of the terrorist designation for the Iranian-backed  Houthis almost in the first month of this administration, February  2021, was a sign of weakening deterrence against Iran.   The administration's inability to stand firmly with the United Arab  Emirates, one of our strongest allies in the Middle East, when it was  attacked by Houthi missiles and drones--of course, with the Iranians'  help--was something else that lessened our deterrence.  [[Page S974]]    Just last week, when the CENTCOM Commander testified, he said there  had been 78 similar attacks on American forces since 2021. We are  losing deterrence. That is during the Biden administration's 2 years.  They have been attacking the hell out of our troops. What are we doing?  What are we doing?   The mullahs in Tehran, like all tyrants, are emboldened by  accommodation. So I am asking my Senate colleagues to take the very  prudent, logical, and responsible step to ask the DNI if what we are  getting ready to do here on the Senate floor, which is to remove the  2002 AUMF, will that undermine our deterrence against Iran? Let's wait  30 days and get the answer.   Don't put your head in the sand, my colleagues. Stand up. See what  the answer is from the DNI so we can move forward in a way that makes  sense for our national security, deterrence of the world's largest  state sponsor of terrorism, and, most importantly, the ability to  protect and defend our servicemembers serving overseas in places like  Syria that are very dangerous.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
