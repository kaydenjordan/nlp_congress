 Mr. President, during Sunday's closing ceremonies at  the Pyeongchang Paralympics, the American flag was held high by a  special member of Team USA. Oksana Masters of Louisville, KY, was  elected by her teammates to represent our Nation at the ceremonies,  capping off her remarkable trip.   Born in Chernobyl with radiation poisoning, Oksana was adopted at the  age of 7 and came to the United States. She underwent a number of  medical procedures at a young age, including the amputation of both of  her legs, but that didn't stop her. Regardless of the obstacle, she  pushed through.   This year marks her fourth Paralympics. She entered Pyeongchang with  a silver and two bronze medals, but this time, this talented multisport  athlete set her sights on the gold, and I am happy to report that  Oksana, once again, achieved her goal. She ascended to the top of the  podium, not once but twice.   Kentucky is very proud of Oksana and all that she has accomplished.  She is a fine representative of our Commonwealth and our Nation.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a totally different matter, the  Senate continues to consider a bill that would strike back against the  evils of sex trafficking. The topic is all too familiar to me and many  of my colleagues who have fought against child exploitation for  decades. In recent years, as trafficking has migrated from street  corners to smartphones, reports of child sex trafficking have ticked up  dramatically.   My friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, has been  especially committed to rooting out the cause of this crisis. He has  built a broad bipartisan coalition in support of the legislation  currently before the Senate. It is designed to close a loophole in  existing law that allows websites to avoid responsibility, even as they  knowingly facilitate trafficking. It would ensure that any institutions  that are party to this reprehensible practice are subject to strict  penalties--the ones they deserve.   I urge each of my colleagues to join us in taking decisive action for  our Nation's children.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, later today the  Senate will vote on a resolution offered by the junior Senators from  Vermont and Utah. Their goal is to end U.S. support for the Saudi  Arabian-led coalition fighting the Houthi insurgency in Yemen, and they  propose to do this using provisions of the War Powers Resolution and  the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act.   I oppose their resolution for two reasons. The first reason is that  my colleagues' substantive policy aim is actually misguided. Supreme  Leader Khamenei and his regime know what  [[Page S1800]]  their goals are: Preserving their rule, expanding Iranian hegemony  across the region, and harming the United States and Israel. That is  what they want to do. That is why Iran exports violence, intimidation,  and coercion. That is why Iran expands its ballistic missile program.  That is why Iran uses proxies, such as the Houthis, Hezbollah, and  other Shia militias, along with cyber attacks and other terrorism, to  meddle in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Bahrain, and beyond.   During the Obama administration, America drew down our forward- deployed military and conventional force structure. We chased after a  flawed nuclear agreement. We reduced our commitment to our Sunni Arab  partners. Iran noticed our reticence and saw an opportunity. It  expanded its support of proxies and built strategies to exploit the  unrest following civil wars in Yemen and Syria and the rampage of ISIL  into Iraq.   If this meddling is to be confronted, if terrorist threats are to be  countered, and if arms shipments are to be curtailed, the United States  will need the help of our regional partners. One key partner is Saudi  Arabia. We have shared common interests for decades. We have worked  together to counter Iran, support the Free Syrian Army, and combat  ISIL. Today the support the United States provides to the Saudi-led  coalition, including aerial refueling over the Red Sea, contributes to  greater precision in their air campaign and actually leads to fewer  civilian casualties. So let me say that again: Withdrawing U.S. support  would increase, not decrease, the risk of civilian casualties, and it  would signal that we are not serious about containing Iran or its  proxies. The Houthi presence would continue threatening shipping lanes  in the Red Sea. Iranian missiles would continue threatening Riyadh, and  Iran would be further emboldened. That is why the goal of this  resolution is bad policy.   But my colleagues' resolution is also procedurally mistaken. The  expedited authorities they wish to draw upon are meant for removing  U.S. forces from actual participation in hostilities, but our support  for the Saudi coalition has not caused us to enter active warfare or  hostilities in Yemen.   The Department of Defense and Secretary Mattis have made clear that  U.S. forces are not engaged in exchanges of fire with hostile forces.  According to the Acting General Counsel of the Department of Defense:  ``The limited military and intelligence support that the United States  is providing to the [KSA-led] coalition does not involve any  introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities for purposes of the War  Powers Resolution or of section 1013 of the Department of State  Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985.''   I support that assessment. The refueling of aircraft over the Red Sea  does not equate to introducing U.S. forces into hostilities nor does  intelligence sharing. U.S. forces are not transporting Saudi forces  into combat within Yemen by air, land, or sea. So the expedited  procedures this resolution seeks to exploit simply do not apply here.   If Senators disagree with my assessment of the merits and oppose our  support for the coalition, they have several legislative tools  available to them. They could try to restrict funds through the  appropriations process, amend the Arms Control Export Act for the  licensing of defense services or the National Defense Authorization  Act. Instead, we face a resolution which purports to require the  President to withdraw U.S. forces from hostilities in Yemen-- hostilities which we have not entered.   In a recent speech, Secretary Mattis explained:         History proves that nations with allies thrive. . . .       Working by, with and through allies who carry their equitable       share allows us to amass the greatest possible strength.    Imagine how challenging that would become if every advise-and-assist  mission our forces undertake around the globe becomes subject to  misapplication of the War Powers Resolution.   Thus, I oppose this resolution on grounds of policy and on grounds of  procedure, and I urge our colleagues to join me this afternoon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a final matter, later this week, the  Senate will consider an omnibus spending package to address a number of  critical priorities, from rebuilding America's infrastructure to  fighting the opioid epidemic. In particular, building on the funding  agreement passed in February, the measure will deliver the resources  and certainty that America's military deserves. To be specific, this  legislation will provide the largest year-on-year increase in defense  funding in 15 years. After years of disproportionate cuts to our armed  services, Congress has begun to provide adequate resources to put an  end to the harmful decline in combat readiness, to fulfill our  commitments to American families who sacrifice through service--many of  them in my home State of Kentucky.   For our men and women in uniform, this means a well-deserved pay  raise. For our veterans back home, it means increased oversight and  modernization in the Veterans' Administration care system, thanks to a  record level of VA funding. Our warriors on the frontline deserve to be  trained to the highest standards, as do the units that replace them.  Now our commanders can work to restore combat readiness--and not a  moment too soon. Threats around the world are only growing in number  and intensity. By strengthening our investment in missile defense, by  funding new weapons systems, by scaling up shipbuilding and aircraft  procurement, and by investing in our all-volunteer servicemembers, we  will send a strong message to our allies and our foes alike that  America's military is regaining dominance.   This week, my colleagues will have the opportunity to follow through  and address the pressing needs of the defense community. I hope each of  them will join me in voting to swiftly pass the omnibus, thus giving  our Armed Forces the resources they need and deserve.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
