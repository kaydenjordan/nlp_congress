 Mr. Speaker, I rise because Americans are completely fed  up. They are fed up with being targeted. And the assertion that I just  heard that MAGA Republicans are domestic terrorists, the assertion that  this is happening throughout the country, I must tell my 90-year-old  grandmother.   Mr. Speaker, this assertion has been made time and time again that  MAGA Republicans will blow something up, that MAGA Republicans are  terrorists. Listen, we have seen censorship and meddling by former  intelligence community experts and current Federal law enforcement  agencies against Republicans and preventing media stories from actually  coming to light. This is a fact.   My friend from Texas just talked about the IRS and other agencies  that have done this. We are not standing idly by, and it is time that  the truth  [[Page H141]]  comes out. When we say things like MAGA Republicans, I think we should  all be very careful and not be disingenuous because there are plenty of  good Americans and patriots that are willing to stand up to get the  truth out.    Mr. Speaker, it is important that free speech be  upheld--protected free speech be upheld. Not libel, not slander, and  not any sort of assertion that all MAGA Republicans are bad because we  know that that is not true. In fact, there are many good Americans that  are standing up for their rights.
