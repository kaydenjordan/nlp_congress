 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise  tonight to continue to make my payments on a debt that I owe.   I am the son of the segregated South. I know what invidious  discrimination looks like. I know what it sounds like. I know what it  tastes like. I know what it smells like. Because I have suffered  invidious discrimination, I want no one else to suffer what I have  suffered.   I rise tonight to pay a debt because I didn't get here by myself, and  the people who look like me, we didn't get here by ourselves. Along the  way there were people of different stripes who made a difference, such  that we could have the opportunities that we have today.   So I am proud to say that I am an ally of the LGBTQIA caucus. I am  proud to say that I am a member of the congressional LGBTQ-plus  Equality Caucus. And I am proud to say that Mr. Cicilline is a person  who I have great respect for, a person who is making a difference not  only in the lives of people who are a member of the community, the  LGBTQIA community, but also persons across the length and breadth of  the globe, because when you help some directly, you help all  indirectly.   I thank Mr. Cicilline for this preeminent privilege to stand tonight  and to be a part of making the world a better place for others. I  desire, if I may, to continue.   I want to make the world know that the caucus that I am a member of,  the LGBTQ-plus Equality Caucus, has 170 members. The caucus was formed  in the 111th Congress. Today, we have introduced the original LGBTQIA- plus Pride Month resolution. This resolution encourages the celebration  of the month of June as LGBTQIA-plus Pride Month. It tracks the  accomplishments and the milestones and the fight for LGBTQIA-plus  equality. It has 187 cosponsors, minus the 100. It has 87 original  cosponsors.   This resolution is endorsed by the National Center for Transgender  Equality, PFLAG National, the National LGBTQ Task Force, and the  Transgender Foundation of America.   We introduced the first LGBT Pride Month resolution in 2013. This  resolution had 25 cosponsors. We have introduced a Pride Month  resolution in every Congress since 2013.   In 2020, the LGBTQ Pride Month resolution had 62 cosponsors. This  year, the resolution has 87 original cosponsors.   Now I would like to just discuss some seminal moments in Pride  history. June marks 52 years of Pride celebrations across the country.  It was in June of 1970 that the first Pride march took place in New  York City to commemorate Stonewall Inn, the site of an act of  resistance in June of 1969.   In 1977, Harvey Milk became the first openly gay elected public  official in the U.S.    In 1980, the Democratic Party became the first major American  political party to endorse a gay rights platform.   In 2000, Vermont became the first State to recognize civil unions  between same-sex partners.   In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled sodomy laws unconstitutional.   In November of 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Justice Court ruled  that preventing gays and lesbians from marrying violates the State  constitution.   In 2008, California voters passed proposition 8, a public referendum  ending same-sex marriage in the State.   In 2009, Congress passed the Matthew Shepard Act, expanding hate  crime laws to include acts motivated by a victim's actual or perceived  sexual orientation or gender identity.   Between 2009 and 2011, Vermont, Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, the  District of Columbia, and New York legitimized same-sex marriage.   In 2010, President Obama officially repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell,  allowing gays, bisexuals, and lesbians to serve openly in the military.   In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down California's proposition 8 and  the Federal Defense of Marriage Act.   On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the prohibition  against sex discrimination laid out in title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights  Act applied to LGBTQ Americans.   Houston, Texas, has a history that we are proud of. We remember the  uprising at Stonewall because it marked the beginning of a movement to  outlaw discrimination and laws that prohibited LGBTQIA persons from  having the same rights as other persons in this country. Nearly a  decade after the resistance displayed in New York at Stonewall Inn, the  gay rights movement for equality made its way to Houston, Texas.   Houston's own Stonewall movement occurred in June of 1977, when  thousands gathered around city hall in  [[Page H3000]]  downtown Houston to protest an infamous antigay activist who was  performing in Houston, Texas. According to OutSmart magazine, more than  4,000 protesters marched around the Hyatt Regency Hotel, where the  event was held.   The first Houston Pride parade took place in June of 1978, along  Westheimer Road; and more than four decades later, it has become the  fourth largest Pride parade in the country.                                time  2110    This resolution that we have presented to the House today is one that  we will continue to present. We will continue to present it because it  is not only the right thing to do, but it is the righteous thing to do.   No person in this country should be treated in such a way as to be  defined as mistreated simply because of who they are. We have a right  to be ourselves, and we should never be put in a position such that it  is perceived that being who you are is inappropriate in a country that  extolls the virtues of liberty and justice for all, that extolls the  virtue of all persons being equal and endowed by their creator with  certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness.   In this country, every person ought to be proud to celebrate Pride  Month.
