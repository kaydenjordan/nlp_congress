 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of an inspiring woman  in my community, Jessie Clemente.   Jessie will be celebrating her 103rd birthday on Thursday with her  family.   Born and raised in Utica, New York, Jessie has committed her life to  being a loving wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She  enjoys spending time with her family, especially her beloved 5-month- old great-granddaughter, who she enjoys cooking and baking with. Jessie  is also incredibly proud of her great-nephew David, who is serving our  Nation in the U.S. Army.   The Clemente family has been a pillar of the Utica community for many  generations. They own and operate Clemente Novelties, where Jessie  often helped with day-to-day tasks and supported her son, who is  currently running the family business.   I want to wish Jessie a very happy birthday and a safe and healthy  year. Her zest for life and love of her family are an inspiration to  all of us.                            ____________________
