 Madam Speaker, today, the junior  Senator from Alabama said that our military has never been weaker in  his lifetime. Of course, that statement is false. Our military has  never been stronger, not just in the history of our country but in the  history of any country.   This is just the latest example of what happens when we allow  partisan politics to infect everything. We shouldn't let this moment  pass without acknowledging how destructive it is for our country when  you can just say anything you want without any concern about whether or  not it is true.   We also should acknowledge the 2 million servicemembers who have  dedicated their lives to defending the right of that Senator to smear  them. They are owed an apology, although I assure you none is coming.                            ____________________
