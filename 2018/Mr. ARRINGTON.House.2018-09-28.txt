 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of a  remarkable man and a fellow west Texan, retired Texas Ranger Captain  Carl A. Weathers, who passed away recently.   Captain Weathers devoted his life's work to serving his country and  my home State of Texas first as a soldier in the United States Army,  and then with an over 40-year career in Texas law enforcement,  beginning as a State trooper and rising to the rank of captain in the  Texas Rangers.   Throughout their long and storied history, the Rangers have remained  the best of the best in Texas law enforcement. Captain Weathers carried  out the Texas Rangers' legacy in true west Texas fashion: with  integrity, courage, and service to his fellow man.   Along with his dedication to the Texas Rangers, Carl was a devoted  husband and family man.   To Carl's family, I join you in celebrating a life well-lived and  trusting that he has heard those beautiful and powerful words from our  glorious creator: ``Well done, good and faithful servant.''                            ____________________
