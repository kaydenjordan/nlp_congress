 Madam President, today, I wanted to rise on the Senate  floor and talk about a topic of utmost importance to my State, the  great people I have the privilege of representing, and what the Biden  administration is doing to good, hard-working American families in  Alaska. It is what I call the anti-Alaska agenda, or the Biden  administration's war on working families.   I know that Americans all across the country have felt pain--economic  pain, health pain, unfortunately, too many deaths as a result of the  pandemic. Right now, we are seeing high energy prices and empty  shelves. There has been a lot of suffering in America. We are a  resilient people, however.   My State, like many, has been hit very hard by the pandemic,  particularly economically--our energy sector, our fishing sector, our  tourism sector. And as we are coming out of this pandemic and everybody  trying to work together--we all want growth and opportunity in  America--we have now been hit with this--with this. This administration  has issued, in its first 9 months in office, 20 Executive orders for  Executive actions solely focused on Alaska.   I came down to the floor 2 weeks ago to talk about this. It was 19  then. You wait a week or 2 with the Biden administration in Alaska, and  it is up to 20. I am sure they have a lot more ready to go. Twenty-- there is no State in America that is getting this kind of attention  from the Biden administration, and we don't want it.   What I am going to be continuing to ask my Senate colleagues to do-- and I am going to start with the President of the United States, who  was a U.S. Senator for many years, decades--put yourself in the shoes  of the people I represent.   Let's imagine that a Republican administration comes into office and  issues 20 Executive orders or Executive actions focused on Delaware-- tiny, little Delaware. The Senators from Delaware, including the former  Senator, now-President, would be down on the floor of the U.S. Senate  raising Cain, raising heck--I don't think I am allowed to swear here-- because of this, because they want to stick up for the people they  represent. Imagine that.   These Executive orders and actions are not some kind of simple  abstractions; they are 20 orders and actions that go to the heart of  what Alaskans do in terms of our economy: work, keeping food on the  table, keeping lights on in their homes, paying the mortgage, keeping  their kids in college, keeping their cultures thriving, keeping our  communities from crumbling, particularly in rural Alaska. Some of the  poorest communities in America is where this administration is  targeting the people I represent.   Very few people in my State--Democrat, Republican, Native, non- Native--support this war against Alaska. This is not a partisan issue  back home, and here is why: because real people, real families, real  communities are being hurt--your fellow Americans. It has got to stop.   I have demanded a meeting with the President and his team to just  walk him through this.  [[Page S9036]]    Mr. President, do you know what you are doing to one of your States  that you are sworn to defend?   These orders threaten the well-being of my entire State, but they  particularly threaten the people who live in rural Alaska, who are  dependent on the land and natural resources for so much of their  economy, so much of their tax base.   Here is the thing, I know what some of my colleagues or those who are  watching are saying: Oh, it is just resource development issues in  Alaska.   Well, I will talk about that. It is some of that, but it is not just  resource development issues that are happening here. Let me give you  one that really burns me up.   We had a bipartisan bill last year, last Congress, to provide what  you will now call racial justice, racial equity, to Alaskan Native  Vietnam veterans who served their country when most Americans were  avoiding service and missed out, because they were overseas fighting  for their Nation, on the opportunity to apply for what is called a land  allotment. There was a deadline that happened, a complete injustice.    Native Vietnam veterans coming home, not treated well because they  are Native, not treated well because they are Vietnam veterans, and  then told: Oh, by the way, the land you were supposed to get, you don't  qualify.   So we got a bill to pass to say that is an injustice. The previous  administration signed it. They were implementing it. And when this  administration came into office, the No. 1 issue I asked Secretary  Haaland to commit to was to finish getting the Executive order out on  these land allotments to implement this bipartisan bill because these  Native Vietnam veterans aren't living that long.   The administration delayed it for 2 years. Why? It has nothing do to  with oil and gas or mining. Why? These Vietnam vets, many aren't going  to live for 2 more years. They did it anyway.   That is 1 of 20. Let me give you another one.   We have had, down in southeast Alaska, the issue of the Tongass--that  is the largest national forest in the country. Every elected official-- Governor, Senator, Democrat, Republican--in Alaska, the last 30 years,  has pressed with the roadless rule, an exemption to the roadless rule,  so we can have an economy there; roads for southeast communities. Every  elected Governor or U.S. Senator, didn't matter the party, that is how  important this was. We were able to get an exemption in the last  administration. I appreciate what President Trump did on that.   This administration comes in, and they reverse it. One of the 20.  Guess how we, the Alaska delegation, found out about that reversal. A  front-page story in the Washington Post. The Secretary of Agriculture  wanted to brief the Washington Post and all the extreme environmental  groups who wanted this before they let the people of Alaska or their  representatives know. These are the examples.   And, yes, the list also includes resource development projects. But  here is the thing on that--I have a folder full of letters. These are  letters from the elected leaders, Tribal leaders, borough leaders,  Alaska Native Corp. leaders, Native leaders in my State--dozens of  letters. Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, Native village of Kaktovik--that  is a Tribe--City of Utqiagvik, City of Atqasuk, City of Wainwright,  Inupiaq Community of the Arctic Slope--that is another Tribe--the Voice  of the Inupiat Arctic, these are all Alaskan Native leaders who live in  the North Slope, some of whom live in the Arctic National Wildlife  area. Every single one of these great leaders in my State, every one,  was writing, even begging, this administration not to do this--not to  do this. And they ignored them--they ignored them.   This is a letter from Edward Rexford. He is the President of the  Native Village of Kaktovik. He wrote to Secretary Deb Haaland after she  suspended oil and gas leases in the ANWR, which we passed. What the  Secretary did, in my view, was clearly illegal.   Edward Rexford wrote: ``You have changed our future with one stroke  of a pen without any explanation or consultation with us--the tribe  that lives within the Coastal Plain.''   His village, Kaktovik, is the only village within the coastal area of  ANWR. That is it. There is no group of Americans who should have a  greater voice in the development of this area than them. But they  didn't even get a phone call--not a phone call, not consultation,  Tribal consultation, which is required by law--none of it.   That is all part of the 20 Executive orders and actions that I said  are hurting people, hurting communities, hurting families, hurting  Native cultures.   I will tell you this: The Biden administration loves to talk about  how they are committed to environmental justice and racial equity, but  it is with a caveat.   Here is the reality: They want to help unserved minority populations  around the country. And I think this is a good goal, but it comes with  a caveat. Unless, of course, they are indigenous people of Alaska, then  the Biden administration targets them.   Look at this folder. These are communities of color in my State, and  all they do is get targeted, not helped; targeted, their economic  opportunity. And then the things that most Americans take for granted  that don't exist in these communities--clinics, flushed toilets,  gymnasiums--all of that comes with economic opportunity. And when you  shut it down, you are really hurting indigenous people in some of the  most impoverished communities in the country. But I guess they seem OK  with that.   I want all of my Senate colleagues to do just a quick thought  experiment. Imagine what it would be like, whether you are a Democrat  or a Republican--but just think about it: A Democrat and a Republican  administration comes in or you are a Republican and a Democrat  administration comes in and changes the future of your State with a  stroke of a pen, as Edward Rexford said, for the people you represent.  Imagine an administration coming in with 20 Executive orders in 8  months, shutting down your economy as you are trying to get out of a  pandemic.   Every Senator here would be mad. Every Senator here would be mad. And  the one thing I very much enjoy about serving in this body is we are a  collegial body. We have our differences, but I certainly have friends  on both sides of the aisle, try to work with everybody, try to be  respectful with everybody. The Presiding Officer and I chaired  committees together, worked together on a lot of things.   And here is the thing, if a Republican administration came into power  and targeted one of my colleague's States with 20 Executive orders in 8  months and whoever it was came to me and said: ``Hey, Dan, you know  this is unfair. My constituents are really being attacked, really being  hurt. Could you reach out to the Republican administration and say:  Hey, come on. Tone it down. Geez, Louise, 20 Executive orders in one  State,'' I would help, and I think almost every Senator here would  help. That is what we do here.   And I want to say that some of my Democratic colleagues here, when I  have talked about this, when I have told them about this, when I have  spoken about this, a number of them have come to me and said: ``Hey,  Dan, give me the list. Give me the list of 20. Maybe I can't help you  on every one of them, all of them. Maybe there are some I actually  like. But I do want to try and help.''   That is what has happened. That is what makes this body a good place.  To those Senators, I really want to thank you. And I am going to ask  for your help because I would do it for you.   And this is unacceptable. Tens of thousands of people I represent are  being hurt by the Federal Government, by the President and his White  House. So I appreciate that from my colleagues. And this is, in  general, how this body works. It makes this a special place.   But I will say this. Not all Senators have been so gracious and  senatorial and collegial. To the contrary, a few of my colleagues are  helping lead the charge in the war on Alaska's working families. They  seem to be putting a ton of effort into it themselves. I am not sure  why, but they spend a lot of their time and energy focused on doing  this: shutting down the Alaska economy, hurting working families, and  ridiculously and absurdly acting as if they speak for the very people I  am privileged to represent, as if they don't have enough to do in terms  of helping their own constituents.  [[Page S9037]]    So I am going to make an example and give an example of one. The  leader of this small group is the senior Senator from New Mexico. Here  is a sampling--three letters in the last year and a half he has  written, signed, or led, focusing on shutting down Alaska's economy and  hurting the great people I have the privilege of representing.   Two of these letters deal with the 1002 area of the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge--controversial, no doubt. In 2017, we voted to provide  the opportunity for development in that small area, what we call the  1002 area. The President signed it. It came into law.   Now, I know most of my colleagues on the Democratic side didn't agree  with that. We have legislation we don't agree with. I accept that. I am  still very good friends with so many.   But, afterward, the senior Senator from New Mexico led letters to all  the top banks in America and all the top insurance and financial  institutions in America and didn't just say don't invest in the ANWR  but said ``don't invest in any oil and gas development project in the  Arctic.''   What is that, the Arctic of America? That is my State.   So now you have, as opposed to collegiality, a small group, led by  this Senator, writing the biggest banks in America, the biggest  financial institutions in America, trying to muscle them, saying: Don't  invest anything in Alaska.   That is not what this body is all about. I would never do that to a  colleague. I would never write all the banks of America and say: Don't  invest in poor communities, Native communities in New Mexico or in the  New Mexico oil and gas industry. I wouldn't do that.   Who does that?   Well, unfortunately, a few--not many, a few--Senators are doing that.   Absurdly, this Senator had the audacity, in one of his letters, to  try to speak for the people I represent. He put in the letter: The  people dependent on the Arctic Refuge don't want you to invest there.   That is patently absurd. Just read the letters from all the people  who actually live there, all the people who live there, who  overwhelmingly want opportunities for oil and gas development and for  jobs and economic opportunity.   You would think, with all of New Mexico's problems, this Senator  would focus on his own constituents.   So I reached out to him and the few others who wrote these letters. I  have reached out. I wrote my own letter to them saying: Hey, I was  disappointed to see you do that. Why didn't you come talk to me? I  wouldn't do that to you. And, by the way, what you are doing is really  going to hurt my constituents.   This is a letter I wrote to this Senator and a few others: I would  appreciate the courtesy of talking about this before you go do it. You  clearly don't understand the indigenous communities that I represent.   I even provided a Wall Street Journal op-ed from the mayor of the  North Slope Borough, Harry Brower, the Inupiaq mayor, who had a lot to  say to the banks who weren't going to invest in his community.    But I got no response. To the contrary, just a few months ago, this  same Senator led a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, Deb  Haaland, asking her to shut down a very important energy development in  Alaska called the Willow Project. This is that letter--just about 4  months ago.   Let me talk about the Willow Project. The Willow Project is not in a  controversial area; it is in the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska,  set aside by Congress decades ago for oil and gas development. Every  Native group in Alaska supports this project, all the unions do, 2,000  direct jobs, billions in revenues for some of the poorest communities  in America, the lowest emissions of any major oil and gas development  project in America.   This is a huge win-win-win for everybody--not even controversial. Yet  the senior Senator from New Mexico wrote Deb Haaland saying: Shut down  the Willow Project in Alaska.   Why is he doing this, literally trying to kill thousands of Alaskan  jobs and impoverish Alaska Native communities?   Do the people in New Mexico know that their senior Senator spends so  much time trying to give Alaska oil and gas workers pink slips and  impoverish Native communities? I wonder. I wonder.   I thought, for just a moment, maybe I should do something against New  Mexico, but then I was like, no; you know what, that is not my style. I  wouldn't want to hurt New Mexico oil and gas workers or Native  communities. They are all great Americans, I am sure. We are a great  country. I wouldn't want to target them the way this Senator is  targeting my State, trying to hurt thousands of Alaskan working  families.   And it should be emphasized and I want to emphasize, that is not how  we work here. That is not what I have seen in my almost 7 years in the  U.S. Senate, Senators trying to attack other Senators' States,  specifically focusing on hurting working families.   The vast majority of the Senators I know wouldn't do that at all.  That is not how business is conducted here in the U.S. Senate. To the  contrary, most of us generally try to help each other. We don't always  agree; that is for sure. But particularly when States have unique  challenges that could hurt their citizens, when my colleagues would  come to me, ``Hey, Dan, can you help out on this,'' I usually try to  help. But I certainly don't go on offense and try to hurt like this  administration is doing and the senior Senator from New Mexico.   But I thought the better course to fight back--because I am going to  fight back, OK. I am going to fight back. These are my constituents who  are hurting. The better course to fight back against these attacks on  Alaskan working families was not to try to hurt New Mexicans but just  show this, the rank hypocrisy of what the senior Senator is actually  doing and saying.   One of his main reasons, in this latest letter, to shut down Alaska,  in trying to deny Federal permits for the Willow oil and gas project,  is to ``achieve climate goals.'' OK? That is in his letter to Deb  Haaland.   But if you do just a little digging, this Senator seems fine with  trying to achieve these goals on the backs of Alaskan workers and  Alaska Natives but not on his own constituents, not on the backs of his  own constituents--to the contrary.   Guess which State in America has gotten way more Federal oil and gas  drilling permits than any other State in the country--guess which one.  It is certainly not Alaska. It happens to be New Mexico. It just so  happens to be New Mexico.   Guess where the Secretary of the Interior is from. New Mexico. Hmm.  Is that a coincidence? I wonder, in their frequent phone calls, when  they talk about concerns of climate and shutting down oil and gas in  Alaska, if shutting down oil and gas in New Mexico ever comes up.   I am pretty sure it doesn't. How do I know that? Because close to  half of all oil and gas drilling permits issued by the Department of  the Interior, by New Mexican Deb Haaland, in 2021 have gone to one  State. What State is that? New Mexico--2,286 Federal oil and gas  drilling permits; almost half of all the permits in the country to one  State.   So here is the bottom line. Here is their view. Shut down Alaska,  hurt working families in Alaska, supposedly, to help America's climate  goals, but then quietly say ``drill, baby, drill'' in New Mexico, with  more permits by far than any other State in the country--almost 2,300.  If that is not rank hypocrisy, I don't know what is.   So I am going to start asking questions about this and, by the way,  so should the press. I sure hope our friends in the press think that,  hmm, there is something a little strange going on here. Clearly, there  is hypocrisy happening. But, you know, that happens here occasionally-- or maybe more than occasionally. But is there anything else going on?   And I hope the press in New Mexico ask their senior Senator why he is  so darn focused on hurting the good people of Alaska--because I  wouldn't do that to New Mexican oil and gas workers or New Mexican  Native communities.   And finally, I am going to ask questions in another area. The Biden  administration is clearly trying to shut down my State. It is there for  everybody to see. Everybody back home  [[Page S9038]]  knows it. But here is the thing. They can't do it illegally, and they  can't do it unethically. And right now there is strong evidence that  they are doing just that.   What do I mean? Today, I sent this letter that I would like to be  printed in the Record to the inspector general of the Department of the  Interior.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Hon. Mark Lee Greenblatt,      Inspector General, U.S. Department of the Interior,           Washington, DC.        Inspector General Greenblatt, I write to express my deep       concern and to request relevant materials related to several       Department of Interior (DOI) appointees that are utilizing       their government positions to work on matters directly and       substantially related to their previous clients or employers       to the benefit of these entities. These actions raise dire       conflicts of interest and questions as to these appointees'       impartiality under Executive Order 13989 and related United       States ethics laws. These individuals have made key decisions       to overturn, review, and delay resource development projects       and land management plans in Alaska that they and their       former employers or clients were actively opposing prior to       their appointments. I ask that you supply all relevant       information requested below so we may have a full       understanding of these appointees apparent and likely       conflicts of interest. I further ask that your office       consider opening an ethics investigation into the work of       these appointees.        Executive Order 13989 requires all appointees to sign a       pledge to ``not for a period of 2 years from the date of       [their] appointment participate in any particular matter       involving specific parties that is directly and substantially       related to [their] former employer or former clients,       including regulations and contracts.'' Beyond the E.O., 5 CFR       Sec. 2635.502(a)(2) requires appointees to consult with       ethics officials and receive approval prior to participating       personally and substantially in a matter where a reasonable       person with knowledge of the relevant facts would question       their impartiality. It has come to my attention that such       apparent conflicts of interest certainly exist for the       political appointees discussed below and to the best of my       knowledge none have received the requisite approval as       required by federal law and regulation.        Ms. Nada Culver currently serves as the Deputy Director of       Policy and Programs at the Bureau of Land Management. Prior       to her appointment, she worked as Vice President, Public       Lands and Senior Policy Counsel at the National Audubon       Society and served as the Senior Counsel and Senior Director       of Policy and Planning at the Wilderness Society. The Audubon       Society was engaged in petitions and lawsuits to halt five       Public Land Orders affecting Alaska signed by the Secretary       of Interior under the last administration, challenges to the       National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPR-A) 2020 Integrated       Activity Plan (IAP), Environmental Impact Statement on the       Willow Projects, challenges to the Arctic National Wildlife       Refuge oil and gas leasing program, and the Ambler Road       project. It has come to my attention that Ms. Culver has been       personally and substantially involved in decisions at the DOI       related to delaying PLOs, announcing reviews of the IAP, the       Ambler Road project, and the 1002 leasing program. Ms.       Culvers impartiality on these matters is plainly       questionable, and again her involvement on these issues       likely violates ethics laws and regulations.        Prior to her appointment, Ms. Natalie Landreth, presently       Deputy Solicitor for Lands, worked for the Native American       Rights Fund (NARF). In this position Ms. Landreth counseled       and represented NARF in comments and petitions on various       projects and management plans under consideration by DOI,       including the EIS for the oil and gas leasing program in the       1002 Area and the Willow project. In addition, she counseled       an Alaska tribal organization as they sought to prevent the       development of the Ambler Road project, which the DOJ, at       DOI's behest, moved to stay for further review of the       project, in line with petitions from this same organization.       NARF's aggressive opposition towards, and request for further       review of, a multitude of development projects now currently       being reviewed by the DOI raises serious concerns now that       their former staff attorney, Ms. Landreth, is a part of the       team conducting those very reviews. Since her appointment, it       has come to my attention that Ms. Landreth has been directly       and substantially involved in the DOI decisions concerning       these projects, advancing NARFs agenda without approval from       ethics officials.        Prior to her appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary for       Land and Mineral Management, Ms. Laura Daniel Davis worked       for the National Wildlife Federation (NWF). As Chief of       Policy and Advocacy, Ms. Davis oversaw NWF's campaign to       reverse the 1002 Area lease sale order included in the 2017       Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. NWF also pursued a strategic campaign       to invalidate the painstaking work of the DOI on the NPR-A       2020 IAP. Now, in a position of public trust, Ms. Davis has       advanced her former employers goals--recalling and reviewing       the IAP. Any reasonable person would at the very least       perceive a conflict of interest if not outright malfeasance       in Ms. Davis invalidating the finalized 2020 IAP as her       former employer has advocated for, especially in the absence       of an ethics approval.        Finally, Robert L. Anderson, formerly Principal Deputy       Solicitor for the Department of Interior, and now Solicitor       of the Department of the Interior, was previously the       director of the Native American Law Center at the University       of Washington School of Law and a staff attorney for NARF.       Mr. Anderson was instrumental in establishing the NARF       Anchorage Office that now consistently opposes and challenges       any and all resource development in Alaska. Mr. Anderson       himself has authored a number of articles detailing his       personal disdain for the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act       (ANCSA) and natural resource development. After consistently       denouncing the DOI in its handling of tribal and Alaska       Native issues, Mr. Anderson has now been appointed as the       DOI's chief advocate. The DOI has numerous responsibilities       under ANCSA and oversees resource development in much of       Alaska. Any reasonable person that has read Mr. Anderson's       works would certainly question his impartiality and ability       to effectively represent the Department he has long decried.        With such direct and substantial conflicts of interests       being ignored, the positions of their former employers and       clients are being advanced through a subversion of unbiased       analysis, constituting arbitrary and capricious actions,       fraud, waste, and abuse, and violation of federal ethics laws       and regulations. To the best of my knowledge, none of these       appointees have received a waiver from EO 13989 or 5 CFR       Sec. 2635.502(a)(2) making their violations not only       unethical but clearly illegal. When such behavior rears its       head there is a responsibility to the public to investigate       and expose every improper action taken. The American people       expect, and the law demands, impartial decision making by       those privileged to serve in the U.S. government. None of       these individuals--as relates to decisions made about       Alaska--appear to be abiding by the law.        For that reason, I am requesting the following documents       within the next 30 days:        Copies of the signed and dated ethics pledge for each of       the above listed officials;        Any and all communications and documentation concerning       ethics consultations and waivers issued to the officials       discussed above;        Any and all recusals made by the above listed officials;        All internal communications (including Microsoft Teams       chats and texts from personal cell phones) concerning the re-      opening of the NPRA IAP to, from, and amongst the above       listed officials and the White House;        Any and all communications between the above listed       officials and their former employers and clients since their       appointments (including Microsoft Teams chats and texts from       communications devices);        Any and all communications and opinions to and from the       Solicitor's Office concerning the legal sufficiency of the       NPR-A IAP and the grounds for re-opening it (including       Microsoft Teams chats and texts from communications devices);        A timeline of the conversations and decisions made at the       Department of the Interior and among its officials that led       to the review of the NPRA IAP, the 1002 leasing program,       Ambler Road project, and the delay of the five PLOs;        A detailed explanation of the purpose and need for re-      opening the NPRA IAP that pinpoints any perceived       insufficiencies;        Any and all records of tribal consultations done in       connection with the decision to re-open the NPRA IAP       (including Microsoft Teams chats and texts from       communications devices);        Public service demands an objective duty to the nation       above all else. Government officials have a duty to serve the       people and uphold the law they have been entrusted to       execute. An impartial administration of the law is essential       to safeguarding our democratic values and must never concede       to private agendas. I am deeply troubled by the disdain these       officials have demonstrated for ethics rules and the       institutional damage such disregard has caused. Moreover, I       have raised these issues directly with Secretary Haaland and       Solicitor Anderson, but have been ignored. Finally, almost       all the likely unethical decisions at issue here are focused       on shutting down responsible resource development in Alaska,       hurting working families throughout my great state. For that       reason, I will work tirelessly to bring the full extent of       these unlawful improprieties to light.    Here is what I am asking in this letter. There is very  strong evidence that at least four senior political appointees at the  Department of the Interior who have been involved in many of these 20  Executive orders and Executive actions shutting down my State were  actually, in their previous jobs, working on the very same issues and  advocating for the very same outcome--meaning they are working with a  special interest group to say shut down the Willow Project.   And then when it came to the Interior, they are working on whether or  not to shut down the Willow Project. Now, most of us know, if that is  true, that is clearly illegal and clearly unethical.   We have documented this letter--four senior Department of the  Interior officials, all of whom who are trying to  [[Page S9039]]  shut down my State--and I think there is strong evidence that they are  violating ethics laws and violating the law. So I have asked for a  detailed investigation by the Department of the Interior Inspector  General into whether or not these individuals have violated Federal  ethics laws in their quest to hurt working families in my State.   Let me conclude with this. I am a supporter of responsible resource  development in America of all of the above: energy, wind, solar, oil-- in every part of our great country, in Alaska, of course, in New  Mexico--all across our great land. And I am a supporter of the great  men and women who do this in Alaska and New Mexico and Texas and North  Dakota.   What is happening in my State right now, this is just wrong, and I am  going to fight. And any other Senator who would be going through what  my State is going through, with your constituents being harmed, you  would be down on the floor fighting, too.   The vast majority of the U.S. Senators here--Democrats and  Republicans--I think deep down in their hearts know that this is just  wrong. You don't come in with a new administration and say, Hey, let me  target one State and beat the heck out of their working families. It is  just wrong.   And I am hopeful that my colleagues here--and I am asking them  because we need the help. I have great people I represent--proud, tough  people, but I can't fight the whole damn Federal Government when they  are focused on shutting you down. So I am hopeful that my colleagues-- all of my colleagues; I will share the list of the 20--that you can  help me get the Biden administration and some misguided hypocritical  U.S. Senators to enact a cease-fire in their war on working families  and Native communities in the great State of Alaska.   I yield the floor.
