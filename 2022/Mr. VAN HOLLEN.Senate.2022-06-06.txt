 Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 100th  birthday of my constituent the Reverend Doctor Phillip Webster Davis,  Sr. It is my pleasure to celebrate him on this special occasion and to  share the details of his extraordinary life, his dedication to our  community, and his service to our country.   The Rev. Dr. Davis grew up in a household guided by family and faith.  He was born the seventh of eight sons--and even at an early age, he  quickly learned the values of brotherhood, community, loyalty, and  love. His father, Reverend James William Davis, pastored at Mt. Calvary  Baptist Church in Rockville, and together with his wife Mary, the older  Reverend Davis instilled in his children many core teachings of the  scriptures, among them: love thy neighbor, pursue a life of service,  and strive to achieve your inner potential.   The Rev. Dr. Davis marshalled the wisdom of those core teachings to  steer the course of his extraordinary life and career. The arc of his  career began in the Armed Services. In 1944, the Rev. Dr. Davis was  drafted into the U.S. Army and served in the New Guinea and Philippines  region during World War II. In a moment of crisis, he was called by his  country to fight back against the forces of fascism and totalitarianism  that had pulled the world into war--and he answered that call with  action. The State of Maryland is deeply proud of the Rev. Dr. Davis'  service to our country, and our entire Nation is grateful for his  commitment to defending freedom everywhere.   After he was honorably discharged from the Army, the Rev. Dr. Davis  entered the private sector and owned several businesses over the years,  including a restaurant, a barber shop, a charter bus service, and an  automotive body shop.   The Rev. Dr. Davis has been many things: a protector of freedom  overseas, a community leader at home, an entrepreneur, and a business  owner. But today, the Rev. Dr. Davis is most well-known throughout  Marylander as the founder and former senior pastor of the Inter- Denominational Church of God. In building that community from the  ground up, the Rev. Dr. Davis set out to grow a congregation that would  accept all people, regardless of background and culture. His vision has  been realized through the many dedicated parishioners of the Inter- Denominational Church of God, who continue working together to create  an inclusive community of worship. After 38 years of exceptional  service, the Rev. Dr. Davis stepped down as senior pastor during the  week of his 90th birthday. Now, his legacy lives on under new  leadership that will sustain and build on the Rev. Dr. Davis' vision  for years to come.   As a result of the Rev. Dr. Davis's work in the ministry and  community, he has received numerous recognitions and honors. But  despite these achievements, the Rev. Dr. Davis has always stayed humble  and remained true to those guiding principles of family and faith that  he first learned a young boy growing up in Rockville. To the Rev. Dr.  Davis, the greatest recognition he could ever receive is in knowing he  is the best husband and the best father to five children, six  grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.   The Rockville community, the Maryland community, and our country are  indebted to Rev. Dr. Davis for his faithful service. On his 100th  birthday, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this  extraordinary milestone and sending our deepest gratitude to the Rev.  Dr. Phillip Webster Davis, Sr., for all he has done.                            ____________________
