 Mr. President, I would like to engage my friend the  chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, in a colloquy.   One of the many vital investments made in the Inflation Reduction Act  to reduce energy costs and confront the climate crisis is the qualified  commercial clean vehicle credit. This provides a tax credit of up to  $40,000 for qualified heavy commercial electric vehicles, or up to  $7,500 for qualified commercial electric vehicles weighing less than  14,000 pounds, which includes both trucks and mobile machinery.   Mobile machinery is a vehicle that is unrelated to transportation,  such as a forklift or bulldozer. The qualified commercial clean vehicle  credit utilizes an existing statutory definition of mobile machinery,  the purpose of which is to provide for an exemption from the excise tax  on heavy trucks that is deposited into the highway trust fund.   The new application of the mobile machinery definition will raise  novel questions about which types of vehicles qualify as mobile  machinery, in cases where the determination was not necessary in the  context of the excise tax on heavy trucks. One such case is commercial  lawn mowers, most of which currently have gas-powered engines that are  a significant source of pollution.   I ask the chairman of the Finance Committee whether commercial lawn  mowers can fit the criteria of mobile machinery and, therefore, qualify  for the qualified commercial clean vehicle credit, provided that the  vehicle meets the other criteria for the credit.    I thank the Senator for clarifying this point, and I  share that understanding.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the  amendment from the Senator of Utah. This would take out one of the  provisions in the bill which will directly help homeowners save money  on their heating bills and on their cooling bills. It does so by giving  them a rebate for home energy efficiency improvements, and then they  will save for the rest of their lives in their home.   I also find it a little ironic this would put money in local  governments, which our Republican colleagues said have received too  much money under the American Rescue Plan, and you have been trying to  claw that back.   I would urge my colleagues to stick with the provision in the bill.  It is an important part of the bill that both provides consumers with  savings and to address the climate crisis.   I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5316
