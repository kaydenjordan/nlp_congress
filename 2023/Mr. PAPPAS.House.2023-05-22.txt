 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Takano for yielding  the time and Chairman Bost, as well, for his support of this  legislation. It was an honor to be able to work with subcommittee Chair  Luttrell on this important issue, S. 777, the Veterans' COLA Act of  2023.    We all know we have a sacred and solemn obligation to make sure that  the needs of our veterans are met. My home State of New Hampshire is  home to over 100,000 veterans from all branches, with service dating  from the Second World War to today. Some of those veterans returned  home with service-connected disabilities and required extra care and  support.   As we all continue to feel the impact of inflation and higher costs,  those pressures can be particularly challenging for our veteran  community.   Our veterans swear to give everything, up to and including their  lives, in service to our country. They shouldn't have to worry if they  can afford groceries this week or pay their electric bill the next  week.   Their VA benefits should keep pace with economic trends, and their  financial and overall well-being should never be left to hang in the  balance.   This legislation would increase the rates of VA benefits equal to the  cost-of-living increase provided for Social Security benefits for  veterans with service-connected disabilities, as well as the rates of  dependency and indemnity compensation for their survivors and families.   This will help ensure that veterans with service-connected  disabilities and families and loved ones of veterans who have been lost  can rest assured that their benefits will support them even as our  economy changes.   We owe our veterans and their families a tremendous debt of  gratitude, and the legislation we propose today is another way that we  can all work to honor their sacrifice and work to pay down that debt  that we all bear.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of this bipartisan bill so we can  send it to the President's desk for his signature.
