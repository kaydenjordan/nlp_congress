 Madam Speaker, February is National Children's Dental  Health Month. This month is a time when healthcare professionals,  providers, and educators help promote good oral health practices to  children, families, and many others.   Tooth decay is still the number one chronic infectious disease among  children in the United States.   Throughout my career as a dentist, I can attest to the benefits of  proper oral health and how important it is to focus on children from a  very young age. Preventive measures like brushing, flossing, and  rinsing correctly are important life lessons that should be learned  from a young age.   I would also like to recognize the American Dental Association for  their strenuous work in this area. They have implemented the Give Kids  A Smile program. It provides hundreds of thousands of underserved kids  with free oral health education, screenings, and preventive and/or  restorative services throughout the entire year.   It is a very much needed program, and I am personally very proud of  the American Dental Association for the work that they do in this area.                            ____________________
