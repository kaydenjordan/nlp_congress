 Mr. Speaker, I rise in sympathy with the  people of Ghana at the passing of former President Jerry Rawlings. I  offer my sincerest condolences and prayers to his family, friends, and  loved ones.   Personally, I have known President Rawlings and his beautiful family  since around 1994. I most recently visited President Rawlings and his  family last year when Speaker Pelosi and Chairwoman Bass led a  Congressional delegation to Ghana commemorating 400 years since the  brutal institution of slavery began in America. It was such a wonderful  meeting and visit. He reaffirmed his commitment to strengthen the ties  between Ghanaians, the country of Ghana, African Americans, and the  United States.   President Rawlings' leadership contributed to steady development, a  transition to democracy and peaceful transfer of power.   Today, Ghana is one of the strongest democracies in Africa, a strong  partner of the United States, and a respected actor on the world's  stage.   My deepest sympathy and love goes out to Mrs. Rawlings, the entire  Rawlings family, to the citizens of Ghana, and the entire continent of  my motherland of Africa. We stand in solidarity as the people of Ghana  continue building a stronger and more inclusive and prosperous country.  May President Rawlings' soul rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of our Special  Order tonight.    Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the chair of our  Congressional Black Caucus. I thank Chairwoman Bass, who has helped us  organize this tonight, for her leadership of the Congressional Black  Caucus.   I join with my colleagues to speak on the impact of COVID-19, the  pandemic which has had an especially disparate impact on communities of  color.   First, again, let me thank Chairwoman Bass, Chairwoman Chu, and  Congressman Castro of the Tri-Caucus, as well as Representatives Kelly,  Haaland, and Davids, for working together to ensure that we address the  disproportionate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities of  color--also, Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia.   It is really very imperative that our strategy to crush COVID  intentionally includes provisions to support the specific needs of our  communities.   I also want to take a moment to thank Speaker Pelosi and Chairman  Pallone for negotiating some of the provisions of our COVID Community  Care Act, that is H.R. 8192, in our Heroes bill, which further  strengthens efforts to engage medically underserved communities in the  latest version, again, of the Heroes bill.   I thank Chairman Scott and, of course, our subcommittee chair, Rosa  DeLauro, for their support, their input, and their assistance in  getting this bill, the COVID Community Care Act, really very targeted,  very focused, and something that all of us could support as a Tri- Caucus, also--and, of course, Speaker Pelosi, again, for her steadfast  understanding and support for this issue.   Now, millions of people have suffered incomprehensible grief and  hardship due to the COVID pandemic. Just in the United States, we now  have over 10.3 million cases of COVID-19 and over 240,000 deaths. That  is mind-boggling.   We are here today to insist that any coronavirus response addresses  the needs of people of color. This is because the impacts of the  pandemic and the economic fallout have had a disproportionate impact on  African Americans, Latinx, Indigenous, Asian Pacific Islander, and  immigrant communities. We have witnessed the horrific result of how  longstanding inequities stemming from structural racism has exacerbated  COVID's threats to people of color.   Black people are dying at more than twice the rate of White people in  the United States. Indigenous and Latinx people are both 50 percent  more likely to die from COVID than White Americans. Between January and  July, the AAPI death rate rose 35 percent compared to an increase of 9  percent for White Americans.   The Federal Government must address the vicious cycle of disparities  that drive these unequal impacts on communities of color, especially  during the COVID-19 crisis. That is why we introduced, together, H.R.  8192, the COVID Community Care Act, legislation to ensure that any  effort to fight the pandemic engages local communities as partners in  crushing the virus.   This bill, supported by our Tri-Caucus colleagues, ensures that any  testing and tracing efforts engage communities of color where they live  with trusted messengers who speak their language and know their unique  challenges.   Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Pallone worked with us to add language to  Chairman Pallone's $75 billion CONTACT plan. This is included in the  revised version of the Heroes Act passed October 1, which will further  strengthen efforts to engage communities of color.   The strengthened CONTACT plan mandates that community-based  organizations and nonprofits in medically underserved communities play  an important role to reach those communities that public health  agencies have difficulty engaging. It ensures the people hired to  conduct the outreach have experience and relationships with people  living in the communities that they serve.   Turning a blind eye to the American people's desperate need for  culturally rooted contact tracing and testing will result in increased  deaths and illnesses that we could have prevented.   We must build a relief package that addresses the needs of millions,  especially Black and Brown people, who are suffering disproportionately  from this virus.   Mr. Speaker, we thank our Speaker for her persistence, leadership,  and fighting spirit to ensure that lawmakers acknowledge and respond to  the racial and ethnic disparities that have plagued our Nation for  centuries.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia), who  played an important role in making sure that the Latinx community and  all the Hispanic issues, as it relates to COVID, were included as a  part of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Garcia very  much for her input in helping to write the COVID Community Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro), my good friend, the chair of the Subcommittee on Labor,  Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies of the House  Appropriations Committee.    Thank you, Chairwoman DeLauro, for your  statement and for reminding us that we have to address the health and  economic impacts at the same time. One does not supersede the other.  Thank you for helping us move our COVID Community Care Act forward with  your leadership on the subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy  Chu), the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus,  someone who contributed to crafting our COVID Community Care Act but  also whom I have had the pleasure to serve with as co-chair of the  Healthcare Task Force for CAPAC, a true leader on so many issues.    Thank you very much, Chairwoman Chu, and thank  you for being with us tonight, but also for your consistently sounding  the alarm to all of us about the necessity for culturally and  linguistically appropriate services, testing, contact tracing, as well  as the importance of disaggregating the data based on race and  ethnicity. Thank you for input into helping to write this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly),  who is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus' Health Braintrust,  someone who is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and  also a member of the Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on National  Security and Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.    Congresswoman Robin Kelly has helped put together this bill and  helped make sure that we put provisions in for data collection and all  of the information that we know we need to be able to target these  resources.   So thank you, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, for being here tonight and  for helping us.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kelly for  laying out actually what the social determinants of healthcare are.  Oftentimes, we see that as separate from healthcare, but you laid it  out perfectly, so thank you for educating us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, but also is a member of the  Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Native American  Caucus. I know Congresswoman Jackson Lee's district in Texas is ravaged  by this COVID pandemic, so I want to thank her for helping us with our  COVID Community Care Act and for being here tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Texas for using this opportunity to deliver a very powerful public  health message also. I also would just note a personal privilege. I was  born and raised in El Paso, Texas, and my heart goes out to all of  those who are suffering from this terrible deadly pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I want to salute our colleague, Congresswoman Veronica  Escobar, for being such a tremendous leader in El Paso in trying to  help on the ground with taking care of people and preventing the  transition of the virus.   I thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee again.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams), a member of the Committee on Education and Labor, whose mission  in life, I think, is to make sure that our young people are educated  and receive the best quality education through the Historically Black  Colleges and Universities, and at the same time make sure that their  health and safety is a top priority issue for their health and their  safety.                                time  2100     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Alma Adams  for that very clear statement and I thank her for outlining the  interconnection and the intersection between systemic racism and the  social determinants of healthcare and how they impact the underlying  conditions and exacerbate it now as seen in COVID-19. I thank  Congresswoman Adams again for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon), who certainly knows the serious and devastating impact of  this COVID pandemic in her district. I visited her district and  understand how close she is to her nonprofits and her community-based  organizations who are doing phenomenal work.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Scanlon very much for being here.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Scanlon for  joining us tonight with our Tri-Caucus and Congressional Black Caucus,  because so many of the issues that you are talking about in your  district as it relates to COVID and health disparities and the social  determinants we all are dealing with in our districts, and so thank you  for your leadership and for continuing to help us get this Heroes Act  passed so that we can do some of the things that you laid out that our  communities deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following statements from  the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National  Indian Health Board, the Asian Health Services, and UnidosUS.    Statement for the Record: Leadership Conference on Civil and Human                                   Rights         On behalf of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human       Rights, I submit this testimony for the record.        No matter what we look like, where we live, or what is in       our wallets, getting sick reminds us that at our core we are       all the same. But we cannot ignore the pandemic's       disproportionate and devastating impact on Black and Brown       people, Native Americans, low-income people, people with       disabilities, the elderly, women, and immigrant communities.       Through health and education disparities, income inequality,       discrimination in voting and housing, unequal treatment       within the legal system, and the digital divide, communities       of color have been routinely locked out and left behind--and       sadly, as we have seen in increased hate violence and in far       worse health outcomes for people of color, this pandemic is       no different.        This pandemic calls for the enactment of policies and       sufficient funding to protect low- and moderate-income people       from economic disaster and to meet the urgent needs of the       most vulnerable people in our nation. Communities that have       already been marginalized by structural barriers to equal       opportunities and who have low levels of wealth are       particularly vulnerable during this current emergency. While       many working people have been sidelined, many others are       still providing essential services during the crisis--working       at our grocery stores, delivering mail and packages, and       providing care to vulnerable people--putting their lives at       risk, often at reduced hours and wages, to keep our country       running. The ongoing crisis has laid bare the structural       racism and barriers to opportunity that are entrenched in our       society, and our collective actions now must not worsen them.           Statement for the Record: National Indian Health Board         On behalf of the National Indian Health Board (NIHB) and       the 574 sovereign Tribal Nations we serve, I submit this       testimony for the record.        American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) Tribal       communities have been disproportionately impacted by the       COVID-19 pandemic. No sector of Tribal economies or health       systems have been spared from the devastation this crisis has       unleashed. We are now, as of this writing, seven months in       the throes of an unparalleled pandemic. While we may not have       been able to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19, we absolutely       could have mitigated the worst of its impacts--especially in       Indian Country. But unfortunately, our Tribes are, once       again, battling a catastrophic, unprecedented, once-in-a-      lifetime disease without the necessary federal relief funds       and resources to protect and preserve life.        Since June of this year alone, NIHB has submitted seventeen       letters to Congress urging immediate action and passage of       emergency stimulus funds for the Indian health system to       better respond to COVID-19. We solemnly await congressional       action. We have consistently urged long-term reauthorization       of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI), vital to       Tribal efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by       preventing, treating, and managing one of the strongest risk       factors for a more serious COVID-19 illness: type II       diabetes. We solemnly await congressional action. We have       demanded that Congress work to fulfill Treaty obligations to       Tribal Nations and Native people by ensuring congressional       COVID-19 relief funds are on par with the recommendations       outlined by Tribal leaders and health experts. We solemnly       await congressional action. We have urged that burdensome       administrative requirements for accessing federal grants and       programs be eliminated to ensure expeditious delivery of       relief resources. We solemnly await congressional action. We       have urged that Congress not subject the Indian health system       to a destabilizing continuing resolution (CR) as it continues       to combat against an unparalleled pandemic; or to, at the       least, attach emergency COVID-19 appropriations for IHS to       the CR to mitigate the pain and disruption. Again, we       solemnly await congressional action.        To be clear, we continue to appreciate the commitment and       leadership of members of Congress in working to advance       Tribal health priorities in response to COVID-19. But the       Tribes require action from all of Congress on those       commitments. On September 10, NIHB was joined by the National  [[Page H5758]]       Congress of American Indians and the National Council of       Urban Indian Health in a letter to congressional leadership       urging immediate action on the priorities listed below. These       priorities have remained intact since early summer, as Indian       Country continues to bear the brunt of this extraordinary       crisis. In short, these priorities have not changed because       the situation in Indian Country remains just as dire. Once       again, we solemnly await congressional action.                          Tribal COVID-19 Priorities         Minimum $2 billion in emergency funds to IHS for immediate       distribution to I/T/U system.        $1.7 billion to replenish lost 3rd party reimbursements       across the I/T/U system.        Prioritize equitable distribution of a safe and effective       COVID-19 vaccine across Indian Country, including a minimum 5       percent set-aside in vaccine funds for the I/T/U system.        Minimum $1 billion for water and sanitation systems across       IHS and Tribal communities.        Long-term reauthorization (5 years), higher funding, and       expansion of self-determination and self-governance for the       Special Diabetes Program for Indians.                               COVID-19 Updates         The last time NIHB appeared before this Subcommittee was       June 10, 2020. Since that time, the number of AI/AN COVID-19       case infections reported by IHS have nearly quadrupled.       Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       (CDC) reported a roughly 22 percent increase in COVID-19       hospitalization rates among AI/ANs--increasing from a rate of       272 per 100,000 in mid-July to 347.7 per 100,000 as of       September 12, 2020. Rates of death from COVID-19 among AI/ANs       have more than doubled since the last time NIHB testified       before the Subcommittee--from a rate of 36 per 100,000 on       June 9 to 81.9 per 100,000 as of September 15.        In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       (CDC) reported that across 23 states, cumulative incidence       rates of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases among AI/ANs are 3.5       times higher than for non-Hispanic Whites. Also, according to       CDC, age-adjusted rates of COVID-19 hospitalization among AI/      ANs from March 1, 2020, through August 22, 2020, were 4.7       times higher than for non-Hispanic Whites. Without sufficient       additional congressional relief sent directly to I/T/U       systems, these shocking upward trends will more than likely       continue as COVID-19 restrictions are eased, schools and       businesses reopen, and the potential threat of a more severe       flu season coincides with this pandemic. State-specific data       further demonstrate the vast inequities in COVID-19 deaths       between AI/ANs and the general population. Below are a few       examples of these state-specific disparities based on NIHB's       analysis of state-specific data.        In Arizona, AI/ANs account for 5.5 percent of the       population, but 13.4 percent of COVID-19 deaths.        In New Mexico, AI/ANs account for 10.7 percent of the       population, but nearly 57 percent of COVID-19 deaths.        In Montana, AI/ANs account for 8.2 percent of the       population, but 27 percent of COVID-19 deaths.        In South Dakota, AI/ANs account for 10.4 percent of the       population, but nearly 23 percent of COVID-19 deaths.        In North Dakota, AI/ANs account for 6.5 percent of the       population, but 13.3 percent of COVID-19 deaths.        In Mississippi, AI/ANs account for less than 1 percent of       the population, but 3 percent of COVID-19 deaths.        Even more alarming is the lack of complete data on COVID-19       outcomes among AI/ANs. Available COVID-19 data already       highlight significant disparities between AI/ANs and the       general population; shockingly, true estimates of disease       burden and death resulting from COVID-19 in Indian Country       are likely much higher. In CDC's own August 2020 report on       COVID-19 in Indian Country, the authors noted the following:        This analysis represents an underestimate of the actual       COVID-19 incidence among AI/AN persons for several reasons.       Reporting of detailed case data to CDC by states is known to       be incomplete; therefore, this analysis was restricted to 23       states with more complete reporting of race and ethnicity. As       a result, the analysis included only one half of reported       laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among AI/AN persons       nationwide, and the examined states represent approximately       one third of the national AI/AN population. In addition, AI/      AN persons are commonly misclassified as non-AI/AN races and       ethnicities in epidemiologic and administrative data sets,       leading to an underestimation of AI/AN morbidity and       mortality.        Indeed, there are multiple states that still have a       significant percentage of COVID-19 cases missing critical       demographic data. In California for instance, a whopping 31       percent of cases are still missing race and ethnicity. The       State of New York has failed to report AI/AN data       altogether--listing only Hispanic, Black, White, Asian, or       Other on their COVID-19 data dashboards.        Meanwhile, the Special Diabetes Program for Indians       (SDPI)--instrumental for COVID-19 response efforts in Indian       Country because it is focused on prevention, treatment, and       management of diabetes, one of the most significant risk       factors for a more serious COVID-19 illness--has endured four       short-term extensions since last September, placing immense       and undue strain on program operations. Under the House-      passed CR for FY 2021 H.R. 8337, SDPI is extended for a mere       eleven days--its shortest reauthorization on record. A       national survey of SDPI grantees conducted by NIHB found that       nearly 1 in 5 Tribal SDPI grantees reported employee       furloughs, including for healthcare providers, with 81       percent of SDPI furloughs directly linked to the economic       impacts of COVID-19 in Tribal communities. Roughly 1 in 4       programs have reported delaying essential purchases of       medical equipment to treat and monitor diabetes due to       funding uncertainty, and nearly half of all programs are       experiencing or anticipating cutbacks in the availability of       diabetes program services--all under the backdrop of a       pandemic that continues to overwhelm the Indian health       system.        Now, with the inevitability of a continuing resolution (CR)       through at least December 11, 2020--and the possibility of       another CR thereafter--it is even more imperative that       Congress provide emergency appropriations to better stabilize       the Indian health system. This Subcommittee knows full well       that IHS is the only federal healthcare system that is       subject to government shutdowns and CRs. This Subcommittee is       also acutely aware of the devastating impacts that endless       CRs have had, and will continue to have, on the Indian health       system. We commend Chair McCollum's leadership in introducing       H.R. 1128 and Ranking Member Joyce's strong support for H.R.       1135--both of which would authorize advance appropriations       for IHS and permanently insulate it from the volatility of       the annual appropriations process. But in the interim,       Congress must ensure a funding fix that protects and       preserves life in Indian Country and delivers critical       pandemic relief in recognition of federal Treaty obligations.       If Congress fails to provide sufficient emergency       appropriations for the Indian health system, a stopgap       measure will force a healthcare system serving roughly 2.6       million AI/ANs to operate during a pandemic without an       enacted budget or even adjustments for rising medical and       non-medical inflation. In short, that is a recipe for even       more disaster, death, and despair.        We patiently remind you that federal Treaty obligations for       healthcare to Tribal Nations and AI/AN Peoples exist in       perpetuity and must be fully honored, especially in light of       the current pandemic and its unparalleled toll in Indian       Country. While we appreciate the roughly $1 billion to IHS       under the CARES Act and the $750 million testing set-aside       under the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care       Enhancement Act; these investments have been necessary but       woefully insufficient to stem the tide of the pandemic in       Tribal communities.        We thank you for your continued commitment to Indian       Country, and as always, stand ready to work with you in a       bipartisan fashion to advance the health of all AI/AN people.            Sincerely,                                       National Indian Health Board.              Statement for the Record: Asian Health Services         On behalf of the One Nation Commission, Co-Chairs Sherry       Hirota, CEO of Asian Health Services, and former Congressman       Mike Honda, I submit this testimony for the record.        The information shared, is documented in the One Nation       Commission 2020 Report: One Nation AAPIs Rising to Fight Dual       Pandemics COVID-19 and Racism, which was delivered to every       member of Congress and the Senate in October 2020.        The COVID-19 pandemic has hit communities of color,       including AAPIs, the hardest. In the 13th Congressional       District, Alameda County in California, AAPIs are the largest       population subgroup, comprising a diverse and varied       population, spanning every economic stratum; essential       workers and corporate CEOs, Nobel Laureates and students on       the broken side of the digital divide, researchers and       doctors, janitors and food servers, and new immigrants all       contributing to society in this time of crisis.        By the time COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic and       national emergency, the Asian American and Pacific Islander       (AAPI) Community had already gone underground. Fear of the       virus was compounded by a sudden and virulent rise in hate       and violence against Asians. Racist taunting by our country's       top leader calling Covid-19 ``Kung Flu,'' and ``China       Virus,'' used the pandemic and its economic destruction to       scapegoat Asian Americans across the country. Congresswoman       Lee's own staffer was called, ``COVID'' and pelted with rocks       while riding his bike through Rock Creek Park in D.C. Despite       calls from every sector of the AAPI Community for the       president to retract his dangerous words, the hate speak       continued. The result was a tsunami of attacks on Asian       Americans.        As COVID-19 cases spiked around the country, AAPIs were not       only blamed but appeared missing from the news coverage,       data, and charts. The twenty-five-year-old health advocacy       battle to ``disaggregate data'' reared its ugly head again       and was now a matter of life and death. Lumping together       information about ethnic and language groups obstructs       effective epidemiology and care. In the big picture, the       absence of data ensures invisibility for AAPIs as a whole,       and each subpopulation within that designation. Missing are       the number of AAPIs who have been tested, how many tested       positive, how many are sick, or hospitalized, or have died.       We must expand the frame--to ask, what is the impact of       COVID-19 on AAPI communities? To fill the gap a self-      organized  [[Page H5759]]       work group of nationally renowned AAPI researchers pulled       data from multiple cities and states revealing higher death       rates among Asian Americans who were Covid positive.        Nine months into the dual pandemic of COVID-19 and racism,       the AAPI community is fighting back against being both blamed       and ignored. The One Nation Commission is honored to join       forces with Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Congresswoman Karen       Bass, and the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Asian       Pacific Islander American Caucus, and individuals and       organizations to defeat COVID-19, bring back our communities       stronger and healthier, combat hate crimes against AAPIs, and       work in solidarity with the Black, Latinx and Indigenous       People to fight systemic racism.        Hidden disparities undermine effective and just health       policy and outcomes. COVID vaccine allocation, for example,       based prioritization in part on inaccurate information of       disparities and vulnerabilities. Recently the National       Academy of Sciences released recommendations on vaccine       allocation but did not name Asian Americans as a vulnerable       group. This must be immediately rectified.        Critical to health, justice, equity, and the opportunity       for our communities to emerge stronger than before from these       dual pandemics:        (1) Mandate disaggregated data collection and reporting;        (2) Require linguistically and culturally competent       outreach and care;        (3) Strengthen and resource the community health center and       nonprofit safety net; and        (4) Reverse unfair and un-American anti-immigrant policies       that endanger the public health and public good, including       Public Charge.        Immediate next steps:        (1) Protecting and further investing in trusted community-      based organizations to implement new programs and preserve       proven programs,        COVID community testing,        COVID contact tracing,        Cultural and linguistic competency,        Addressing misinformation that creates fear and chilling       effects (e.g., public charge rule change).        (2) Expanding beyond COVID-19 outcomes (cases and deaths)       to understand full impacts        Anti-Asian hate crimes a physical and mental health,        Mental health,        Immigration status affecting access and utilization of       services (e.g., public charge rule change),        Other social determinants of health (occupation/essential       workers, living conditions, language barriers).        (3) Data disaggregation is paramount to identifying and       addressing hidden disparities. Encourage immediate       disaggregated data collection at the local levels--testing,       cases, comorbidities, deaths,        Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good: Reinforce       disaggregated data reporting in public communications to       create this paradigm shift, even with small numbers,        An example of hidden disparities: Filipinos having even       more striking death rates. In the U.S., Filipino nurses make       up 4 percent of workforce but nearly 31.5 percent of deaths       among registered nurses.                     Statement for the Record: UnidosUS         On behalf of UnidosUS, I submit this testimony for the       record.        Communities of color are putting life and limb on the line       every day to help our nation through the COVID-19 crisis yet       continue to be overwhelmingly and disproportionately impacted       by the dire health and economic repercussions of this       pandemic.        These unprecedented and devastating times continue to       expose the appalling and deeply unjust fault lines in our       nation's health care system and labor force. Despite the fact       that Latinos are overrepresented in ``essential'' occupations       where they are most at risk of exposure to the coronavirus       infection and are also bearing the brunt of the economic       fallout from the pandemic, they have been consistently       excluded from much needed COVID-19 relief legislation.        Any further delay in COVID-19 relief legislation will be       particularly devastating to the health and well-being of our       nation's 58 million Latinos, far too many of whom have been       left out of the four coronavirus relief packages enacted so       far. Failure to respond urgently to the human suffering we       are witnessing is deeply objectionable and, from a public       health and economic perspective, wholly indefensible.        Latinos have long suffered from health disparities--being       more likely to develop chronic health conditions such as       diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Another disparity is       emerging, Latinos are contracting and dying from COVID-19       disproportionately and are nearly three times more likely to       die compared to non-Hispanic Whites.        These disparities are a result of multiple preexisting       structural and societal factors, including a health care       system that leaves coverage out of reach of millions of       Latinos. Before the pandemic, more than 10 million Latinos       (including 1.6 million Latino children) were uninsured, and       preliminary data now show that the Latino uninsured rate       increased over the course of 2020. Latinos have also long       struggled with food insecurity and increased stressors and       mental health issues, and the pandemic has only exacerbated       these challenges.    Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment to thank all  of our colleagues who joined us this evening laying out the pandemic  upon pandemic upon pandemic in communities of color.   In all past public health crises one recurring lesson stands out:  That is, success depends on the willingness of people to trust the  health information that they are getting. We learned this from the HIV  and AIDS pandemic, Ebola, H1N1, and now we are learning it again during  COVID. So this is especially true for communities of color.   This year millions of Americans have taken to the streets to demand  racial justice. This is because the system that exists today has failed  them. We must acknowledge the centuries old racial and ethnic  disparities, and intentionally build culturally and community-minded  policies to move forward for a stronger and unified country.   We must act swiftly. The longer communities suffer from COVID-19, the  greater the long-term impact and disparities. States project that their  shortfall for 2021-fiscal year will be much deeper than the shortfalls  faced in any year of the Great Recession.   Federal Reserve economists project that unemployment will be at 6.5  percent at the end of 2021. Of course, it is higher in communities of  color. The Congressional Budget Office projects an even higher rate at  6.7 percent; again, for communities of color more than likely it is  double that.   Our Nation's workforce is disproportionately composed of communities  of color and some of the most marginalized communities and groups. Many  are essential workers. These workers and their families are being put  at greater risk during the coronavirus pandemic due to the conditions  of their jobs and their socioeconomic realities and, mind you, the lack  of Federal response. We must pass a COVID relief bill.   I am proud to stand before you joined by my colleagues because I know  that this change is on the horizon. From the sidewalks to the ballot  boxes, people are fully engaged and are courageously advocating to be  heard. It is our job that every community is ensured coronavirus relief  and that we negotiate what is needed, including funding to provide  relief for every community and with community stakeholders.   Our bill, H.R. 8192, the COVID Community Care Act, does just that. We  cannot afford to leave anyone behind.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank our Speaker; Chairwoman Bass, for  sharing this CBC Special Order hour; and I thank our Tri-Caucus chairs,  Congresswoman Chu and Representative Castro, Representatives Haaland,  Davids, of course, Representative Garcia. And I thank all of our  colleagues for being here tonight to really sound the alarm.   This is an emergency in the entire country. It is a deep and broad  emergency pandemic as it relates to COVID-19, and we need relief right  away.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
