 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's budget landed with a thud  on the backs of working Americans this week.   Its message is quite simple: this administration will reward wealth  with one hand and target working families with another.   To this President, avoiding the estate tax for wealthy heirs is an  entitlement, but the healthcare of everyday Americans is expendable.   To this President, carried interest on passive income is a worthy tax  benefit for executives, while a livable minimum wage for a working  parent is a burden we cannot afford.   To this President, a lengthy record of felony convictions won't deny  your tax credit for a private jet, but a conviction for misdemeanor  drug possession could cost you the roof over your head.   A budget that puts Americans first doesn't deem millions of Americans  unworthy.   A budget that puts Americans first doesn't starve them of housing, of  healthcare, and of food because their President counts stock market  gains as more important than our common humanity.   But putting Americans first has never been the fundamental policy of  this administration. It has always been to draw a bright line between  the wealthy and the striving.   I stand to reject this budget.                            ____________________
