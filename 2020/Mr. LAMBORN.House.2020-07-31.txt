 Mr. Speaker, in March 2016, Taylor Force, a U.S. Army  veteran, was brutally murdered by a Palestinian terrorist while  visiting Israel. The terrorist's family now receives monthly rewards  from the so-called Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund. Palestinian  leadership has spent over $350 million rewarding tens of thousands of  terrorists with pay-for-slay payments.   My bill, the Taylor Force Act, signed into law by President Trump in  2018, targeted these payments, but we have documented evidence that  they continue today.   The U.S. must sanction Palestinian officials, like Qadri Abu Bakr,  who are incentivizing terror and officially designate them as sponsors  of terror. We must let the enemies of peace know that the United States  will not stand by and allow the Palestinian Authority to promote and  reward the murder of innocents through pay for slay.   Mr. Speaker, in March 2016, Taylor Force, an American citizen and  U.S. Army veteran who served his country in both Iraq and Afghanistan,  was brutally and senselessly murdered by a Palestinian terrorist while  visiting Israel. The murderer was later shot dead by police after his  stabbing spree wounded another 10 innocent victims.   For carrying out this evil act, the terrorist's family receives  monthly stipends from the so-called ``Palestinian Authority Martyrs  Fund.''   In fact, tens of thousands of terrorists and their families have  received millions of dollars from Palestinian leadership as a reward  for murdering innocent men, women, and children.   The grotesque incentive is structured so that the more people they  kill, the greater their monetary reward. The most prolific killers can  receive more than $3,500 a month. This includes those who were and  remain members of designated terrorist organizations as described in  President Trump's Terrorist Designation Executive Order #13224.   Palestinian leadership has since spent over $350 million rewarding  these heinous acts of terror in what has now been universally dubbed  ``pay-for-slay.''  [[Page H4207]]    My bill, the Taylor Force Act, was signed into law by President Trump  on March 23, 2018. This law was meant to disincentivize these awful  payments, end the senseless war of terror against Israel, and advance  the cause of peace by ending the cycle of violence perpetuated by the  Palestinian political leadership.   Unfortunately, Palestinian Authority leaders have publicly rejected  the terms of the Taylor Force Act. We have seen documented evidence  that the ``pay for slay'' payments are now continuing in 2020,  something which Palestinian leadership has brazenly praised without  fear of consequences from the United States.   The appropriate next step is to personally sanction the Palestinian  officials involved in this incentivizing of terror.   The Palestinian Commission of Prisoners' Affairs and its Director,  Qadri Abu Bakr, must be designated as sponsors of terror, as the  administration committed itself to in Executive Order 13224.   President Trump's Peace to Prosperity plan for ending the Israel- Palestinian conflict specifically addresses the `Prisoner and Martyr  Payments' and calls for their immediate termination. This position has  received long-standing bipartisan support at home and abroad.   It is time we let the enemies of peace know in no uncertain terms  that the United States will not stand idly by and allow the Palestinian  Authority to promote and pay for the murder of innocents through pay- for-slay.                            ____________________
