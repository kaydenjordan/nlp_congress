 Mr. Speaker, our infrastructure is stuck in the 1950s,  and it doesn't have to be. It is time--in fact, it is past time--for  Congress to bring our bridges, roads, and schools into the 21st  century. The American people gave Democrats control of the U.S. House  last year because we promised to work for the people, higher wages,  lower costs, and rooting out corruption in Washington. The Moving  Forward Act delivers on that promise.   It creates millions of good-paying jobs at a time when they are  needed most. More than 40 million unemployment claims have been filed  since the start of this pandemic, but the President is more interested  in tweeting than helping people who are out of work.   As a candidate, President Trump promised to rebuild our  infrastructure. It turned out to be yet another empty promise on his  road to power.   Mr. Speaker, now Democrats are providing $1.5 trillion to build  modern, sustainable infrastructure. This is a bill that invests in the  well-being of our cities and towns.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to adopt the en bloc package, which  includes my amendment to establish the interagency innovative materials  standards task force and to pass the underlying bill without delay.                                time  1715
