 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of  the majority leader the schedule for next week.   Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield to my friend, the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the House majority leader.           Honoring Retiring Parliamentarian Thomas J. Wickham, Jr.     Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time.   Obviously, we will have an opportunity to continue, as we should,  this tribute to Tom Wickham.   So, Tom, congratulations on what you have done to preserve the  integrity of this institution.   We come here as Republicans, Democrats, as Americans first, but  people who all have their own views. Even if you are Republican, we  don't all think exactly the same way, as Democrats don't always think  the same way. But we come here to achieve certain things, to make this  a more perfect Union in the ways in which our districts--our 750,000,  roughly, people elect us to come and be part of this democracy, the  world's greatest democracy.   You come and work with other people. Sometimes, you battle with other  people in the arena of legislative ideas. It is not physical  confrontation, as the majority leader pointed out. But sometimes, you  have to persuade. Sometimes, you have to fight for your beliefs.   But ultimately, if you are going to achieve the things you came here  to do, you have to change legislation. It takes an act of Congress, as  they say. When you do that, you have to follow the rules.   The Jefferson Manual that goes back to 1801 are the rules that govern  this great House. If there is a bill on the floor and you wish to make  a change to that bill, you want to offer an amendment to the bill,  bring a motion to recommit on the bill, you have to work within the  rules. Those rules are interpreted not by the majority, not by the  minority, but by the Parliamentarian.   The job you have done for 25 years in the Parliamentarian's Office,  but especially since 2011 as the House Parliamentarian, you don't  always tell people what they want to hear, but you tell people what is  the right way to do something according to the rules that we have  established so that there is a fair process.   A lot of people don't see this back and forth. If the Parliamentarian  rules against you, it is not a personal thing. In many cases, a Member  will go to the  [[Page H4531]]  Parliamentarian, Republican or Democrat--I have done this myself--and  said, ``This is what I would like to achieve.''   Sometimes, they tell you that you can't do it on that bill because  there are germaneness issues. But sometimes, there is that gray area  where if you are trying to do it this way, it won't work, but if you  try to do it another way, it actually would work. That is really the  art of the ability of a Parliamentarian, to work with Members of  Congress to help them achieve the things they are trying to do. We  still have to go and get the votes, but at least allowing a Member that  opportunity to go fight it out and make their case.    In many cases, that case wouldn't be able to be made if the  Parliamentarian wasn't fair in offering that guidance to Members of  Congress, whatever they are trying to achieve, whatever their  background, whatever their district, to be fair and to at least give  them that opportunity to come here on the House floor and fight that  battle, hopefully right that wrong, and advance the things that they  were elected to go do to make this a more perfect Union.   So thank you, Tom, for that fairness.   I know as Jason takes on this role in a few weeks, he will have a  great legacy to build upon and to look toward somebody who did the job  right and served this country in a very proud and respected way.   I know Heather is probably watching on C-SPAN. I am not sure how many  other people are, but Heather, hopefully, is, your wife. She will have  more time to work with you. I am not sure who the parliamentarian of  your house is. I am the House Republican whip, but in my house,  Jennifer is the one who plays that role.   But in your house, hopefully, Heather sees you more, because you are  here when we are here, and sometimes those are late hours, and  sometimes those are long weekends.   We appreciate the sacrifices you have made. Hopefully, in this next  role in your life, you will be able to enjoy more time with your wife,  Heather, and your family.   We truly do thank you for playing this part of your role in history  and adding to what is great about this great democracy.   Do you mind standing up so everybody in the Chamber here can see you  and pay the proper tribute?   Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend.    As I was addressing it to the Speaker, of course.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time.   Madam Speaker, we all appreciate Tom's service to our country and  especially to this Chamber.   Now, if I may inquire of the majority leader the schedule for next  week, and I would yield.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and appreciate the  timeline, especially the comments about the negotiations that have been  going on in a very constructive way regarding a continuing resolution.  They have definitely been in good faith with Republicans and Democrats  as well as with the White House. It is encouraging to hear that,  potentially, tomorrow that could be filed and we fully expect to be  ready to take that up next week if that does, in fact, happen.   I know the differences that we have been talking about in the last  few days are minor in consideration of all of the factors that are  included in a continuing resolution. So I think, as people watch some  of the bigger fights that are real between the two sides, to see that  on something as important as properly and responsibly funding the  government that we are making very good progress on at least a short- term mechanism that would stave off any kind of shutdown between now  and September 30, I appreciate the work that has been done by the  majority with the minority and with the White House and Senate to get  to that point. Hopefully, we do get that legislation filed and are able  to take it up next week.   Unless the gentleman had anything else on that, there was another  legislative issue I wanted to bring up.   As we both know, there are conversations going on regarding a  potential next relief package. We don't know if there will be an  agreement reached. These negotiations have been going on for weeks and  weeks since the CARES Act, the multiple pieces of legislation that we  filed both before and after that we have come to an agreement on,  things like the Paycheck Protection Program that both sides worked very  hard on, very successfully on.   Reports have come out to show over 50 million Americans' jobs were  saved by the work we did as a Congress working together to save  millions of small businesses and over 50 million jobs as we are  struggling through this pandemic.   One of the things I would like to ask the gentleman to take a look at  is that  [[Page H4532]]  we may get an agreement, but we may not on a bigger relief package, and  we see multiple bills that are out there. The Senate has been trying to  advance something. The House has had a position. Some House Democrats  yesterday filed a separate bill with some other House Republicans to  try to have a third way, and the White House has been talking about a  different option. In the meantime, we clearly don't have an agreement  yet on that.   I would ask if the gentleman would look at H.R. 8265. This is a bill  by Representative Chabot of Ohio. He is the lead Republican on the  House Small Business Committee. This is a bill that would specifically  target those small businesses that were part of the Paycheck Protection  Program. This is not a new idea. This is taking the existing framework  of a bill that we, both sides, came together to pass, a very successful  bill.   As the gentleman knows, the Paycheck Protection Program still has  over $130 billion remaining in its account, money that wasn't spent. We  were able to help every business that asked. Every business that was  eligible was able to go to their local bank, didn't have to go to an  SBA lender.   Again, I want to thank our small community banks that played such an  important role. We would not have been able to help all those small  businesses stay afloat if our local community banks didn't participate  in helping the customers that they usually see on a daily basis who are  struggling.   But as that money is sitting in that account, the program has  expired, so the money can no longer be spent. We have appropriated this  money. It is not new money and it is not a new program. But what  Representative Chabot's bill does is it would allow those small  businesses that have shown a loss--we know there are some business  doing better today than they were before COVID; there are some that are  doing dramatically worse after COVID.   This would specifically be limited to those businesses that have  experienced at least a 25 percent loss or more, that they would be able  to go for a second round of Paycheck Protection loans, using existing  money, not new money, the money that is locked in an account that can  no longer be spent.   So maybe we do get an agreement between now and then on a larger  package, but if we don't, at a minimum, I would just ask the  gentleman--I would think this would be something that could pass on the  suspension calendar to at least help small businesses using a program  we already agree upon, that we already know has been successful. It  saved small businesses in every single district of this country. It is  not a Republican or Democrat plan. It has been a plan that truly has  been a lifeline for any of our small businesses. And, again, over 50  million jobs have been saved.   I would just ask the gentleman if he would take a look at that, if we  don't get an agreement, to potentially bring something like that to the  floor--that could be a suspension-type bill to pass--and, at least  while we are negotiating things that may or may not happen, help those  businesses that we know need help.   I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  [[Page H4533]]    As we look at the various topics that the gentleman from Maryland  brought up on the negotiations, if you looked at the Senate bill--and,  clearly, there are multiple bills out there--ultimately, it is going to  take a bipartisan bill working with the administration. Mr. Meadows has  been here many times working, trying to meet, sometimes not being able  to get meetings with some leaders.   But at the same time, if you look at the Senate bill, they did  include some enhanced unemployment. They included more money for small  businesses, for families, for testing. They had $16 billion for  testing, $31 billion for vaccine, which I know--I want to bring that  up. They had $20 billion for farmers, $15 billion for childcare.   They did have liability protection, which continues to be a very big  issue many small businesses bring up. They want to make sure that, if  they open safely, they are not going to be shut down by frivolous  lawsuits. That is something that there has been a lot of negotiation  about as well.   But, ultimately, when you look at those differences, we will  hopefully get that resolved. In the meantime, if that can't get broken,  at a minimum, if we can look at some of the money that is unspent  because, in addition to the PPP, I think the gentleman knows, we also  put about $150 billion in the CARES Act toward our States to help all  of our States, a formula that allowed States and, in some cases, local  governments get money to help themselves through these tough times.    There is not one State that has spent all that money. And I know some  people want to talk about how much more money to give, but if they  haven't spent the money they have already gotten, maybe we can look  there as another way to help push more relief, including with schools.   If a school wants to reopen safely--and I would encourage all  schools, the protocols have been out there. The Centers for Disease  Control have put out very good, responsible safety protocols for safely  reopening schools, and it varies, depending on the kind of region you  are in. If you have a spike, there is a way to handle that. If you are  in an area that has not seen a prevalence of COVID, then there is a  different way to handle it. But in every case, there is a way to safely  reopen schools. The American Academy of Pediatrics has laid that out as  well. It means following the safety guidelines, but it can be done and  needs to be done.   Unfortunately, in every case it is not being done, but it is not for  lack of money. Any school system that needs more assistance, whether it  is masks or screens for the teachers or whatever else they might need,  sanitizer, the funds that we sent to the States, again, none of which  have spent all of that money, can be used to help to safely reopen  schools as well.   So those are all conversations we will hopefully have.   I do want to then talk about where we are with a vaccine, because we  have been seeing a lot more reports on the progress, the tremendous  progress that has been made within the medical community. And we know  from the very beginning of this disease that our frontline healthcare  workers have been some of the heroes, probably the biggest heroes of  all of this, those hospital workers, the nurses, the doctors, but also  those people working in the labs.                                time  1500    Almost instantly after China lied to us about the origination of the  disease, lied to us about even whether or not the disease could be  spread from person to person they corrupted the WHO. But ultimately as  we started to find out what was coming out of Wuhan, I don't know, even  the Foreign Affairs Committee of this House majority had a hearing  titled: ``The Wuhan Coronavirus.'' So clearly, we know where this  started. It has been discussed.   But at the same time, we have been working feverishly to find a cure,  to find a vaccine. We have seen therapies emerge at a rapid pace.  President Trump implemented Operation Warp Speed, which was a way to  get red tape out of the way. Nobody is cutting corners on safety, but  ultimately what we are all doing is focusing all the energy and the  weight of this Federal Government behind finding a cure and a vaccine,  and what we are seeing now is remarkable success in progress.   Here are some of the companies that right now are in phase 3 of  testing on an actual vaccine for COVID-19. These are all very respected  companies, not only in America, but worldwide, globally respected.   I am concerned by some of the comments we are starting to see by some  people trying to undermine the public's confidence in a vaccine if it  were to be approved by the FDA. And let's keep in mind, the FDA would  have to approve any vaccine. You have to get approved by the FDA to go  to phase 2. You have to get approved to go to phase 3, and then  ultimately after testing on tens of thousands of people at a pace we  have never seen before--with money, by the way, that we helped pass,  and again, the gentleman and I both were part of those coalitions,  Republican and Democrat, working to put money in place for that  testing, for the work that is being done by these great companies to  start now making the vaccine vials, a hundred million vials possibly  that could be made before the drug is approved if, in fact, it then  gets that approval, so that you don't have to wait to start mass  producing after the approval.   If the FDA does approve any or all of these drugs as a vaccine that  would actually prevent COVID-19, I hope we would both encourage people,  if they wanted to, to then go and get that vaccine. And this is,  hopefully, not going to be a debate within the country. Hopefully, it  is going to be a recognition that America has the best scientific minds  in the world. We have the most respected drug companies in the world,  and they are working feverishly, not cutting a single corner on safety.   These would have to be safe and effective drugs for the FDA to  approve them, but if any one or all of them get approved, then I would  hope we would encourage people to go and protect their families, if  that is what they want to do. And I know a lot of people that would  want to do it. I have heard from some people, as I am sure the  gentleman has, that they may want to wait a little while. But I also  know that people want to be safe and secure in their homes. They want  to have a confidence level that they are not going to be at risk of  dying from COVID. And ultimately a vaccine and a therapy are the final  answer that gets us over the hump, that gets us to where we can fully  start reopening.   We are seeing many States at advanced levels of opening their  economy, but we also know that we are not where we need to be, and a  vaccine is probably going to be that biggest determining point that  helps people reopen in a much more effective way. I hope we can at  least agree that if that approval comes by the FDA that it is something  we can all embrace and encourage people to pursue, if that is what they  feel is best for their family.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I would tell the gentleman it is not hope  that you have to have. This is all about science.   Name one of these companies that would put their name on a drug that  would be injected into American people based on politics or based on a  timeline that would have an impact on an election? Not one of these  companies would do it. I would challenge anyone to name a company that  would do that, because they wouldn't do that. So it is not a hope.   If the FDA approves one of these drugs or all of these drugs, it is  because they work, they save lives. And we can't have an undermined  confidence that they would save lives--because a vaccine is not  something that a President or a candidate for President sits in a lab  and figures out. It is a very serious process that the FDA, who is the  most respected agency in the world for drug approval, has to sign off  on every step of the way.   There are three phases. These are the companies that made it all the  way through. There are other companies that are in earlier stages and  may actually get to an FDA-approved vaccine, as well, and they are all  very well respected, too, but these are the only companies. There is no  mystery company. These are the companies that are in competition, not  with themselves, but they are trying to save lives. And from everything  we are hearing, the results are tremendously successful. We should be  applauding that.   Operation Warp Speed has gotten us to this point, and while the  President might not get credit--and I think it is an important point,  as the gentleman talks about instilling confidence, where the President  is on science. I have been in many of those meetings with Dr. Fauci,  with Dr. Birx, with the whole team of the whole coronavirus task force.    He has been in some of those meetings, too. And as the  gentleman knows, not all doctors agree.    There are some doctors who will say this is the way to  do it, and there are some doctors who say that is the way to do it. You  get 10 attorneys in a room; you might get 10 opinions. The saying ``go  get a second opinion,'' that is because maybe not all doctors agree.   But when you are President of the United States you don't have the  luxury of waiting for every doctor to be in agreement. If there is an  inflection point on a decision, and some doctors are over here, and  some doctors are over there, guess what, it is the President who has to  make that final call, not because he has ignored science, but because  he has looked to the science, and ultimately, he has to make that  decision.   Dr. Fauci himself was in a committee hearing by the Select  Subcommittee that the majority whip, Mr. Clyburn, chairs. I am the lead  Republican on that committee. We had Dr. Fauci in our committee. I  asked him specifically, I went down the line on major decisions that  had to be made by this President and whether or not science was used or  not and whether or not it worked. I started, by the way, with the  decision of whether or not to stop flights from China when we found out  after China lied that they, in fact, did have this disease spreading  widely in China, and President Trump made that decision to stop flights  from China.   I know the Democrat nominee for President was against that decision,  but President Trump worked with the experts. Dr. Fauci was part of  that.   I asked him, I said, Was that the right decision by President Trump?   He said, Yes, it was.   I said, Did that decision save American lives?   He said, Yes, it I did.   And we went down the line on decision after decision, and they were  all science-based. At no point was the President trying to undermine  science.   In fact, some people were trying to suggest that Dr. Fauci was being  sidelined, and yet, he was at the hearing, under oath, speaking on  behalf of his role in the administration, and he said he has never been  sidelined. He was actually asked that question, Have you been  sidelined? He said, ``no'' under oath.   Now, is he always in agreement with the other doctors in the room?  No, he is not. Does that mean he is wrong? No. But maybe he is. But,  again, doctors can disagree because that is what science is. It is not  two plus two equals four every time because you are dealing with some  very complicated issues of a disease we knew nothing about less than a  year ago.   Fortunately, with Operation Warp Speed, President Trump put together  the best scientists, not just in America, but I would argue in the  world, to figure out how to solve this, how to come up with things like  hydroxychloroquine, which some people might say doesn't work. I have  talked to many doctors who use it successfully to save lives even  today. That should be the doctor's decision. Some people want  government to control all those decisions. I would rather the doctor  being the one to work with his patient.   You look at the other drugs that are out there today, but again, now  we talk about a vaccine, there is not one company on this list--these  are the only companies right now in phase 3. And if any of them are  approved by the FDA, I hope nobody would question the integrity of that  drug.   Do you think any of these companies would put their name on a drug  that they don't stand behind as a safe and effective vaccine for this  disease? And that is really the point.   It is all about science here. It is all about science and some people  are trying to undermine that. And we need to get away from that because  that will cost lives. If somebody is reluctant to take one of these  drugs because they heard somebody that said, well, don't trust it if it  comes from this President or that candidate, that is a dangerous game  because lives would be lost if people didn't take that vaccine because  they didn't have that confidence. We all need to have that confidence.  We all work with science.   We have all had doctors who told us one thing, and maybe you wanted  to go get that second opinion, but at the end of the day, you have got  to make that choice, and you make it based on all the science that is  available, and not all the time do all the scientists agree. In fact,  many times on the complicated issues you get different opinions from  different scientists. This President has worked with some of the best  in the world.   And according to Dr. Fauci himself, by and large, the President has  followed even Dr. Fauci's advice and has made the right decisions up  and down the line based on science. And most importantly, President  Trump's decision following the science has saved American lives,  starting with that very first decision, which Joe Biden himself was  [[Page H4535]]  against. How many American lives would have been lost if we didn't ban  the flights from China; if we didn't ban the flights from Europe, when  it was breaking out in Europe; if we didn't do 15 days to stop the  spread, which President Trump did on the advice of his scientist? After  that they said we need to go another 30 days. President Trump did that,  too. Every one of those decisions was based on science. Every one of  those decisions saved American lives.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I would just remind the gentleman, with  all due respect to Dr. Redfield, he is not the head of the FDA.   The FDA is the agency that approves drugs, and in fact, the FDA is  the agency working every day with these companies. There is a very  strict protocol for going through phases of testing.   Now, one thing that is important to point out on the testing,  because, again, some people wonder because Operation Warp Speed has  gotten us to a point quicker, maybe in the history of the world, at  finding a vaccine for a disease we knew nothing about 8 months ago, but  the reason they are doing it is not because they are cutting corners.  No one in science that I have heard has suggested that they are cutting  corners because they are not. They have strict protocols.   What they are doing, number one, the President put real money in  place behind making sure that each of these drug companies has direct  communication with the FDA every step of the way so they know if tests  need to be run on more people or different demographic groups, as is  done with other drugs, they can do it quickly. They have a wide range  of people willing to be tested.   To the tribute of all Americans, over 300,000 Americans have signed  up for these tests. This isn't being tested on just a few people.  Sometimes, a drug takes years and years to get to market for a lot of  reasons. One is red tape.   President Trump has done a great job of getting the red tape out of  the way to let the scientists actually do their job in real time.  Something could sit on somebody's desk for months, in many cases,  delaying lifesaving drugs. We have gotten that red tape out of the way.   Frankly, we ought to look at working together as Republicans and  Democrats at making that the norm, not the exception, to actually be  able to get red tape out of the way to help save lives.   But as they are doing it, they are testing it on more people than is  normally the case. Sometimes, you might only have a few thousand people  who are willing or in a position to be tested. Today, you have hundreds  of thousands of people who are being tested.   If they make it through each step, it is not based on who is in the  White House. It is based on what the doctors at the FDA, working with  the smart people in these drug companies, have come up with based on  the test results. If they test people and there are problems, it  doesn't even make it to phase 2.   These are all in phase 3. They are all showing tremendous promise,  but if one of them makes it through or if all of them make it through,  it is not because somebody rushed it. It is because the doctors and the  scientists said it works. Not one of these companies would put their  name on that vaccine, not one of them.   Again, I would challenge anybody, Madam Speaker, if they think any of  these companies would cut a corner, please let us know right now  because that is not the case. That narrative shouldn't be out there  because that narrative would be a false narrative and would cost  American lives. If that narrative were to get out, then there might be  people who wouldn't take the vaccine who otherwise would and should,  where it could save their life, because this will save American lives.   And it is through American ingenuity. We ought to be proud of this.   We should put the politics aside and say thank God America is the  leader in healthcare to the point where we have great American  companies partnering, in this case, with a German company here in  America, testing at a level we have never seen before on more people  because we took the priority, through Operation Warp Speed, to put  all the focus of these great agencies on finding a cure for COVID-19.    We are on the brink of doing it. It may not happen if the science  doesn't match. But if the science does say these work, we all ought to  applaud that and encourage people to explore, in a conversation with  their doctor, whether or not they should take it.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I never suggested that. In fact, I said  at the outset that these companies are in direct communication with the  FDA on a regular basis. That is what Operation Warp Speed is.   In the old way of doing things, these companies would have submitted  their data and would have waited months while some faceless bureaucrat  let it sit on a desk and nothing happened.   Instead, what the President did was said there will be direct  contacts where they can communicate with the FDA. They are not the  enemy.   These companies aren't the enemy. The FDA is not the enemy. But it  shouldn't be viewed as you are on one side and you are on the other  side.   They are both working together because they are both part of the  smartest scientific community in the world.  [[Page H4536]]  They work together because the FDA wants to get it right and these  companies want to get it right.   We saw one of them just a few days ago. They had a pause, which is  the protocol. That is the safety protocol because there was a question  in the testing, and they addressed it. I am sure there were many. I  don't know directly, but I am sure there were many conversations with  the FDA.   But then they started up again, which means there wasn't a problem.  But it meant they followed the protocols, which say, if you see  something that you need to go review, you hold off, and then you go  check that out. That is what one of these did, and now they are back on  track.   The others continue to go through, all of them, working with the FDA.  That is really what this is about. It is about a partnership because  the FDA has to sign off.   I am sure the gentleman would agree. You want to make sure you have  multiple people looking at it. You don't just want the company that is  making the drug looking at it. You want the regulator looking at it as  well because, ultimately, they have to sign off on it.   They are not doing it blindly. No one suggests that. But they are  doing it with a much sharper focus. It is the top priority, I think we  would all agree. This needs to be the priority to get our country back  on track, and it has to be done right. But it is not going to get  signed off if it is not right. So, it is a partnership, and it is  working incredibly well.   Again, this new partnership ought to be the model in the future. It  shouldn't be the exception just because of COVID. It is working  incredibly well.   We worked together to pass the 21st Century Cures Act, which  ultimately will find a cure for cancer, for Alzheimer's, for ALS, for  other diseases. It is because we put a sharper focus over at the  National Institutes of Health, and we put additional resources over at  the National Institutes of Health.   That priority, what we are learning from this, ought to be replicated  to help find a cure for some of those other diseases so that maybe we  can find even more cures for people who are living today, not just for  somebody 30 years from now, but for somebody struggling today with one  of those terrible diseases.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I know we will continue this  conversation. Hopefully, the bill gets filed tomorrow, and we can  resolve more of these issues next week. I look forward to seeing the  gentleman and working with him on all of these.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
