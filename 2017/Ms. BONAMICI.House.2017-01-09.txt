 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 353, the Weather Research and  Forecasting Innovation Act. This bill, introduced by my colleague, Mr.  Lucas, is a product of hard work and negotiation over the past two  Congresses.   In addition to Mr. Lucas, I thank Chairman Smith and also Environment  Subcommittee chair, Mr. Bridenstine, and former chair, Mr. Chris  Stewart, who were great partners in this process. The language before  us today is a result of a truly bipartisan and bicameral effort.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible  for many important tasks at the cutting edge of science and public  service, and weather forecasting is one of the tasks most critical to  our country.   In the northwest Oregon communities I represent, my constituents rely  on timely weather forecasts to decide when to harvest their crops, when  to go to sea to fish, how to navigate the roads safely when there is  freezing rain or snow, and to prepare for possible flood conditions.   The National Weather Service provides excellent forecasting products  to support our economy, but with the increasing frequency of severe  weather events, there can be and should be improvements in our  forecasting capabilities and delivery.   For example, forecasts can be more precise regarding what will happen  and when. Improved forecasts can provide more lead time to allow  communities to prepare, especially in severe weather events. Forecast  information should also be communicated more effectively to the public  and those in harm's way to reduce the loss of life and property. This  bill is designed to address those important goals.   The bill connects the research side of NOAA, the Office of Oceanic  and Atmospheric Research, more effectively to the forecasting needs of  the National Weather Service. This research-to-operations pipeline is  essential for the continued improvement of our weather forecasting  enterprise.                                time  1715    The bill contains several provisions that will improve interactions  and information sharing between NOAA's researchers and the National  Weather Service. It also improves communications between NOAA and the  broader research and private weather communities.   The bill also establishes interagency coordination, through the  Office of Science and Technology Policy, across multiple agencies  outside of NOAA that share responsibilities for weather research and  forecast communications. This is essential as we face budget  constraints, and it will help speed the adoption of best tools and  practices across the various agencies.   H.R. 353 also recognizes that even the best forecasts will not serve  the public's needs unless there are effective communications systems.  The bill directs NOAA to do more research, listen to experts, and  improve its risk communications techniques.   The bill also reestablishes a program that allows NOAA to give awards  to people who save the lives of others through NOAA's Weather Radio All  Hazards program. The bill also formally establishes the pilot program  currently operating at NOAA to engage in contracts with the commercial  sector for weather forecasting data.   Additionally, the bill requires NOAA to examine the benefits and  costs of different sensors by running simulations of different  configurations of instruments and datasets on forecasting accuracy. It  is important that these requirements are not too prescriptive so that  NOAA can use the most efficient, accurate, and cost-effective model for  this situation.   This legislation will produce advances in weather forecasting and  capabilities that will result in better development of forecast  innovations and technology. Ultimately, this will save American lives  and property.   I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle for their input and  support. Also, I would like to thank the hardworking committee staff on  both sides of the aisle for their efforts to continue negotiations to  move this bill forward.   I ask my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
