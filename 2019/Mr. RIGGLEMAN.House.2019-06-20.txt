 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Maryland,  Representative Trone, with whom I have developed a bipartisan  partnership that has resulted in these two amendments.   The first amendment increases funding for Community Connect Grants to  connect broadband deployment into rural communities that are  underserved by private sector investment.   Our rural communities, including some in my district, need access to  broadband to keep up with the demands of the modern economy.   This amendment will help communities close the digital divide, which  is critical to enhancing economic opportunity, job creation, access to  healthcare, and education in rural America.   The next amendment, dear to my heart, increases funding for the Rural  Health and Safety Education Program to combat the opioid epidemic in  rural communities.   Representative Trone and I and too many others in this body and in  our country at large have seen friends and family members suffer and  even pass away from the opioid crisis that has ravaged our country.  Just last week, I lost my cousin to a heroin overdose.   This funding is an essential step to turn the crisis around.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support these two amendments.
