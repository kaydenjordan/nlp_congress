 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  extend my sincerest congratulations and happy  [[Page S1787]]  birthday wishes to Ms. Carol Rivard who celebrated her 100th birthday  on March 17, 2018.   Carol has lived in New Hampshire since she moved to Salem with her  family in 1959. She worked in a textile mill and later as an office  clerk for Kmart. After her retirement, Carol dedicated her time to  helping a local food pantry where she volunteered every week for nearly  10 years.   To this day, Carol lives independently in her New Hampshire home. Her  most cherished moments are spent with loved ones at family gatherings,  where they enjoy listening to Frank Sinatra and cheering on the Boston  Celtics. Carol has three sons and a daughter, as well as three  grandchildren and five great-grandchildren   I join with Carol's friends and family, as well as many people in the  town of Salem and across the Granite State, in wishing her a very happy  100th birthday.                            ____________________
