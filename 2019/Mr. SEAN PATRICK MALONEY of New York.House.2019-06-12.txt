 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor a young hero we lost last week who died in a tragic accident at  the United States Military Academy at West Point, located in my  district in New York's Hudson Valley.   The cadet's name was Christopher J. Morgan, but most folks called him  C.J. He was a member of the class of 2020. He was just 22 years old.   Chris was a talented cadet. He was majoring in law and legal studies  and was a standout wrestler. Above all, he was dedicated to this  country and to protecting our freedoms.   The loss of a young cadet is heartbreaking, and this accident is  devastating to our community. This tragedy is another painful reminder  of the sacrifices our military servicemembers and their families make  for us and on our behalf.   My heart goes out to Chris' family, to his fellow cadets, some of  whom were also injured in the accident, and I ask today that all join  me in praying for these cadets and the soldiers injured last week in  the accident. The Army family is impacted and the entire West Point  community.   I also want to thank New York's first responders, medics, emergency  personnel, and State troopers for their quick action after the accident  last week.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an  amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today on  the anniversary of a day 3 years ago when we were mourning a terrible  loss because of a gun massacre in Florida that affected my community in  particular.   I rise to offer an amendment to the Department of Labor, HHS, and  Education Appropriations Act that will set aside $5 million of funding  for gun violence research in our schools. This bill rightfully includes  $25 million for gun violence research funding at the Centers for  Disease Control. This funding is critical when 100 Americans die every  day because of gun violence.   Ninety-four schools across our country had shooting incidents last  year. That is the largest number of school shootings in a single year  since 1970.   The other side has held gun violence research hostage for more than  two decades by refusing to appropriate dedicated funds for gun violence  research--just research. Now that we are finally able to look into this  public health crisis, we need to address it head-on.   As a Representative and as a dad who sends his kids to public school  every day and whose worst nightmare is that someone will use a gun to  hurt them or their friends, I am asking that we take action to stop  school shootings now. The lives and safety of our kids are at risk, all  of our kids, and we have almost no data on what is happening.   This funding will treat gun violence in our schools just like we  treat any other public health crisis and finally give the CDC the  funding it desperately needs to help us find answers on how to address  these ongoing acts of violence.   As we know, quality data can lead to breakthrough solutions.  Investing in research on car accidents and the risk of smoking has led  to policies that have saved countless lives. We can finally free and  empower researchers to study the unique impacts and causes of gun  violence in schools, examine the data, and formulate solutions that  will save lives, children's lives.   I urge support of my amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro) for her remarks.    Madam Chair, I yield back the  balance of my time.
