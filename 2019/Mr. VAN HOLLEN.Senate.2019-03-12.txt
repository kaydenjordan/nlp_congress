 Thank you, Madam President. I want to start by  thanking my friend, the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse, for  his leadership on addressing the climate issue for many, many years,  taking to the floor of the Senate time and again to raise the alarm  about the dangers of climate change and what it means to communities  throughout this country and people throughout the world, and, much more  than that, putting forward very specific ideas--constructive ideas--on  how we can address this issue together. I am proud to join the  legislation that he referenced, along with Senator Barrasso, to look at  carbon capture technologies and to incentivize those technologies, as  Mr. Whitehouse indicated. It is a small measure but maybe a first baby  step that we can work on here together.   Like the Senator from Rhode Island, I have been listening carefully  to the floor discussion over the last couple of weeks. I have heard  many of our Republican colleagues come to the floor. They have come to  criticize the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal, of course, is a very  ambitious set of goals to address the crisis of global climate change  and to put out some ideas for how we address this generational  challenge.   While I heard a lot of criticism, as Senator Whitehouse said, I  didn't hear a single--not one--idea about how we can work together to  significantly address this challenge, which is why Democrats have asked  our Republican colleagues to join us in supporting S. J. Res. 9, which  was introduced by Senator Carper, along with the Democrats and, I am  pleased to say, one Republican. The question, of course, is where are  the other 52 Republicans when this is the language? I am going to read  it because it is very straightforward, and I think the American public  will ask themselves why we don't have 100 Senators on this piece of  legislation:         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That it is       the sense of Congress that--        (1) climate change is real;        (2) human activity during the last century is the dominant       cause of climate crisis; and        (3) the United States and Congress should take immediate       action to address the challenge of climate change.    It is simple, straightforward. I want to just take these very  quickly, one at a time.   ``Climate change is real.'' Look, we all know that there are a few  greenhouse gases. You have methane, which is a very potent greenhouse  gas. But the most prevalent one, of course, is carbon dioxide. It is a  greenhouse gas, and you can measure the concentration of carbon dioxide  in our atmosphere. You can go out and take samples and measure it.   In doing that, we find that we have seen huge increases in the  concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere over the last 100  years.   I am proud to represent the State of Maryland, which is home to NASA  Goddard, where they do a lot of climate science, and home to NOAA, or  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I am holding the  latest measurement they did in January 2019. It shows the carbon  dioxide in the atmosphere at 411 ppm. That is a jump just from 2006,  when it was at about 380 ppm. If you look at that over time, you see a  big jump in concentration. These are greenhouse gases, and that is why  you see, of course, the increasing temperatures.   I am now holding in my hand something from NASA that just came out on  February 6 of this year, headlined ``2018 fourth warmest year in  continued warming trend, according to NASA, NOAA.'' It points out that  globally 2018 temperatures ranked behind those of 2016, 2017 and 2015,  and it goes on to say that the past 5 years are collectively the  warmest years in modern record.   So there are large concentrations of CO2 and rising  temperatures. I hope our Republican colleagues will agree with us on  that point in the resolution.   No. 2 is that it is caused by ``human activity.'' There is no doubt  that if you look at how fossil fuels that were in our Earth for  millions of years have been released during the Industrial Revolution  in the last century--be it from coal-fired powerplants, oil, or gas-- all of a sudden you saw this carbon which had been trapped in the Earth  released into the atmosphere through human activity, and that also is  measurable.   So I hope our Republican colleagues will agree with us on those two  points, and if they agree with us on those points, then I hope they  will agree with us that we should all do something about it, because  the consequences of climate change are very real, and we can see them  all around us.   Senator Whitehouse mentioned a recent study that showed that the  probability that the scientists were wrong was .001 percent-- negligible.   We just saw last Thanksgiving--this last year at Thanksgiving time-- that 300 U.S. scientists issued the Fourth National Climate Assessment.  I have a copy of part of that in my hand right here, and they make it  very clear--these are U.S. scientists--that the impact of these growing  temperatures is real and, of course, we see them all around us in the  form of much more extreme and frequent droughts. We see it in the form  of more forest fires. We see it in the form of flooding and sea level  rise. We see it all over our country in every community and all over  the world. The costs of doing nothing are mounting by the day.    If you look at this report that was issued around Thanksgiving, they  also talk about the regional impact of disruption and of the impacts of  climate change. They look at different regions around the country,  including the Northeast. Of course, Senator Whitehouse represents Rhode  Island, and I have the honor of representing Maryland. It says these  areas, these regions, will get hot faster than many other areas.   It also talks about the impact of climate change on the Chesapeake  Bay, which is a national treasure and is very important to Maryland's  economy. They predict stronger and more frequent storms and an increase  in rain, which will lead to more pollution in the bay, increased water  temperatures, and sea level rise. By the way, one island has already  disappeared in the Chesapeake Bay, and a couple more look like they  will be going under in the coming years because of sea level rise.   If you go to the Naval Academy in Annapolis and you talk to folks  there, they will tell you that they are already experiencing the  negative impact of flooding and sea level rise right there at the Naval  Academy. Of course, our military has warned for years about the  consequences of climate change.   I just want to give a very simple analogy since I mentioned the  Chesapeake Bay. Like many of us, we have worked hard to protect water  bodies in this country, and the Chesapeake Bay is an incredible natural  estuary. Years ago, everyone recognized that the bay was dying. We saw  more sewer overflows into the bay because we didn't have enough sewage  treatment plants. We saw runoff from suburban roads and highways. We  saw nutrient runoff from farms in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The bay  was on its way down fast. Of course, with all of those nutrients in the  watershed, you lose the oysters, the crabs, and the seafood industry.  You lose the Chesapeake Bay.   The same thing is, of course, happening to our planet. Just like with  the Chesapeake Bay, there is a limit to how much carbon pollution you  can put on our planet. We have all seen those amazing photographs of  the Earth from outer space. The Earth is telling us that there is a  limit as to how much carbon pollution we can spew into it, and it is  telling us by its screaming out with these extreme weather events. So  the real question is, What are we going to do about it?   As Senator Whitehouse said, there are many things we should be doing.  I will close my remarks by mentioning one that also involves putting a  price on carbon because, among the array of tools we need to deploy,  that really needs to be one of them. It is really based on the simple  idea we have pursued in this country to fight pollution, which is that  the polluter pays, right? The folks--the industries--who are causing  the pollution that is impacting our communities in harmful ways should  pay. How do you make them pay? You put a price on the carbon pollution  that is being emitted. When you put a price on the carbon pollution  that is being emitted, there is an incentive to emit less of it, and  there is an incentive for others to find innovative ways to generate  energy without there being carbon pollution.  [[Page S1803]]    That is why, for many years, I proposed what is called the cap and  dividend bill, which looks at the science and says: OK, if we want to  make sure to avoid these huge costs to our communities, we have to  limit the amount of carbon pollution that is being emitted.   We base that cap on science, and that generates a price for carbon.  That means, as Senator Whitehouse said, that in order to avoid that  price, people will look for ways to reduce carbon emissions. We take  the funds generated from putting a price on carbon, and we rebate those  funds to the American people. A study by an economist at the University  of Massachusetts Amherst found that if you do that--if you rebate the  funds you generate by putting a price on carbon and making polluters  pay and if you rebate that to American households--80 percent of  American households will actually have more money in their pockets at  the end of the day than they started with. That doesn't even count the  additional benefits from there being a cleaner environment and fewer  storms and severe weather events. It also doesn't include the  incredible economic opportunities that would be unleashed by having  more people invest in clean energy technology and energy efficiency.   So it is really a pleasure to be here with my friend Senator  Whitehouse because that is one tool among others, including the need to  invest in more research. The Senator said you have to put some  resources behind research and innovation. It doesn't just happen by  magic. We can have clean energy portfolio standards, we can do a lot of  things, but we need to start with something real. That is why we are  here, because that is the final part of that resolution. It is a very  simple resolution that says that climate change is real, that it is  caused by human activity, and that the U.S. Congress should take  immediate action to address the challenge.   It is time for our colleagues to stop criticizing everybody else's  ideas and to put their own ideas on the table. We are ready to work  with our colleagues on a bipartisan basis to address this most pressing  of issues that face our country and the world.    Madam President, if I might, that is why it is always  interesting to hear some of the critics of climate change say: Do you  know what? Carbon dioxide has been around since the beginning of the  planet, so it can't possibly be harmful.   Of course it has been around forever, but, as Senator Whitehouse  pointed out, it has been around for hundreds of thousands and millions  of years at a certain concentration. If you look at all of the evidence  from NASA scientists and others, you will see that level of  concentration bumped up and down within a certain range for all of  those millennia that the Senator talked about. Yet, in the last 150  years, especially the last century, it shot straight through the roof.  It is an excellent example of the phrase ``everything in moderation.''   Obviously, carbon dioxide has been part of our planet's gases all  along, but the fact is that we have unleashed that carbon dioxide, in  the form of fossil fuels, that has been trapped in the Earth for  millions and millions of years. We have somehow just let it out within  the last 100, and that is what is creating harmful, poisonous levels of  carbon dioxide that are poisonous for the planet. Just like with a  human being, when you put poison in the body, the body lets you know.  The Earth is screaming out in all of these different ways to let us  know that it has reached its limit when it comes to carbon dioxide  pollution. That is why we have to do something about it.    There you go.
