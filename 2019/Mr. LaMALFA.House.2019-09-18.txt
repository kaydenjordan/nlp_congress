 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend Andrew Wheeler,  Administrator at EPA, and R.D. James, administrator at the Army Corps  of Engineers, for withdrawing the very devastating WOTUS rule, the  waters of the United States rule that was put in about 4 years ago  under the Obama administration which went way beyond the bounds of what  the Clean Water Act passed and was intended by this Congress in 1972.   It has been devastating to farmers, ranchers, and others outside that  do things with the management of water seeming to be not just in what  is called navigable waterways but every mud puddle across the United  States.   This was a massive overreach by the previous administration on that,  and we can put this back on a better path so that we have the type of  management that actually does help keep our water clean in this country  but also not onerous regulations that make it impossible to farm and  ranch in this country.   We have seen farmers receive million-dollar fines because of merely  reengaging crops have been fallow for a while or changing a crop, which  is way beyond the scope of what the Clean Water Act intended and had  provisions for exemptions for agriculture.   It is a great step. Thank you, EPA and Army Corps, for the repeal of  this measure.                            ____________________
