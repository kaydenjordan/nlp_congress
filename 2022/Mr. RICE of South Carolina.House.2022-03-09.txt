 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Brady, Mr. Neal,  and Mr. Doggett for their leadership on this bill to sanction Russian  energy exports, which I support, but I must express my frustration that  this bill does not go far enough.                                time  1945    On February 7, President Biden stated that if Russia invaded Ukraine,  the United States would impose crippling sanctions. Yet, here we are, 2  weeks after Biden finally found the courage to call it an invasion, and  the sanctions are still being rolled out piecemeal.   Only last week, the administration was telling us that sanctioning  Russian oil and gas imports was not on the table. In the face of  inaction, Democrats and Republicans in Congress came together to impose  the crippling sanctions the President had promised but not followed  through on. The bipartisan bill would have banned Russian oil imports  and enabled the imposition of tariffs on all remaining Russian imports  to America. But the White House intervened, and my Democrat friends  withdrew their support.   Instead, this bill bans only oil. The remaining half of Russian trade  remains. American purchases will keep funding Russia's cruel invasion,  and Russia will keep its most-favored-nation status in the World Trade  Organization.   In this bill, we ask our allies to penalize Russian imports, but we  refuse to do so ourselves. Now, that is not leadership. I cannot  understand why America would maintain trade relations with a nation  that only last night bombed a children's hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine.   Mr. President, how many more innocent Ukrainians need to die before  you do what you promised? Stop projecting weakness, and just do what  you say.   China is watching. The world is watching.
