 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, I rise today to discuss the impeachment  inquiry currently underway in the House.   First, I want to recognize the courageous public servants who have  testified in the House in recent weeks in defense of U.S. national  security and in defense of the rule of law and our democratic  institutions. I will cite just four: Lieutenant Colonel Vindman,  Ambassador Yovanovitch, Ambassador Taylor, and Ambassador McKinley.   Despite the two decades of military service by Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman and the Purple Heart he earned for his sacrifice for our  country in Iraq, his character has faced brutal attacks from cable news  and from some current and former Members of Congress.   As former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul put it in a  Washington Post column last week, ``Such smear tactics are revolting  and un-American. [Lt. Col.] Vindman has served our country with honor  and distinction, both on and off the battlefield. . . . And he is a  patriot--as you would expect from someone with his outstanding  resume.''   So said former Ambassador McFaul, and I agree with him. I think most  Americans would agree with him.   Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is just one of the many brave patriots who  have testified as part of this impeachment inquiry.   Ambassador Yovanovitch has dedicated over 30 years to U.S. foreign  service. She has rightfully earned the respect and credibility that she  has within the U.S. national security community for her anti-corruption  efforts in Ukraine and for her unwavering commitment to U.S. national  security interests.   Ambassador McKinley has served this country as Senior Advisor to the  Secretary of State and Ambassador to Brazil, Afghanistan, Colombia, and  Peru. He has demonstrated fierce loyalty to his colleagues in the State  Department and to the United States itself.   Ambassador Taylor's life has been marked by his service to our  Nation, from West Point to the 101st Airborne in Vietnam, to his work  as Ambassador to Ukraine and other significant foreign policy roles.   We should all be inspired by these and countless other public  servants who work to protect and serve the United States every day.  When I reflect upon their service to our country and their integrity, I  am reminded of one of the lines from ``America the Beautiful": ``Oh,  beautiful for patriot dream That sees beyond the years.'' That is what  these patriots are doing--trying to understand and deliberate about  what their actions should be now that will help America over time, to  see beyond the years. That is part of the dream of a patriot, and these  individuals have demonstrated that. They have a care and a concern  about our institutions, our government, our democracy, our  Constitution, and, of course, a concern about what their actions mean  for the future.   Over the past week, the House committees leading the impeachment  inquiry regarding President Trump's, in my judgment, abuse of power  have publicly released the first full transcripts from several of their  interviews with State officials and diplomats. The transcripts explain  in rich detail how the President employed Rudy Giuliani, his personal  attorney, to manage a shadow diplomacy agenda focused on personal  vendettas and unfounded--and that is an understatement--conspiracy  theories in Ukraine.   Ambassador Yovanovitch testified that there was a ``concerted  campaign'' to have her removed as Ambassador to Ukraine and repeatedly  discussed the threatening and bullying behavior of the President and  Mr. Giuliani because of her disagreements with Mr. Giuliani. The  Ambassador explained that a senior Ukrainian official expressed  significant concerns regarding Mr. Giuliani's behavior and told the  Ambassador that she ``really needed to watch her back.''   When asked whether she felt threatened after President Trump told the  Ukrainian President that she was ``going to go through some things,''  Ambassador Yovanovitch responded unequivocally ``yes,'' meaning yes,  she felt threatened.   And she indicated some of her friends were ``very concerned'' about  her personal safety.   Just imagine that. Imagine that. A U.S. Ambassador concerned about  what would happen to her next. Even those around her were concerned  about her personal safety because of what a President was saying and  doing--and those around him.   Later in her testimony, Ambassador Yovanovitch discussed the  influence of Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine. When asked whether anyone at the  State Department tried to stop Giuliani's efforts, she explained as  follows:         I don't think so. I don't think they felt they could.    Now, let's turn to Ambassador Taylor. He described similar concerns  about Mr. Giuliani. Referencing the investigations President Trump  wanted Ukraine to pursue into his political opponent--in this case,  former Vice President Joe Biden--Ambassador Taylor described that the  ``irregular channel'' of Ukraine policy directed by Mr. Giuliani was  focused on ``one or two specific cases, irrespective of whether it  helped solve the corruption problem'' in Ukraine.   Ambassador Taylor further explained that it was his ``clear  understanding'' that ``security assistance money'' for Ukraine would  not be delivered until President Zelensky ``committed to pursue the  investigation.''   Ambassador McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State  Pompeo, confirmed that he resigned because of his concerns about the  President's shadow diplomacy efforts  [[Page S6464]]  with Mr. Giuliani. When the chairman asked Mr. McKinley whether he  resigned in part because of efforts to use the State Department to dig  up dirt on a political opponent, Mr. McKinley responded:         That is fair. And if I can underscore, in 37 years in the       Foreign Service and different parts of the globe and working       on many controversial issues, working 10 years back in       Washington, I had never seen that.    As the Washington Post reported on September 21, the President's  behavior related to this Ukraine matter has revealed--in the opinion of  this journalist at the Post, a reporter who has covered the President  very closely--No. 1, ``a President convinced of his own invincibility-- apparently willing and even eager to wield the vast powers of the  United States to taint a political foe and confident that no one could  hold him back.''   Let me move to the whistleblower protections. Armed with this sense  of invincibility, the President has directed some of his most pointed  criticisms at the brave whistleblower who came forward to expose the  President's call with the Ukrainian President.   On Twitter, the President has demanded to meet the whistleblower  face-to-face, despite laws that clearly protect the whistleblower's  right to anonymity.   Just the other day, the whistleblower's attorney confirmed that his  client offered to answer written questions under oath from House  Republicans as long as the questions did not compromise the  individual's identity.   House Republicans immediately denounced the offer, and the President  tweeted that ``[w]ritten answers are not acceptable,'' despite the fact  that President Trump refused--refused to be interviewed by Special  Counsel Mueller's team and only answered written questions during the  special counsel's investigation into election interference.   Despite his own unwillingness to answer live questioning, the  President has persisted in his desire to ``out'' the whistleblower by  tweeting that ``we must determine the Whistleblower's identity'' and  arguing that the press would be ``doing the public a service'' if it  outed the whistleblower.   Nothing--nothing the President has done or said in his more than 2\1/ 2\ years as President convinces me that he has any understanding of  public service or doing the public a service, depending on how you look  at it.   President Trump has even demanded to know who provided the  information to the whistleblower and suggested that the source was ``a  spy'' who would have been executed ``in the old days.''   These comments follow the testimony of Acting Director of National  Intelligence Joseph Maguire--a former Navy SEAL with 36 years of  military experience and a Presidential Appointee--before the House of  Representatives in September.   Mr. Maguire said the following:         [W]e must protect those who demonstrate courage to report       alleged wrongdoing. . . . The Inspector General is properly       protecting the complainant's identity and will not permit the       complainant to be subject to any retaliation or adverse       consequences for communicating the complaint to the Inspector       General.    Yesterday, in floor remarks, the junior Senator from Kentucky  compared the whistleblower to Edward Snowden and argued that the  current concerns about the safety of the whistleblower are nothing more  than ``selective outrage.''   To be clear, Edward Snowden broke the law. He abused his security  clearance and position of trust to leak classified information to the  press. He sought safe haven in Russia, and we are unaware of any other  information he may have shared that could further jeopardize national  security.   The current whistleblower has strictly followed the appropriate  channels of reporting, as confirmed by Director Maguire, and the  individual deserves the full protection under the law.   The Senator from Kentucky referenced Edward Snowden in a conversation  about blowing the whistle on President Trump's abuse of power. I hope  that anyone would not make a comparison between the two cases.  Threatening a witness or retaliating against a whistleblower is  illegal. We know that. The President's public attacks on the  whistleblower only add to the record of impeachable conduct.   His careless and extreme rhetoric not only places the whistleblower's  personal safety in jeopardy, it undermines the entire whistleblower  program of the intelligence community and across the government.   The intelligence community and Congress must continue to do all we  can to protect the current whistleblower's identity and personal  safety. The current legal protections for whistleblowers are  insufficient to fully protect those who are courageous enough to come  forward and report wrongdoing.   Of course, the reason we need the additional protections is the  President's conduct in threatening the whistleblower. No other  President has ever done this.   Congress must consider more ways to protect whistleblowers, including  criminalizing the disclosure of the whistleblower's identity. It should  be clear that should be a crime, if the statutes do not provide for it  now.   We must use this experience to ensure that whistleblowers will be  protected from threatening rhetoric and from actions by a President or  any other public official meant to intimidate whistleblowers. If you  are threatening a whistleblower, if you are trying to ``out'' them,  that is always--always wrong. We do not have to worry about whether a  specific statutory provision made it a crime. It is always wrong. Until  this President, that was well understood by people in both parties,  both Houses, and both branches.   This inquiry is not simply about President Trump's clear abuse of  power. This inquiry is about our democracy and the values our Founders  agreed should guide our Nation.   We owe the whistleblower, Lt. Col. Vindman, Ambassadors Yovanovitch,  Taylor, and McKinley, as well as others, our deepest gratitude and our  appreciation for their integrity and commitment to American values.  They are real American heroes who, despite the President's bullying and  harassment, have stood up in defense of our democratic institutions and  the values the Founders fought to guide our Nation.   I yield the floor.
