 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule  governing debate, and the underlying bill, regarding H.R.2, the so- called ``Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018,'' the House  Republicans' failed attempt to produce a Farm Bill that is good for  America.   A more fitting name for this terrible and bitter legislative pill  would be the ``Let Poor Families and Children Starve so Billionaires  Can Get Fatter Act.''   Going back to 1962, beginning with Senators Hubert Humphrey, Bob  Dole, and George McGovern, Farm Bills have always attracted bipartisan  support and engendered an enduring alliance between urban and rural  legislators in the common cause of ensuring livable incomes for farm  families and an affordable and nutritious food supply.   With this purely partisan bill, House Republicans have turned their  back on this 56 year heritage.   Mr. Speaker, St. Augustine, the great Catholic theologian, said:  ``Without justice, what else is the state but a gang of robbers?''   There is no justice in this Farm Bill, but there is harm--lots of  it--inflicted on the most vulnerable, so much so that many people are  saying that the House Republican majority has produced a bill that is  worthy of a gang of robbers.   I oppose this rule and underlying legislation for several reasons but  most of all because of its abject cruelty to American's most vulnerable  families and children.   H.R. 2 slashes $23 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program (``SNAP''), a lifeline depended upon by millions of families  and children to provide for their daily nutrition needs.   But who among us can say they are truly surprised?   Since taking office sixteen months ago, the President has made  abundantly clear his indifference to the most vulnerable citizens in  society.   And he has been aided in his endeavors by a feckless House Republican  majority.   The President began his presidency with a concerted and determined  push to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a law which has helped over 17  million individuals gain health insurance; reduced the uninsured rate  by 40 percent and, provided 89 percent of Americans with the security  and peace of mind that comes with access to affordable quality  healthcare.   When that effort failed, the President next turned his efforts to  passing the massive Trump-GOP Tax Scam, which slashed taxes for the top  one percent and multi-national corporations, but the negative  consequences of which the Trump-GOP Tax Scam have been devastating for  the average American.   The GOP Tax Scam has now been revealed not to generate broad-based  economic growth but instead to create annual trillion dollar deficits  as far as the eye can see.   Mr. Speaker, if we are to be honest about creating an environment  where individuals have an opportunity to emerge from poverty  conditions, there must be access to nutritious food.   SNAP is a critical component to providing food security to lower- income Americans.   SNAP sets children up for success.   Children on SNAP achieve higher test scores and are more likely to  graduate from high school, helping to break the cycle of poverty and  build a stronger economy in the long term.   SNAP is temporary.   The average family spends just ten months on SNAP, receiving  assistance only during difficult times.   (SNAP is critical for poor and working families.   Most participate in SNAP when they are between jobs.   Among households with at least one working-age non-disabled adult  roughly 8o percent of SNAP households work in the year before or the  year after receiving SNAP.   Close to two-thirds of SNAP recipients are children, elderly, or  disabled.   The vast majority of those who are required to work, do work.   The average per person benefit is $132 per month, or about$1.60 per  meal.   Mr. Speaker, if this bill were to become law, it would cut $23  billion from SNAP and would kick one million households off the  program.   That means 83,000 Texas families would see their benefits cut,  impacting more than 96,000 individuals.   In Texas, over half of all SNAP beneficiaries live below the poverty  line so cutting access to SNAP would be devastating.   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we not increase food security for  the least vulnerable among us.  [[Page H4161]]    If our children are not adequately and safely housed, they are not  protected from life's crueler elements.   If they are not fed, they lack nourishment and preparation for school  and all its challenges.   Mothers know this and their children know this.   Everyone knows this, with the apparent exception of the President and  House Republicans.   The House Republicans' eagerness to sacrifice poor and working  families and children by cutting SNAP and other food assistance  programs for up to 23 million people by $23 billion is an accurate  reflection of their priorities and values, which favor tax cuts for  multinational corporation and the top 1 percent at the expense of the  poor and working class and those striving to enter the middle class.   Mr. Speaker, there are other major insults, injuries, and cruelties  inflicted on working families by this callous legislation.   This so-called Farm Bill changes SNAP from a food program to a work  program by imposing new draconian work requirements on adult SNAP  participants between 18 and 59 years old, requiring documentation  showing 20 hours per week of work or participation in a job training  program.   The changes include severe, harsh penalties if the paperwork is not  filed on time, ignoring the reality of low-wage work, which is plagued  by unstable, uncertain work schedules, unpredictable hours, and few  benefits like paid sick or family leave.   This mean-spirited legislation threatens free school meals for  265,000 children and SNAP eligibility for 400,000 households by  eliminating Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE), which allows  states flexibility to link their social service programs to SNAP.   The bill also severs the connection between SNAP and Low Income Home  Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps families pay their  energy utilities, adversely impacting working families and people with  disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, this wretched legislation is an equal-opportunity  catastrophe because it also inflicts serious damage on farm families  and rural America at a time of great challenge and economic  uncertainty.   Farm prices are plummeting amid the self-inflicted damage of  President Trump's tariffs yet this bill instead of providing relief  exacerbates the economic and social pain in rural America by killing  good-paying rural jobs, cutting a gaping hole in the critical farmer  safety net and shifting opportunity away from America's small towns  with cuts to vital rural development, sustainable conservation, and  energy initiatives.   Inexplicably, H.R. 2 fails to address the 52 percent decline in farm  income and eliminates the Conservation Stewardship Program, the  nation's largest working lands conservation program, by merging it with  the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, resulting in $800 million  less for investments in preserving working lands and sustainable farm  practices.   The legislation hurts rural families in several additional ways by:   Failing to increase funding for USDA's trade assistance programs that  help farmers stay globally competitive through initiatives that help to  develop and expand their business in overseas markets;   Abolishing the entire Energy Title, resulting in lost investments in  jobs of the future in renewable energy and biofuels;   Adding onerous fees to rural development guaranteed loans;   Curtailing broadband assistance in remote areas by adding  administrative burdens and fails to boost USDA's telemedicine  initiatives that help combat opioid abuse in rural America;   Underfunding the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program,  which provides funding to organizations that educate, mentor and  provide technical assistance for new and veteran farmers; and   Betraying the next generation of farm and food leaders by failing to  provide mandatory funding for scholarships at 1890 land grant  institutions.   This so-called Farm Bill is so bad in so many ways to so many people  that it is little wonder that it is strongly opposed by leading  organizations and associations from all sides of the political  spectrum, including: National Farmers Union, National Sustainable  Agriculture Coalition, Environmental Working Group, National Young  Farmers Coalition, Union of Concerned Scientists, Agriculture Energy  Coalition, American Biogas Association, Institute for Agriculture &  Trade Policy, AARP, American Academy of Pediatrics, AFSCME, Alliance  for Retired Americans, American Psychological Association, Center for  Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Child Care Aware of America, Child  Welfare League of America, Children's Defense Fund, Coalition on Human  Needs, Every Child Matters, Families USA, Feeding America, First Focus  Campaign for Children, Food Research & Action Center, Hispanic  Federation, Lutheran Services in America, MAZON: A Jewish Response to  Hunger, Meals on Wheels America, MomsRising, NAACP, National Consumers  League, National Council on Aging, National Employment Law Project,  National PTA, National Urban League, National Women's Law Center, NOW,  Partnership for America's Children, Sargent Shriver National Center on  Poverty Law, SEIU, Share Our Strength, UnidosUS, YWCA USA, Heritage  Foundation, R Street Institute, and Taxpayers for Common Sense.   I urge all Members to join me in voting to reject the rule and this  cruel, heartless legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows            An amendment to H. Res. 900 offered by Mr. McGovern         On p. 2, line 2, insert ``The amendment specified in       section 2 of this resolution shall be considered as adopted       in the House and in the Committee of the Whole.'' after       ``purposes.''        At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        ``Sec. 2. The amendment referred to in the first section of       this resolution is as follows:        `Add at the end the following:              Subtitle H Protections From Retaliatory Tariffs       SEC. 11801. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not take       effect until the President transmits a certification to       Congress that the following Administration efforts will not       result in adverse trade or tariff impacts against U.S.       farmers, ranchers, and other agriculture producers:        (1) the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade       Agreement;        (2) the application of tariffs and/or quotas on steel and       aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act       of 1962;        (3) any enforcement action taken pursuant to the       investigation into China's acts, policies, and practices       related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and       innovation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974; and        (4) the application of global safeguard tariffs on imports       of large residential washing machines and solar cells and       modules under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974.''                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What it Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule....When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools  [[Page H4162]]       for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and       allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer       an alternative plan.     Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts for yielding.   Let me very quickly say that my first statement is my opposition to  this bill. I can't imagine the cut of $23 billion out of our food  nutrition program, nor can I understand the breaching of the  relationship between our support for farmers and our support for poor  people.   I appreciate my good friend, Mr. Faso, but I have to stand in strong  opposition to his amendment which would authorize States to privatize  and contract out program eligibility and other administrative  functions.   Mr. Chair, I come from Texas. We tried it. It was an enormous drain  on the budget. It didn't work. It was costly. People lost their  benefits. It is a terrible idea because removing SNAP's merit staffing  requirement would prioritize profit, disrupt access to food assistance,  and export good jobs.   The SNAP merit system ensures that an employee's core mission  objective is to effectively implement program rules unhindered by  private interests or profit motives. Many SNAP clients, including the  elderly and disabled, have complex cases that require trained  professional civil service workers to dedicate significant time.   When these functions are turned over to for-profit companies, there  is a different priority, Mr. Chairman. They focus on the bottom line  rather than providing comprehensive support. Your constituents of this  program are the elderly and children and disabled. In the early 2000s,  Texas transferred most of the operational aspects of its eligibility  determination system to a private contractor with disastrous results.  Services deteriorated as backlogs and other inefficiencies increased.  There were 127,000 children who were dropped from health insurance. I  am opposed to this legislation. Let's do what is right, Mr. Chairman,  for the children.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to Amendment No. 13 offered by  the gentleman from New York, Congressman Faso, which would authorize  states to privatize and contract out program eligibility and other  administrative functions.   This is a terrible idea because removing SNAP's merit staffing  requirement would prioritize profit, disrupt access to food assistance,  and export good jobs.   SNAP's merit system ensures that an employee's core mission objective  is to effectively implement program rules unhindered by private  interests or profit motives.   Many SNAP clients, including the elderly and disabled, have complex  cases that require trained, professional civil service workers to  dedicate significant time to appropriately screen and verify their  information and ensure they receive the correct benefit levels.   When these functions are turned over to for-profit companies, they  focus on the bottom line rather than providing comprehensive support to  the needy.   This is what we saw in Texas when the state experimented with  privatization.   In the early 2000's Texas transferred most of the operational aspects  of its eligibility determination system to a private contractor with  disastrous results.   Services deteriorated as backlogs and other inefficiencies increased.   The contractor's monthly abandoned call rate was four times higher  than what was called for in the contract; more than 127,000 children  were dropped from health insurance between December 2005 and April  2006; and thousands of experienced state employees were laid off or  quit and replaced by poorly trained, low-paid vendor employees.   Former Texas Comptroller, Carole Keeton Strayhorn, after conducting  an audit of the system, stated that the ``project has failed the state  and the citizens it was designed to serve'' and called the  privatization effort a ``perfect story of wasted tax dollars, reduced  access to services and profiteering at taxpayers' expense.''   Additionally, the Faso Amendment puts at risk good local jobs that  likely could be exported out of the area or overseas.   In many areas, including rural regions, civil service jobs offer some  of the best-paying, most stable employment for local workers.   Privatizing core SNAP functions would mean many of these jobs would  be moved to other locations, including overseas.   Diminishing the pool of good jobs with steady hours and benefits  could leave many out of work or with less stable options, hurting local  economies.   An added danger of privatization is that it could compromise the  security of participants' data.   SNAP collects detailed information about applicants and participants,  including social security numbers, household composition, and income  and employment information.   Handing private data of millions of individuals over to private  companies raises serious concerns about their ability to keep it secure  and their interests in using it for other purposes.   Shifting core SNAP functions to private workers could disrupt timely  and accurate provision of benefits.   During the early 2000's, Texas experimented with privatizing key  pieces of the eligibility process, including accepting applications,  advising clients on program requirements and eligibility, and verifying  eligibility.   The results were disastrous.   Thousands were unable to apply or were given misinformation and many  received incorrect benefit allotments.   Individuals' private information was released, compromising their  security.   And taxpayer dollars were wasted--none of the promises of improved  performance or cost-savings were realized.   I urge all Members to join me in voting no to Amendment No. 13.
