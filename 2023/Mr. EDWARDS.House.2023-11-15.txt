 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Polk  County High School volleyball team for winning the 1-A volleyball State  championship for the first time in the school's history.   The Polk County Wolverines won last Saturday's championship game in a  3-0 win against Falls Lake Academy.   Outside hitter Sophia Overholt, who averaged nearly three kills per  set, was named MVP of the State finals.   While the Wolverines have no shortage of impressive individual  players, their strong bond as a team led them to this historic victory.   As Michael Jordan, another great North Carolinian, once said:  ``Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins  championships.''   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the Wolverines. I wish them all the  best in their future endeavors, and I encourage them to continue to  strive for excellence on and off the court.   They have made western North Carolina proud.                            ____________________
