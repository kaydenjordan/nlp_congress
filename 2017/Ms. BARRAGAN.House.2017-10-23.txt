 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3551, the C-TPAT  Reauthorization Act of 2017.   H.R. 3551 reauthorizes, for the first time in 11 years, the Customs- Trade Partnership Against Terrorism Program, also known as C-TPAT.   C-TPAT is a voluntary public-private sector partnership program where  CBP works with the trade community to provide high-level cargo security  through close cooperation with the principal stakeholders of the  international supply chain, such as importers, carriers, consolidators,  licensed customs brokers, and manufacturers.   Today, more than 11,400 certified partners spanning the gamut of the  trade community have been accepted into the program. CBP pre-vets and  certifies C-TPAT partners they consider to be low risk in exchange for  benefits, such as fewer examinations and access to expedited or  dedicated lanes.   This bill incorporates Democratic amendments, including one of my own  that establishes a standard system for C-TPAT partners to report  suspicious activity instead of the patchwork system that exists now.   Another important amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. Correa, was  adopted in committee to ensure that when CBP changes up the rules and  security criteria for C-TPAT, stakeholders are given adequate notice to  comply.   Furthermore, I would like to thank the majority for working with us  to recognize that suspension and expulsion from the C-TPAT program has  serious economic and repudiation ramifications for companies. The  majority agreed to include Democratic language supported by the Border  Trade Alliance and other stakeholders that urges CBP not to publish  suspended C-TPAT participants, as is the current practice, until  appeals and complete due process is carried out. We found some cases  where companies were reinstated in the appeals process, but since they  were tagged as a suspended company by CBP in the Federal Register,  their business suffered. This language would prevent that from  reoccurring.  [[Page H8056]]    Mr. Speaker, at a time when U.S. ports, like the Port of Los Angeles  in my district, are experiencing CBP staffing shortages, the C-TPAT  program helps the supply chain be more efficient and safe. I support  the program's reauthorization.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3551 is an important piece of legislation that has  strong support on both sides of the aisle and a broad range of  stakeholders.   C-TPAT offers importers and other partners a win-win situation where  they voluntarily allow CBP to prescreen them in exchange for benefits,  such as shorter wait times and dedicated services. The more we know  about our supply chain, the safer we will be.   C-TPAT is a big way we stay informed. As such, I encourage my  colleagues to support H.R. 3551, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 504, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation,  APEC, Business Travel Cards Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, the APEC Business Travel Cards Act permanently  reauthorizes the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Card  Program. This trusted-traveler program provides access to fast-track  immigration lanes in airports for travelers who conduct verified  business in the APEC region. APEC is a forum for 21 Pacific Rim  countries, including the U.S. and Australia, to support sustainable  economic growth and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.   U.S. Customs and Border Protection started issuing cards to eligible  Americans in 2014 after Congress passed the APEC Business Travel Cards  Act in 2011. Today, the program facilitates travel for Americans  working on behalf of 30,000 U.S. businesses. Under that law, the  authority to issue these travel cards to Americans is set to expire on  September 30, 2018.   S. 504, the APEC Business Travel Cards Act of 2017, is supported by a  diverse range of stakeholders, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  the Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers of Commerce, the U.S.  Council for International Business, the U.S. Travel Association, and  the American Hotel and Lodging Association.   On the House Homeland Security Committee, companion legislation to S.  504 was championed by Congresswoman Kathleen Rice of New York. With the  leadership of Miss Rice and others, her bill was passed unanimously by  our committee.   Allowing ABT cards to expire would be a mistake that puts American  businesses at a disadvantage. I urge my House colleagues to support  this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, S. 504 is an important piece of legislation that has  strong support on both sides of the aisle. The ABT Card Program allows  business travelers and government officials with business in APEC  countries to access fast-track processing lanes at APEC airports.   The program saves an estimated 43 minutes per trip, according to U.S.  Customs and Border Patrol, and operates entirely on user fees, costing  taxpayers nothing. Importantly, it preserves authority for the  Department of Homeland Security to revoke or suspend an individual's  card for security reasons at any time.   This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill, and I encourage my colleagues  to support S. 504 to ensure that the bill gets to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2142, the INTERDICT Act of  2017. H.R. 2142, the International Narcotics Trafficking Emergency  Response by Detecting Incoming Contraband with Technology Act, or the  INTERDICT Act, is an important piece of legislation in our ongoing  fight to stop the flow of illicit opioids like fentanyl from places  like China and Mexico.   According to the CDC, the death rate from synthetic opioids, which  includes drugs such as tramadol and fentanyl, increased by 72.2 percent  from 2014 to 2015. In 2016, CBP seized nearly 200 pounds of fentanyl  and other synthetic opioids, primarily from along the southwest border.  This is 25-fold increase over seizures from the previous year.   The INTERDICT Act before us today ensures that CBP will have the  necessary tools to better combat the flow of these opioids. More  specifically, this bill provides CBP high-tech chemical screening  devices to help detect and interdict fentanyl and other illicit  synthetic opioids. Additionally, the bill provides for the laboratory  equipment, facilities, and personnel for support during all operational  hours.   This bill was passed by our committee unanimously, and I commend the  sponsors of this bill, the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas)  and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), for their  leadership on this issue.   I urge my colleagues to supports this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, H.R.  2142 is an important piece of legislation that has strong bipartisan  support. Passage of this bill will go a long way in our fight against  opiates. As such, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2142.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Los  Angeles Dodgers for winning the National League Champion Series. They  will appear in the World Series for the first time in 29 years. I hope  they win it all.   Earlier this year, I had the honor of wearing the Dodgers uniform to  the Congressional Baseball Game. I am a huge fan, and we Angelinos love  our Dodgers.   When I was a kid, as my father battled Parkinson's disease, we  watched every game together. It was our bonding time.   As we watch the game this week, may every kid enjoy our national  pastime with a loved one--in person or in spirit.   Go Dodgers.                            ____________________
