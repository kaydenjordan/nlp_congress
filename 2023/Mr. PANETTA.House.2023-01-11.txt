 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the heroism of  Paul Bandy; his wife, Aimee Johns; and Heath Braddock.   On a clear summer day last year, Steve Breummer, a triathlete, was  doing his routine swim about 150 yards off the coast in Monterey Bay  when he was attacked by a great white shark. Pulled under water, bitten  across his thigh and abdomen, and bleeding profusely, Steve saw the  cold black eye of that predator, fought him off, and yelled for help.  [[Page H195]]    Paul, a police officer, and Aimee, a nurse, heard the cries and  paddleboarded to the victim. Heath, who was onshore, grabbed a  surfboard and joined in the rescue. Even though there was blood on top  of the water and a shark lurked under the water, all three heroes were  undeterred, got to Steve, got him out of the water, and saved his life.   For their actions, the rescuers have been honored by the Red Cross  and the Carnegie Commission.   Steve, although not yet doing triathlons, is walking and swimming  again.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I honor all of them for the determination to  fight in the face of danger; for their will to act, despite it being to  their detriment; and fulfilling what it means to be a hero in our  community on the central coast and in our country.                            ____________________
