 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1528) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  carry out a study of Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1528         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Transparent       Standards for Corporate Insiders Act''.       SEC. 2. SEC STUDY.         (a) Study.--        (1) In general.--The Securities and Exchange Commission       shall carry out a study of whether Rule 10b5-1 (17 CFR       240.10b5-1) should be amended to--        (A) limit the ability of issuers and issuer insiders to       adopt a plan described under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(3) of       Rule 10b5-1 (``trading plan'') to a time when the issuer or       issuer insider is permitted to buy or sell securities during       issuer-adopted trading windows;        (B) limit the ability of issuers and issuer insiders to       adopt multiple trading plans;        (C) establish a mandatory delay between the adoption of a       trading plan and the execution of the first trade pursuant to       such a plan and, if so and depending on the Commission's       findings with respect to subparagraph (A)--        (i) whether any such delay should be the same for trading       plans adopted during an issuer-adopted trading window as       opposed to outside of such a window; and        (ii) whether any exceptions to such a delay are       appropriate;        (D) limit the frequency that issuers and issuer insiders       may modify or cancel trading plans;        (E) require issuers and issuer insiders to file with the       Commission trading plan adoptions, amendments, terminations       and transactions; or        (F) require boards of issuers that have adopted a trading       plan to--        (i) adopt policies covering trading plan practices;        (ii) periodically monitor trading plan transactions; and        (iii) ensure that issuer policies discuss trading plan use       in the context of guidelines or requirements on equity       hedging, holding, and ownership.        (2) Additional considerations.--In carrying out the study       required under paragraph (1), the Commission shall consider--  [[Page H1914]]         (A) how any such amendments may clarify and enhance       existing prohibitions against insider trading;        (B) the impact any such amendments may have on the ability       of issuers to attract persons to become an issuer insider;        (C) the impact any such amendments may have on capital       formation;        (D) the impact any such amendments may have on an issuer's       willingness to operate as a public company; and        (E) any other consideration that the Commission considers       necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors.        (b) Report.--Not later than the end of the 1-year period       beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Commission shall issue a report to the Committee on Financial       Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate containing       all findings and determinations made in carrying out the       study required under section (a).        (c) Rulemaking.--After the completion of the study required       under subsection (a), the Commission shall, subject to public       notice and comment, revise Rule 10b5-1 consistent with the       results of such study.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1528, the Promoting Transparent Standards for  Corporate Insiders Act, is a bill introduced by Chairwoman Maxine  Waters for several Congresses to strengthen confidence in our capital  markets by ensuring everyone plays by the same rules.   This bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the last  Congress and is designed to promote strong enforcement against  financial fraud by ensuring corporate executives cannot indirectly or  illegally trade on material nonpublic information they know about their  companies.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, prohibits insider  trading as a fraud that hurts investors as well as the integrity of our  capital markets. Those accused of illegal insider trading sometimes  defend themselves using the SEC's rule for trading plans and claim any  trades that occurred while they possessed inside information were made  pursuant to a preapproved trading plan. But the rule for trading plans  has several shortcomings and loopholes that may allow corporate  insiders to get away with insider trading.   This bill would require the SEC to study whether to amend its rule  for trading plans to limit the ability of corporate insiders to, for  example, adopt multiple overlapping plans or change their plans to  indirectly take advantage of inside information. This bill would then  require the SEC to report to Congress and revise its rules based on the  results of the study.   This bill is needed to protect confidence in our markets. For  example, last year, we saw numerous pharmaceutical executives profiting  from conveniently timed announcements regarding the companies' progress  toward a COVID-19 vaccine.   For instance, shortly after Moderna announced positive results for  its vaccine, the pharmaceutical company's CEO altered his trading plan  to increase the number of shares sold through the plan. Shortly  thereafter, he sold shares for millions of dollars in profit.   Similarly, on the same day Pfizer announced positive data regarding  its vaccine, Pfizer's CEO sold more than $5 million worth of shares as  part of his trading plan.   This bill is supported by investor and consumer advocates, public  pension funds, and State securities regulators, including the  California Public Employees' Retirement System, the Council of  Institutional Investors, and the North American Securities  Administrators Association.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1528, which  will help prevent corporate insiders from using inside information to  rig the game in their favor at the expense of investors and the  integrity of our markets.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1996) to create protections for financial institutions that  provide financial services to cannabis-related legitimate businesses  and service providers for such businesses, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1996         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--        (1) the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law       115-334) legalized hemp by removing it from the definition of       ``marihuana'' under the Controlled Substances Act;        (2) despite the legalization of hemp, some hemp businesses       (including producers, manufacturers, and retailers) continue       to have difficulty gaining access to banking products and       services; and        (3) businesses involved in the sale of hemp-derived CBD       products are particularly affected, due to confusion about       the legal status of such products.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1996.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud we are here today to pass this bill about  public safety, accountability, and respecting States' rights. Forty- seven States, four U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia have  spoken and legalized some form of recreational or medical cannabis,  including CBD products. 318 million people live in those 47 States.  That is 97.7 percent of the population of America.   However, because cannabis remains illegal under Federal law, the  Controlled Substance Act, businesses in these States are forced to deal  in cash; and the businesses, their employees, and ancillary businesses  can't access the banking system.   The fact is that the people in States and localities across the  country are voting to approve some level of cannabis use, and we need  these cannabis businesses and employees to have access to checking  accounts, payroll accounts, lines of credit, credit cards, and more.  This will improve transparency and accountability and help law  enforcement root out illegal transactions to prevent tax evasion, money  laundering, and other white-collar crime.   Most importantly, this will reduce the risk of violent crime in our  communities. These businesses and their employees become targets for  crime, robbery, assault, and more by dealing in all cash, and this puts  the employees and the store owners at risk.   Over the last year in Oregon alone, a string of more than 100  robberies and burglaries at cannabis businesses culminated in a murder  when Michael Arthur, a dispensary employee, was shot to death during a  robbery.   Just last week in Colorado, an innocent bystander was shot during an  attempted break-in at a medical cannabis business. And in Colorado, we  are always reminded of Travis Mason, the young father and Marine Corps  vet, who was murdered while working as a security guard for a cannabis  business.   We must do better for these employees, their families, and all our  communities.   The SAFE Banking Act will create a safe harbor for financial  institutions and their employees who choose to do business with a  cannabis company. Section 3 of the bill is particularly important to  not only cannabis businesses, but everyone who might do business with a  cannabis-related company. This section would protect ancillary  businesses, like real estate owners, accountants, electricians, and  vendors, by clarifying the proceeds from legitimate cannabis businesses  are not unlawful under Federal laws. This proceeds section is the key  provision allowing all cannabis-related businesses and their service  providers and landlords to access the banking system without fear of  reprisal.   This bill now has 177 bipartisan cosponsors, and one-third of the  Senate is cosponsoring the companion bill from Senators Merkley and  Daines.   Last Congress, the SAFE Banking Act passed the House 321-103, with  the support of 91 Republicans. The broad base of support for this  legislation generated a diverse group of cosponsors and endorsing  organizations from banking, credit union, and insurance trade  associations to labor unions, cannabis businesses and advocates, and  State government leaders.   There are, obviously, many more marijuana issues we need to address  working together, including additional research, tax issues, and  criminal justice reforms. Passing this bill will show that Congress can  work together in a bipartisan way to address outdated marijuana laws. I  hope this bill is an icebreaker for the House to take up other reforms  and finally remove the conflict between State and Federal laws.   In summary, even if you are opposed to the legalization of cannabis,  you should support this bill. American voters have spoken and continue  to speak, and the fact is that you can't put the genie back in the  bottle. Prohibition is over. The SAFE Banking Act is focused solely on  taking cash off the streets and making our communities safer, and only  Congress can take these steps to provide this certainty for businesses,  employees, and financial institutions across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Velazquez, Stivers, Davidson,  Joyce, Correa, and Blumenauer for their partnership on this bill and  their commitment to making our communities safer. I also thank  Representatives Luetkemeyer, Barr, and Porter for their contributions  to the text of this bill and their support. Finally, I thank Chairwoman  Maxine Waters for her support over the years and for continuing to make  this a priority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the  SAFE Banking Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North  Carolina for his many compliments. I would just remind him, we are the  Financial Services Committee. We have a certain amount of jurisdiction  that deals with financial institutions and financial services, and that  is what this bill is focused on, dealing with so much cash generated by  this industry, whether we do anything or not, and to try to advance  public safety in the process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez), the chair of the Small Business Committee, who had a lot to  do with writing the Small Business piece of this.    Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank Mr. Stivers  for working with me so much over the last few years on this. I am going  to miss him as he chooses to take another path in the near future. I  just want to say on the floor, that he is a real credit to this  institution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  his work on this bill and his input on the card processing piece of the  legislation.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). He  has put the effort together across a whole range of cannabis issues. I  thank him for his steadfast work on this subject.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these  endorsements for the SAFE Banking Act, including from the American  Bankers Association, the American Council of Independent Laboratories,  the American Council of Life Insurers, the American Financial Services  Association, the American Land Title Association, the American Property  Casualty Insurance Association, the American Trade Association for  Cannabis and Hemp, the Arizona Dispensaries Association, the California  Cannabis Industry Association, and the National Armored Car  Association. It goes on forever. I am not going to list all of these.  There are about 50 different endorsements.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North  Carolina. To his point that there is a broader discussion that has to  take place, the purpose of this bill is a public safety purpose. Its  purpose is to keep people from being killed, from being robbed, and  from being assaulted. That is within the Financial Services Committee  arena because, at this point, the cannabis industry and the people who  serve it in one way or another have to deal in cash, which really  creates the  [[Page H1924]]  potential for the robberies, for the murders, and for the assaults.   We have been able to gather a lot of support for this. I mentioned  the bankers, the credit unions, the insurance industry, the cannabis  industry, obviously, the real estate industry, the armored cars, and  the minority cannabis industry. Law enforcement is supportive of this.  We have the National Treasurers Association, 21 Governors, and  attorneys general because they know this is a public safety matter and  that we really need to address it.   We have been working on it for some time, as the gentleman from North  Carolina mentioned, but we need to get this to the Senate. They need to  take whatever action they want to take, but we have to make our  communities and these businesses safer.   The SAFE Banking Act is about public safety. Our bill is narrowly  tailored to get cash off the streets and improve public safety.   I thank my lead cosponsors on this bill, Representatives Velazquez,  Stivers, and Davidson, and all of my colleagues who have listened to me  talk about the need to address this problem for the last 8 years.                                time  1700    I also thank the staff of the Committee on Financial Services, the  staff from my lead cosponsors, and my own staff, who put so much time  into this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the SAFE  Banking Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1602) to direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and  the Securities and Exchange Commission to jointly establish a digital  asset working group, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1602, the Eliminate Barriers  to Innovation Act of 2021.   Digital assets are a fast-growing but poorly understood area of  finance and technology, and I believe this bipartisan legislation will  help Americans, small businesses, fintechs, and financial institutions  using digital assets to better understand the legal and regulatory  landscape.   Last Congress, the Committee on Financial Services established the  Task Force on Financial Technology, which was chaired by Congressman  Lynch, who is co-leading this bipartisan bill with Ranking Member  McHenry. I thank both of them for their hard work on this legislation.   We must look carefully and diligently at how digital asset markets  are used, as they present unique challenges to regular retail  investors.   Cryptocurrencies, security tokens, and other digital assets,  including those utilizing blockchain and distributed ledger technology,  are new technologies. How we regulate investment in them will be one of  the most important questions in the financial services space.   If digital assets are used by retail investors, we must ensure these  products provide adequate protections, disclosures, and notifications  to make sure ordinary investors are not defrauded or have their  household finances ruined due to excessive volatility.   This is especially important during this unprecedented COVID-19  crisis, with many people struggling financially and possibly drawn to  risky investments or scams.   This bill would require the Securities and Exchange Commission and  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish a working group  on digital assets. The working group will investigate the legal and  regulatory framework and best practices related to digital assets. The  working group will report to Congress on its findings to help this body  and the public better address these evolving markets.   I thank Representative Lynch and Representative McHenry for their  thoughtful and bipartisan approach to this legislation, and I look  forward to the work of the SEC and the CFTC on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).    Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman will forgive me,  but I listed a lot of people on the SAFE Banking Act that I want to  thank. One person who I forgot, and I would be remiss, is Mr. Denny  Heck, who is now Lieutenant Governor of Washington and who was also  instrumental in putting that together.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. McHenry and Mr. Lynch for their bipartisan  work on this legislation directing the SEC and the CFTC to work  together with all relevant stakeholders to study the use of digital  assets.   The working group created by this legislation will, undoubtedly,  benefit the American public on this important topic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation by voting  ``yes'' on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H1927]]
