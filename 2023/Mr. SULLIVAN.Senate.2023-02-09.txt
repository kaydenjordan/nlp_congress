 Mr. President, I want to thank my good friend from the  great State of Mississippi, who has been a fantastic leader on the  Armed Services Committee, a fantastic leader on so many of these  important national security topics. He and I share a very strong,  similar, identical view on the importance of Taiwan, and we all need to  be doing that. So I want to thank my good friend Senator Wicker from  Mississippi for his leadership on this and so many other issues.                                Willow Project    Mr. President, I also want to thank my good friend from Alaska,  Senator Murkowski, who was just on the floor of the U.S. Senate talking  about the importance of the Willow Project not just to Alaska but to  America. She and I are going to be down here on the floor a lot in the  next several weeks. I was here last week talking about this project.   Now, for those of you who haven't watched, a quick recap of the  Willow Project: a very large-scale oil and gas project in the National  Petroleum Reserve of Alaska, so not a controversial area at all. It is  not like ANWR or some of the other areas in our State.  [[Page S285]]    NPRA, as we call it in Alaska, was set aside by the Federal  Government decades ago for oil and gas development because we need oil  and gas. We need it. Some people out there don't think we do, but we  do. And if we need it, we should do it in America.   Just a quick, little summary of some of the key aspects of this:  2,500 jobs to build this. It is ready to build tomorrow. We have  permission. It is completely shovel-ready. Seventy-five percent of  those jobs will be union jobs, building trades jobs. It is one of the  top priorities of unions. I will talk about that. Peak production:  Almost 200,000 barrels a day--highest environmental standards in the  world, by far; lowest greenhouse gas emissions of a major energy  project in the world, by far; billions in revenues from the Federal  Government, from State government, for local governments in Alaska, and  broad-base support from every group in Alaska you can imagine.   So that is the Willow Project. We got the final EIS last week. And  the Biden administration is still kind of saying: Maybe we are going to  narrow this so much that we are going to kill it.   I am going to talk about that. That would be unbelievable. I have  tried to work with this administration and, certainly, Senator  Murkowski has. We have made this the No. 1 issue from the Alaska  delegation ever since Joe Biden stepped into office on day one.   I personally raised this with the President, every Cabinet official.  Willow is No. 1. If you want cooperation from the Alaska delegation,  you have to work with us. We are there. We are almost there. But I want  to talk about some of what happened last week because our good friends  in the media, who love to write about this story, Willow, because they  hate the project, they are biased in the project. So when the EIS came  out last week, if you read the national media--which there was a lot  of--guess who they quote. Guess who they quote. Do you think they quote  the Alaskans who want it? The Native people? The indigenous people in  my State who really want it? The unions? No. No, no, no. Our friends in  the national media never quote them. They quote Greenpeace, Center for  Biological Diversity. Who are the other radical groups? Earthjustice.  All the far left radical groups--none of whom live in Alaska, by the  way--they get fully quoted: Climate Bomb--all this crazy stuff. It is  not scientific-based at all. But they don't quote people, in my view,  who really, really matter--who really, really matter; particularly the  Native people.   You want to talk about racial justice; you want to talk about  environmental justice; you want to talk about racial equity--buzz words  the Biden administration uses all the time. The media does too. But  somehow they always leave out the indigenous people of my State.   It is wrong. It is wrong. Media is wrong. The Biden administration is  wrong. I am going to go into this in a big way. But I just want to make  one final point. When people talk about the science--the Democrats, we  are the party of science--what happened last week was the final EIS  came out, and that was the career staff at the Federal Agencies who  came out with this final environmental impact statement. It wasn't  great. It limited this project from five pads, which is where the Trump  administration--their record of decision--concluded based on science  that you can do this in an environmentally sensitive way. The Biden  administration came out and said: No, we are going to move it to three  pads. All right. That is the career staff. We can live with that.   The private sector company, ConocoPhillips, can live with that. The  Native people can live with that. We have 30 days. If you are an  American who cares about energy security, national security, weigh in  with BLM.gov, the Department of the Interior. Say: We have got to get  the Willow Project going.   If this gets limited beyond that, it is pure politics--pure politics.  The Democrats, party of science--OK, prove it. If this gets limited  more, it will kill the project. We know every far-left environmental  group in the country--just read the paper--last week, they said, we are  out to kill this thing. If this gets killed, it will be pure politics  by Joe Biden, John Podesta--the whole group in the White House.   So the Native people are very upset in my State because  overwhelmingly they support this. Every major Native Alaskan group in  the country supports this. And they can't get one quote in the  newspaper. The Washington Post--forget it. They won't quote a Native  Alaskan who supports it. They find the one who is against it and quote  her. But the vast majority support it. This is the voice of the Arctic  Inupiat. They put this statement out a couple of weeks ago. I am just  going to read it again.   ``Outside activists groups''--that is the ones that always get quoted  in the newspaper. You know the ones: Center for Biological Diversity,  Greenpeace, Earthjustice. By the way, Center for American Progress-- interesting about them--they are really against it.   Now, why is that so interesting? That was started by John Podesta.  Until recently, he was the leader of it. They put statements out  against Willow all the time. Now, he is in charge of making a decision  on whether Willow should go forward. Is that fair? Boy, I hope he is  being objective. Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot. I wouldn't  even want to describe what that would look like.   So all these groups, they are always against it. But here are the  Native people who want it. I will explain for a minute why they want  it. So they said:         Outside activist groups opposing Willow have drowned out--    Certainly in the media--         [o]ur local perspectives and are actively working to       supersede the views of the Alaska Native people.    True. By the way, the media--sorry, guys, but you are helping them in  a great way to cancel the voices of the Native people.         This is not environmental justice or any other kind of       justice.    It certainly is not racial equity. It is racial cancelization. I am  continuing.         It is a direct attack on Alaska Native self-determination.    So that is going on right now. And it is very frustrating. It is very  frustrating because the voices of some amazing people in my State--the  indigenous people of Alaska--are being canceled and drowned out. And  our national media has no problem quoting in every story the far-left  radical enviros who want to shut down every energy project in America,  and they won't quote these great people.   So why do they care about this project so much? Well, it is jobs. It  is energy. It is revenues. But you know what? It is even bigger than  that. Here is why they care.   I break out this chart a lot. I am going to explain it here. This is  a chart from the American Medical Association. And what it does, it  looks at the changes and life expectancy in America from 1980 to 2014,  a 25-year period. Now, look, we are all Americans. We want progress.  Where you see anywhere kind of yellow and then green and then blue and  then dark blue and purple, that is good in our country. That means  people's life expectancy is increasing. We all want that. We all want  that.    Now, unfortunately, you see like orange and red--a couple of spots in  America, orange, red--that is actually American life expectancies in  the last 25 years decreasing. Nobody wants that.   This is another topic, but that is primarily parts of the country  that were hit really hard by the opioid epidemic. We have to work  together and improve it. We don't want to see any orange or red here.  Nobody wants an American's life expectancy to decrease. That is bad.   But here is my broader commitment. What part of America had the  biggest life expectancy increase from 1980 to 2014? Increase. My  State--the great State of Alaska. If you look at this map, life  expectancy--particularly in the rural areas, the Native areas, Native  villages, Aleutian Islands chain, parts of the southeast--life  expectancy went up 5, 6, 7--up to 13 years--13 years. The highest in  the country. That is great. That is great.   As I have said to many folks when we have been debating these issues  here on the Senate floor, give me one indicator of policy success more  important than are your citizens living longer. I have never heard  anyone come back to me and say: Here is something more important, Dan.  I don't think there is.   So from 1980 to 2014, there are big swaths of Alaska where the life  expectancy went like this. It is great. We  [[Page S286]]  should all celebrate that. Why did that happen? Why did that happen? I  will tell you why it happened. We had major resource development here.  We have Prudhoe Bay--the development of Prudhoe Bay--the biggest oil  and gas field in North America, other oil and gas fields. They had the  development of the Aleutian Islands chain with the Magnuson-Stevens Act  for resource development on fisheries. That is a huge legislative  change. You had mining. You had resource development, which was jobs  and revenues. And all of a sudden, these communities were able to get  things like clinics and flushed toilets and running water and  gymnasiums--things that in the lower 48, in New Jersey, or other  places, you just take for granted. We didn't have them there.   And because we had jobs and resource development in an economy, you  started having that, and you have people living longer.   So I think you are hopefully seeing the point. This Willow Project is  a matter of life and death for my constituents. And that is why almost  everybody--the Alaska Federation Native, every Native group, every  group in Alaska--they are all for it. And that is why we get really mad  and frustrated--I saw Senator Murkowski down here a couple of minutes  ago, and she was frustrated--when the big Washington Post and New York  Times write their left-leaning, anti-Willows, and they have no idea  what they are writing about.   This is a matter of life and death, and they are canceling the voices  of the people I represent, particularly the Native people. That has to  change. That has to change.   You know who else supports this? I had the great honor of giving my  annual speech to the Alaska legislature 2 days ago in Juneau, AK. It is  something Senator Murkowski and I do every year. It is a huge honor. I  made the pitch on Willow to all the State senators, State  representatives. And I am pretty sure we are going to get a unanimous  joint resolution from the house and senate, Alaska State Legislature,  saying how important this project is and how everybody in elected  office in my State supports it. That is very unusual. In any State, you  would have outliers. I am pretty sure we are going to get something  unanimous.   Why are we doing that? Again, to not just show the media but the  Biden administration and the Congress that this issue unifies Alaskans.  And we should be respected for this. We should be respected.   So the Native people of Alaska are very strongly supportive. They get  canceled. You even have a couple of real clueless Congressmen on the  other side of the Congress last week coming out saying Alaskans don't  want the Willow Project, the Native people don't. I mean, these guys  are clueless. I forget their names--some guy from Arizona--but they are  wrong.   I am going to make another point, which is maybe even more  frustrating. The media doesn't want to hear from the Native voice. Do  you know who else doesn't want to hear? The Biden administration  themselves--the Biden administration themselves. I can't tell you how  many times I have heard the President, Cabinet officials, the Vice  President talk about racial equity, racial justice, environmental  justice all the time.   Last night, I was with a remarkable gathering of Alaskan Native  people. This was a trilateral gathering from the people on the North  Slope where this Willow Project is going to take place--right here. I  call it a trilateral gathering because it was the leaders--dozens of  them--flew 5,000 miles from here--Utqiagvik, the top of the world, by  the way--they flew 5,000 miles to Washington, DC. We all met last  night: Senator Murkowski, Congresswoman Peltola. And it is the  trilateral group because it is the Tribe, what I call Inupiaq Community  of the Arctic Slope. This is a regionally, federally recognized Tribe  of Inupiat people, their leadership. That was one part of this  trilateral group.    The second part was the regional borough--like a county. That is  right here, the North Slope Borough. By the way, it is bigger than  Montana. That is the size I am talking about. These are elected  officials--city council, the mayor. They are all Inupiat indigenous  people. That is the second part.   The third part is the Alaska Native Regional Corporation called  Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Remember, it was created by  Congress. It is an economic engine. It has Tribal and heritage  components.   So it was the leaders of all these three organizations, the Tribe,  the borough, and the Regional Alaska Native Corporation--all their  leadership. I have known these people for a long time. They are  amazing, incredible Americans. You would love them.   A couple dozen of them flew from right here, from Barrow, to  Washington, DC. They wanted a meeting with the Secretary of the  Interior, Deb Haaland. They wanted a meeting with her. They didn't get  the meeting. You would think: Geez, it is pretty important. Do you want  to hear the voice of the Native people? Do you want to talk about  racial equity, racial justice, environmental justice? These people just  flew 5,000 miles to Washington, DC. The Secretary doesn't have time to  meet with them. That is not very respectful. They are all supportive,  by the way--the Tribe--they are all supportive of the Willow Project.   But here is the thing. It wasn't just this week. This group of Alaska  Natives, the trilateral group, some of the most important people in my  State, have tried at least five different times to meet with the  Secretary of the Interior. They have flown 5,000 miles to Washington,  DC, to get one damn meeting with the Secretary of the Interior. Do you  know what? Her office has said no every single time. Environmental  justice, racial equity, respect for the Native people--come on. It is a  bunch of baloney--five times at least. The only time Deb Haaland has  ever given these people an audience was when she was up there for about  20 minutes.   It is shocking. She is canceling the voices of the Native people of  Alaska who want this project. They flew 5,000 miles--this trilateral  group, the Tribe, the borough, the ANC. Nope, the Secretary is too  busy. Nope, the Secretary is too busy last time and last time and last  time. At least five different times they tried to meet with her. She  won't listen. That is what I call cancellation.   Media, you are welcome to write that. You won't, of course.   I guarantee you that in that time, she has probably met with  representatives from some of these far-left radical groups--probably  dozens of times--but she won't do it.   You want to hear some real irony? As I mentioned last week, the  scientists came out from the Federal Agencies and said: Here is the  final environmental impact. It was very long, very detailed, very data- filled scientific studies.   Remember, the normal course of business in the Federal Government is  once you do an EIS, you have 30 days for the final Record of Decision.  That almost always gets stamped ``approved.'' Rarely, do you have the  Record of Decision 30 days later changing the EIS. What is happening in  America is all these radical lower 48 environmental groups are trying  like crazy to pressure John Podesta and the President of the United  States to change it. That would be pure politics.   The Democrats say they are the party of science. This wouldn't be  science at all. This would be pure, raw political power to appease the  Center for Biological Diversity and completely screw the people I  represent on the North Slope. That would happen.   Here is the real irony. Last week, BLM put out this EIS. It was a  pretty good statement. They narrowed it more. Then, the Department of  the Interior put out a statement. They didn't attribute it to anybody.  Deb Haaland certainly didn't say it was her statement. It was just a  statement from the Department of the Interior saying the Department has  substantial concerns about the Willow Project. Wait a minute. BLM is  part of the Department, and BLM just came out with an EIS saying it was  good. That is weird. It is the preferred alternative in the final EIS,  which BLM just put out, so that is really strange.   And then they said: One of our concerns is direct and indirect  greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect--I don't know what that means. Deb  Haaland doesn't worry about greenhouse gas emissions from New Mexico,  which has increased production in oil and gas in the last 3 years by  700,000 barrels a day. Where is that story, Washington Post?  [[Page S287]]    But they also said they are concerned about the impacts to wildlife  and Alaska Native subsistence. They might change it based on that. But  who are the people who understand impacts to wildlife in Alaska Native  subsistence on the North Slope? Who are they? They are the people I was  with last night. They are the people Deb Haaland refuses to meet with.   So the Department of the Interior was really concerned about  ``impacts to wildlife and Alaska Native subsistence.'' She had 30  Alaska Native leaders in DC yesterday to tell her about it. These are  the whaling captains; these are the hunters; these are the people who  know this issue more than anybody.   Do you know what this is? This is just a ruse, right? If the  Department of the Interior was really worried about impacts to wildlife  and Alaska Native subsistence, don't you think Deb Haaland would at  least have taken one meeting with these great leaders who are the  leaders on Alaska Native subsistence and wildlife?   The North Slope Borough Project has the best wildlife experts in the  world, and the borough was here yesterday--same with ICAS, the Native  Tribe. They were here. It is a little fishy that the Secretary of the  Interior won't meet with these great Alaska Natives. Why? Because they  are going to say: Madam Secretary, respectfully, we really want this  project.    Let me conclude with one other voice that is being ignored, canceled,  whatever you want to talk about on the Willow Project. I like this  picture. I love this picture, actually. It is a very iconic photo of  men and women--actually, it is just all men in that photo. These are  the great Americans who built this country. This is taking a lunch  break while they are building the Empire State Building. I think they  built that in 18 months, 12 months, something incredible like that. The  reason I like this picture is because there has become a theme,  unfortunately. Some of my Democratic colleagues don't like it when I  say this, but there has become a theme that I have seen over the  years--certainly in Alaska and maybe not in the rest of the country-- but I think it is pretty much the rest of the country, and it is this.  My friends in the Democratic Party used to say: We are the party of the  working men and women, men and women who built stuff like the Empire  State Building and build projects like Willow or the Trans-Alaska  Pipeline.   Here is the thing. Whenever the national Democrats--Joe Biden, you  name it--whenever they have a choice, a choice between the radical far- left environmental elites who want to stop stuff and these men and  women who build things, every time--every single time--they go with the  radical elites and sell out the working men and women in America, every  time. Some of my Democratic colleagues don't like it when I say that.  Well, I am sorry, but I think it is truthful.   I will say--and I said it on the floor the other day--I have a lot of  Senate colleagues, Republicans and, in particular, Democrats, and I am  so thankful, who have called and reached out to the White House and  said: Look, you guys, come on, this Willow project makes so much sense.  It has been in permitting for decades. Every environmental review has  passed with flying colors. The President is really going to Saudi  Arabia to get on bended knee to beg for oil? He is really going to  Venezuela to lift sanctions to get oil from them, and we are not  letting Alaskans produce it? That is crazy.   A lot of my Democratic colleagues--I am not going to name them  because they probably don't want to be named--I appreciate you guys  calling the White House to say: Come on, you have to approve this  Willow project.   But here is the thing. Last year, I had what is called a  Congressional Review Act on a permitting issue. The White House,  believe it or not, after the infrastructure bill, which I supported--we  had good permitting reform in it. After the infrastructure bill passed,  the White House put out a rule that would make infrastructure projects  much harder to permit, particularly energy projects.   I brought what is called a Congressional Review Act piece of  legislation to rescind the Biden administration rule so we could build  things more quickly. I am proud to say, a bipartisan group of Senators  supported it. President Biden said he was going to veto the Sullivan  bill if it comes to his desk. All right. Mr. President, that is a bad  idea.   But the reason I am mentioning that now was that was a test because I  had every building trade in America supporting my Congressional Review  Act resolution to rescind the Biden administration's arcane rule that  would make permitting infrastructure projects harder, and the working  men and women said we are supporting the Sullivan Congressional Review  Act. And guess what. It passed. Now, the usual suspects, Center for  Biological Diversity and all the left green groups, were against it.  That was a test.   Whom are you with, the working men and women of America or far-left  elite, radical environmental groups that want to shut it down again?  That is a test. I posed it to my Senate colleagues. The Senate passed  the test. It was bipartisan--not by much, but it was still bipartisan.  Thank you, Joe Manchin.   Here is the thing. Willow is another test. It is not a test for my  colleagues here. If we had a vote on Willow right now, I bet it would  pass well over 60, 65 Senators.   So, again, I thank my Democratic colleagues for helping me. All my  Republican colleagues want it done. They know it is good for Alaska and  really good for America. But here is the thing: Once again, all the big  building trades, all of them are coming out in huge support for the  Willow Project. They are making it--the laborers, the building  tradesmen--they are making it one of their biggest priorities, if not  their biggest priority, for these people. Why? As I mentioned, 2,500  construction jobs--that is the estimate to build this--75 percent of  which will be labor and building trade union jobs.   Here are just a few of the statements from some of these great  Americans--and they are great Americans. I have gotten to know these  labor leaders, the heart and soul of the country.   Here is Terry O'Sullivan, Labors International, LIUNA:         Energy infrastructure, oil and natural gas in particular,       is the largest privately funded job-creating sector for LIUNA       construction workers. The oil and natural gas industry has       provided tens of thousands of jobs, resulting in millions of       work hours for our members. These are quality union jobs with       families supporting wages and benefits. The same is true for       the Willow project.    LIUNA, Terry O'Sullivan, laborer, pro-Willow.   Where is that story, Washington Post, New York Times? You won't write  it. You never write it. You canceled these twice.   These are great Americans.   How about Mark McManus, general president of the Journeymen and  Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Union? Let's see what he  said about Willow:         It is long past time we create good-paying union jobs and       invest in North Slope [Alaska] communities that will benefit       directly from this project in the [NPR-A, as we call it].    NPR-A set aside 7 years ago for oil and gas development. The Willow  Project will help deliver reliable energy to consumers and provide  billions of dollars in economic investments in these communities.   There you go. Pipefitters.   Come on, national media, write that story. Just don't keep quoting  the far-left environmental groups; quote working men and women who  built this Nation.   Who else? James Callahan, president of the operating engineers.  Willow will also put operating engineers to work. Those are his union  members. He is in charge of them. He is another great American, along  with others in the skilled trades. These jobs offer families sustaining  wages and offer strong health and pension benefits. Furthermore,  construction of the Willow Project will provide much needed revenue to  Alaska and the North Slope communities, the Native communities. Another  union leader in America.   Now, look, the President likes to call himself blue-collar Joe and  working Joe and all of that.   Prove it, Mr. President. Prove it.   This is another example of a choice. The only groups in this country  right now who want to shut down the Willow Project are far-left,  radical environmental groups who don't want to build anything, who  don't give a darn about working men and women in America  [[Page S288]]  and certainly don't give a darn about the Native community on the North  Slope.   I really wish our media friends would write this story. The unions  support it; quote them. The Native people support it; quote them, don't  cancel them.   This administration needs to wake up. The American people are getting  tired of this. This is a test. The EIS came out last week. If it is  changed, it will be because of raw political power by far-left  environmental groups who forced the White House to kill this project.   I am just going to end with this. This is just an example. These are  union members. These are broad-based groups of Alaska Native  organizations. These are just economic groups in our State and  nationally. This is not a hard call.   This project has the highest environmental standards in the world,  and if we need oil and gas, which we do, why wouldn't we get it from  American workers, like the people I just quoted, to help Alaska Native  communities, like the people I just quoted? Why is the Federal  Government--Joe Biden--going to Saudi Arabia to beg for oil? By the  way, he got rejected. Why did we lift sanctions on Venezuela, a  terrorist regime? To get more oil--whose production processes are 18  times more polluting than an American oil and gas project. Why? None of  this makes sense.   So, again, I want to thank my Democratic Senate colleagues in  particular. We have 30 days. If you are an American and you care about  energy security and good jobs, if you are a union member, pick up the  phone, send an email--blm.gov--and tell them: Stop the madness.  Finalize the Willow Project for the benefit of the Native people in  Alaska, for the benefit of working Americans, for the benefit of our  national security, and for the benefit of our environment. That is what  we need to do. I am hoping that the Biden administration makes the  right call.   I yield the floor.
