 Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained and missed a vote.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 62.                    Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Panetta     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Porter) for yielding the balance of the hour, of her time, to me.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm among the  shrinking Black population in cities across the U.S. According to a  recent study by the University of Illinois at Chicago, the city of  Chicago lost 350,000 Black residents between 1980 and 2016.   Madam Speaker, this is what I call ``Black exodus''--not exodus, but  ``Black exodus.'' This intense ``Black exodus'' is a result of decades  of disinvestment and disenfranchisement. Sadly, the city of Chicago  that so many African Americans looked to as a beacon of hope during the  great migration has often failed to invest in its Black population.   The economic, cultural, and political impact of Chicago's Black  community on our Nation has been immense: Louis Armstrong's  groundbreaking jazz emanated from Chicago, Thomas Dorsey's gospel rose  up from Chicago, and Muddy Waters' blues all came about in Chicago.                                time  1745    Since 1945, until recently, the iconic Ebony Magazine, along with its  sister magazine, JET magazine, chronicled Black civic and social life  in Chicago and across the Nation.   The first African American President of the United States began his  political career on Chicago's South Side.   The story of Black Chicago is one of power and perseverance, often in  the face of extreme resistance and resounding prejudice.   The UIC study stated that a lack of well-paying jobs and affordable  housing are two main factors that have driven the decline in Chicago's  Black population. The alarming statistics presented in this study are  proof that the consequences of the predatory and prejudiced practices  from the past are still present with us and still being felt at this  very hour.   Madam Speaker, the practice of redlining was invented, first  occurred, in Chicago.   Last September, I highlighted a study from Duke University that  stated that redlining, the practice of restricting the availability of  conventional mortgage loans in certain neighborhoods based on their  racial makeup, stole up to $4 billion from Chicago's Black community  during the 1950s and 1960s. Chicago's Black community was ripped off up  to $4 billion because of redlining in the 1950s and 1960s.   Now, some of the neighborhoods that African Americans were initially  systematically forced into are, all of a sudden, quickly developing,  which threatens to push out families who have lived there for  generations.   Redlining is being followed by the gentrifying that is occurring in  Chicago.   Despite the creation, Madam Speaker, of 65,000 new jobs in downtown  Chicago between 2010 and 2015, Chicago's predominantly Black  communities saw a net reduction of 1,500 jobs. While 65,000 jobs in the  downtown area increased, 1,500 jobs in Chicago were decreased from the  Black community.   Compounding, Madam Speaker, this reduction is the fact that over  700,000 jobs are located within 30 minutes of Chicago's downtown, in  the predominantly White North Side of Chicago, but just 60,000 jobs are  located within 30 minutes of the South Side of Chicago.   Chicago is a tale of two cities. It always was and currently remains  the tale of two cities: the wealthy, affluent, upper-middle-class North  Side, and the poor, devastated communities on the South and the West  Sides, both within 30 minutes of Chicago's downtown area.   Many Black Chicagoans who reside on the South Side are thus deprived  of the opportunity to earn a living in or near the community that they  reside in.   Madam Speaker, these startling trends are certainly not confined or  restricted just to Chicago or even to the Midwest. In fact, Madam  Speaker, we can look right here in our Nation's Capital, the city of  Washington, D.C., for our next example.   A recent Georgetown University study found that African Americans  accounted for over 70 percent of the District's population in 1970. By  the year 2015, African Americans were just 48.3 percent of the  District's population, from 70 percent to less than 50 percent in just  a few years.   Georgetown's findings were strikingly similar to the findings at the  University of Illinois at Chicago. Soaring housing prices and a  diminished job market for those who were without a bachelor's degree  pushed longtime residents out of our Nation's Capital, and they pushed  out longtime residents in Chicago as well.   Madam Speaker, we don't look just at Chicago or our Nation's Capital.  Let's look south to see the same troubling trend.   Austin, Texas, Madam Speaker, is a modern-day boomtown whose  population grew by 20 percent between 2000 and 2010, a boomtown in  Austin, Texas. During this same period, its African American population  fell by over 5 percent.   A 2014 survey from the University of Texas at Austin found that 26  percent of African Americans who moved out and left Austin did so  because the city had gotten too expensive.  [[Page H1118]]  Gentrification has forced many long-term residents of color to leave  their neighborhoods due to increased housing costs.   It is essential that this Congress ensures that neighborhood  development does not force out those families who have often called  these very same neighborhoods home for many past generations.   Madam Speaker, that is why I am so proud to have joined with  Congressman Hank Johnson in introducing H.R. 4999, the Opportunity Zone  Fairness and Inclusion Act. This bill seeks to mitigate the inequities  that are often brought on by rapid neighborhood development.   The opportunity zone program was intended to incentivize investment  in underserved communities. Currently, Madam Speaker, this same  investment program, this same opportunity zone program, lacks  mechanisms to ensure that the residents of these neighborhoods benefit  from this increased investment.   By mandating that opportunity zone funds establish investment and  advisory boards that include members of targeted communities, H.R. 4999  would ensure greater local involvement in opportunity zone projects.   H.R. 4999 would also establish requirements for small and minority  business involvement in those very same critical opportunity zone  funds. I encourage all of my colleagues in this Congress to join me in  supporting H.R. 4999.   Madam Speaker, going forward, we must develop policies with an eye on  rectifying the prejudices and the injustices of the past. That means  bringing affordable housing, stable and well-paying jobs, and vibrant  and robust businesses to communities that have been denied these  opportunities for far too long, including my beloved hometown, the city  of Chicago.   Merely pushing development without a firm focus on equity would only  perpetuate the discriminatory policies of the past.   In partnership with State and local governments, this Congress and  future Congresses can help preserve and strengthen the vibrant,  pioneering, and groundbreaking Black communities in places like  Chicago, Illinois, and, more broadly, in urban areas throughout our  great Nation.   Madam Speaker, this Congress can do nothing more or nothing less than  help American citizens regain a footing in their communities, in their  neighborhoods, by ensuring that fair housing is available, affordable  housing is available, economic viability and vitality with increased  businesses are available, and that jobs are created in these  communities.   Let us turn this page to a more productive and progressive future and  close the book on the precedential and bad disinvesting past.   Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
