 Mr. Speaker, I am so proud. Only 2 weeks into the new  Presidency, we are now moving ahead, right now, boldly, to answer the  cry of the American people and to ultimately pass and implement the  American Rescue Plan. If you don't hear the cry of your constituents,  then you aren't listening.   I want to focus on our communities, our States, our counties, our  cities, large and small, that are in a crisis situation right now. They  are starving for help to cover the basic costs that they have, and we  have an opportunity to give them $350 billion in relief and flexible  aid that can be used to make sure that our communities stay strong.   It is not just about budgets, and it is not just about employees. It  is about our constituents who will find that if  [[Page H304]]  we aren't able to fund the essence of what our communities need, then  we are going to see firefighters lose their jobs; we are going to see  paramedics and police and nurses and teachers and sanitation workers  not available for our communities; and we will see towns and counties  not able to fund their transportation systems.   It is time for us to act. It is past time for us to act. Let's do it.
