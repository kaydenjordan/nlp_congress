 Mr. President, I wish to recognize Timothy J. Goode on  the occasion of his retirement as Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal for the  Southern District of West Virginia. Chief Deputy Goode is stepping down  after a long career of accomplishment and service to his country and to  West Virginia.   Since he came to West Virginia, my staff and I have had the pleasure  of working with Chief Deputy Goode and his colleagues in the Southern  District office. He has been a consistent advocate for the U.S.  Marshals Service and served as a valuable liaison between the Service  and my office. Before he came to West Virginia, he had already accrued  a number of accomplishments in a storied career.   Chief Deputy Goode received his bachelor's degree from Indiana State  University in 1983, entering the U.S. Marshals Service as a deputy in  1986. Over the next three decades, he served as a mentor to numerous  deputies, coordinated and led operations that resulted in the arrest of  dangerous criminals, and served in various administrative and  informational capacities, including two stints as Acting U.S. Marshal.  Among his many approbations was a special recognition by the Indiana  General Assembly in 1990 for his role in the arrest and extradition of  General Manuel Noriega.   In addition to his long record of service, Chief Deputy Goode serves  as a Sunday school teacher and holds a master's degree in Christian  Ministry. An outdoorsman, he is also an avid hunter and fisher.  Finally, and most importantly, he is a devoted husband to his wife,  Kyle.   Exemplary public service should be praised, and we all owe a debt of  gratitude to Chief Deputy Goode for his service. I wish him well in  retirement and in his future endeavors. It is an honor to call him a  friend and fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________
