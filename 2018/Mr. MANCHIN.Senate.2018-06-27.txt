 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of Clifford Carwood Lipton, a West Virginian and a national hero  who fought on D-Day and at the Battle of the Bulge, a story made famous  on the HBO series Band of Brothers. In the years since his passing, his  heroism as one of the greatest Easy Company soldiers has remained a  treasure to the Huntington community.   Carwood was born and raised in Huntington. He attended a year at  Marshall University before joining the war effort as a paratrooper in  1942, and he quickly worked his way up the ranks. He was the jumpmaster  of one of the C-47 Skytrains used to jump into Normandy. Eventually,  Carwood received his battlefield commission as a second lieutenant. He  and the rest of the Easy Company later liberated one of the Nazi camps  at Landsberg.   Carwood remained with the Easy Company for the rest of the war and  remained in the Reserves through the Korean war. Among the many  recognitions he has received for his service are the Purple Heart,  Bronze Star, World War II Victory Medal, Presidential Unit Citation,  and the Orange Lanyard of the Royal Netherlands army.   After the war he was able to return to Marshall University and  complete a degree in engineering. Carwood got a job with Owens  Illinois, Inc., a glass and plastic production facility, where, staying  true to his character, he quickly worked his way through the ranks  until he became chief operator in 1952. He moved to New Jersey to work  in a similar factory and then to London with his wife, where he was the  director of manufacturing for eight different glass companies in  England and Scotland for many years. In the early eighties, he moved to  Toledo, OH, and retired as director of international development.   When visitors come to West Virginia, I jump at the chance to tell  them we have more veterans per capita than most any State in the  Nation. We have fought in more wars, shed more blood, and lost more  lives for the cause of freedom than most any State. We have always done  the heavy lifting and never complained. We have mined the coal and  forged the steel that built the guns, ships, and factories that have  protected and continue to protect our country to this day. I am so  deeply proud of what West Virginians have accomplished and what they  will continue to accomplish to preserve the freedoms we hold dear-- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   I am honored to recognize Carwood's memory, as well as the unwavering  love he had for our home State and our great Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Edwin Welch  upon his retirement as president of the University of Charleston after  a 29-year legacy of innovation that has advanced the university into a  world-class institution.   As a former White House employee during the Kennedy, Johnson, and  Nixon administrations, an ordained minister, a college professor,  provost, and president, Dr. Welch brought a wealth of experience and  drive to the Mountain State.   Since his first days at U.C. in 1989, Dr. Welch had a clear vision  for the university, keeping in mind the needs of the Charleston  community and of West Virginia. Our State is so unique to the rest of  the Nation. We are home to the most hard-working, creative, hospitable  people in the country--very much self-made people. Dr. Welch knows what  a college education means to them and to their families, and so he has  spent his career developing new opportunities for them to use to their  advantage. Together, with faculty, staff, and the community, Dr. Welch  sought to forecast challenges and opportunities and to create the best  possible strategies for maintaining a strong institution. His  collaborative vision brought the university back from the brink of  financial peril and allowed it to grow and thrive.   Under his leadership, more than 20 construction projects have  reinvigorated U.C., which has also seen a dramatic increase in  enrollment throughout the years. In 1994, he secured one of the largest  gifts in the university's history, which led to the construction of the  Clay Tower Building. More recently, he oversaw the $20 million Russell  and Martha Wehrle Innovation Center project, which serves to create a  strong campus base for innovation that will extend into Charleston and  the Greater Kanawha region. Additionally, Dr. Welch's wife, Dr. Janet  Welch, has made exceptional contributions to education and the arts at  U.C. and throughout the community. She received national recognition  for the creation of the Erma Byrd Galley for West Virginia Women  Artists, among her many accomplishments.   For his efforts, Dr. Welch has earned numerous recognitions, such as  the YMCA's Spirit of the Valley Award for his community service  efforts, and he was also the first recipient of the Charles L. Foreman  Award for Innovation in Private Higher Education by the Foundation for  Independent Higher Education. In fact, he's so beloved by the community  that there is even a towboat named after him, which you can  occasionally see floating down the Kanawha River.   Furthermore, one of the most respected aspects of Dr. Welch's tenure  is his relationship with students, faculty, and staff. He once said  that the life and work of the university is not what goes on in his  office. It is what goes on in the interactions students have with  faculty members, staff, and administrators. He frequently walked the  campus or sat down for lunch in the cafeteria to hear students'  concerns, problems, accomplishments, and their dreams. He kept all of  this in the back of his mind when making any significant decision for  the university.   Dr. Welch sees education for the ever-changing environment that it  is. He has truly laid the groundwork for all who will follow in his  footsteps, who will constantly strive to bring the very best  opportunities to U.C. students and to strengthen the Kanawha Valley  region. The effects of this close-knit city-university relationship are  profound and serve as an outstanding model for all educational  establishments.   While he is retiring and everyone is certain to miss his strong  leadership, Dr. Welch's dedication and commitment to excellence will  leave a lasting legacy with the countless lives he has touched.   Again, I congratulate and thank Dr. Welch for his remarkable years of  service. I am honored to wish good health and much happiness to him and  Dr. Janet Welch in the days and years ahead.                            ____________________
