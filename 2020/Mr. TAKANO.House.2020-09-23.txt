SEC. 507. REPORT ON EFFORTS BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS                     TO IMPLEMENT SAFETY PLANNING IN EMERGENCY                     DEPARTMENTS.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs must be more       effective in its approach to reducing the burden of veteran       suicide connected to mental health diagnoses, to include       expansion of treatment delivered via telehealth methods and       in rural areas.        (2) An innovative project, known as Suicide Assessment and       Follow-up Engagement: Veteran Emergency Treatment (in this       subsection referred to as ``SAFE VET''), was designed to help       suicidal veterans seen at emergency departments within the       Veterans Health Administration and was successfully       implemented in five intervention sites beginning in 2010.        (3) A 2018 study found that safety planning intervention       under SAFE VET was associated with 45 percent fewer suicidal       behaviors in the six-month period following emergency       department care and more than double the odds of a veteran       engaging in outpatient behavioral health care.        (4) SAFE VET is a promising alternative and acceptable       delivery of care system that augments the treatment of       suicidal veterans in emergency departments of the Veterans       Health Administration and helps ensure that those veterans       have appropriate follow-up care.        (5) Beginning in September 2018, the Veterans Health       Administration implemented a suicide prevention program,       known as the SPED program, for veterans presenting to the       emergency department who are assessed to be at risk for       suicide and are safe to be discharged home.        (6) The SPED program includes issuance and update of a       safety plan and post-discharge follow-up outreach for       veterans to facilitate engagement in outpatient mental health       care.        (b) Report.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a       report on the efforts of the Secretary to implement a suicide       prevention program for veterans presenting to an emergency       department or urgent care center of the Veterans Health       Administration who are assessed to be at risk for suicide and       are safe  [[Page H4747]]       to be discharged home, including a safety plan and post-      discharge outreach for veterans to facilitate engagement in       outpatient mental health care.        (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall       include the following:        (A) An assessment of the implementation of the current       operational policies and procedures of the SPED program at       each medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs,       including an assessment of the following:        (i) Training provided to clinicians or other personnel       administering protocols under the SPED program.        (ii) Any disparities in implementation of such protocols       between medical centers.        (iii) Current criteria used to measure the quality of such       protocols including--         (I) methodology used to assess the quality of a safety plan       and post-discharge outreach for veterans; or        (II) in the absence of such methodology, a proposed       timeline and guidelines for creating a methodology to ensure       compliance with the evidence-based model used under the       Suicide Assessment and Follow-up Engagement: Veteran       Emergency Treatment (SAFE VET) program of the Department.         (B) An assessment of the implementation of the policies and       procedures described in subparagraph (A), including the       following:        (i) An assessment of the quality and quantity of safety       plans issued to veterans.        (ii) An assessment of the quality and quantity of post-      discharge outreach provided to veterans.        (iii) The post-discharge rate of veteran engagement in       outpatient mental health care, including attendance at not       fewer than one individual mental health clinic appointment or       admission to an inpatient or residential unit.        (iv) The number of veterans who decline safety planning       efforts during protocols under the SPED program.        (v) The number of veterans who decline to participate in       follow-up efforts within the SPED program.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on S. 785.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 785, the Commander John Scott  Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act.   Madam Speaker, throughout the 116th Congress, the House Committee on  Veterans' Affairs has committed significant resources and energy with  one goal in mind, addressing and helping reduce veteran suicide.   As a result, our committee has passed no less than 15 pieces of  legislation that would address many of the upstream challenges that  veterans confront, which can exacerbate mental health conditions and  often lead veterans into crisis.   While we are not discussing all of these proposals today, I am  hopeful that one bill, and the subject of today's debate, S. 785, will  provide additional tools and will lead to additional reporting that  will inform our continued efforts to address this multifaceted and  complex challenge.   There is no one solution to this issue, but I know that by working  together we can continue to make meaningful progress.   I also thank the members of my committee and other Members of this  Chamber who offered legislation in the House to address gaps, enhance  upstream prevention, and create additional resources to help veterans  access care. Many of these components are included in S. 785.   Congressman Sablan's legislation included in S. 785 extends VA  healthcare to veterans for a 1-year period following discharge or  release from active service. We know this is a crucial period for  veterans to be enrolled in and receive high-quality healthcare.   Two provisions from Congressman Cisneros's bill are included in S.  785; one, directing VA to update its clinical practice guidelines for  treating veterans at risk of suicide, and the other mandating that VA  develop clinical practice guidelines to standardize best practices for  treating co-occurring substance use disorders, chronic pain, PTSD and/ or traumatic brain injuries.                                time  1230    Other members of my committee introduced House companion legislation  for key components of S. 785.   Congresswoman Lee's bill supported further telehealth expansion at  the VA to capitalize on the use of technology and meeting veterans  where they are.   Congressman Lamb introduced legislation to bring the VA's  complementary and integrated health services to even more veterans and  also pushed the scientific enterprise to seek biomarkers and more  tailored treatments for mental health problems through a new VA  precision medicine initiative.   Congressman Brindisi's bill will bring more resources to VA's suicide  prevention coordinators and more staffing in this critical area to VA  medical centers.   Madam Speaker, I want to say thanks to them and all our Members who  introduced companion legislation to S. 785, and I now encourage my  colleagues to join me in supporting S. 785.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Roe for his kind  words, and it is a pleasure to be here today to present this package of  legislation on veteran suicide prevention.   I do appreciate his mentioning the veteran hotline, and I do want to  also encourage veterans to know that it is okay to not be okay and to  please call the number that Dr. Roe just announced. I will try to make  sure I repeat that later on during our session today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Lamb), my good friend and vice chairman of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Mrs. Lee), my good friend and the chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Technology Modernization, and also the author of this  important piece of legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cisneros), my good friend and member of the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 785. I thank all of my colleagues who worked on this bill on  both sides of the aisle, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5245) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for  a bar on the recovery of certain payments or overpayments made by the  Department of Veterans Affairs by reason of delays in processing of  certain information, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 5245, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5245, as amended, the  Stopping Harm and Implementing Enhanced Lead-Time for Debts for  Veterans Act, or the SHIELD for Veterans Act. It would create important  steps to improve how VA handles overpayments made to veterans. The  Department's process for collecting overpayments that it makes must be  fair and reasonable and consider the potential hardships when an error  is discovered. This legislation does just that.   Further, the legislation would make overpayments less common by  improving the information available to beneficiaries and modernize how  veterans can provide updates to VA on their eligibility and status.   The SHIELD Act was sponsored by Chairman Chris Pappas, who leads our  Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. The bill was developed based  on hearings Chairman Pappas held during the session. The subcommittee  also conducted extensive oversight of VA collections.   Finally, the legislation takes into account the experiences and input  of veterans service organizations that help veterans navigate what is  an overly complex current collections process that leaves many  understandably frustrated.   I also appreciate the bipartisan nature of this bill. Our oversight  was conducted with the minority that also offered improvements to the  bill, which were incorporated into the current language.   I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I thank  Mr. Pappas for sponsoring this important legislation and urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 5245, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), my good friend, the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and also the author of  this important piece of legislation.    Madam Speaker, I, too, urge passage of this commonsense  solution. I very much also appreciate the bipartisan agreement that we  have reached that this is, indeed, a problem we should have fixed many  years ago.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 5245,  as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7105) to provide flexibility for the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs in caring for homeless veterans during a covered public health  emergency, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7105         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking subparagraph (E)       and inserting the following:       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (E)(i) Interest rate reduction refinancing  0.50                    0.50                   NA  loan issued before January 1, 2021 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (E)(ii) Interest rate reduction             0.85                    0.85                   NA  refinancing loan issued on or after  January 1, 2021, and before January 15,  2027 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (E)(iii) Interest rate reduction            0.50                    0.50                   NA  refinancing loan issued on or after  January 15, 2027 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7105, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7105, as amended, the  DELIVER Act.   H.R. 7105, as amended, was introduced by Representative   Mike Levin,  chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, in June of this  year. But the package before us encompasses many of the issues his  subcommittee has worked on to reduce homelessness and improve  employment opportunities for veterans.   This bipartisan package encompasses seven bipartisan, bicameral  pieces of legislation to improve the lives of veterans experiencing  hardships.   First, section 101 of this package includes Chairman Levin's Homeless  Veterans Coronavirus Response Act. This section includes temporary  authorities for the Department of Veterans Affairs to effectively  assist veterans during this difficult time.   Madam Speaker, that means giving VA the ability to serve more meals  and providing blankets, clothing, basic hygiene products, and permanent  and temporary shelter to veterans experiencing homelessness.   The section also allows VA flexibility to more quickly pay out grant  and per diem payments. This means housing more veterans more quickly.   Finally, Mr. Levin's bill authorizes VA to use resources to contract  healthcare services for veterans in the Health Care for Homeless  Veterans, or HCHV, program during a public health emergency.                                time  1315    These are crucial improvements that VA has asked for, and we stand  with them to deliver this assistance.   Now, section 102 of this legislation represents H.R. 2398 from  Representative Scott Peters. His Veteran HOUSE Act would finally expand  HUD-VASH to cover veterans with other-than-honorable discharges.   Veterans with other-than-honorable discharges make up 3 percent of  the population, but they compose 15 percent of the homeless veteran  population. There is no question that this commonsense expansion of the  program would mean fewer homeless veterans, and I thank Representative  Peters for his tireless work on this section.   Now, included in section 103 of the bill is H.R. 3749, Representative  Panetta's Legal Services for Homeless Veterans Act. This would  authorize VA to provide grants or enter into cooperative agreements  with eligible entities that provide legal services to homeless veterans  and veterans at risk for homelessness.   Madam Speaker, according to community organizations, legal services  are one of the top unmet needs for homeless veterans. Under this  section, VA would be required to consult with organizations that have  experience providing services to homeless veterans when establishing  these criteria and requirements, and these grants or cooperative  agreements would only be available to highly rated public or nonprofit  entities.   Additionally, Representative Wild has included legislation to ensure  that at least 10 percent of the funds made available each fiscal year  for this grant program must be reserved for providing legal services to  homeless women veterans.   As we know, women veterans are the fastest growing population of  homeless veterans, and I thank Representative Panetta and  Representative Wild for their work on this section.   Section 104 of the underlying bill includes Representative Beatty's  legislation to carry out a gap analysis study to determine if VA  programs are properly serving homeless women veterans.   Section 105 of the legislation represents bipartisan legislation just  introduced by Minority Leader McCarthy and Chairman Levin. Their  legislation, the Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act, would encourage VA  to contract out vacant HUD-VASH caseworker positions, increase the  grant per diem rates, and allow grant per diem participants to gain  access to the homeless management information systems. This will make  our community providers more effective at delivering for their  communities.   Section 105 also includes Representative Brownley's Homeless Veteran  Families Act.   Many homeless veterans with children are unable to obtain  transitional housing and support assistance through the program because  providers only receive payments from the VA for the veteran, not their  minor dependents. This section would authorize VA to pay a partial per  diem to GPD providers supporting our Nation's homeless veterans with  children.   Finally, this legislation would also have VA more accurately track  HUD-  [[Page H4761]]  VASH case manager vacancies and help Congress determine how to more  effectively keep the program staffed so that it may most effectively  serve our Nation's veterans.   Sections 201 through 203 represent Ranking Member Roe and Chairman  Levin's Rapid Retraining Assistance Program for Veterans. Now, this  program will train 7,500 veterans who have been economically impacted  by COVID-19, putting their skills and knowledge back to work in our  economy.   We have a commitment to our Nation's veterans to support them  regardless of the challenges they face. COVID-19 is no different, and I  am pleased that we were able to find a way to pass concrete employment  measures for our Nation's veterans.   Last but certainly not least, sections 204 through 207 represent  Chairman Levin's Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder,  Retired, Transition Improvement Act.   This section would make much-needed improvements to our  servicemembers' transition process, including more accessible  transition sites and providing grants for organizations to assist with  resume assistance, interview training, and job recruitment training.   All told, this is one of the most meaningful pieces of legislation  dealing with economic hardship we will have a chance to consider, and I  am grateful to the countless Members of Congress for their hard work to  make it a reality.   Our time here is short, so we call on our colleagues in the Senate,  who have also worked on many of these provisions, to send this bill to  the President before we finish our work this year.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to join me in voting for  H.R. 7105, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), my good friend and the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, who is also the author of this  impressive, comprehensive H.R. 7105.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  kind words and comments, and I appreciate his passion for our veterans.  And I am very pleased that we can honor his friend by the naming of the  bill.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to  close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I just want to say that this is a tremendously  comprehensive bill. It represents the tremendous work of Members from  both sides of the aisle.   I have to say that I am recalling at this very moment a woman veteran  who drove all the way from Los Angeles into my district to a townhall  meeting where she first made me aware of the issue of veterans with  children not having enough money, not enough benefits to be able to get  into homeless housing, and I am so pleased that the bill by Ms.  Brownley to address that issue is in this piece of legislation.   I just urge all of my colleagues to pass H.R. 7105, as amended, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8247) to make certain improvements relating to the  transition of individuals to services from the Department of Veterans  Affairs, suicide prevention for veterans, and care and services for  women veterans, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8247         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) The number of women veterans in each State who are       enrolled in the patient enrollment system of the Department       under section 1705(a) of title 38, United States Code.        (3) Of the women veterans who are so enrolled, the number       who have received health care under the laws administered by       the Secretary at least one time during the one-year period       preceding the submission of the report.

(8) If known, an identification of the medical facility of       the Department in each Veterans Integrated Service Network       with the largest rate of decrease in patient population of       women veterans as measured by the decrease in unique women       veterans patient use.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 8247, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8247, the Veterans  Comprehensive Prevention, Access to Care, and Treatment Act, or  Veterans COMPACT Act.   While passing S. 785, the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental  Health Care Improvement Act can be viewed as a great success, no single  piece of legislation can comprehensively prevent the tragedy of veteran  suicide.   We must continually find and work to address gaps in prevention and  care for veterans, especially those at heightened risk for suicide,  including women veterans, veterans who have recently separated from the  military service, veterans who haven't used VA healthcare recently, and  veterans in acute crisis.   The COMPACT Act contains nine provisions to further enhance veteran's  mental health and well-being and prevent deaths by suicide.   Madam Speaker, the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs approaches  suicide prevention legislation within the CDC's public health  framework, emphasizing upstream prevention, targeted interventions for  those veterans at higher risk, and emergency care for those in suicidal  crisis.  [[Page H4768]]    The COMPACT Act includes my provision to remove financial barriers  and ensure that veterans in acute suicidal crisis or at imminent risk  of self-harm will receive emergency stabilization care and never see a  bill for it.   COMPACT also offers two provisions designed to better understand the  particular needs of women veterans by directing the VA to report on  women veterans' healthcare usage and the specific program needs of  women veterans experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity.   It also includes two provisions aimed at including veterans' family  members with veterans' permission in education programs to better  support their veterans. When we take care of families, we also take  care of veterans.   Madam Speaker, this bill also mandates that VA report back to  Congress on the details of Solid Start, a relatively new VA approach to  contacting and supporting veterans who have recently separated from the  military. This is a known high-risk period for suicide among veterans.   COMPACT will ensure that veterans who haven't used VA healthcare  recently get a reminder to come back in for VA services, so they don't  inadvertently lose eligibility for some of those services.   Because we know that VA police play important roles in keeping  everyone safe on VA campuses, this bill requires new annual trainings  to make sure that all VA police officers are familiar with mental  health challenges and competent in crisis deescalation techniques.   Madam Speaker, finally, the COMPACT Act sets up an interagency task  force to look at increasing veterans' access to the outdoors and, in  particular, use of our public lands for healing and recreation.   I want to emphasize that the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs is  always willing to work in a bipartisan and bicameral way to advance  policies to support veterans. And to that end, we sought and  incorporated feedback from stakeholders and we worked hard to find  consensus with our House and Senate colleagues.   Madam Speaker, even though the Department of Veterans Affairs  declined to appear and testify before us in the House on this bill, we  incorporated its last-minute technical suggestions in the spirit of  collaboration. And because of their commitment to finding common ground  and for working with the House to reach an agreed-upon bipartisan,  bicameral piece of legislation, I want to thank Senators Moran and  Tester, and Dr. Roe and their staffs for their tireless efforts in  helping craft this bill. Because of their work, we are providing VA  with additional tools and resources to reduce veteran suicide.   We should be clear that while we will pass two important pieces of  legislation today to address the tragedy of veteran suicide, this  certainly does not mark the end of Congress' obligation. We can and we  must do more.   Madam Speaker, we must implement key recommendations from the White  House PREVENTS task force related to lethal means safety and community  provider training. We must increase VA's outreach to and care for  minority and underserved veterans.   We stand ready to move this negotiated bill forward and immediately  get back to work. My hope is that the Senate stands ready as well.  Politics must never come before the debt we owe our veterans.   Before I say my final words in this opening piece about this  legislation, I want to just again reiterate to our veterans out there  who may be experiencing a crisis or who know a veteran who may be  experiencing a crisis, to please call the Veterans Crisis Line at 1- 800-273-8255 and press 1. As Dr. Roe said earlier today, it is okay not  to be okay.   Again, 1-800-273-8255 and press 1, or text 838255.   For deaf or hard of hearing, please call 1-800-799-4889.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of  H.R. 8247, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly) to speak on H.R. 8247.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the ranking member for his assistance and partnership in  getting COMPACT to the finish line. I certainly thank Chairman Smith  for his contribution. I agree with the chairman that the great  outdoors--the tremendous resources that we have in our country of our  national parks--should be made more available and accessible to our  veterans who are suffering the unseen wounds of war. So I thank the  gentleman so much for his contribution.   Madam Speaker, I want to urge all of my colleagues to support H.R.  8247. I want to thank the staff; my own staff director, Ray Kelley; and  the tremendous expertise that we brought on and just the tremendous  focus that they were able to achieve during the past 18 months.   This is, indeed, a huge milestone today, to be standing here and to  see H.R. 8247 be passed before the House today.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R.  8247, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3798) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for  limitations on copayments for contraception furnished by the Department  of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3798         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Access to       Contraception for Veterans Act''.       SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON COPAYMENTS FOR CONTRACEPTION.         Section 1722A(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by striking ``to pay'' and all that follows through the       period and inserting ``to pay--''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:        ``(A) an amount in excess of the cost to the Secretary for       medication described in paragraph (1); or        ``(B) an amount for any contraceptive item for which       coverage under health insurance coverage is required without       the imposition of any cost-sharing requirement pursuant to       section 2713(a)(4) of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC       300gg-13(a)(4)).''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 3798, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3798, as amended, eliminates copayments on  contraceptive items at the Department of Veterans Affairs, ensuring  that no veterans, especially women veterans, face economic barriers to  a critical component of preventative healthcare.   I thank Congresswoman Brownley for introducing this bill and for her  efforts as chair of the Subcommittee on Health and the Women's Veterans  Task Force.   Contraception is an essential part of healthcare, and more than 99  percent of women have used birth control at some point in their lives.  Women veterans represent the fastest growing population of veterans  accessing care through VA, and many are of reproductive age.   Contraception is widely available at VA, and veterans enrolled at VA  can obtain oral contraceptives, shots, skin patches, vaginal rings, and  long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as implants or intrauterine  devices or IUDs. In addition, the VA pharmacy dispenses over-the- counter contraceptives, including condoms and emergency contraception.   Requiring a copay for contraception creates an unnecessary economic  barrier to preventative healthcare. Women veterans are more likely to  live in poverty than male veterans, and transgender veterans are more  likely to live in poverty than cisgender veterans. Even a small copay  can be insurmountable for someone trying to make ends meet.   Madam Speaker, passing this bill is especially critical during the  pandemic. During times of crisis, such as natural disaster and  pandemics, the rate of unplanned pregnancy increases. When so many  Americans are experiencing economic hardship, their access to  healthcare should be something that they do not have to worry about.  This bill has wide VSO support and is also supported by the Department  of Veterans Affairs.   I, again, thank Ms. Brownley for her leadership on this issue. I  thank Dr. Roe and the minority staff for working with us on this bill,  and I look forward to working with our Senate counterparts to get it  passed into law before the 116th Congress.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), my good friend, the chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Health, and also the author of this important piece of  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I conclude my remarks on Ms. Brownley's important  piece of legislation on making contraception available on the same  basis as the Department of Defense, I, too, want to add my words of  praise to my colleague and my partner in the work in the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs, Ranking Member Dr. Phil Roe.   Mr. Speaker, he has so much to point to, the proud list of  accomplishments: The Blue Water Navy bill was something that had a  chain of ownership. I happened to be the last one on the chain. I know  that the gentleman put a lot of work into that.   Even as we approach the month of October, we know that, finally, they  are going to implement the caregiver portion of that bill. What a  tremendous expansion of caregiver benefits that were previously only  available to post-9/11 veterans. I lament that it took that long, but  it is here.   Let's also think about the tremendous progress we made on  homelessness. It is not done, and it is not over, but we made  tremendous strides nationwide in reducing veteran homelessness. We just  passed today a very comprehensive bill to deal with the remains of  homelessness, which remains a very serious problem in my own home State  of California.   Mr. Speaker, Dr. Roe has helped shape our progress on veterans  homelessness in so many areas of policy relating to our Nation's  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I join all of my colleagues in saying that the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs will miss him.   I know his storytelling, but I learned late this year of his  affection for the late folksinger John Prine. I know Dr. Roe plays the  guitar, and I hope that before he leaves, he will regale us at some  point with either one of his songs or one of the songs that he likes to  play on that guitar.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  3798, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4772]]                                     time  1415
