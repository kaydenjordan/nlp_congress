 Mr. President, I rise to announce my opposition to the  nomination of Chad Readler to be a Judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of  Appeals.   As the Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's  Civil Division, Mr. Readler was both a lead attorney and policy adviser  in the Department's decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act,  including its provisions protecting individuals with preexisting  conditions.   Rather than defend the law and its protections for individuals with  preexisting conditions, such as asthma, arthritis, cancer, diabetes,  and heart disease, Mr. Readler's brief in Texas v. United States argued  that they should be invalidated.   I strongly objected to DOJ's position to not defend the law, and it  is telling that this position also concerned some other career  attorneys in the Department. In fact, three career attorneys withdrew  from the case rather than support this position, and one of those  attorneys eventually resigned.   In my view, the Justice Department's severability argument is wrong  and implausible. On June 27, 2018, I wrote to Attorney General Sessions  and urged the Justice Department to reverse course and to defend the  law's critical protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.  Even the Justice Department acknowledged that it was ``rare'' for the  government to refuse to defend the laws of the United States against  constitutional challenges.   I have continuously stressed the importance of protecting Americans  who suffer from preexisting conditions, including 45 percent of Maine's  population: 590,000 Mainers. In July 2017, I voted to block several  proposals to repeal the ACA, which I feared would reduce protections  for individuals with preexisting conditions. In October 2018, I voted  to overturn a Trump administration rule that expands the duration of  short-term health insurance plans, which could deny coverage to people  with preexisting conditions.
