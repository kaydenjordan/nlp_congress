 Madam President, during the last decade, our complex  Tax Code left hard-working families behind and allowed the wealthy and  well connected to get ahead. It is so bad that one small business owner  in Paducah, KY, recently wrote to my office asking for relief because,  as he said, ``Taxes are suffocating my company, and me personally.''   The pain isn't just being felt in Kentucky. It is an urgent problem  nationwide. Families and job creators are doing their best to get  ahead, but too often our Tax Code keeps them from reaching for the  American dream. Working families and small businesses in our country  deserve better than our outdated Tax Code, and that is what we are  trying to deliver.   Tax reform represents the single most important thing we can do right  now to spur economic growth, help support good jobs, and boost the  middle class. This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity, and we  should meet the challenge.   Overhauling our Tax Code can mean more money for small businesses to  hire, to invest, and to expand. It can mean families keeping more of  what they earn to save for a rainy day or an emergency. This relief can  even mean getting one step closer to sending a child to college, buying  a new car, or saving more for retirement.   This week, the Senate will continue our years-long effort toward tax  reform. Under the leadership of Chairman Hatch, the Senate Finance  Committee reported out legislation to replace our noncompetitive,  complex, and outdated Tax Code.   Through dozens of hearings, substantial hard work, and an open  amendment process, the committee has produced a bill that would  prioritize the middle class and small businesses so they can keep more  of their hard-earned money.   Our plan doubles the child tax credit, preserves the adoption tax  credit, and roughly doubles the standard deduction to reduce how much  income is taxed in the first place.  [[Page S7320]]    Put it all together, and a typical middle-class family of four making  a median family income could see a tax break of around $2,200. As  families sit around the table to balance their budgets and plan for the  future, this money will make a significant impact.   In addition, our tax reform proposal will provide much needed relief  for low- and middle-income families by repealing ObamaCare's individual  mandate tax. By ending an unpopular tax from an unworkable law, this  plan can help those who need it most.   The bottom line is this: We want to take more money out of  Washington's pocket and put more money into the pockets of American  families. To accomplish this goal, we will continue to consider the  plan under regular order. Every Member will have a chance to offer  amendments on the floor, and then we will vote.   There are many places in this legislation where we should all-- Republicans and Democrats--be able to agree. For instance, our  Democratic colleagues have the opportunity to help us end tax  incentives that contribute to American jobs going overseas. That sounds  like something our friends across the aisle should support. In fact,  many of them have identified those incentives as the fundamental  problem in our current Tax Code. This is our chance to put an end to  it. I hope they will join us in our effort to help jobs and investments  stay right here at home.   I am proud to continue working with my colleague to get this  legislation one step closer to the President's desk. Let's keep working  together to deliver tax relief for the American people.   Now, Madam President, on another matter. Later today, the Senate will  consider two more talented nominees to the Federal judiciary. First, we  will vote to confirm the nomination of Dabney Friedrich to serve as  district court judge for the District of Columbia.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon, Tuesday,  November 28; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Katsas nomination, then subsequently recess until  4 p.m.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent,  notwithstanding rule XXII, that at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, November 28,  there be 90 minutes of postcloture debate remaining on the Katsas  nomination, equally divided between the leaders or their designees.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:44 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, November 28, 2017, at 12 noon.                            ____________________
