 Madam President, I recognize the Belen Jesuit  Wolverines varsity basketball team, winners of the FHSAA Class 5A State  Championship Title in Boys Basketball held in Lakeland, FL, on March 4,  2023.   The Belen Jesuit Wolverines basketball team, led by Coach Gaston  ``Chachi'' Rodriguez, finished their regular season with a 28-4 record.  They claimed the school's first State championship in the sport.  Considered underdogs with an undersized roster, Belen defeated Daytona  Beach Mainland High School in the championship game with a final score  of 49-30. Senior Javi Rosell's 22 points led the team, followed by  sophomore Bryce Fitzgerald with 13 points, including 11 of 12  freethrows made. The championship game was tied after the first  quarter, but Belen broke open with 13 steals and forced 23 turnovers  from Mainland's team during the rest of the game. The Wolverines' 30  points allowed in the championship game were the fewest scored by an  opponent over the past decade.   I extend my best wishes to the entire Belen Jesuit family, Principal  Roca, Coach Gaston Rodriguez, players Kevin Garcia, Joshue Perez, Ryan  Cuellar, Javi Rosell, Bryce Fitzgerald, Alec Arnholt, Ej Gross, Carlos  Santana, Alejandro Lopez, Max Klemick, Vincent Lima, Al Madrigal,  Dillon Diaz, Nicolas Portuondo, and Ignacio Falla. I look forward to  hearing of their continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, I recognize the Mater Lakes  Academy Bears varsity boys' basketball team, winners of the Class 4A  State Final at the 2023 Boys Basketball State Tournament held in  Lakeland, FL, on March 4, 2023.   The Mater Lakes Academy Bears basketball team, led by Coach Dylan  Estock, finished their regular season with a 28-3 record.

Ten players scored in the championship game, led by  their primary trio of senior Michael Bradley, who scored 21 points;  junior Christian Reid, with 20 points and seven rebounds; and sophomore  Anthony Knowles, with 13 points, six rebounds, and six assists. Mater  Lakes took command of the game in the second quarter, growing their  lead to 23 points before defeating the Villages Charter by a final  score of 77-41.
