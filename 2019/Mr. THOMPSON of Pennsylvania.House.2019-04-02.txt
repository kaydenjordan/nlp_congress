 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Easterseals on its 100th anniversary.   Easterseals is a network of more than 70 leading nonprofit  organizations that provide local services and support to children and  adults with disabilities, veterans, and older adults.   Founded in 1919 in Ohio, Easterseals works nationwide, in almost  every State, to help Americans achieve milestones, live independently,  and be active members of their communities.   Easterseals employs more than 30,000 professional staff across the  country, including therapists, nurses, employment specialists, and  direct support professionals who deliver high-quality services.   Over the past century, Easterseals has helped millions of individuals  and families by assisting children who have disabilities; helping them  access early intervention, including physical and speech therapies, to  help prepare them for successful learning; providing in-home and  community adult day services for seniors and people with disabilities;  helping individuals with disabilities, veterans, and seniors find  meaningful employment; and providing camping and recreational  opportunities to youth and adults with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, Easterseals provides autistic individuals early  education, employment, camping, caregiving, transportation, and other  services to support Americans of all ages.   The number of children in the U.S. with developmental delays is on  the rise. A recent study found that approximately 13 percent of infants  and toddlers have a developmental delay. Research has also shown that  one in  [[Page H2943]]  three children who receive early intervention services will not require  special education in preschool.   Mr. Speaker, we know that the first few years of a child's life will  lay the foundation for his or her long-term well-being and overall  success. That is why I am a strong proponent of Head Start and Early  Head Start programs.   We can't guarantee that every child will be successful in life, but  we can give them the same access to early educational opportunities.  This is just one of many reasons why I introduced H.R. 1695, the  Community Services Block Grant Reauthorization Act of 2019. This  legislation renews our Nation's commitment to reducing poverty through  locally driven comprehensive approaches.   Head Start and early education programs are operated through  community action agencies and promote school readiness through  enhancing the cognitive, physical, behavorial, and social-emotional  development of children from low-income families. Easterseals  specializes in early childhood development where children with and  without disabilities can learn together.   Another piece of legislation I am cosponsoring is H.R. 1878, the IDEA  Full Funding Act. This would ensure that individuals with disabilities  are receiving an appropriate education.   In the 1970s, Congress promised to cover 40 percent of the extra cost  of special education, but we never come close to fulfilling that  promise. In fact, current funding remains only at 14 percent of the  targeted amount. This bill would mandate gradual increases in IDEA  funding to reach the full commitment--40 percent, a commitment made by  Congress--by fiscal year 2029 and each subsequent fiscal year after  that. Easterseals is also supportive of this legislation.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, three Easterseals affiliates  serve 67 counties. They employ almost 700 people, and they serve nearly  27,900 individuals. Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the incredible  services Easterseals works to provide to American families.   For the past 100 years, it has leveraged its network of nonprofits to  improve the lives of others. In schools, workplaces, and communities,  Easterseals has fostered environments where everyone is included and  valued, regardless of age or ability.   I congratulate Easterseals for its contributions to improving so many  lives over the past 100 years.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on World  Autism Day, to recognize and support all children or adults with autism  spectrum disorder.   In 2018, an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States was  diagnosed with some form of autism spectrum disorder. Notwithstanding  these diagnoses, Americans with autism make exceptional contributions  across our Nation and around the world.   Each April Autism Speaks celebrates the start of its signature  campaign, Light It Up Blue. Light It Up Blue is a unique global  campaign to increase understanding and acceptance for people with  autism.   Today we celebrate World Autism Awareness Day, and this month is  World Autism Month.   Mr. Speaker, let's renew our commitment to support the entire  international autism community, including children and adults with  autism, their families, and caregivers.   Together, we can increase access to information, encourage heightened  understanding of autism, promote respect and dignity, and support the  services that assist people with autism to reach their full potential.                            ____________________
