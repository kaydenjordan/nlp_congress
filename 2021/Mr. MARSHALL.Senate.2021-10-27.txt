 Mr. President, EcoHealth Alliance received hundreds of  millions of dollars in taxpayer grants and contracts, including $65  million from USAID. This company and their research may well hold in  their hands the smoking gun to getting to the bottom of COVID's  origins, and millions of families who lost loved ones deserve closure.   Any Federal Agency that has given them money must be transparent and  provide Congress all information on what EcoHealth used that money for.  We asked for this information months ago. USAID has failed to do so,  and that is why I am here to object to these two unanimous consent  requests.   Therefore, I object.
