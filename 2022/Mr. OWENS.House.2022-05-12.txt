 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor National Guard members  in Utah and across our Nation.   Since 1636 members of the National Guard have proudly served our  communities and our entire Nation.   Today and every day, we are incredibly thankful for their commitment  to serving others and keeping us safe. These past 2 years have been  especially challenging for the airmen and soldiers of the National  Guard who have stepped up when the Nation called and provided much- needed support for our communities.   From Logan to St. George, they have provided direct hospital support  during the height of COVID-19, helped fight wildfires across the  American West, and provided a calm and collected response to recent  episodes of civil unrest.   They have performed under some of the most serious and difficult  conditions in recent memory while also balancing their responsibilities  as parents, spouses, employees, and even businessowners.   I have had the privilege of meeting many of these fine men and women.  From the officers and NCOs of the 19th Special Forces Group to privates  assigned to the 65th Field Artillery Brigade, I have been impressed by  their selfless service and commitment to duty. Utah is truly blessed to  serve as the proud home of Camp Williams and over 7,000 of these  remarkable airmen and soldiers.   These brave men and women are always ready and always there.   Utah has a one-of-a-kind spirit of service, and the members of our  National Guard are no exception. Each and every day they faithfully  live out their mission to provide military forces to assist our State  and Federal authorities at times of emergency. They stand ready to  protect Utahns and Americans from enemies both foreign and domestic and  to react quickly in the face of natural disasters or emergencies. I am  grateful to them for keeping Utahns and Americans safe.                                time  1745
