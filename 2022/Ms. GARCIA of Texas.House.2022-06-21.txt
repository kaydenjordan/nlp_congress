 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the House  Democrats' efforts to lower rising costs that threaten and burden our  American families.   Putin's cruel war in Ukraine is rising prices across our Nation and  the world, but Democrats are taking decisive action.   Last week, we passed the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act. This bill  will reduce our dependence on foreign fertilizer production, strengthen  competition in the meat and poultry sector, and strengthen our supply  chain.   It will also expand access to cleaner Unleaded 88 gas that costs an  average of 40 cents less per gallon. These steps for Democrats will go  a long way, Mr. Speaker, to protect American families from Putin's  inflation.   Yet, some extreme MAGA Republicans continue to side with greedy  corporations and billionaires instead of hardworking families.   I call on our Republican colleagues to work with us in our efforts to  lower costs for all families across America. The time to act is now.                            ____________________
