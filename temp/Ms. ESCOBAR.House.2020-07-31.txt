 Mr. Speaker, Monday, August 3, will mark 1 year since El  Paso, Texas, became the target of a killer who confessed to driving  over 600 miles in order to stop what he called the ``Hispanic  invasion'' with his AK-47.   In a horrific act of domestic terrorism, he killed 23 people, injured  22, and devastated all of us. This wasn't only another tragic outcome  of America's gun violence epidemic, but also a result of America's hate  epidemic fueled by racism and xenophobia as well as rhetoric coming  from the most powerful leaders in the land.   One year later, we still don't have laws that make us safer from gun  violence, and we still face a reckoning on hate.   My community continues to confront hate with love and to honor the  victims and survivors. In that spirit, it is my privilege today to  introduce legislation that honors the victims of the August 3, 2019,  attack and designates the El Paso Community Healing Garden as a  national memorial.                            ____________________
