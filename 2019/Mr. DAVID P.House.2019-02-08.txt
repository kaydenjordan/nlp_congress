Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Representatives Allred, Sherrill, and  Torres' amendment that would require the VA to ensure that eligible  veterans are made aware of childcare assistance available to them  through this program via outreach and publicly available information  made easily accessible on VA's website.   This program would be no good to any veteran if they don't know that  it exists and could potentially serve them. This is a commonsense  proposition and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting it.   On a related note, I understand that Representative Allred recently  left D.C. to return to Dallas for the birth of his son, which is  further proof of how disruptive children can be to a working parent's  schedule and why this bill is so needed.   I wish Congressman Allred and his family my hearty congratulations  and send them my best wishes during this joyous occasion.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment, although I am not opposed.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Congresswoman Moore's amendment to  require annual reports on the participation and funding requirements  associated with childcare assistance, as well as biannual reports on  other remaining challenges regarding childcare services and  recommendations for improvement.   If we are going to create a new program like this one, we have an  obligation to ensure that it is serving the people it is supposed to be  serving, and providing good value for our taxpayers.   I am happy to support this amendment to ensure that this program is  closely monitored by VA, and that Congress is able to use these reports  to conduct appropriate oversight of it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I strongly support  Congresswoman Moore's amendment, and urge my colleagues to support it  also.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment sponsored by  Congresswoman Kuster to require VA to establish criteria for childcare  assistance for veterans who experience unusual or excessive burdens  when trying to access those childcare services.   Approximately 40 percent of veteran patients live in rural or highly  rural areas. Those veterans have unique barriers both to healthcare and  to childcare, and VA must take those barriers into consideration when  it is designing this program.   I thank my good friend, Congresswoman Kuster, who is a tireless  advocate for veterans in New Hampshire. Congresswoman Kuster and I  spent Thanksgiving a couple years ago in Afghanistan, visiting our  troops. I know her love for veterans and her commitment to that and her  work on this amendment. I am pleased to join her in supporting it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee.

ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Congressman Delgado and Congresswoman  Lawrence's amendment to expand the definition of childcare services to  include extended daycare programs.   Many schools offer childcare in the morning or evening hours to  accommodate the busy schedules of working parents. If those programs  are a better fit for the children of veterans seeking childcare  assistance under this bill, it only makes sense for VA to have the  flexibility to use them.   That said, I have questions about this amendment that I believe could  have been addressed had this bill gone through regular order. For  example, would this amendment permit veterans whose children are  already involved in these programs to deduct a portion of the cost when  they are seeking care, or does this only cover drop-in care?   I am grateful to Congressman Delgado for his work on this amendment,  and I hope that we can work with Chairman Takano to address these  questions.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I think we have these  two amendments reversed.    ROE of Tennessee. Yes, I do.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of  Representatives Delgado, Harder, and Stefanik's amendment to include  emergency mental healthcare under the definition of a covered health  service.   It is a tragedy and a tragic fact that approximately 20 veterans die  every day by suicide. We have perhaps no greater calling on the  Veterans' Affairs Committee than doing all we can do to lower and  eliminate that number.   A veteran in crisis must have the benefit of every available support  to get them through that crisis and on a path to healing. This  amendment will ensure that the lack of childcare won't be a barrier to  care for a veteran in crisis.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of  Congressman Golden and Congresswoman Kuster's amendment to expand the  healthcare services under which a veteran would be eligible to receive  childcare assistance to include readjustment counseling.   The readjustment counseling provided through vet centers is an  important component of VA's mental healthcare system of care. I commend  Congressman Golden and Congresswoman Kuster for making sure that  veterans in need of childcare assistance so that they can attend  appointments at vet centers are able to receive that assistance.   I thank Congressman Golden for his service to our great country. I  think we owe the gentleman a great debt of gratitude and welcome him  here to the House floor.

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of  Congressmen Golden and Brindisi's amendment requiring a report  regarding the accessibility and effectiveness of the childcare  assistance program for veterans living in rural and highly rural areas.   As I said earlier this morning when discussing Congresswoman Kuster's  amendment, approximately 40 percent of veterans live in rural or highly  rural areas. Those veterans have unique access needs, and VA must be  mindful when creating this program.   Mr. Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this amendment today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I support this amendment; I  encourage my colleagues to support this amendment; and I yield back the  balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of  Congresswoman Sherrill's amendment, which would prohibit childcare  providers from providing childcare assistance under this program if  they employ an individual convicted of a sex crime, an offense  involving a child victim, a violent crime, or a drug felony.   It would also stipulate that the requirements in this bill are not  intended to lower any Federal, State, or local standards for hiring or  screening childcare centers.   I thank Congresswoman Sherrill for introducing this thoughtful  amendment that recognizes that the children of veterans accessing  childcare assistance under this bill must be cared for in the safest  environment possible.   This amendment is a no-brainer, and I encourage all of my colleagues  to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee.

Sexual trauma can have wide-ranging implications on a person's  physical and mental health. I am grateful to the sponsors of this  amendment for making sure that MST is specifically included in this  legislation so that veterans who have suffered this terrible crime will  face one less barrier to obtaining care.
