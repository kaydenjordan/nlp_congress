 Mr. Speaker, as the corporations, the  wealthy, and the well-connected enjoy lavish tax cuts, while retaining  the ability to avoid paying any taxes whatsoever because of the many  tax loopholes still in the Tax Code, millions of low- and middle-income  Americans work diligently to complete their tax returns today.   The Republican tax scam has made the rich even richer, while economic  inequality in America has gotten a whole lot worse. Sadly, most  Americans say they have seen no change in their withholding taxes.   While the wealthy are reaping massive windfalls from the giveaways in  the GOP tax scam, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates  that this tax scam will cause the annual deficit to soar to over $1  trillion in 2020, and an additional $3.4 trillion will be added to the  national debt over the next 10 years.   Ending deficit spending and reducing the Federal debt is what  Republicans have always claimed they were about, but we see now, with  Republicans in total control, that they have misled us.   It is time to put this scam to bed, Mr. Speaker, and bring new order  to this House. Shame on the Republicans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I  may hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 141, a bill  originally introduced by Representative Conyers of Michigan, for the  purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to  clause 7 of rule XII.
