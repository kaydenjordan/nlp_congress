 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on H.R.  1815, and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1815, the SEC Disclosure  Effectiveness Testing Act crafted by Representative Casten from  Illinois, a new Member of Congress and member of the Financial Services  Committee.   H.R. 1815 requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to test its  disclosure documents with retail investors through one-on-one  interviews and surveys to ensure that these documents are actually  understood by their target audience.   The SEC's approach to protecting retail investors from conflicts of  interest and other risks has been based on informing them through  disclosure. This is a problem when those disclosures are written in a  way that retail investors don't understand.   Since at least 2012, when the SEC conducted a financial literacy  study, we have known that many of the disclosures intended for retail  investors are not well-understood by those investors.   While the public has the opportunity to comment on most rulemakings  or new disclosures, these comments are largely from well-funded  industry representatives, rather than the mom-and-pop investors who  will be receiving these new disclosures.   H.R. 1815 ensures that the SEC gets the input it needs from retail  investors on disclosure forms by requiring the SEC to test those forms  and engage in qualitative one-on-one interviews and nationwide surveys.   Investor testing has been embraced by both Democratic and Republican  commissioners at the SEC. In addition, the SEC itself has been engaged  in investor testing in several instances, including most recently in  2018, when it tested a proposed disclosure for brokers and investment  advisers to provide to retail investors known as Form Client  Relationship Summary, that is, CRS.    This proposed five-page disclosure was intended to help retail  investors understand the obligations owed and services provided by  investment professionals, as well as the fees and costs that could  affect their investment accounts.   To ensure that retail investors are able to use Form CRS as intended,  the SEC conducted a nationwide online survey of 1,800 individuals and  31 qualitative, in-depth interviews in Denver and Pittsburgh. The mixed  results of the SEC's testing of Form CRS showed that changes and  possibly more testing were necessary.   Unfortunately, in that instance, the SEC did not engage in the  robust, iterative investor testing that H.R. 1815 would require, and  finalized a vague disclosure.   H.R. 1815 would require the SEC to go back and review and test  existing disclosures like Form CRS and determine whether changes should  be made. This review of existing documents is particularly important as  the capital markets, investor behaviors, and investing trends change.   In addition to the SEC, other regulators like the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission also engage in  usability testing of their disclosures.   H.R. 1815 builds on the efforts of the SEC by requiring the  Commission to engage in a similar iterative process for all existing or  future disclosure, intended to help retail investors make informed  investment decisions.   I thank Representative Casten for putting forth this commonsense  piece of legislation that will help investors make better informed  financial decisions regarding their hard-earned earnings.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Casten), who will correct all the misstatements that were  just made by the gentleman from Michigan. Representative Casten is the  sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who is the chairwoman for the  Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital  Markets.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1815 is a commonsense bill that is supported by  our Nation's seniors, investment advisers, and investor advocates. Here  is what they have said about the bill:   According to AARP, they wrote: ``AARP, on behalf of our nearly 38  million members and all older Americans nationwide, is pleased to  endorse H.R. 1815, which would require the Securities and Exchange  Commission to conduct investor testing when developing rules and  regulations about disclosures to retail investors. Robust investor  testing of retail investor disclosures will assist investors in getting  the information they need to make informed choices about their hard- earned savings.''   According to the Financial Planning Coalition: ``The coalition  believes that H.R. 1815 would provide the statutory framework necessary  for the SEC to ensure to Congress and Main Street investors that  disclosures required under SEC rules have been thoroughly and  adequately tested by the SEC and are reasonably effective in achieving  their intended purpose.''   According to the Consumer Federation of America: ``Disclosure is both  an important investor protection tool and a regulatory requirement that  imposes significant cost on industry. We, therefore, have an obligation  to make those disclosures as effective as possible. H.R. 1815 would  help to achieve that goal by updating the SEC's approach to disclosure  development. Anyone who supports commonsense, evidence-based regulation  should support this legislation.''   Mr. Chair, before reserving the balance of my time, I include in the  Record correspondence from the Financial Planning Coalition, the AARP,  and the CFA, that is the Consumer Federation of America.                                   Financial Planning Coalition,                                                   October 11, 2019.      Re Support for H.R. 1815, the ``SEC Disclosure Effectiveness           Testing Act''.         Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the Financial       Planning Coalition (Coalition), we are writing to express our       strong support for H.R. 1815, the ``SEC Disclosure       Effectiveness Testing Act.'' We encourage you to support the       legislation when it is considered on the House floor in the       coming week.        A fundamental public policy goal of the federal securities       laws is to ensure full and adequate disclosure of       ``material'' information to American investors. The       expectation is that the disclosure will assist investors in       making an informed investment decision. Given this, we       appreciate the work the U.S. Securities and Exchange       Commission's (SEC) Office of the Investor Advocate has done       to identify and confront the challenges to improve investor       disclosure.        Research conducted on behalf of AARP, Consumer Federation       of America and the Coalition organizations, as well as       separate research conducted by the SEC, all highlight the       challenges and difficulties in developing clear,       understandable investor disclosures. Information about       financial issues and investments is often complex and       technical in nature, and investor comprehension of this       information typically is poor. All too often, mandated       disclosures contain technical language and concepts that, as       research confirms, are confusing to or misunderstood by       investors. Indeed, research studies prove time and again how       difficult it is to convey even the most basic financial and       investment concepts in a way that typical Main Street       investors understand.        To determine whether proposed investor disclosures would be       effective at achieving their regulatory purpose of informing       investor decision-making, it is not enough simply to survey       investors generally on their likes or preferences. Thorough       and adequate investor testing must go beyond that and, more       importantly, must assess investors' ability to integrate       information and synthesize it into a rational evaluation.       This involves a more complex and higher-level cognitive       skill. Conducting thorough one-on-one cognitive testing is       the only proven way to determine whether a proposed       disclosure document will achieve its intended purpose.        For these reasons, we are particularly pleased that the       proposed legislation includes a requirement for qualitative       testing in the form of one-on-one cognitive interviews of       investors. A deeper look into the way investors analyze and       synthesize information is necessary to determine the       usefulness and effectiveness of any disclosure document in an       investor's decision-making process.        The Coalition believes that H.R. 1815 will provide the       statutory framework necessary for the SEC to ensure to       Congress and Main Street investors that disclosures required       under SEC rules have been thoroughly and adequately tested by       the SEC and are reasonably effective in achieving their       intended purpose. The legislation to be considered on the       House floor appropriately clarifies that the scope of testing       is limited to those disclosures that are intended to be used       by retail investors in choosing a financial professional or       investment product. The modified legislation to be considered       on the House floor makes additional important clarifications       that the Coalition supports.        We urge a ``Yes'' vote when the legislation comes up for a       vote on the House floor.            Sincerely,      Kevin R. Keller, CAE,        Chief Executive Officer, CFP Board.      Lauren Schadle, CAE,        Executive Director/CEO, FPATM.      Geoffrey Brown, CAE,        Chief Executive Officer, NAPFA.                                   ____                                                    AARP                                   Washington, DC, October 16, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: AARP, on behalf of our nearly 38       million members and all older Americans nationwide, is       pleased to endorse H.R. 1815, which would require the       Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct investor       testing when developing rules and regulations about       disclosures to retail investors. Robust investor testing of       retail investor disclosures will assist investors in getting       the information they need to make informed choices about       their hard-earned savings.        AARP has a long history of fighting for investor       protections and is especially eager to provide clarity and       transparency to the often confusing and overly complicated       investment world. AARP has experienced firsthand the value of       investor testing to provide individuals with meaningful       information needed for financial decision-making. In response       to the SEC's proposed Client Relationship Summary (CRS)       disclosure forms, AARP commissioned two, independent rounds       of research  [[Page H8214]]       and testing to gauge retail investor understanding. The       findings provided valuable information that helped guide our       recommendations for design and content modifications to       improve consumer understanding. AARP believes that such       retail testing should be utilized extensively by the SEC for       the development of effective, consumer facing disclosures.        AARP appreciates that creating effective disclosure is       often a difficult and daunting task. We also understand that       the price of ineffective disclosures can be poor investment       decisions and inadequate levels of retirement savings. We       believe testing is imperative for facilitating informed       decision-making on the part of consumers trying to save and       invest their hard-earned money.        We look forward to working with you and your colleagues to       increase transparency and access to critical and       understandable information, as well as facilitate informed       decisionmaking for older Americans making investment       decisions and saving for their retirement. If you have any       questions, please feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                                   Bill Sweeney,       Senior Vice President, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                     Consumer Federation of America.        Dear Representative: We understand that H.R. 1815, the SEC       Disclosure Effectiveness Testing Act, will soon be brought to       the House floor for a vote. We are writing to urge you to       vote yes on this pro-investor bill, which would help to       ensure that the disclosures retail investors rely on convey       as effectively as possible the key information needed to make       an informed choice about decisions that are critical to their       financial wellbeing.        The sad reality is that the disclosures investors receive       when choosing investment professionals or evaluating       investment options often do a poor job of conveying       critically important information in a way that typical retail       investors can understand. This includes cost disclosures that       don't clearly convey costs, risk disclosures that don't       clearly convey risks, and conflict of interest disclosure       that do not clearly convey the nature or impact of those       conflicts. Evidence of this can be found, for example, in a       2018 SEC proposal to create a summary prospectus for variable       products that, while sound in concept, is long, dense, poorly       organized, and full of technical jargon.        As a result, retail investors, and particularly the least       sophisticated retail investors, are too often flying blind       when making investment decisions that will affect their       ability to afford a secure and independent retirement or fund       other long-term financial goals. There are several reasons       for this. One is the inherent difficulty of the Securities       and Exchange Commission's task of developing clear       disclosures of complex topics for a non-expert retail       audience. But the other is the SEC's failure to adopt best       practices widely used by industry and some other government       agencies to develop more effective disclosures, including       incorporating qualitative testing of disclosure effectiveness       early in the development process.        This bill would help to correct the second of these two       problems. It would do so, first, by requiring the SEC to       incorporate qualitative disclosure effectiveness testing in       the development of new disclosures designed for retail       investors. Importantly findings of the testing would have to       be made available for public comment. This would both hold       the SEC accountable for addressing those findings in any       rulemaking subject to the testing requirement and provide all       stakeholders with an opportunity to weigh in.        Second, the bill would require the SEC, with input from the       Office of Investor Advocate, to develop a plan for testing       existing retail disclosures, without imposing a rigid       timeframe for completing that review. Appropriately,       disclosures primarily relied on by institutional investors,       analysts, and other sophisticated market participants would       not be subject to the testing requirement. This, along with       the involvement of the Office of Investor Advocate in       determining which existing disclosures are priorities for       testing, would help to ensure resources are devoted to       testing the disclosures most important for retail investors.        Disclosure is both an important investor protection tool       and a regulatory requirement that imposes significant costs       on industry. We, therefore, have an obligation to make those       disclosures as effective as possible. H.R. 1815 would help to       achieve that goal by updating the SEC's approach to       disclosure development. Anyone who supports common sense,       evidence-based regulation should support this legislation.            Respectfully submitted,      Barbara Roper,        Director of Investor Protection.      Micah Hauptman,        Financial Services Counsel.     I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I must admit that I am a bit surprised at this  opposition. I am a bit surprised at this opposition because, first of  all, everyone must understand that the SEC is our cop on the block.  This agency has, as its basic mission, to protect investors.   Who best to be protected than the small, retail investors? We have so  many schemes, so much fraud that we witness every day that is being  brought forth to basically take advantage of the most vulnerable people  in our society, many of them who don't have a lot of resources, who  don't have money that they could lose. So, we believe that they must  understand in what they are investing.   This is not about the big, institutional investors. This is about  your retail investors. This is about the little  [[Page H8215]]  guy. This is about those people who are depending on the information  that they get and their investment advisers to help guide them so they  can have enough money in retirement, for example.   Why is it we would have any elected official coming to represent the  people from their districts who would be opposed to making sure that  these small investors are represented, that they are protected, that  they are cared about?   So, I am surprised at this opposition, and I don't know why there  would be so much time spent saying that the SEC does not need to do  additional kinds of testing, that they don't need to be concerned about  these disclosures.   What is it you need to protect about the SEC from doing its basic  job? I don't understand that.   But, however, let me just say that H.R. 1815 is a commonsense bill  that benefits mom-and-pop investors by putting a process in place to  ensure that the SEC's disclosures are clear and comprehensible for  those investors.   A disclosure is only useful if it can be understood by its audience,  and this legislation ensures that disclosures are tested in a robust  way so that they are clear.   This bill is supported, again, by groups such as the AARP, our  seniors; the Financial Planning Coalition; and the Consumer Federation  of America, looking out for consumers.   I, again, commend Representative Casten for putting forth this  important legislation, and I thank him for his work. But, more than  that, I thank him as a new Member of Congress who understands that his  job, his responsibility, is to look out for his constituents and for  the small investors, the little people, those people who need some  protection, those people who don't need to be ripped off, those people  who need to have clear information and disclosure about what they are  getting into.   I thank Representative Casten for his vision, for his foresight, and  for understanding the responsibility of the SEC.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is unnecessary and could  undermine the investor understanding of how retail investors relate to  brokers.   H.R. 1815, the SEC Disclosure Effectiveness Testing Act, simply  requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to test its documents  with retail investors through one-on-one interviews and surveys to  ensure that disclosure documents intended for retail investors are  actually understood by their target audience.   H.R. 1815 is in no way intended to repeal Regulation Best Interest, a  rule adopted by the SEC in June to change the standard of conduct for  brokers when providing retail investors with personalized investment  advice.   And, to be clear, the bill does not require testing of the standard  imposed by the SEC under Regulation Best Interest. Instead, it requires  testing of how well retail investors understand the standard and how it  impacts the advice they receive, along with any other disclosures.   In addition, the bill contemplates that the SEC, in consultation with  the investor advocate, would develop a schedule of disclosures that it  intends to test and report to Congress. There is nothing in the bill  that requires investor testing of disclosures related to Regulation  Best Interest on day one of enactment.    But this amendment would say that the SEC should never test these  disclosures, regardless of changes to the markets, investment product  offerings, investor behaviors, and investment trends. This makes little  sense, particularly considering the rise of riskier products like  cryptocurrencies that are being targeted to retail investors.   I would also point out that, to the extent that the SEC, in  consultation with the investor advocate, determines that it should make  substantial changes to the disclosures that would have a significant  impact on retail investors, H.R. 1815 would simply require the SEC to  test new and existing disclosure forms to ensure that they are actually  understood by the intended audience.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, I ask all of my colleagues to do  so, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire how much time I  have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Casten), the sponsor of this important  legislation.                                time  1315     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First, let me just say, no matter how many amendments the opposite  side can come up with, no matter how many ways they try to explain why  they are not speaking for the retail investors, the small folks, the  people with not a lot of resources, the people who depend on good  information to be disclosed to them, they can come up with all the  amendments they want, but no one thinking clearly about this will  understand why they are trying to protect the SEC, our cop on the  block, from doing everything they possibly can do to protect our  seniors and our most vulnerable people.   So H.R. 1815 seeks, again, to ensure that disclosures specifically  designed for the most vulnerable investors, including mom-and-pop  retail investors, can actually be used and understood by their intended  audiences. Isn't that a simple request in this bill, that our most  vulnerable retail investors understand what they are investing in, that  that information should be disclosed to them? I don't get the arguments  against it.   This amendment, however, directly conflicts with the scope of the  bill,  [[Page H8219]]  which covers new as well as existing disclosures. Requiring existing  disclosures to be subjected to investor testing makes good sense.  Evidence has shown many existing disclosures are not understood. The  evidence is there that tells you that we have discovered that the  disclosures are not understood by these vulnerable people. We have  information that documents that, that the investors, the small  investors, these seniors, don't understand. This bill is about helping  them to understand what they are signing on the dotted line for.   Mandatory disclosures that are unused or not understood impose  unnecessary costs on the companies making those disclosures, and  importantly, fail to inform retail investors of key risks that they  should know when making investment decisions.   However, this amendment that is before you would treat disclosures  that are put forth before the next Presidential election as perfect,  without need for further investor input through testing. Such an  exemption is inconsistent with the object and purpose of this bill.   This undermines H.R. 1815 and its value to retail investors. So I  could say this another 100 ways, they can come up with all the  amendments they want to come up with; the fact of the matter is, this  bill that is put forward by Mr. Casten is to protect the citizens who  need the information the most, because they are vulnerable. And so  having said that, I would urge my colleagues to join me in opposing  this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Casten), the author of this bill, to  continue to tell the public why we must protect the most vulnerable in  our society.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
