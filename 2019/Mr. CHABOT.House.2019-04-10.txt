 Mr. Speaker, when I was reading the Cincinnati Enquirer  online this morning, an article headline grabbed my attention: ``Last  WW II Doolittle Raider dies.'' Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole was 103  when he passed away Tuesday in Texas.   There were 80 Raiders, and the fifth last to survive was Tom Griffin,  from my Cincinnati, Ohio, district, who was 96 when he died a couple of  years ago. I had the honor of getting to know Tom well over the years.  He was a wonderful guy, and, yes, he was a hero.   That is a term that gets used quite frequently nowadays; but Tom  Griffin, and Dick Cole, and the other 78 brave Americans who took off  that night from the USS Hornet truly were heroes.   Only months after the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor, their  daring feat gave America a much-needed shot in the arm that was a first  and major step in winning that war.   Now these 80 courageous, gallant, patriotic Doolittle Raiders are all  gone, but they will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
