 Mr. Speaker, I rise as well as a member of the House  Ethics Committee to assure the public that the House Ethics Committee  takes these matters very seriously. I rise in strong support of H. Res.  630, and I hope that it passes unanimously today. I commend Barbara  Comstock and Jackie Speier for their tremendous work in this area.   Congress should be leading on this issue, helping to foster a  workplace environment free of sexual harassment, discrimination, and  other terrible behavior. Congress must ensure an atmosphere where those  who serve their country here feel protected, supported, and believed,  particularly young people who come here with such idealism, no matter  the power of the offender. I take these matters seriously, as should  every Member of Congress.   The reports that taxpayer funds have been used for settlements  related to harassment by Members of Congress are rightfully infuriating  to the American people and to me personally. We need transparency and  accountability and to end any sexual harassment settlements paid by  taxpayers.   Today's action ensures that thousands of House employees know their  rights and the services offered to victims. I strongly urge a ``yes''  vote.
