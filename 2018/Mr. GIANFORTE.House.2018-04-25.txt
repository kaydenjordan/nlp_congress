 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3144,  which will bring certainty to the management of the Federal Columbia  River Power System.   For generations, the system has provided thousands of Montanans with  clean, low-cost energy. Compliance with environmental mandates and  litigation, however, threaten our way of life.   The Bonneville Power Administration spent over $700 million to comply  with environmental red tape in 1 year alone. Thirty percent of those  costs were passed on to taxpayers. A recent court-ordered spill  released nearly $40 million of potential hydropower. Approximately  130,000 Montana taxpayers will pay a portion of the costs for this  court-mandated spill. This increase is on top of rate hikes of up to 50  percent that western Montana electric co-ops have faced since 2011.   It is time to bring certainty to the operations of the Columbia River  System.   Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this bipartisan bill, I urge my  colleagues to bring some relief to Montana taxpayers and pass H.R.  3144.
