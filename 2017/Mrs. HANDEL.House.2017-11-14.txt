 Mr. Speaker, the last time we had real tax reform in  this country was 1986.   To achieve economic growth in the 21st century, we need a Tax Code  designed for the 21st century. The status quo is simply not getting it  done. It is not good enough.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a bold, transformative step that  simplifies our Tax Code and reduces the tax burden on working Americans  and middle-income families. This bill reduces the Federal tax rate for  the majority of low- and middle-income Americans while doubling the  standard deduction. More than 65 percent of filers in Georgia's Sixth  Congressional District use that standard deduction.   What does it mean?   It means that a married couple will be able to pay not a dime of tax  on their first $24,000 of income every year.   The bill will also fuel economic growth and job creation. Small  businesses will be at the lowest tax rate since World War II. The Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act contains real tangible benefits for the majority of  American taxpayers. I support this bill enthusiastically and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
