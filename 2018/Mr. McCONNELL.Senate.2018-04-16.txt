 Mr. President, I want to begin this afternoon by  commending the men and women who make up the world's most capable  military. Over the weekend, America's all-volunteer Armed Forces  executed a challenging mission with precision and with excellence. At  the President's order, the United States joined with our British and  French allies in military action to respond to Bashar al-Assad's use of  chemical weapons against the Syrian people.   I support both the actions taken and the underlying objectives.   The tactics the Assad regime has deployed to consolidate gains and  terrorize the people of Syria have stood in defiance of the clear U.S.  position that the use of chemical weapons is simply unacceptable. It  was time to act.   Americans have become used to flawless execution on the part of our  uniformed military. Times like these compel us to pause and appreciate  their excellence and their heroism. We must remember that none of it  could occur without extensive training, careful planning, robust  investment, and the professionalism, dedication, and bravery of our  servicemembers.  [[Page S2132]]    Mr. President, on a completely different matter, this afternoon the  Senate will vote to advance legislation from Senator Moran that would  bolster the proper sovereignty of American Indian Tribes in the face of  excessive Federal regulations.   From the passage of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 all the  way until 2004, the NLRB respected the sovereignty status of Tribal  government employers. But because the law does not technically provide  that exemption, the NLRB discarded that precedent in 2004 and has  become entangled in local Tribal decisions.   By intervening in Tribal affairs on a case-by-case basis, the NLRB  has effectively been picking winners and losers among different  businesses. The result has been regulatory confusion and a lessening of  Tribal governments' authority to govern their own lands.   This legislation would correct the 83-year-old oversight that led to  this confusion. It would codify in law that federally recognized Tribal  governments should be exempt from such regulation, just like other  State and local governments.   More than 160 Tribes, Tribal corporations, and Tribal trade  associations support Senator Moran's legislation. I am proud to support  it as well, and I urge every one of us to vote to advance the bill  later this afternoon.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, tomorrow's tax filing deadline is not exactly a  national holiday, but millions of Americans use the end of tax season  as a time to pause and to take stock. In recent weeks, at kitchen  tables in Kentucky and across the country, working families have been  crunching the numbers. For too long, our country's outdated and unfair  Tax Code made life more difficult than it needed to be for middle-class  families. Now all of that is changing.   Tomorrow marks the last time America's working families,  entrepreneurs, and job creators will have to file under that old Tax  Code. This Republican Congress and President Trump got rid of it and  put a brandnew 21st century Tax Code in its place. Now Americans are  rightly anticipating a better year ahead, and they aren't having to  wait very long.   President Trump is in Florida today to hold a roundtable discussion  with small business owners. On Main Streets from Miami to Tallahassee,  tax reform is empowering local employers to create more prosperity for  their employees and for their communities.   In Melbourne, the owner of Stellar Transport, a shuttle service that  works closely with Florida's elderly, is using tax savings to raise  wages, expand paid vacation, and cover a 26-percent increase in  healthcare costs for his 60 employees.   In Jacksonville, Magellan Transport Logistics is planning to buy a  new 47,000-square-foot facility and hire 100 new employees as part of  an ambitious plan to succeed under the new pro-growth Tax Code. Of  course, these are among the first fruits of the U.S. economy under this  historic new law.   Millions of U.S. workers are receiving bonuses, raises, and special  benefits, not to mention lower utility rates and increased  opportunities. As employers adopt new withholding practices, more and  more workers will see more of their own money going into their own  pockets.   Florida's workers and entrepreneurs should be proud of Senator Rubio,  who was instrumental in getting tax reform across the finish line. In  particular, his efforts helped Republicans to secure a significant  increase in the child tax credit.   It is surprising that Florida's senior Senator didn't want any part  of all these tax cuts and new jobs. He took every opportunity to vote  with every other Democrat and try to block these tax cuts from  happening. Fortunately, Republicans overcame partisan opposition and  made tax reform a reality.                   Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 2667    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk due for a  second reading.

Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Udall.
