 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my remarks in  opposition to this sham impeachment.   Madam Speaker, the talking points that we have heard all day are the  same that have been repeated for months--and they all point to the same  conclusions: the President did not abuse his power and he has been  subjected to the most partisan, lopsided impeachment attempt in  history.   President Trump said there was no quid pro quo. President Zelensky  said there was no quid pro quo. The two people with any direct  knowledge both said that there was no crime. Despite that, one of my  colleagues--the same one who publicly claimed for over a year that he  had seen clear evidence that the President was a Russian spy--secretly  met with a whistleblower who had heard that the President had withheld  aid for a quid pro quo. Now, we don't know if that knowledge came to  the whistleblower second, third, or even fourth hand because we weren't  allowed to question them--we just know it was hearsay.   What is readily apparent after years of this garbage is that the  Democrat party simply cannot accept the will of the American people.  Robert Mueller investigated the Russian collusion hoax for over a year  and cleared that cluster of lies with his report. Rather than indemnify  President Trump for promoting and campaigning on that sham, my  colleagues across the aisle cooked up another scandal to deliver on  their impeachment promises.   In 2024 there will be no Soviet-bloc countries left to accuse the  President of colluding with and then what will you do?
