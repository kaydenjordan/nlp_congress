 Mr. Chairman, I believe I have a couple of amendments at  the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would extend by 1 year the  deadline by which States may apply for Federal grant assistance to set  up State-based health insurance markets, moving the deadline from  December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023.                                time  1630    My amendment would also extend by 1 year the corresponding date by  which the exchanges must be self-sustaining, from January 1, 2024, to  January 1, 2025.   Currently, 11 States and the District of Columbia have such health  insurance exchanges. However, no health exchanges have been established  since the ACA's original deadline of 2015.   While I do support H.R. 987's language which provides an additional  2-year window for States to establish their own insurance exchanges,  given the complexity of the current debate with the possibility of  single-payer healthcare out there and also Medicare for All, it is my  hope and expectation that, by extending these application periods from  2 to 3 years, more States will have the opportunity to weigh those  outstanding options and explore the option to establish their own  State-based exchanges.   It was reported recently that the Governor of New Jersey, for  example, has announced that his State would seek to establish its own  State-based healthcare exchange for 2021. It is quite possible that  other States that may have held off in setting up similar exchange  marketplaces and are contemplating those other possibilities could also  be reconsidering setting up an exchange, and that is the reason for my  amendment. I believe that ensuring that States have the time to  consider and plan for setting up such an exchange is the right thing to  do.   I would note that my amendment does not seek additional funding  during that time period, so it will not increase the cost. It simply  gives States additional time.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment as well as the  underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think I have said enough. It is a technical  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have another amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment directs the Government Accountability  Office to prepare a cost-benefit analysis of the establishment of a  State-sponsored public health insurance option for States that may want  to offer public options in their State's health insurance exchanges.   A State-run public option would allow individual States to offer very  basic, low-cost insurance plans without the high cost of commercial  advertising and other overhead costs that can sometimes add as much as  30 percent to the cost of some health insurance plans, or perhaps  States could optimize the use of community health centers that we all  love so much. Once these low-cost public option plans are on the  market, private insurance companies would be forced to compete with  that lower price by offering similar low-cost plans.   State-sponsored public options could help address the lack of  competition that is driving up the cost of healthcare in many States  where one or two insurance companies are allowed to dominate the market  due to the fact that the Affordable Care Act currently exempts  insurance companies from antitrust laws.   While State-run public options were a feature in the original  version, the House version of the ACA, which I supported, Senate action  deleted that from the final versions of the ACA which eventually passed  and which I opposed.   I believe that the information that the study will provide will be an  important resource for States in regions looking to offer more  healthcare options to their residents.   Mr. Chairman, one of the loudest messages that came out of the last  mid-term election was that, 9 years after the passage of the ACA, the  American people still want us to fix their broken healthcare system.   For many people, the Affordable Care Act is not affordable. But I  believe it is fixable. Many fervent supporters of the ACA are also  disappointed with the lack of success in reaching the goals of the ACA  so that they are now supporting efforts to repeal the ACA in favor of  single-payer or Medicare for All proposals.   I believe there are some significant changes that could be made to  the ACA to make it work. This study will be a simple way to provide our  States with guidance that can help them determine whether a public  option may be right for them.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support both this amendment and  the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
