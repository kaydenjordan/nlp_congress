 Mr. Speaker, right now, 3.5 million Americans, our  fellow citizens, are facing a humanitarian crisis. In Puerto Rico, the  majority of people still lack basic electricity, clean drinking water,  and medicine, the bare basic necessities just to stay alive--not to  speak of the basic resources they need to begin the great task of  rebuilding their lives and their communities.   It has been days since the hurricane passed over Puerto Rico leaving  death and destruction in its wake. The people of Puerto Rico are  literally crying out for help. There are far too many, especially those  in rural communities, who still have not been reached by those bringing  aid. As a Representative from an island State in Hawaii, I can only  imagine their frustration and desperation.   I urge the administration to dedicate all available resources to  helping the people of Puerto Rico. Work with Congress to pass an  emergency aid package to ensure that those delivering aid have what  they need to help the people of Puerto Rico and save lives.                            ____________________
