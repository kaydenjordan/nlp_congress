 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 233 years ago, our Founding Fathers  gathered in Philadelphia, just a few miles north of us in Delaware.  Eleven years earlier, we had declared our independence from the British  Crown, the most powerful empire in the world. Despite long odds, David  overcame Goliath, and we won our independence, but would the government  of this new Nation endure?   When the Founders gathered in Philadelphia that summer of 1787, they  began debating a new form of government. At times, the differences  between our Founders--Northern States, Southern States, small States,  and large States--seemed irreconcilable. However, a great compromise  was eventually reached, and an intricate system of checks and balances  was written into a governing document, the Constitution of the United  States.   Nebraska Senator William Jennings Bryan once remarked: ``Destiny is  not a matter of chance. It is a matter of choice.'' Our Constitution  has endured longer than any other on Earth, in large part because we  did not leave our destiny to chance. Today, our Constitution remains  the longest lasting Constitution in the world.   Our Founders, despite their many disagreements, made the crucial  choice that this new Constitution would not lead to the creation of an  all-powerful King. They came from places where they had done that, been  there, and they didn't want to go through that again. Instead, the  Constitution created three separate, coequal branches of government--an  executive branch, a legislative branch, and a judicial branch. This  ingenious system would ensure that a future President with the impulses  of a King would be restrained by the other two branches.   The Constitution also provided another backstop against abuses from a  future President who committed treason, bribery, or other high crimes  and misdemeanors. That constitutional backstop is called impeachment.   As we consider the impeachment of Donald J. Trump, I ask my  colleagues to remember that while we are here today because of the  conduct of one man, the Constitution that guides us through these  choppy waters some 233 years later is the triumph and wisdom of many  men. We are here because of patriots like Washington, Adams, Jefferson,  Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, and many others who lived under the harsh  rule of a King and fought for the freedom to govern themselves.   Our Constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power of  impeachment, while the Senate has the sole power to conduct a trial in  the event the House impeaches a sitting President.   We are now at the end of the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump. It  is not the trial that many of us had hoped for. We had hoped for a fair  trial. The American people deserve a fair trial. A fair trial has  witnesses. A fair trial has evidence.   I don't believe that history will be kind to those who have and  continue to prevent the truth from coming to light during this trial.  The American people deserve to know the truth, as does this jury, the  Members of the United States Senate.   President Lincoln once said:         I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth,       they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis.    Thomas Jefferson said something very similar to that. He said that if  the people know the truth, they won't make a mistake.   The same is true of the Senate. If given the truth, we, too, can be  depended upon to meet this crisis and do the right thing. I believe the  truth will not only set us free but keep us free.   We now have an obligation to consider the evidence presented by House  managers and the President's defense team related to two Articles of  Impeachment--one, abuse of power; two, obstruction of Congress.   The House managers have presented a case that is a result of a 3- month-long investigation during which the House Intelligence Committee  issued scores of subpoenas for documents and testimony. Donald Trump  obstructed this process from the start. No President--not even  President Richard Nixon during Watergate--has ever issued an order to  direct a witness to refuse to cooperate in an impeachment inquiry. As a  result of this unprecedented obstruction, the Trump administration did  not provide a single document to the House of Representatives--not one.   Fortunately, those 17 brave public servants, many of whom risked  their careers, came forward to testify under oath, and here is what we  learned from them.   Donald Trump used the powers of his office to pressure the Government  of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election on his behalf and to smear  his  [[Page S831]]  most feared political opponent, our former colleague, former Vice  President Joe Biden. Donald Trump did this by illegally withholding  funds appropriated by Congress to help an ally, Ukraine, in the midst  of a hot war against Russia. Donald Trump did this by withholding a  coveted White House meeting from the newly elected President of  Ukraine, President Zelensky.   This President illegally withheld the funds and a meeting until  President Zelensky merely announced sham investigations involving Vice  President Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not  Russia, interfered in the 2016 election. And when he got caught in the  midst of this corrupt scheme, President Trump even called for other  foreign nations to interfere on his behalf in the upcoming 2020  election.    While I believe the evidence against Donald Trump is overwhelming,  like any criminal defendant, he is entitled to a robust defense.   Many of us listened carefully to the President's defense team over  the course of his 2-week trial. Not once did the President's defense  team rebut the facts of the case. Not once did they defend their  client's character or call an eyewitness who could contradict the  assertions made by witnesses who testified under oath. Not once did we  hear the President's defense team say: Of course, the President  wouldn't use the weight of the Federal Government to smear his  political rival.   What did we hear? Instead, we heard distractions, conspiracy  theories, unfounded smears about Vice President Biden--our former  colleague--and his family. Instead, we heard a farfetched legal theory  that Presidents cannot be impeached for soliciting foreign interference  in our elections if they believe their own reelection is in the  national interest.   I believe the House managers proved their case, and there now appears  to be some bipartisan agreement that the President abused his power.  Still, does this merit conviction and removal from office? Think about  that.   Our Constitution, agreed to in 1787, sought to establish ``a more  perfect Union''--not a perfect union, ``a more perfect Union.'' The  hard work toward a more perfect union did not end when Delaware became  the first State to ratify the Constitution on December 7, 1787. In  truth, it had only just begun. We went on as a nation to enact the Bill  of Rights, abolish slavery, give women the right to vote, and much,  much more.   Throughout our history, each generation of Americans has sought to  improve our government and our country because, after all, we are not  perfect.   In the words of Senator Bryan, we do not leave our destiny to chance.  We make it a matter of choice. And we choose to make this a more  perfect union, a reflection that the hard work begun in Philadelphia in  1787 is never--never--truly complete.   Our Constitution has weathered a Civil War, World War I, World War  II, Vietnam, Watergate, a Great Depression, a great recession, death of  Presidents, assassination of Presidents, and, yes, impeachment of  Presidents. Our Constitution will weather this storm too.   A vote to acquit this President does not exonerate this President. A  vote to acquit effectively legalizes the corruption of our elections-- the very foundation under our democratic process. A vote to acquit says  to the President, and to all who follow, that you may use the powers of  the office to solicit foreign interference in our elections--the very  thing that the Founding Fathers feared. A vote to acquit is the  realization of our Founders' worst fears: leaving a President with the  impulses of a King, unchecked by the other coequal branches of  government and undeterred by the prospect of impeachment.   Donald Trump violated his oath. He broke the law. He attempted to  cheat in the 2020 election, and when he got caught, he left little  doubt that he will cheat again. That is not the conduct we expect of an  American President. That is the conduct of someone who believes that he  or she is above the law. Donald Trump is our President. He is not our  King.   So colleagues, if our destiny is to remain the most enduring  democracy in the history of the world, we must not leave this to be a  matter of chance. We must choose to preserve and protect our  Constitution, and, to do so, we must convict Donald Trump on both  Articles of Impeachment and remove him from office.   As he left the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin  was asked this question we heard asked several times in the last 2  weeks on this floor. He was asked: ``What do we have, [what do we have  here] a monarchy or a republic?'' Franklin answered famously: ``A  republic, if you can keep it.''   Today I want to pose the same question to all of us, to our  colleagues, in this Chamber: What do we have here, a monarchy or a  Republic? I guess we can all answer for ourselves, but I want to leave  you with my answer today. Here it is. We have a Republic, and I intend  to keep it.   I yield the floor.
