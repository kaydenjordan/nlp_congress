 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity.  As he noted, the President has talked and tweeted incessantly about  creating jobs and infrastructure investment, but, unfortunately, the  only substantive proposal to come out of the White House that relates  to infrastructure, infrastructure investment, and jobs is in his  budget, and it actually reduces Federal investment in infrastructure,  which would basically eliminate jobs.   So I mean, the bill before us today, bipartisan bill on  apprenticeships is great, but you have got to apprentice for something  that is real: a job in the end, construction.   America is falling apart, and, right now, we have nothing but  rhetoric coming out of the White House, and now ideology. They are  talking about privatizing all of the infrastructure in the United  States so that you will pay tolls everywhere you go, and, you know,  they call it asset recycling. They have come up with a catchy new name.  That has been floated, but they haven't put any substance behind it.   So this amendment would allow the House to debate and pass H.R. 2510,  Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. This bill would  provide $25 billion in direct infrastructure investment over the next 5  years to address America's crumbling wastewater infrastructure and  local water quality challenges.    The state of our water infrastructure, according to the American  Society of Engineers' report card of 2017, is a D-plus. Meanwhile,  municipalities across the country have a backlog of more than $40  billion--B, billion--in clean water infrastructure projects, and,  according to the EPA, communities need close to $300 billion over the  next 20 years to bring their systems into a state of good repair.   It is clear that we cannot continue to neglect the serious needs of  our aging water infrastructure. As these systems fail and degrade, they  pose a risk to the health and safety of our citizens and obviously the  environment.   I know the President promised, during his campaign, to make clean  water a priority. I agree with that. He promised to triple funding for  State revolving loan fund programs to help States and local governments  upgrade critical drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.   Well, here is a chance to deliver on that promise. H.R. 2510 does  exactly that. It triples investment in America's crumbling water  infrastructure.   I was a county commissioner at a time when the Federal Government was  a good partner, and, in those days, they put up 85 percent of the cost  of our wastewater system. We put up the other 15. You know, this  could--by renewing this legislation and a commitment to the State  revolving loan fund programs and adding in a grant component for lower  income areas, that could, you know, be a great step in terms of Federal  partnership and creating actual jobs for the apprentices that this bill  wants to create.   There is widespread support for this legislation. I include in the  Record letters of endorsement from 30 separate groups.                                     Ohio Environmental Council,                                                       Columbus, OH.      Hon. Garret Graves,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace Napolitano,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and           Environment, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Napolitano: On       behalf of the Ohio Environmental Council, I am writing to       enthusiastically support the Water Quality  [[Page H5062]]       Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. This bill bolsters       the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) by authorizing $20       billion over five years for loans to improve wastewater       infrastructure in local communities. It also provides crucial       additional funding to help states control water pollution and       address challenges from outdated sewer systems.        The need for this bill has never been greater as the nation       faces a $40 billion backlog of clean water infrastructure       projects, with cities and towns needing $300 billion over 20       years to update their water systems. In Ohio, the American       Society of Civil Engineers found our state needs a total       $14.58 billion for wastewater improvements. The Clean Water       SRF is an essential resource to help meet this need.        The Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) program,       Ohio's Clean Water SRF, continues to provide fundamental       capacity to improve water quality for Ohio communities and       residents. The program includes several different loan       options that help both cities and rural communities prevent       water pollution. This includes funding to upgrade and replace       Home Sewage Treatment Systems (HSTS), as well as assistance       for wastewater collection and treatment, stormwater       activities, and efforts to reduce nonpoint source pollution.       Interest from the WPCLF program funds the preservation and       restoration of aquatic habitat to counter the loss of natural       systems that helped maintain the health of Ohio's water       resources.        Since its inception the Clean Water SRF has provided $7.2       billion serving 621 villages, cities, counties and sewer       districts helping to curb pollution while providing quality       jobs. To ensure this program's continuing success and help       Ohio address our water infrastructure needs, I urge your       support for the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act       of 2017.            Sincerely,                                             Heather Taylor-Miesle,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                           California Association of                                             Sanitation Agencies,                                                     Sacramento, CA.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Ranking Member, Committee on Public Works and Transportation,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace Napolitano,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and           Environment, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Members DeFazio and Napolitano: The California       Association of Sanitation Agencies (CASA) is pleased to       support your efforts to address the water infrastructure       funding gap and specifically the introduction of the Water       Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. For 60       years, CASA has been the leading voice for California's       public wastewater agencies on regulatory, legislative and       legal issues.        CASA agencies are faced with mounting challenges of aging       infrastructure, growing demands from increasing population,       and emerging challenges from changing climate conditions.       Confronted with these realities, there is clear demand for       increased infrastructure investment, including the need to       invest in water recycling infrastructure and clean energy       facilities derived from the wastewater treatment process.        Under your legislation, the Clean Water State Revolving       Fund (SRF) would be renewed at $20 billion over five years.       This authorization represents a critical down payment toward       a robust federal commitment to the nation's water       infrastructure needs. According to the report, the financial       burden to simply meet water quality and water-related public       health goals of the Clean Water Act (CWA) in California was       in excess of $26 billion in 2012. Due to drought conditions       and other strains on our wastewater systems, that figure has       only gone up over the last 5 years. Nationwide the demand for       all clean and drinking water infrastructure needs has been       estimated at more than $300 billion over the next two       decades. CASA also supports the bill's provisions to       authorize grant assistance for water recycling as well as the       programs to address stormwater flows and combined sewer       overflows. In California, the ability to construct water-      recycling projects is vital to a safe and reliable water       supply and to ensure protection of our ecosystems.        As you and your colleagues work to develop a comprehensive       water infrastructure policy for the nation, we look forward       to working with you to advance meaningful federal assistance       programs.                                                      Adam D. Link,      Director of Government Affairs.                                   ____                              American Society of Civil Engineers,                                        Washington, DC, May 2, 2017.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeFazio: The American Society of Civil       Engineers (ASCE) supports The Water Quality Protection and       Job Creation Act of 2017 to provide needed funds to fix the       nation's wastewater treatment systems.        The nation's wastewater treatment systems are the most       basic and critical infrastructure systems for protecting       public health and the environment, but are badly underfunded.       Nearly 240 million Americans--76% of the population--rely on       the nation's 14,748 treatment plants for wastewater       sanitation. By 2032 it is expected that 56 million more       people will connect to centralized treatment plants, rather       than private septic systems--a 23% increase in demand. In the       U.S., there are over 800,000 miles of public sewers and       500,000 miles of private lateral sewers connecting private       property to public sewer lines. Each of these conveyance       systems is susceptible to structural failure, blockages, and       overflows.        In March, ASCE released its 2017 Infrastructure Report       Card, which graded our nation's wastewater systems a ``D+.''       Many wastewater systems are aging and it's expected that over       the next two decades, requiring at least $271 billion to meet       current and future demands.        This legislation is an important step towards meeting our       country's wastewater investment needs and improving our       wastewater systems.            Sincerely,                                                 Brian Pallasch,                                       Managing Director, Government      Relations & Infrastructure Initiatives.                                   ____                                     Water Infrastructure Network,                                                        May 2, 2017.      Re WIN's Strong Support for the Water Quality Improvement and           Job Creation Act.       Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeFazio: The Water Infrastructure       Network (WIN), a coalition of the nation's leading       construction, engineering, municipal, conservation, public       works, labor and manufacturing organizations, strongly       supports the Water Quality Improvement and Job Creation Act.       WIN also commends your continued work to reauthorize our       nation's critical water infrastructure funding programs. The       United States is facing a water infrastructure funding crisis       as documented in recent reports by CBO, EPA and WIN pointing       to a shortfall in funding for clean water infrastructure that       exceeds $300 Billion over the next two decades. The Clean       Water Act was last reauthorized in 1987 and WIN believes that       consideration and passage of legislation providing       substantial increased investment in America's Water       Infrastructure is long overdue.        WIN is encouraged by the growing bipartisan support in       Congress for investing in our nation's clean water       infrastructure. The FY '17 Appropriation Package released       this week calls for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to       be funded at $1.39 Billion--a $414 M increase over the       original FY '17 funding request. The Trump Administration has       also made investments in our nation's water infrastructure a       top priority for the Environmental Protection Agency,       requesting increases in funding for both the Clean Water Act       and Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Funds in their       2018 Budget.        WIN believes Congress must seize this unique opportunity       make long overdue investments in our nation's critical water       infrastructure. Investments in water infrastructure make       eminent economic and environmental sense for our nation. WIN       is committed to working with you and the bipartisan       leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee       to advance water infrastructure funding legislation in the       First Session of the 115th Congress.            Sincerely,          The WIN Executive Committee--American Council of             Engineering Companies (ACEC), American Public Works             Association (APWA), American Society of Civil Engineers             (ASCE), Associated General Contractors of America             (AGCA), International Union of Operating Engineers             (IUOE), Laborers International Union of North America             (LIUNA), National Association of Clean Water Agencies             (NACWA), National Rural Water Association (NRWA),             United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (The             United), and the Vinyl Institute (VI).                                   ____                                  Oregon Water Resources Congress,                                         Salem, Oregon, May 3, 2017.      Re The Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017.       Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Washington, DC.        Representative DeFazio: On behalf of the Oregon Water       Resources Congress (OWRC), I am writing to express our       support of Congressman DeFazio's efforts to reauthorize the       Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and tackle the water       quality financing needs in the country under The Water       Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. The CWSRF is       an effective program that addresses critical water       infrastructure needs while benefitting the environment, local       communities, and the economy.        OWRC was established in 1912 as a trade association to       support the protection of water rights and promote the wise       stewardship of water resources statewide. OWRC members are       local governmental entities, which include irrigation       districts, water control districts, drainage districts, water       improvement districts, and other agricultural water suppliers       that deliver water to roughly 1/3 of all irrigated land in       Oregon. These water stewards operate complex water management       systems, including water supply reservoirs, canals,       pipelines, and hydropower facilities that serve a diverse set       of farmers, ranchers, and other water users contributing to       the local and global economy.  [[Page H5063]]         The CWSRF is a perfect example of the type of program that       should be reauthorized because it creates jobs while       benefitting the environment, and is an efficient return on       taxpayer investment. CWSRF funded projects provide family       wage jobs in construction and professional services industry       that are a crucial component to economic recovery in Oregon       and other states. Moreover, as a loan program, it is a wise       investment that allows local communities to leverage their       limited resources and address critical infrastructure needs       that would otherwise be unmet.        OWRC was very pleased to see the passage of the Water       Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN) by       Congress in December last year. An integral piece of the       funding puzzle for our member districts was reinstated by       this act, irrigation district eligibility for principal       forgiveness. The CWSRF is often an integral part of an       overall package of state, federal and local funding that       necessitates a stronger level of assurance that loan funds       will be available for planned water infrastructure projects.       Irrigation districts are often located in rural communities       and have a small number of farmers with limited capacity to       take on loan debt. Even a small reduction in the principal       repayment obligations can make the difference in whether or       not a district can move forward with a project.        The CWSRF program is an important tool utilized by OWRC       members across Oregon, and we applaud this effort by       Congressman DeFazio to reauthorize this key program. OWRC       looks forward to working with the Committee and this Congress       as the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017       moves forward.            Sincerely,                                                    April Snell,                                                 Executive Director,      Oregon Water Resources Congress.                                   ____                                              Southern Environmental                                                      Law Center,                                        Washington, DC, May 3, 2017.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jimmy Duncan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace F. Napolitano,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and the           Environment, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives DeFazio, Napolitano and Duncan:       Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) writes in support of       the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017. At       a time when much of our nation's infrastructure is at a       breaking point, bolstering our national infrastructure funds       is more critical than ever. Thank you for your leadership on       clean water infrastructure investment.        This bill authorizes $20 billion in Federal grants over       five years to capitalize Clean Water State Revolving Funds       (Clean Water SRF). Across the country, many communities are       struggling with how to pay for needed investments and       upgrades to infrastructure that protects clean water and       public health. According to the 2012 Clean Watersheds Needs       Survey, municipalities need close to $300 billion in       investment over the next 20 years to bring their wastewater       and stormwater management infrastructure to a state of good       repair.        The Clean Water SRF provides a critical source of funding       to states to address water infrastructure needs and reduce       pollution from stormwater and wastewater across the country.       This legislation will help communities address the estimated       $40 billion backlog in clean water infrastructure projects.       Additionally, this investment in our water infrastructure is       good for the economy. The report Water Works: Rebuilding       infrastructure, Creating Jobs and Greening the Environment       shows that investments in our water infrastructure, including       green infrastructure, would conservatively yield 1.9 million       American jobs and add $265 billion to the economy.        This legislation authorizes $20 billion in Federal grants       over five years for the Clean Water SRF to provide low-      interest loans and additional loan subsidizations to       communities for wastewater infrastructure. We are supportive       of efforts to increase the resiliency of treatment works to       natural or man-made disasters. In the face of a changing       climate, resiliency of our nation's infrastructure is       increasingly important.        Also, this legislation authorizes $2.5 billion over five       years for grants to address combined sewer overflows (CSOs)       and sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and recapture and reuse       of municipal stormwater. CSOs and SSOs pose a significant       health and safety risk to communities and can damage local       economies that are dependent on clean water and tourism. We       are supportive of funds to address this ongoing problem that       can cost communities significant resources to address.        Economists estimate that between 20,000 and 26,600       construction, engineering, and manufacturing jobs are created       for every billion dollars of federal investment in water       infrastructure. Investments in the Clean Water SRFs are       critical to protect public health, promote job creation, and       restore clean water in our rivers, lakes, and streams.        SELC appreciates your leadership on clean water       infrastructure investment and your continued work on reducing       pollution related to aging and inadequately funded       infrastructure.            Sincerely,                                              Navis A. Bermudez,                                        Deputy Legislative Director,                                 Southern Environmental Law Center.     And according to the National Utility Contractors  Association, every billion dollars invested in our Nation's water  infrastructure creates or sustains 27,000 real jobs in the private  sector. That means that the $20 billion in Federal investment in the  Clean Water State Revolving Fund, including H.R. 2510, would create or  sustain approximately 540,000 jobs.   This is real. It is real. Real jobs for real people and real  improvements in the infrastructure of this country. This would be a  great step forward, and I urge that my colleagues adopt the amendment.
