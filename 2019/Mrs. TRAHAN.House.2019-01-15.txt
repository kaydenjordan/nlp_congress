 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about what is now  the longest government shutdown in American history, its impact on the  hardworking men and women of Massachusetts, and the opportunity cost of  the current impasse.   Over the last several weeks, I have heard heartbreaking stories from  Federal workers and their families from across north central  Massachusetts. During a meeting I had last week in Andover with  furloughed IRS employees, I heard about veterans struggling to afford  their prescriptions and parents worrying about putting food on the  table.   One woman had just recently lost her husband and others were still  recovering from last September's gas explosions in the Merrimack  Valley. A few days earlier, I spoke with an air traffic controller at  Logan Airport who, after hearing President Trump's assurances from the  Oval Office that the budget standoff would not lead to a shutdown last  month, felt comfortable splurging on Christmas presents for his wife  and four children. Now, with the bills coming due and his pay stub  reading zero, he and his family are confronted with anxiety and  financial hardship.   Each of the over 800,000 Federal workers impacted by this shutdown,  close to 7,500 in Massachusetts alone, has a story to share. I am the  daughter of a union iron worker and the country's biggest union, the  AFL-CIO, has a saying: A fair day's wage for a fair day's work. We gain  nothing from punishing the dedicated Federal workforce, nor do we  position ourselves to recruit the best and the brightest if we can't  even keep the lights on.   Today, the majority in this Chamber continues to vote for legislation  that reopens the Federal Government, restores critical services, and  makes Federal employees financially whole again.   As we continue to wait on the President and his party's leadership in  the Senate to do the right thing by approving House-passed legislation  to end this shutdown, critical pieces of legislation languish as the  American people wait anxiously for Congress to act on real issues and  crises, not the manufactured one on the border.   Healthcare costs continue to rise. Our climate is rapidly changing as  coastal communities suffer from more intense storms and more frequent  flooding, while California has faced down some of the largest and  deadliest fires in the history of the State.   Gun violence continues to rip apart families and communities, and  more Americans died of an opioid overdose than died during the Vietnam  war. There is so much more we should be focused on.   Madam Speaker, we cannot allow shutting down the government over a  policy debate to become the new normal. I was here as a staffer in 1995  during Newt Gingrich's shutdown and remember feeling that it was an  unprecedented event, never to happen again. Sadly, that feeling was  wrong.   We were all elected to this body to debate issues that matter to the  American people. It is what our constituents expect us to do. It is  time to open the government and debate border security on the floor of  the people's House for all to see.   Ensuring the safety and the security of the United States is among  our most solemn responsibilities. I take it very seriously, but the  only crisis right now is the one the President is making.   Each day that the administration keeps the government closed, it  threatens the financial security of Federal workers, the people who  process our taxes, inspect our food, and ensure airport security as  well as all of the people who depend upon them.   Each day of the shutdown is a day lost supporting education,  improving roads and bridges, and providing affordable healthcare.   We have sent bill after bill to the upper Chamber to provide border  security and reopen the government. This week, we will do it again. If  the President wants to improve border security, he should work with  Democrats on real solutions.   Madam Speaker, I oppose a $5 billion wall. Experts say the wall won't  stop the flow of drugs or prevent visa overstays. The people who live  at the border don't want it. But wherever you stand on funding a border  wall, holding Federal employees and their families hostage is  unacceptable.   Madam Speaker, it is time to put people first, end this government  shutdown, and get back to work.                            ____________________
