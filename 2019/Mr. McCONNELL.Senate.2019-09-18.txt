 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment this  morning to mourn the passing of a devoted son of Louisville, KY, and  someone I was lucky to call a very dear friend.   I can say without exaggeration that David Jones, Sr., was the single  most influential friend and mentor I have had in my entire career. I  have never forgotten something he told me when I was starting out in  Jefferson County. He said: ``The most important word in the English  language is `focus.' ''   David used his extraordinary focus and many other talents to build an  extraordinary American business and to better his community. Whenever a  local need had somebody--almost everybody, actually--stumped, David  always seemed to end up in the thick of it, forging a path to success.   In the days ahead, many will rightly pay tribute to David's  brilliance and his determination, but he was also one of the kindest,  most decent, most generous individuals I have ever met. I will sorely  miss his friendship, and Kentuckians will miss his extraordinary  leadership.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, today  the Senate will have an opportunity to take the first procedural step  toward keeping the Federal Government funded and open.   At the end of July, the White House and the Speaker of the House  reached an agreement to guide the appropriations process. Both parties,  both Chambers, and both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue agreed to the  terms. We laid out top-line funding targets for defense and nondefense;  we swore off poison pill policy riders; and, unlike the past several  budget deals, which took a full year to negotiate while appropriations  languished, we finished this year's deal much earlier to ensure we had  enough time to move the appropriations bills.   In other words, congressional leaders and the President laid the  ground for a sensible, bipartisan funding process, but instead, over  the past week and a half, we have seen our Democratic colleagues  suggest that they may try to shoehorn their longstanding disagreements  with President Trump into this appropriations process. Even though we  all agreed not to insist on poison pills or change existing  Presidential authorities, Democrats are threatening to filibuster  Chairman Shelby's clean Defense bill over their disagreements with the  President on immigration policy.   I sure hope that doesn't happen. I hope our Democratic friends will  allow the process to move forward when we vote later today. The stakes  are high. We are talking about critical resources for the missions of  the Department of Defense. Our military commanders have told us that  this funding is vital to keeping peace with Putin's Russia, China, and  all their efforts to harm America's interests. Just days ago, Saudi  Arabian energy facilities literally went up in flames after what  appears to be a massive, coordinated attack by Iran.  [[Page S5548]]    In a world this dangerous, uncertain funding and continuing  resolutions will not cut it for our national defense. Our men and women  in uniform do not deserve to have the funding for their tools, their  training, and their own pay raise, by the way--pay raise--used as  leverage by Senate Democrats to try to extract concessions from the  White House.   So, look, I would urge each of our colleagues to join me today in  taking the first step toward fulfilling our obligation to keep this  country safe and secure.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, we are closely  monitoring events in the Middle East following that provocative and  dangerous Iranian attack on Saudi energy facilities, which included the  largest oil processing facility in the entire world.   As I said on Monday, Iran's reckless behavior is not just a threat to  the region but to the entire global economy, and it must be met with  swift consequences from the international community.   As the United States and our allies continue to learn more and weigh  our options, there has already been one positive lesson that should not  go unnoticed. While the attack has shaken global energy markets, to be  sure, the United States is in a much better position to weather the  storm than we might have been in past decades.   For years and years, an international attack of this magnitude would  have been virtually guaranteed to roil the U.S. economy and send gas  prices soaring for Americans at the pumps, but so far, this time  around, analysts don't expect this event to yield the significant  impacts we would have seen back in the seventies or even in the  nineties. Why is that? The answer is three words: American domestic  energy.   Over the last decade and often over the strenuous, strenuous  objections of Democrats, our Nation has made incredible strides toward  energy independence. We have explored new technologies, new methods,  and new ways to fuel America's prosperity right here at home, and it is  paying off big time. By 2015, our production had become so robust that  I led the charge to lift the outdated ban on crude oil exports. Late  last year, thanks in part to Republican policies, the United States  became a net exporter of oil for the first time in decades.   Get this: Across all forms of energy, the Department of Energy  projects that next year our Nation will export more energy than we  import for the first time since 1953. Let me say that again. Thanks  largely to Republican policies, our Nation is poised to become a net  energy exporter for the first time since the Eisenhower administration.   That is huge progress, not just for our economy but, as we have just  been reminded, for our national security as well. You would think the  country would be united in celebration, but not everyone is happy. Oh,  no. Last week, just days before this massive disruption in the Middle  East, House Democrats sent us several bills designed to limit domestic  energy development and literally tie America's hands. One of those  bills would have shut off exploration in a small portion of ANWR in  remote Alaska. They want to reverse something that had been sought for  40 years until Republicans secured it in 2017.   So, as far as I can tell from the bills the House keeps sending us,  the socialists who are calling the shots over there have never seen a  pipeline they didn't want to cancel. They have never seen a pipeline  they didn't want to cancel, a responsible development they didn't want  to kill, or a step toward American energy independence they didn't want  to reverse.   Along with the Democratic House, this also seems to describe their  party's Presidential candidates. Almost all of them have endorsed the  radical idea of ending oil and gas exploration on Federal lands not  only offshore but onshore, too. Let me say that again. Almost all of  them have endorsed the radical idea of ending oil and gas exploration  on Federal lands, not only offshore but onshore, too. That is today's  Democratic Party. This ideology has consequences for American  prosperity, but it also weakens our Nation's footing in the world.   Just days after these Democratic votes, we were offered a sobering  reminder of just how important American energy really is.   So here is the good news: This Republican Senate is on the job, and  we won't let Democrats take us backward. We won't let them reduce our  prosperity or make us more vulnerable to overseas chaos. Republicans  will keep working to help our Nation thrive.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany S. 1790.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the House insist upon its amendment to the       bill (S. 1790), entitled ``An Act to authorize appropriations       for fiscal year 2020 for military activities of the       Department of Defense, for military construction, and for       defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe       military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for       other purposes,'' and ask for a conference with the Senate on       the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.                               Compound Motion     Mr. President, I move that the Senate disagree to the  House amendment, agree to the request of the House for conference, and  authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.  [[Page S5563]]                                     Cloture Motion     I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived and that the cloture vote occur at a time to be determined by  the two leaders.    Now, Mr. President, this week our friend and  colleague, the senior Senator from Tennessee, will mark a major  milestone in his State's history.   As of tomorrow, Lamar Alexander will have served as Tennessee's  Governor or U.S. Senator for 24 years, 8 months, and 15 days--more  combined years and offices than any other Tennessean.   Of course, Senator Alexander also remains the only Tennessee Governor  ever popularly elected to the Senate. He is the only Tennessee  Republican to be undefeated in six statewide primary elections. And his  2008 general election vote total of 1,579,477 votes is still the  largest ever recorded by a Tennessee statewide candidate.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement from the  Tennessee secretary of state, Tre Hargett, who has calculated each of  these political accomplishments, be printed in the Record following my  remarks.   As impressive as these statistics are, all of Lamar Alexander's  colleagues know that political record-setting is not what makes him  tick. Here is something he likes to say about serving in the Senate:         It's hard to get here. It's hard to stay here. So while       you're here, you might as well try to accomplish something.    Well, he certainly lived out his own advice. During Senator  Alexander's very first term, he got 70 Senators to support his  bipartisan America COMPETES Act to help our country stay competitive  with the rest of the world. He even persuaded the Democratic and  Republican leaders to join forces as the principal sponsors. When it  was enacted in 2007, everyone knew who the chief engineer had been.   Senator Dan Inouye said at the time:         I wish to commend my colleague, Senator Alexander, for his       broad and very intricate history of bipartisanship. If all of       us in this body follow this process in all major legislation,       this would be a historic session. . . . I thank the Senator       from Tennessee very much.    That was Senator Dan Inouye from Hawaii.   Then in 2012, after being elected three times by his peers as  chairman of the Republican conference, Lamar did something that is not  often done around here: He gave up that power and his future ambitions  for elected Senate leadership in order to ``spend more time working to  achieve results on the issues I care the most about.''   Since then, not coincidentally, there have been a steady stream of  important new laws dealing with those very issues. Time after time,  Lamar has taken the lead, often as the principal sponsor or chief  engineer. He has worked behind the scenes. He has collaborated across  the aisle to get things done. He hasn't often stepped into the  spotlight himself, but he has almost always been the key driving force.   As chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, he worked with Senator  Patty Murray to fix No Child Left Behind. President Obama called it ``a  Christmas miracle,'' and the Wall Street Journal said it was the  greatest devolution of power to States in a quarter-century. The  Nation's Governors and the National Education Association recognized  Lamar with awards. We are dealing with a rare public servant who can  literally win plaudits from the Wall Street Journal editorial board and  the Nation's largest teachers union at the same time.   In 2013, Senator Alexander was one of a group of Senators who  revamped Federal student loans with a new market-based interest rate to  save hundreds of millions of dollars for students attending college.   In 2016, he and Senator Murray sponsored the 21st Century Cures Act.  It is landmark legislation that I was proud to be involved with and  view as the most significant law of that entire Congress.   In 2018, again with Senator Murray, he offered the landmark Opioid  Crisis Response Act. President Trump called it ``the single largest  bill to combat a drug crisis in the history of our country.''   Last year, working with Senator Hatch, he was the chief engineer of  once-in-a-generation legislation to ensure America's songwriters are  paid fair-market value for their work.   For the last 5 years, as chairman of the Energy and Water Development  Appropriations Subcommittee, he has worked with Ranking Member  Feinstein to deliver record funding for our National Laboratories,  funding to keep America No. 1 in supercomputing, and 6 years of full  funding for inland waterway infrastructure.   This is quite a distinguished record, and this is far from all of it.   I have heard that Senator Alexander explains to Tennesseans that they  can think of Congress like a split-screen television show. On one side  are the dramatic public fights, the partisan showdowns, but on the  other side, he explains, you see huge bipartisan majorities working  diligently on issues that directly affect the daily lives of millions  of Americans. Well, that side of the screen is where you will find  Senator Alexander. In fact, he is a star player.   Senator Alexander has announced he won't seek a fourth term in 2020.  While the end of his time here may be in sight, I am confident the  catalog of his hard work and leadership is nowhere near complete just  yet. As chairman of HELP, he and Senator Murray have reported the Lower  Healthcare Costs Act to the full Senate. They are working together to  reauthorize and update the Higher Education Act. He and Senator  Feinstein have produced an appropriations bill--passed by the  Appropriations Committee--that would provide a fifth year of record  funding for the National Laboratories, a sixth year of full funding for  our inland waterway infrastructure, and the resources to keep America  No. 1 in supercomputing. And there is almost certainly more to come  over the next year and a half. Lamar's service reminds us that there  are many ways to be a transformational leader in this body.   As a young man, I was an intern for Senator John Sherman Cooper of  Kentucky. He was never an elected leader but was always regarded by his  colleagues as a leader because of his willingness to do what he thought  ought to be done. Senator Cooper once said to me:         I not only represent Kentucky, I represent the Nation, and       there are times you follow, and times when you lead.    In fact, two of the three Senate office buildings are named for  Senators who were never elected the leader of their party's caucus.  Lamar Alexander is just that kind of leader.   We are proud to celebrate this milestone as Senator Alexander notches  more combined years as Senator and Governor than anyone else from his  State, but even more, we recognize the example the Senator has set for  all the rest of us. It is just like he says:         It's hard to get here. It's hard to stay here. So while       you're here, you might as well try to accomplish something.    Congratulations, my friend.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                September 17, 2019.      Hon. Lamar Alexander,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Alexander: I am writing to congratulate you on       your record years of  [[Page S5564]]       service to Tennessee. On September 19, 2019, you will have       served more combined years as either Governor or United       States Senator from Tennessee than any other Tennessean. This       is a milestone that illustrates your dedication to public       service and to Tennesseans.        September 19, 2019, marks your 9,024th day in office as       either Tennessee Governor or U.S. Senator from Tennessee.       Your 24 years, 8 months, and 15 days of service will then       surpass the previous longest serving Governor and United       State Senator from Tennessee, Isham Harris.        This is just one of your many elections records in the       state. You are the only Tennessee Governor ever popularly       elected to the United States Senate. You have won more       Tennessee Republican statewide primary elections--six--than       any other Tennessean. And your 2008 general election vote       total--1,579,477 votes--is the largest vote total ever       recorded by a Tennessee statewide candidate.        I congratulate you on this, and your many other, great       accomplishments and I thank you for your service to our great       state.            Sincerely,                                                       Tre Hargett,                                                Secretary of State.
