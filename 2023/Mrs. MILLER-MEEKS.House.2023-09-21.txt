 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to shed light on a  critical issue that affects countless lives: suicide.   National Suicide Prevention Month is not just a time of remembrance.  It is a call to action. Mental health struggles are not a sign of  weakness and seeking help should not be stigmatized.   We must come together to support individuals in crisis, especially  our servicemembers, who have sacrificed so much for our Nation.   Let us remember that each life is precious and that there is always  hope, even in the darkest of times.   Reach out to your loved ones, check on your friends, and be the  beacon of support that someone might desperately need. Together, we can  speak out about mental health and degrade the barriers to treatment.   This National Suicide Prevention Month, let us work hand in hand to  ensure that everyone knows they are not alone and that help is always  within reach. Together, we can make a difference and save lives.                            ____________________
