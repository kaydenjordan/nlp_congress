 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters for managing  this time.   To the gentleman from New York, what an honor it is for me to stand  on this House floor as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, as a  Black woman, to urge my colleagues to support the Harlem Hellfighters  Congressional Gold Medal Act.   We have heard so much about them, and I am proud to join them, giving  them the recognition that they deserve. These men of this segregated  unit fought bravely in the First World War and distinguished themselves  in battle across France. The men of the 369th Infantry Regiment, the  Harlem Hellfighters, are an important chapter in the long history of  Black Americans serving our country.   So often we talk about Black history, but it is important to know  that Black history is American history. And, today, we stand here  united as Americans, Democrats, Republicans, asking our colleagues to  make sure that we recognize the Harlem Hellfighters for the great work,  the great bravery, for what they did for this country.
