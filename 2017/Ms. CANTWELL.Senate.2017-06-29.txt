 Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Murray in  commemorating the Ballard Locks' 100th anniversary. As our constituents  in Washington State know, these locks are an integral part of our  regional economy. The safe and efficient operation of the Ballard Locks  supports $1.2 billion in total lock-related economic activity, more  than 3,000 full-time jobs, and more than 1 million tons of freight.  With over 1.3 million visitors a year to see the locks and the fish  ladder and visit the Carl S. English Jr. Botanical Gardens, the Ballard  Locks are one of the region's top tourist attractions generating  another $40 million in economic activity per year.   The Ballard Locks provide critical public safety and environmental  functions, maintaining the water level of Lake Washington and Lake  Union and preventing salt water intrusion from Puget Sound into these  freshwater lakes. The locks support two floating highway bridges-- Interstate-90 and  [[Page S3856]]  State Route-520--the water and sewer systems that serve Mercer Island  residents, and approximately 75 miles of developed commercial,  municipal, and residential shoreline. It also allows for emergency  response by the Seattle Fire Department, Seattle Harbor Patrol, King  County Sheriff, and U.S. Coast Guard. The facilities spillway and fish  ladder serve as a link for salmon and steelhead migrating from the  ocean upstream to freshwater spawning grounds, which is important to  fulfilling Federal Tribal treaty responsibilities.    Mr. President, together Senator Murray and I will  continue to advocate for this critical infrastructure, working to  ensure our colleagues and the administration understand the importance  of the waterways and navigation systems in the Pacific Northwest.  Investing in our water infrastructure supports jobs, economic security,  and healthy communities. Senator Murray and I are proud to fight for  the investments the Army Corps needs to operate, maintain, and restore  the Ballard Locks.                            ____________________
