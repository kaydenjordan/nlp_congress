 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of today's  resolution to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   As a physician, I have lived the nightmare of the ACA for the past 6  years. Because of ObamaCare, I know more physicians leaving their  practice this year than any other year. With $12,000 deductibles and  annual premium spikes of over 50 and many times over 100 percent,  ObamaCare has made health care truly unaffordable and unattainable for  many, many people. In fact, it would be irresponsible for Congress to  sit back and watch the ACA continue its death spiral and bankrupt our  country.   As we begin to replace ObamaCare, we want to reassure Americans we  will not pull the rug out from anyone. If you are on a current exchange  policy or have preexisting conditions, we will have a period of  transition and high-risk pools that will provide you with quality,  affordable alternatives.   Like many others, my district sent me here to fix health care, and we  intend to do just that.
