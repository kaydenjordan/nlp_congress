 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Michael Bauer, a lifelong champion for the causes of equality and  justice.   Always at the forefront for each battle the LGBTQ community has faced  since the AIDS epidemic began, Michael connected elected officials,  business leaders, and nonprofit organizations to elevate the visibility  of the community and safeguard its rights.   Inspired by his own mother's story as a 103-year-old survivor of the  Holocaust, Michael understood that the future of humanity, of the  LGBTQ, Jewish, pro-Israel, and civil rights communities, in particular,  was dependent on protecting against oppression. He took the directive  ``Never Again'' literally and devoted his life to that end.   Michael's top priority was always his family, and the love and  support they provided were most important in his life. He married the  love of his life, Roger Simon, whom he met in 1982, in Toronto in 2003.   I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering my friend Michael for  his tireless service and dedication. He will be missed.                            ____________________
