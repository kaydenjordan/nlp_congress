 Mr. Speaker, in my district a couple  weeks ago there were 53 migrants found cooked to death in the back of a  trailer.   The Biden border crisis has continued to spiral out of control.   If this body will not take notice now, when will it ever take notice?   Out of those 53 migrants, half of them were from Mexico, half of them  were from Guatemala, and a few others were from surrounding areas.   This crisis continues to spiral. It continues to get worse. It is  over 100 degrees in Texas today, and no one seems to care. No one seems  to notice. Regardless of their legal status, these people are  oftentimes seeking economic freedom, and yet they are dying in the back  of trailers because no one in this body will address immigration reform  and border security.                            ____________________
