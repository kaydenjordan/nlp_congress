 Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Speaker of the House of  Representatives and myself, and consistent with the request of the  President of the United States, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on the Budget be  discharged from further consideration of the bill, H.R. 9047, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Can the Speaker inform us as to what that committee  consists of?    I thank the Speaker for the clarification.                            ____________________
