 Mr. President, I am delighted this morning to be on  the floor with the distinguished Senator from Texas. In order to  proceed, I ask unanimous consent that, as in legislative session, the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  S. 1253 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the Cornyn amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the  bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from Texas.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I have  the pleasure of serving with him on the Committee on the Judiciary. We  have been there for a long time, and over the years, I have come to  have great respect for him. So it is a particular asset for me to be  able to share the authorship of this bill.   Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Preventing Online Sales of E- Cigarettes to Children Act. Our commonsense bill would treat e- cigarettes the same as traditional cigarettes and other tobacco  products when it comes to purchasing them online. Can you believe it?  E-cigarettes can be purchased online by someone 12 years old. There is  no age requirement.   This bill would help prevent children from illegally obtaining e- cigarettes by ensuring that online vendors are verifying the age of  their customers, properly labeling packages, and checking  identification upon delivery. The law exists today, as I stated, for  traditional cigarettes, and there is no reason e-cigarettes should be  treated differently.   An annual survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  found that nearly 5.3 million students are using e-cigarettes--over 5  million students.   Besides being illegal, the rate of e-cigarette use among teenagers is  growing. In 2019, almost 30 percent of high school students reported  using an e-cigarette in the previous 30 days. That is a 50-percent  increase from the year before. So the popularity of them for younger  and younger children is going up and up.   According to the U.S. Surgeon General report, the developing  adolescent brain is uniquely sensitive to nicotine. Other studies have  shown that children exposed to nicotine may be at greater risk for  experiencing deficits in attention and cognition, suffering from mood  disorders, and engaging in drug-seeking behavior. These effects may  continue into adulthood, long after e-cigarette use has stopped.   Further, new research shows that young people who use e-cigarettes  are five times more likely to smoke traditional cigarettes within 1  year. Clearly, it is a come-on to children to graduate from the e- cigarette to the real cigarette.   Given the effects of nicotine on children and the likelihood of their  transitioning to traditional cigarette smoking, it is critical that we  close any legal loopholes that allows underage youth to use e- cigarettes. Studies show that one of the easiest ways for underage  users to purchase e-cigarettes is online. Our bipartisan bill would  require e-cigarette retailers to meet the same requirements as those  that sell traditional cigarettes online.   I believe we have 27 cosponsors equally divided between our two  parties, so I am very pleased about that.   By applying the same safeguards we have worked on with online sales  of traditional cigarettes, our bill would ensure that online e- cigarette sellers are verifying the age of their customers, properly  labeling packages, and checking identification at delivery.   While there is limited research on the effects that vaping has had on  coronavirus patients, the virus is known to attack the lungs. People  with underlying conditions are particularly susceptible. Last year, we  saw a mysterious lung illness sicken thousands of people that had a  history of vaping. So it stands to reason that any damage already  caused by vaping may further compromise a person's ability to fight off  the coronavirus.   I want to thank Senator Cornyn for working with me on this important  legislation and our 26 colleagues who joined as cosponsors to address  the epidemic of e-cigarette use among American youth.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
