 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 140, the Tribal  Labor Sovereignty Act, a provision in the pending legislation that will  end the National Labor Relations Board's alarming overreach into  businesses operated on sovereign Tribal lands.   In March of 2017, the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and  Pensions, which I have the privilege of chairing, held a hearing on  this legislation and heard from Native American business leaders on how  the NLRB's arbitrary use of its jurisdiction had been harming  businesses large and small on Tribal lands.   Leaders of the Native American community testified before the  subcommittee on how the NLRB had meddled in the day-to-day operations  and management of Native American businesses, often dragging out  matters for years.   To make matters worse, the proceedings led by the NLRB are creating  burdensome legal costs for businesses who are seeking to provide high- quality goods and services to Native American communities.   While members of the NLRB have changed and have begun to make great  progress in reversing some of the Board's most damaging decisions,  Congress needs to make it clear that Tribal labor sovereignty must be  safe from future Washington overreach.   The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act will clarify the National Labor  Relations Act and reverse the troubling encroachment of the Federal  Government on Tribal lands.   Congress has the opportunity here to stand up for sovereign rights of  Native Americans and the businesses they own and operate on their  lands. These Tribes have created their own system of labor protections  for employees and employers consistent with their lands and traditions,  and it is not for Washington bureaucrats to tamper with those  protections.   I urge my colleagues to support the sovereignty of all Native  American Tribes and pass the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the fact of those in  opposition, but 150 Tribes and individuals from the Native Americans  that are asking for this stand in support of this, and we are delighted  to listen to that and work for a solution here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Foxx), the chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce  Committee.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), a gentleman who had a distinguished record of  supporting and helping and enabling workers.    Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure of yielding 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita), the sponsor of this  legislation, as well as the chair of the Subcommittee on Early  Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this has been a telling debate. Again, I think the key  question here, as has been asked by so many colleagues: Are Native  American Tribes government entities; are they sovereign? The only  answer that we can respond with is: Absolutely, yes. They are  sovereign. This is not an issue debating NLRB or NLRA. It is going back  to what we have established already that, in fact, a sovereign nation,  just like a State or local government, is free from the intervention of  NLRB.   In this case, a sovereign nation has that right. Just as a reminder,  over 150 Native American organizations have asked for this legislative  effort to be achieved. Why? Because it was working fine up until 2004,  and NLRB then came arbitrarily in--sometimes yes, sometimes not-- intervening, but, ultimately, they were changing the system in place.   While we are moving back to letting the sovereignty reign in these  Native American Tribes, yet we need to make it very clear for the  future and not go back to what has precipitated this change.   The bill amends the National Labor Relations Act to clarify that the  law does not apply to any enterprise or institution owned and operated  by an Indian Tribe and located on Tribal land. It protects the  sovereignty of Native American Tribes, reaffirming they are afforded  the same rights and protections enjoyed by State and local government.   It ensures Tribes have control over their labor relations and can  determine what is best for the workplaces. It eliminates legal  confusion and uncertainty that is hindering the ability of Tribal  governments to serve their citizens.   Mr. Speaker, that is what it does. It reasserts and reaffirms what we  have already said in law. And for that reason, I ask my colleagues to  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
