 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise because I offered an  amendment to the budget resolution bill that is going to be up for a  vote tomorrow. The amendment that I offered was a statement of policy  that repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement is  dangerous and irresponsible. This is a bipartisan sentiment.   Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, stated: ``I have  great concerns that we inject a level of great uncertainty into an  already uncertain environment if we don't give people a clear  indication as to what will come once we repeal.''   I don't support a repeal, but people in my district cannot afford to  go without health care in the 44th Congressional District.   I urge my colleagues to think about this, to think and to listen to  their Republican colleagues. We need to see a replacement plan.                            ____________________
