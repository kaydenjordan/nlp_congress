 Mr. Speaker, we ask our veterans to serve, young men and  [[Page H1192]]  women who sign up, serve in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and they are going  knowing that they are representing us, and they will take on the  challenges and the dangers of combat. They do that willingly.   But why is it that we create an extra hazard within our control by  creating these burn pits and assign men and women to be breathing that  toxic air? It is not right. This legislation, Honoring our PACT Act,  finally acknowledges that that was wrong and that we have a duty to  every one of those veterans.   In Vermont--and I know, Mr. Speaker, it is in your State as well; you  have been a leader on this--there has been tragedy with cancers to  young men and women, fathers, moms.   In our State, Pat Cram and June Heston both lost their wonderful  husbands, Sergeant Major Michael Cram and Brigadier General Michael  Heston, to cancer. Those women have started a movement in Vermont that  has supported this legislation that finally is going to do for these  veterans what we did for the Vietnam veterans with Agent Orange and  establish a presumption that this was combat related. It is overdue,  and it is necessary.   So I thank all of the men and women on both sides of the aisle who  are standing up to acknowledge that our obligation is to take care of  the warrior and his or her family after they have served us so well.   This is overdue legislation. Let's pass it by unanimous consent.
