 Mr. President, if you have flown in the past year, you have  heard the announcement at the beginning of every flight that says  Federal law requires that passengers wear a mask. Well, the last I  checked, we have a constitutional system, and Congress makes laws.  Something is not required by Federal law unless Congress passes such a  law and the President signs it. That is the only way something becomes  a federal law in this country.   We are coming through a pandemic, and we can see the light at the end  of the tunnel. Over 150 million people in the United States are fully  vaccinated against COVID-19. Any American adult who wants to be  vaccinated against COVID-19 can get vaccinated at this point, and the  science should drive our decisions on how to open up. That is why today  I introduced a resolution to encourage the CDC to review and update its  guidance on wearing masks in confined spaces to clarify that people who  are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no longer need to wear a mask on  public transportation in the United States, including at airports, on  commercial flights, and on buses and rail systems, and for the  Transportation Security Administration to update its travel guidance to  track with the latest science. I was joined in this effort by Senators  Collins, Lummis, Wicker, Moran and Blackburn, and I appreciate their  support.   The CDC has been quite clear that masks are not needed for people who  are fully vaccinated. Science matters, and vaccines work. The mandate  to wear masks on planes and on other modes of transportation--when they  are no longer required in many businesses and restaurants for  vaccinated people--is hurting the aviation industry.   If the objective is to encourage people to be vaccinated, one way to  do that is for there to be a real difference in what you can do after  being vaccinated. Repealing this requirement to wear masks on  airplanes, at airports, and on public transportation would increase  demand, increase travel, and would tie the policy to science. It is a  commonsense step to take, and I hope more of my Senate colleagues will  join us in encouraging the CDC to follow the science.                            ____________________
