 Mr. Speaker, I believe some of my Republican colleagues,  and one in particular, wish harm upon this legislative body. I am not  saying this for shock value; it is the conclusion I drew after a Member  of Congress advocated violence against our peers, the Speaker, and our  government.   It is what I believed after this Chamber was turned into a crime  scene just 10 weeks ago. It is how many of us felt, sheltering in this  room, as the Capitol was breached.   Some Members called their loved ones to say good-bye. Others prayed  to their God. And I asked myself if this would be the day our democracy  died.   I take no joy in introducing this resolution, but any Member who  incites political violence and threatens our lives must be expelled,  and I will do everything I can in my power to protect our democracy and  keep all of my colleagues safe.                            ____________________
