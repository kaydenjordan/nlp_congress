 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H. Res. 848,  encouraging the connecting of members of the Armed Forces in the United  States to support structures necessary to transition from the  battlefield.   While I support this resolution and urge my colleagues to vote in  support of it, I must register my disappointment that this is one of  only two veteran- or servicemember-related measures that House  leadership has chosen to work on this week, the week following Veterans  Day.   The resolution asks members of the public to join Congress in  thanking and supporting servicemembers in their transition out of the  military into civilian life. That is worthwhile, but it does not come  with any concrete action.   Our committee has favorably reported several bills to help our most  vulnerable veterans. Those bills are waiting for action and have been  for months now. If we really wanted to honor servicemembers and  veterans, we would be voting on those bills this week.   Mr. Speaker, we know that homeless veterans are eight times more  likely to die by suicide, so we urgently need to get homeless veterans  housed before the coldest and cruelest months of the year come upon us.  Every day we fail to act, more disabled and elderly veterans are forced  into the care of nursing homes and other institutional long-term care  settings, even though they would prefer to be taken care of at home  surrounded by their loved ones.   Let me also point out that while I find it telling that while  jurisdiction over this resolution about servicemember transition lies  primarily with the House Armed Services Committee, the House Committee  on Veterans' Affairs is here managing floor time. I am glad for this  because our committee has been pushing to take primary oversight  responsibility for the administration of the TAP program for years.   We hear from countless veterans that the administration of TAP by DOD  falls flat. DOD is focused on readiness and making sure that  servicemembers are focused on their mission of protecting our country,  as they should be. Nevertheless, the bookend to that mission is helping  servicemembers find success as civilians.   Because DOD has not focused on that transition, too many  servicemembers separate from the military without a full picture of the  earned benefits available to them as veterans, and it leaves them more  vulnerable at an already stressful time.   I believe that it would make more sense for us to have primary  jurisdiction over the TAP program to make sure the transition from the  military to civilian life is as smooth as possible. We work with VA on  healthcare and benefits delivery every single day, and we are better  positioned than the Armed Services Committee to ensure veterans  understand what life will look like out of the military.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see House leadership acknowledging our  leadership role in the transition of servicemembers. I will continue to  advocate that TAP be included as primarily within the Veterans' Affairs  Committee's jurisdiction in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Van Orden for introducing this  resolution, and I hope we can continue working together on continued  improvements to the TAP program.   I urge this House to bring up additional veterans bills. We should  not only thank veterans and servicemembers for their service. We should  be backing up those thank-yous with action.   As we face yet another threat of a shutdown, I hope this Congress can  stop operating from the brink and begin to do the work that is demanded  of us. It is what we owe to veterans, and we should not abide by  reneging on our promises.  [[Page H5706]]    Mr. Speaker, I support H. Res. 848, but let's act on more than the  words of a resolution. I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  What I would like to do on the floor today is not more bickering and  arguing. It is a plea. It is a plea to the Speaker and the leadership  of this House to bring the home act to the floor. It is a Republican  bill. It is a bipartisan bill. We can do more than this resolution.  With all due credit to my colleague from Wisconsin for this resolution,  we can do more than words on a resolution. We can take action.   We can help veterans who are going to be forced out of aging at home  and into a nursing home. We can help those veterans stay in their homes  with the legislation offered by my colleague from California, Julia  Brownley, the Elizabeth Dole act.   Mr. Speaker, let me respond to my colleague, the chairman. I did not  bring up the issue of the lost time with a Speakerless House. I would  reject the suggestion that the 21 days we lost of floor time was  because Democrats voted to do what they would normally do, which is  they vote for their own nominee for Speaker.                                time  1730    I am not even arguing about lost time. I am arguing that we do have  time that could be better used.   Instead of endless 2-minute votes on amendments that both sides have  voted against stacked on top of each other, we could have used that  time to bring the HOME Act to the floor. We could have used that time  to bring the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act to the floor.   Both bills are bipartisan. Both bills have wide support by the  veterans service organization community. I just say to the chairman-- and I know the chairman himself has urged the Speaker to do this--my  question is, even with all of these useless votes on amendments, we had  time this week. We had enough time to bring those bills to the floor.  Let's bring them to the floor immediately. We need to get veterans  housed before the winter sets in.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  supporting the resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.R. 593, a bill to  rename the outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in  Hinesville, Georgia, as the John Gibson, Dan James, William Sapp, and  Frankie Smiley VA Clinic.   I thank Representative Carter for introducing it and the Georgia  delegation for its support.   These individuals, all hailing from Liberty County, Georgia, were  killed in action during the Vietnam war. Four young men who made the  ultimate sacrifice for their country.   Private First Class John Gibson, a marine, was killed by small arms  fire in the Tet Offensive on February 7, 1968. He was 21 years old.   Specialist Dan James served in the Army's 25th Infantry Division and  was killed on December 29, 1968. He was 20 years old.   Specialist William Sapp served in the Army's 4th Infantry Division.  He was killed on June 7, 1968. He was 25 years old.   Marine Lance Corporal Frankie Smiley served in the 1st Marine  Division. He was killed on August 25, 1968. He was 24 years old.   These are four names out of the 58,000 who died in the Vietnam war  that we honor for their service and sacrifice. These four names will  continue to be honored at the VA clinic in Liberty County as it carries  on its mission to serve veterans.   The sacrifices of those who served in Vietnam and in other wars and  conflicts is particularly salient as we just commemorated Veterans Day,  and as we had the opportunity to reflect on the sacred obligation we  owe to veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  do believe it is important to remember the service and sacrifice of  servicemembers and veterans because we must keep close to mind our duty  to repay that service and uphold the promises we have made to those who  swore an oath to our country to protect and defend it. However, I fear  that we have fallen short this year. While I do urge support for this  naming bill, I am extremely disappointed that during National Veterans  and Military Families Month and Warrior Care Month, and 2 days after  Veterans Day, that this is the only veterans legislation the Republican  majority has brought to the floor for us to consider.   These young men who lost their lives in the Vietnam war sacrificed  everything they had for our country. If we really wanted to honor them  and the millions of Americans who have risked their life and limb in  service, we should be doing even more.   In this Congress so far, our committee has only originated three  bills that have been signed into law. By comparison, in the last two  Congresses, under Democratic leadership, we passed more than 70 bills  to expand access to care and benefits that are now law. This inaction  is unconscionable when there is such an acute need for assistance among  veterans and survivors.   It is not for a lack of good ideas. There are several worthwhile  bills that are ready to be voted on right now, bills that would change  and improve the lives of veterans and their families across the  country.   For example, H.R. 3848, the bipartisan Housing Our Military Veterans  Effectively, or HOME, Act of 2023, sponsored by Republican  Representative Chavez-DeRemer, would restore authorities that were  essential to ensuring America's most vulnerable veterans found or  stayed in housing during the pandemic.   For the period of the public health emergency, the Department of  Veterans Affairs was able to provide food, clothing, bedding, hygiene  items, shelter, transportation services, and communication devices to  veterans experiencing homelessness. VA also had temporary authority to  increase reimbursements to grant and per diem providers which ensured  veterans in transitional housing received the care and services they  needed. Unfortunately, these authorities and funding expired with the  end of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration in May 2023,  and there has been since no congressional action to restore them.   To aid in this effort, Representative Nikema Williams introduced H.R.  491, the Return Home to Housing Act, and Representative Sheila  Cherfilus-McCormick introduced H.R. 645, the Healthy Foundations for  Homeless Veterans Act. These bills are both included in the HOME Act,  which was reported out of our committee by voice vote on July 26, 2023.  That is right, a bill with strong unanimous support has been  languishing for months for no clear reason.   Earlier this year, Chairman Bost and I were standing in these exact  spots, and he made a promise to me that we would pass this legislation.  I understand from staff conversations that Chairman Bost has been  imploring the Speaker to schedule that bill for a vote. I, too, sent a  letter to the newly elected Speaker imploring him to bring this bill to  the floor.   In the book of Matthew 25:35 it says: ``For I was hungry and you gave  me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink,  I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you  clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me . . . Then the righteous  will answer him, `Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or  thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger  and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see  you sick or in prison and go visit you?' ''   Do we not take these words as a call to action? There are homeless  veterans suffering as we speak. It is our responsibility to take care  of the most vulnerable veterans. Every night a veteran spends on the  street is a night this Congress could have acted to shelter them. You  can feel the cold setting in here in Washington, D.C.   The HOME act would fill the basic needs of veterans experiencing  homelessness to help get them on a path to stable housing. Whether it  be emergency shelter to escape the cold, a warm meal, or clothes to  wear and a ride to a job interview, this bill allows VA to help  homeless veterans in the most fundamental ways.   Veterans service organizations and advocates have called on Congress  to pass legislation to continue the flexible funding and authorities  for critical VA homelessness programs. These authorities resulted in a  reduction in veteran homelessness by over 11 percent over the last 2  years during the pandemic. This was an amazing feat during one of the  most difficult times in our recent history, and yet this House has not  seen fit to bring this bill to the floor.   If the House fails to act or continues to delay action, I fear that  veteran homelessness will undoubtedly increase and critical gains made  during the pandemic will be lost. We are about to enter the winter  months. Will this Congress allow veterans to remain on the streets or  lacking access to basic necessities?   The other bill I have urged the Speaker to bring to the floor is H.R.  542, the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act. This bill, introduced by  Representatives Brownley and Bergman, was also reported out of  committee with unanimous support in July. It would require VA to  provide access to all home and community-based services, such as home  health aides, home-based primary care, and respite care to all veterans  and caregivers who need them. Currently, elderly and disabled veterans  only have access if their VA medical centers have chosen to offer these  services.   This legislation will enable veterans to remain at home, safely age  in place, and avoid or delay admission to nursing homes and other  costly institutional settings of care. It will also help connect  veterans' caregivers to respite  [[Page H5709]]  care and other supportive services that help them care for veterans at  home and improve VA's coordination with other Federal long-term care  programs that promote aging at home.   Finally, the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act will require VA to create a  website where veterans and their families can more easily obtain  information about VA's home- and community-based services programs and  assess whether any of these programs may be right for them.   Nearly every veteran will, at some point, face the need for  additional care at home or, if they can't get it, spend their last  years in a nursing home setting. This legislation is an investment in  care for millions of veterans and current servicemembers who need this  help now or may in the future. We can afford to do this. We must do  this.   Senator Elizabeth Dole, alongside all other major veterans service  organizations, has spoken to several committee members and its chairman  about the urgency of passing this bill this year. The health and well- being of thousands of veterans depends on it. I have heard that certain  Republican Members object to the Dole act. I would ask those Members  with concerns to speak to me or the bill's sponsors so that we can try  to address those concerns. That would be the fair and honest thing to  do, so that we can tell the advocates for this bill what the actual  holdup is.   The Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act has the support of every major  veterans service organization, including Disabled American Veterans,  Paralyzed Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, American  Legion, Wounded Warrior Project, and the Military Officers Association  of America. It is also supported by AARP, the National Association of  Counties, the National PACE Association, and the Elizabeth Dole  Foundation.   Democrats on the committee remain ready to help pass both of these  bills and many others that have passed out of the committee with broad  bipartisan support.   Weeks were spent waiting for the Republican Conference to select a  new Speaker, and significant time has been wasted on partisan  appropriations bills that have no chance of being signed by the  President. We are here using precious floor time on poison pill  amendments at worst or symbolic gestures at best, but none of these  things will actually help veterans get the care and benefits they  deserve.   Last year, we came together to pass the largest expansion of veterans  benefits in a generation, my Honoring our PACT Act, but we cannot and  should not stop there.   Every bill brought to the House floor represents a choice and makes a  statement about priorities. From my experience, whenever I had a  veterans bill that was ready or timely, Speaker Emerita Pelosi made way  for it because for her veterans issues are sacred. They are not fodder  for negotiation or collateral. I hope our current Speaker comes to that  same understanding. There is always time for veterans legislation.   We ask servicemembers to leave their families to protect our country,  and we have a responsibility to honor our pact with them, that we will  take care of them when they come home. That includes our most  vulnerable veterans, such as homeless, elderly, and disabled veterans.   We must get these bills passed and honor our commitment to veterans.  Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 593. I ask my colleagues to do the same,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley), my friend, and the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
