 Madam President, today I rise to congratulate  Consumer Reports on 50 years of advocacy in Washington, DC.   In 1936, scientists and researchers established a union of consumers  to test products and give evidence-based recommendations through what  was to become the iconic publication Consumer Reports. In 1972, the  organization saw an opportunity to do even more for consumers and for  the country at large by sharing data and insights with policymakers and  making policy recommendations in support of consumer safety, fairness,  and transparency in the marketplace.   Fifty years ago, a small team was established in Washington, DC, that  has been working with Senators on both sides of the aisle, with our  colleagues in the House of Representatives, and with staff at Federal  Agencies such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Department of  Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Trade Commission,  Federal Communications Commission, United States Department of  Agriculture, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--which  Consumer Reports played a major role in helping establish in 2010.   For the past five decades, Consumer Reports has ensured that we in  government hear the voices of consumers, understand their needs in the  marketplace, and shape the rules and safeguards that consumers deserve.   Consumer Reports has partnered with me and others to take actions  that not only help people save their hard-earned money, but also save  lives. Products are safer, our standards are higher, and consumer  protections have endured, thanks to the extraordinary work of this  organization.   On the 50th anniversary of Consumer Reports establishing its first  team of advocates in Washington, DC, I congratulate and commend  Consumer Reports president and CEO Marta L. Tellado, along with the  past and present staff and board of directors, all of whom have  dedicated their talents and resources to creating a fair, safe, and  just marketplace for all of us.                            ____________________     Yes, I do.
