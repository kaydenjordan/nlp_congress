 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree  to the resolution (H. Res. 393) remembering the victims of the violent  suppression of democracy protests in Tiananmen Square and elsewhere in  China on June 3 and 4, 1989, and calling on the Government of the  People's Republic of China to respect the universally recognized human  rights of all people living in China and around the World, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 393         Whereas, on June 4, 1989, a violent crackdown on peaceful       demonstrations held in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square       was carried out by the People's Liberation Army, following       orders given by the Government of the People's Republic of       China;        Whereas an estimated 1,000,000 people joined the protests       in Tiananmen Square and citizens in over 400 Chinese cities       staged similar protests calling for democratic reform,       including not only students, but also government employees,       journalists, workers, police officers, members of the armed       forces, and other citizens;        Whereas the peaceful demonstrations of 1989 called upon the       Government of the People's Republic of China to eliminate       corruption, accelerate economic and political reform, and       protect human rights, particularly the freedoms of expression       and assembly, issues that remain relevant in United States-      China relations 30 years later;        Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China       takes active measures to deny its citizens the truth about       the Tiananmen Square massacre, including the blocking of       uncensored internet sites and social media commentary on       microblog and other messaging services, and the placement of       misleading information on the events of June 3 and 4, 1989,       on internet sites available in China;        Whereas, on May 20, 1989, martial law was declared in       Beijing, China, after authorities had failed to persuade       demonstrators to leave Tiananmen Square;        Whereas during the late afternoon and early evening hours       of June 3, 1989, thousands of armed troops, supported by       tanks and other armor, moved into Beijing and surrounding       streets;        Whereas, on the night of June 3, 1989, and continuing into       the morning of June 4, 1989, soldiers fired into crowds,       inflicting high casualties on the demonstrators and injuring       many unarmed civilians;        Whereas tanks crushed to death some protesters and       onlookers and seriously injured many others;        Whereas independent observers reported that hundreds,       perhaps thousands, were killed and wounded by People's       Liberation Army soldiers and other security forces in Beijing       and other cities in China;        Whereas tens of thousands were detained and sent to prison       or reeducation through labor, often without trial and many       were tortured and imprisoned for decades;        Whereas the Tiananmen Mothers is a group of relatives and       friends of those killed in June 1989 whose demands include       the right to mourn victims publicly and who call for a full,       public, and independent accounting of the wounded, dead, and       those imprisoned for participating in the spring 1989       demonstrations;        Whereas members of the Tiananmen Mothers group have faced       arrest, harassment, and discrimination, with the group's       website blocked in China and the freezing by Chinese       authorities of international cash donations made to the group       to support families of victims;        Whereas despite the Government of the People's Republic of       China's integration into the international economic system       and its obligations under international treaties and       covenants, the political reforms and the protection of       universally recognized rights sought by the Tiananmen       demonstrators have not been realized during the past 30       years;        Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China       continues to actively suppress universally recognized rights       by imprisoning or restricting the activities of pro-democracy       activists, human rights lawyers, citizen journalists, labor       union leaders, religious believers, members of ethnic       minorities, and individuals in the Xinjiang and Tibetan       regions, among many others who seek to express their       political or religious views or their ethnic identity in a       peaceful manner, including in Hong Kong where the Government       of the People's Republic of China has increasingly exerted       influence, eroding freedoms there, and placing its special       status at risk;        Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China       continues to harass, disappear, and detain peaceful advocates       for human rights, religious freedom, ethnic minority rights       and the rule of law, and their family members, such as Ilham       Tohti, Gao Zhisheng, Wang Bingzhang, Lobsang Tsering, Yang       Maodong (also known as Guo Feixiong), Liu Xianbin, Qin       Yongmin, Wu Gan, Zhang Haitao, Wang Quanzhang, Tashi       Wangchug, Tang Jingling, Liu Feiyue, Wang Yi, Jiang Rong, Cao       Yuguang, Abdurehim Heyit, Eziz Emet, Hebibulla Tohti,       Drugdra, Lobsang Gephel, Sonam Dargye, Thardoe Gyaltsen,       Gulmira Imin, and Huang Qi, among many others;        Whereas according to the Political Prisoner Database       maintained by the United States Congressional-Executive       Commission on China, the Government of the People's Republic       of China continues to detain over 1,500 political and       religious prisoners, though the number is presumed to be much       higher;        Whereas Nobel Peace Prize laureate and prominent advocate       for human rights and political reform Liu Xiaobo died in       state custody in 2017, the first Nobel Peace Prize laureate       to die in state custody since Carl Von Ossietzky died in 1938       after being detained by the Nazi German government;        Whereas over a million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic       and religious minorities are interned in political       reeducation camps in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and       elsewhere in China and are subjected to the forced       renunciation of faith, torture, and forced assimilation of       their language and culture through actions that may       constitute crimes against humanity;        Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China       harasses, detains, and tortures human rights lawyers who take       on cases deemed politically sensitive; prevents Chinese       workers from forming independent unions and engages in an       ongoing crackdown on labor advocates, organizations, and       their supporters; restricts severely the religious activity       of Protestants, Catholics, Tibetan Buddhists, and Turkic       Muslims and has sought to eradicate Falun Gong practice in       China; vilifies publicly and refuses to negotiate with His       Holiness the Dalai Lama or his representatives over Tibetan       issues and asserts control over the reincarnation process       through which the next Dalai Lama will be recognized;       repatriates forcibly refugees to North Korea and pressures       neighboring governments to repatriate refugees from China who       reach their territory in contravention of the international       legal principle of non-refoulement; restricts the activities       of and detains citizen journalists; and continues to limit       the size of Chinese families;        Whereas the protection of universally recognized human       rights, in law and practice, would allow the Government of       the People's Republic of China to establish more stable       economic, political, and security relations with its       neighbors and the United States; and        Whereas this historical episode has had an enduring impact       on United States-China relations--        (1) because there has been no justice for those who lost       their lives seeking freedom and political reform during the       Spring of 1989;        (2) because the Government of the People's Republic of       China censors research, discussion and commemoration of       Tiananmen in China;        (3) because the demonstrations showed that the ideas of       democracy and freedom, human rights and the rule of law are       not foreign to the people of China;        (4) because the demonstrations and their violent       suppression showed the lengths to which the leaders of the       Government of the People's Republic of China will go to       suppress universally recognized rights and to maintain their       hold on power; and        (5) because, despite persistent, ongoing, and sometimes       brutal repression, there continue to be Chinese citizens       bravely seeking to exercise universally recognized human       rights, ensure the rule of law, and promote political reform       thus carrying on the legacy of the Tiananmen demonstrations:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) expresses sympathy and solidarity to the families of       those killed, tortured, and imprisoned for their       participation in the pro-democracy demonstrations during the       spring of 1989 in Beijing and in other cities across the       People's Republic of China;        (2) supports the leaders of the Tiananmen demonstrations       and all those who peacefully sought political reform,       democratic transparency, the rule of law, and protections for       universally recognized human rights in China;        (3) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of       China to--        (A) support a full, transparent, and independent accounting       of the government's actions and number of deaths that       occurred during the violent suppression of the spring 1989       Tiananmen demonstrations;        (B) rehabilitate the reputations of those who participated       in the demonstrations and those detained for seeking to       commemorate the anniversary of the demonstrations; and  [[Page H4232]]         (C) cease the censoring of information and discussion about       the Tiananmen Square massacre, including at Confucius       Institutes worldwide;        (4) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of       China to allow Tiananmen demonstration participants who       escaped to or are living in exile in the United States and       other countries, or who reside outside of China because they       have been ``blacklisted'' in China as a result of their       peaceful protest activity, to return to China without risk of       repercussions or retribution; and        (5) condemns the ongoing restrictions on universally       recognized human rights by the Government of the People's       Republic of China and its efforts to quell peaceful political       dissent, censor the internet, brutally suppress ethnic and       religious minorities, and detain and torture lawyers and       rights advocates seeking the Government's commitment, in law       and practice, to international human rights treaties and       covenants to which it is a party and that are reflected in       the Chinese constitution.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 393.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul for his eloquent statement and  his leadership on this issue, and I rise in very strong support of this  measure.   Thirty years ago, I was here on Capitol Hill, my first job out of  college. I was working on the Senate side for the late, great Senator  Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and one day, I was sitting in my cubicle and  we were watching our TVs, which were tuned to this novelty station  called CNN that was bringing these events live to us, something we had  never really experienced before.   One day we looked up, and we saw the image of this young Chinese man  with his grocery bags standing in front of that line of tanks, and we  watched it unfold for about 2 minutes. It seemed like forever. We did  not know what would happen. Would he be killed? Would he be run over?  It was a moment that changed my life and changed the world.   We all know what happened afterwards: a massacre; mass arrests;  efforts that continue to this day to bury the truth of what happened in  Tiananmen Square.   The Chinese Government has tried to erase the memory of that day from  our collective memory. Here is something very important, something that  should command our attention: the Chinese Government today is not  satisfied merely with censoring its own people. It is insisting on  censoring the entire world.   It is trying to intimidate companies, and universities, and  individuals all around the world into never uttering the words, ``the  Tiananmen massacre.''   With this resolution, we say to the Chinese Government that they  cannot intimidate the United States of America. This resolution makes  clear we are going to speak the truth about the crime that they have  committed 30 years ago, and all of the crimes they continue to commit  today: the wholesale imprisonment of lawyers; their efforts to crush  the culture and heritage of the Tibetan people; the mass surveillance  technology they are exporting to the whole world; and the mass  internment of innocent men, women, and children in Xinjiang.   We see the significance of these actions, not just what the Chinese  Government is doing on human rights, but what is being done on trade,  and in the South China Sea. All of them are an effort by the Chinese  Government to break free and to rewrite the rules that keep the  world safe and free.    We see the Chinese Government's attempts to silence us on these  issues for what it is, a sign of weakness, not of strength.   The Chinese Government's power rests on a fragile foundation of  falsehood. It depends on people forgetting the past. It depends on  people believing a lie. So today, we say that they are failing, and  they are going to fail. It has been 30 years. We still mark this  anniversary. We still remember Liu Xiaobo and all of the heroes of the  square. The footage of Tank Man still plays on TV, and thanks to the  internet, more people are seeing it today than saw it in 1989.   We will carry on until we know his name, until the Chinese people  have the freedom that they fought peacefully for that day and that they  so richly deserve.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the author of this resolution and  one of the greatest champions of human rights I have had the privilege  to know.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   I will simply say that our disagreement here, the disagreement we  have been expressing in such a united way, is not with China. It is  certainly not with the Chinese people. It is simply with the Chinese  Government.   We stand in full agreement with the Chinese people, with everybody in  China who wishes to live in a country governed by respect for the rule  of law and for human rights. That is what this resolution is about.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
