 Mr. Speaker, what do these people have in common: a  teacher who buys a prom dress for her student; a teacher who buys  crayons and pencils for her students; a teacher who buys packages of  paper for his students; my mom, who calls me and says, ``Don't cut my  Medicare. Don't let them cut my Medicare''; the person who has a heart  attack or is paying hard-earned money for his or her cancer treatment?   None of those people will be able to write off their medical expenses  or their educational expenses. My mom and other seniors will see a $25  billion cut in Medicare.   What they have in common is that this tax scam will hurt all of them,  as opposed to the folks who are the richest among us. The corporations  who are doing very, very well, they will see the tax benefits.   This is not a tax plan, it is a tax scam, and our people that we  serve deserve better.                            ____________________
