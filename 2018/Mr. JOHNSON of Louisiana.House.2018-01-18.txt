 Mr. Speaker, we have heard some outrageous  arguments from our colleagues on the other side in the last hour or so.  I have heard things like the argument that this is unnecessarily  legislating medical standards. They said that this should be a matter  of medical judgment. Really?   A commitment to the sanctity of every single human life is essential  to who we are as Americans and, more fundamental than that, who we are  as human beings.   They have also argued that this is a solution in search of a problem,  but they ignore the data. According to the CDC, between 2003 and 2014,  588 of the infant deaths reported included a record that the cause of  death was ``termination of pregnancy affecting a fetus and a newborn.''  The CDC acknowledges that this could be an underestimate.    I can tell you from my own experience, firsthand, over two decades  litigating against the abortion industry in Louisiana that that  industry always underreports their numbers of terminations and,  certainly, their complications.   Just yesterday, I spoke with my friend Brandi in Baton Rouge. She is,  herself, a survivor of a failed abortion attempt. She was left to die,  and now she lives with severe disabilities because of that. She is a  passionate advocate for life. Mr. Speaker, every single one of us  should be.   The most important responsibility of a just government is to defend  the defenseless. With the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,  it is necessary to protect the most vulnerable in our society, and I  urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the legislation.
