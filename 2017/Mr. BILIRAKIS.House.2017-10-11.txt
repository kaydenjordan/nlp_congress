 Mr. Speaker, it was great to participate in this  morning's board of delegation meeting, during which we discussed the  impact of recent hurricanes on our State and unmet needs to require  further attention.   With the onslaught of natural disasters that have plagued our country  in recent months, we must provide appropriate levels of Federal support  to all who are suffering. However, we must also ensure that Florida's  ongoing needs are not overlooked as we seek to fully recover.   Our two largest industries, tourism and agriculture, have sustained  significant losses, which will have a long-term impact on our economy,  unfortunately. We also learned valuable lessons during the hurricane as  it relates to the care for our most vulnerable citizens, our seniors  and the disabled. These lessons need to translate to action in order to  prevent future tragedies.   I look forward to working with my colleagues as we evaluate the  proposed natural disaster funding bill that will be voted on later this  week and determine its impact on Florida.                            ____________________
