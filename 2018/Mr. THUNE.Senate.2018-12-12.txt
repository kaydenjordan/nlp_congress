 Madam President, I rise today to thank and honor our  colleague and ranking member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation, Senator Bill Nelson.   As has been mentioned by some of our colleagues, Bill Nelson has  served the people of Florida and our Nation with distinction in a  career spanning more than four decades.   I have been honored to have Bill Nelson as a colleague from my first  day in the Senate and for the last 4 years as a partner in an  especially successful working relationship on the Commerce Committee.  Over this time, we fostered a can-do spirit with committee colleagues  and drove nearly 100 committee legislative accomplishments. Together,  we worked on policy for our Nation's future in technology, aviation,  ocean management, surface transportation, scientific research, space,  and many other areas.   Senator Nelson exhibited an especially extraordinary passion for  prioritizing safety, the future of manned spaceflight, and an  unshakeable belief that powerful companies should be held to account  when consumers aren't treated fairly.   Certainly in the instances when we used the authorities of our  committee to demand answers about cyber security failures, troubling  privacy violations, and the scourge of illegal robocalling, I always  knew that Senator Nelson had my back. We are both passionate about  serving the people of our respective States.   I won't soon forget my visit with Bill to the Everglades, where he-- clearly in his element--introduced me to some alligators and some  unwelcome python squatters, which nonetheless love Florida too. I still  have a photo holding on to one of those big snakes. It makes our  rattlesnakes in South Dakota look small by comparison.   Certainly in the instances when we used the authorities of our  committee to demand answers about all of these other important issues,  we worked closely together.   I was pleased to not only join him in Florida but also to welcome him  to South Dakota to see some of the issues that are important in our  State. On a very, very cold October day, I had the privilege of showing  Senator Nelson Mount Rushmore. I remember that as we walked up there,  the wind was blowing--as it typically does in South Dakota--about 30 or  40 miles an hour, and the wind chills were very, very cold. I know that  as someone who spends a lot of his time in the great State of Florida,  where many of my constituents, like those of Senator Klobuchar's, spend  their winters, it probably felt especially cold to him. But we had a  chance to go underground and look at some of the tunnels of the old  Homestake gold mine that are now host to the National Science  Foundation's Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory. I  remember thinking at the time that Senator Nelson is the only Senator  in Senate office who has been in space, so he has been thousands and  thousands of miles in space, and now he has been 5,000 feet  underground, too, and there aren't many people who can say that.   Bill's work in the Senate and on the Commerce Committee has left a  legacy. I also want to acknowledge his outstanding staff team who have  supported his efforts. He mentioned them. My staff had the opportunity  to work closely with his staff, and they are the very best and true  professionals in every sense of the word. I am grateful for the work we  have been able to do together.   As your colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, pointed out, as you  not only leave this place but continue your life in Florida, you will  continue to impact that State in the profound way you have so much in  the past.   I just want to wish Senator Nelson and his wife Grace all the best as  they head to more long, sunny days in their beloved home State of  Florida.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of  my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Victoria  Brooke. Victoria hails from Waldorf, MD, and is a recent graduate of  Marshall University.   While interning on the Commerce Committee, Victoria worked in the  committee's front office and assisted the Aviation Operations, Safety,  and Security Subcommittee with various projects. She is a dedicated  worker who was committed to getting the most out of her internship. I  extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Victoria for all of the  fine work she did for the Commerce Committee and wish her continued  success in the years to come.                            ____________________
