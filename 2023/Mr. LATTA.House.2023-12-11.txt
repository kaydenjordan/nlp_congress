 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 2787) to authorize the Federal Communications Commission to process  applications for spectrum licenses from applicants who were successful  bidders in an auction before the authority of the Commission to conduct  auctions expired on March 9, 2023.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2787         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``5G Spectrum Authority       Licensing Enforcement Act'' or the ``5G SALE Act''.       SEC. 2. FCC PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS FOR SPECTRUM LICENSES                     AWARDED BY AUCTION.         In the case of any applicant for a license or permit for       the use of spectrum in the band of frequencies between 2496       megahertz and 2690 megahertz, inclusive, that the Federal       Communications Commission selected through a system of       competitive bidding conducted under section 309(j) of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)) on or before       March 9, 2023, and to whom the Commission has not granted the       license or permit as of the date of enactment of this Act,       the Commission may process the application of the applicant       during the 90-day period beginning on the date of enactment       of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2787, the 5G SALE Act, which  will help restore trust in our Nation's wireless technology ecosystem  and enable faster mobile broadband service for millions of Americans  nearly overnight.   The 5G SALE Act would deliver on our promise to provide access to our  airways for those who successfully won a license at auction before  March 9, 2023. These licenses have been locked up since the expiration  of the Federal Communications Commission's auction authority earlier  this year.   While I will continue to work with my colleagues on a long-term  solution to reauthorize auction authority, today's legislation is a  positive step to ensuring that the FCC can finalize the review and  award licenses to companies whose checks have already cleared the  Treasury.   The 5G SALE Act will ensure that those relying on advanced mobile  broadband services, especially our veterans who access VA telehealth  services, will benefit from American investment in these technologies.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), my good friend representing the 13th  District.    Mr. Speaker, as the minority has said, we need more  spectrum, not less, and we have to win the race for 5G.   We have seen, over time, as I have spoken with people across the  country for years, it was like the United States was way ahead in 5G,  but as time went by, then all of a sudden, we were just a little bit  ahead or maybe we were even. If we are going to win this race, we have  to have 5G out there. It is absolutely essential.  [[Page H6799]]    During COVID, some of the things that happened have already been  mentioned--telehealth services, the business side, education.   For families to stay connected, it is absolutely essential that we  have more broadband out there, not less.   We need to keep our promise to those that won these auctions that  these airways will be available to them.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
