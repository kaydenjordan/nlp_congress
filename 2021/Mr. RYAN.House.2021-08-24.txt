 Madam Speaker, we see our Republican friends are very  upset. They said: This is embarrassing. What are we doing? What have we  done?   What you are mad about is that we are delivering for the American  people. We saved pensions; we cut taxes for working-class people; we  invested in the communities, and we invested in the schools. Now,  universal preschool; everyone can go to community college; vision,  dental, hearing for Medicare recipients; and paid family leave.   If you think for one second I am going to apologize for what we are  doing, you are wrong.   Once again, we should have done this 30 or 40 years ago. And,  obviously, once again, the Republican Party is MIA.
