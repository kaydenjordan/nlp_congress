 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and include  extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, this evening, we will hear from myself and  a colleague from Tennessee, and he is joining me today to talk about  how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has benefited our States.   In my congressional district, Kentucky's Second, I have heard from  constituents who have seen more money in their paychecks and from  businesses that have been able to grow and pass along the benefits of  tax reform directly to their employees.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the standard deduction for both  individuals and couples. For the 75 percent of residents in Kentucky's  Second District who take the standard deduction, this is an automatic  tax cut. Additionally, individuals in every tax bracket are paying  lower rates.   When I visited Owensboro in February, I met Cheri and Ray Middletown,  who own On Time Fab, a small business that provides fabrication  services for agricultural, industrial, and commercial productions.  Cheri and Ray shared with me that, during the first week of the  implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, each of the 20 employees  of On Time Fab took home more pay as a result of tax reform.   One employee took home as much as $56 a week and more than $200 a  month. A single dad working for On Time Fab is bringing home an extra  $40 each week. Some thought there was a mistake in their paychecks  because they are able to keep so much of their hard-earned money, and  $40 a week is over $160 a month.   By cutting the corporate tax rate to make the U.S. competitive  globally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has given businesses the  opportunity to pass along savings to their customers. For example,  residents of 48 States, plus the District of Columbia, are seeing their  utility bills go down because of tax reform.   In Kentucky, the Public Service Commission has ordered investor-owned  utilities to track their tax savings and to reduce rates for hundreds  of thousands of Kentucky customers. In fact, the Public Service  Commission has already announced that Kentucky Utilities' and  Louisville Gas & Electric's residential electric customers will see  their average monthly bills decreased by 6 percent.   Atmos Energy, which serves western Kentucky, announced in March that  it will be cutting the average residential bill by just over 3 percent.  Other savings from tax reform will fund infrastructure upgrades across  the Commonwealth. Companies in Kentucky have been able to expand their  operation because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Owl's Head Alloys in my hometown of Bowling Green recently announced  a $3 million expansion which would create 17 new jobs, bringing their  total employment in the Second District to nearly 100 good-paying jobs.  When I visited their facility in March, Owl's Head owner and president,  David Bradford, told me that the economic outlook resulting from the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act helped lead to their decision to expand.   This is exactly why we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: to give  American businesses the confidence to grow and expand right in our  communities, and to help individual taxpayers keep more of their money.  Some might say that an extra $200 a month is just crumbs. For  hardworking Kentucky taxpayers, the extra money can go toward a car  payment or a mortgage. It can help pay for a child's braces or even for  regular expenses like groceries.   The bottom line is that, with more expendable income in their  pockets, Americans across the country have more freedom to choose how  they spend their hard-earned money. A typical family of four earning  $75,000 can expect to pay $2,000 less in taxes this year compared to  last year.   I was proud to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I am proud to  report that tax reform is making a real difference in the lives of  Kentuckians.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have a neighbor to the south of me here  today to talk about how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is having a big  effect on the lives of not just Kentuckians but all Americans-- particularly Kentucky and Tennessee--so I yield to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), my good friend from suburban Memphis, which is  one of the great cities in our area, to talk about the effects of the  tax cuts in Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Tennessee for  yielding back. As he said, Tennessee has seen the benefits from tax  reform. Kentucky is seeing the benefits of tax reform and the  opportunity for people to move into prosperity as they expand  opportunity.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in April, unemployment  was at 3.9 percent across the country. The Bureau of Labor Statistics  also reported that 164,000 jobs were added across the country in April,  raising the total since our tax reform bill was signed into law to  nearly 800,000 people.   Businesses are confident in our economy because of tax reform. Most  businesses are telling me that they are looking for workers, looking  for people to have the opportunity to move forward. One of the great  reasons that we are trying to do some of the policies that were talked  about during the last hour is that we want to see people have the  opportunity to work, to go from poverty to prosperity, from dependence  to independence.   We want people to have the opportunity to move forward, and a growing  economy will allow them to do so because these people are needed in the  workforce. They are wanted. They are needed, and I will guarantee you,  when we have people in the workforce, they are going to be better off  than if they are not. So we are looking forward to moving forward with  some of the issues that were talked about earlier.   But tonight we have heard stories about Kentuckians; we have heard  stories about Tennesseans who have benefited from tax reform.  Hardworking taxpayers are seeing more money in their paychecks.  Companies are expanding and creating jobs. Businesses are passing along  the benefits of tax cuts to their customers and to their employees,  handing out bonuses and raises. We are seeing these stories in our own  States and across the country.   This is exactly what we expected when we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act, and I am glad to see many of our communities benefiting from this  bill. I want to thank my friend from Tennessee for sharing his stories  from Tennessee, as I was sharing my stories from Kentucky, and I thank  him for joining me tonight to discuss the importance of tax reform.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
