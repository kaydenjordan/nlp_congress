 Mr. Speaker, it is time to focus on our energy crisis  and our energy costs, but that also relates to food.   In our country, we are already seeing bare shelves of food items. You  might recall years ago when Boris Yeltsin visited this country. They  took him to a supermarket, and he was amazed by what was on American  shelves. Now, we are moving in the direction of having shelves like in  Russia.   In my home State of California, as they cut off the water supply, the  Klamath Basin got zero water last year to farm crops, and in the San  Joaquin Valley and part of the Sacramento Valley, zero water  allocations.   As we look at conditions around the world, Russia is deciding to cut  off some of the imports of fertilizer, which will make it harder to  plant crops. Hungary has decided they are not going to export grain  anymore this coming year. This is going to have a ripple effect through  all food supplies and certainly on prices. The price of wheat is way  up, maybe 100 percent--wheat futures. We are going to feel this at the  stores if we are not planting our own food in this country.   We have the water to do it in California, but it is all going out in  the ocean in order to support fish that no longer live there. And the  salinity issue is misused.   We have to focus once again.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am still trying to figure out what the  priorities of this Biden administration are. When you look at the  different world events going on--when John Kerry comes out and says:  Oh, we hope this Ukraine intervention does not interfere with the  progress the U.S. is making with Mr. Putin on climate change--you  wonder what are the priorities?   Indeed, I would have to remind you that if CO2 is a  priority of this administration, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,  it represents only .04 percent of our atmosphere. You see all the other  gases in our atmosphere are represented by much larger percentages.   If indeed John Kerry and this administration's big priority is  CO2, what are they doing to help remedy that for the energy  this country needs? Well, my home State of California it shutting down  both nuclear power plants that we had at one time in the State, Santa  Onofre first and Diablo Canyon coming up pretty soon.   It is tearing up hydroelectric dams, like up in my district, on the  Klamath River; both of those provide CO2-free electricity,  if CO2 indeed is the big priority. No, it is something else.  It is some other agenda. They are not doing much to help. If we had  more nuclear power plants in this country, we wouldn't have the fuel  for them.   We produce only 9,000 pounds of uranium, yet our needs in this  country for our power plants, military ships, and even medical is about  45 million pounds. That is 9,000 versus 45 million. It doesn't seem to  be the priority of this administration to have America's needs, the  people of this country's needs, our energy independence when you look  at just the production of electricity, let alone oil and gas, which are  so critical for everyday needs for everyday Americans.   We need to really focus on what this country needs and we need to  help steer this administration into that focus instead of the fruitless  direction we are going.
