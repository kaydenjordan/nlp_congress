 Madam Speaker, the Taliban is emboldened today. They  have found a new reason to cry ``death to America.'' That reason is Joe  Biden.   His foreign policy is not America first; it is Taliban first.   Mr. President, listen carefully, and I will say it slowly just for  you: No man left behind. That is leadership.   Here is my pledge to the Taliban: You may chant ``death to America''  today, but mark my words, the levers of power will be in strong hands  soon. If you harm an American, we will rain  [[Page H4350]]  down vengeance upon you with wrath and fury that will put the fires of  hell to shame.   Psalm 91 promises us that God will be our refuge and our fortress.  But you do not worship my God or heed His promises. So when we come for  you, there will be no refuge, no cave, and no crevasse you can crawl  into that will save you from our wrath.   To those who hate America and all we stand for, read my lips: I am  young, and I have a long memory. When power in Washington inevitably  shifts, we will not forget you because we are in the business of  killing terrorists. And pretty soon, business will be booming.
