 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Charles  Vernon Parker of Austin, Texas, known as Charlie to his friends and  family.   Over the last three decades, Charlie Parker has been a leader in the  business community, construction, real estate, and many other areas.  Charlie's companies have completed massive projects across the United  States, providing jobs and opportunities to dozens of Americans.   Beyond Charlie's vast accomplishments in the business world, he has  been one of our Nation's greatest advocates and leaders in the area of  drug and alcohol addiction recovery.   As a person in long-term recovery, Charlie has been clean and sober  since 1984. In the three decades since, he has traveled the world with  his wife and best friend, Katie, as one of the most sought-after  addiction recovery motivational speakers.   To date, thousands of men across the world attribute their freedom  from addiction to Charlie Parker.   Charlie Parker served on the board of directors of Austin Recovery  and was a large benefactor of dozens of charitable organizations and an  active member of his Christian church.   Recently diagnosed with a terminal illness, Mr. Parker is spending  his final chapter still actively working with the men he mentors and  being a force for God and a force for good every day in our Nation, as  well as spending time with his loved ones: his daughters, Sadie and  Grace; his grandchildren; and his loving wife, Katie.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to commemorate the life of  Charles Vernon Parker.   Thank you, Charlie, for a life well lived.                            ____________________
