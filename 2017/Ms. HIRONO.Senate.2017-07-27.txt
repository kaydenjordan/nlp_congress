 Mr. President, I intend to offer the following motions to  H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the  Record.  [[Page S4376]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Hirono moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that the bill will not result in the loss of       health care coverage, increased out-of-pocket health care       costs, or increased taxes for any individual in the State of       Hawaii, with such changes maintaining the deficit neutrality       of the bill over the 10-year budget window.                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Hirono moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) provide that, for each calendar year that begins after       the date of enactment, each State shall provide medical       assistance through the State Medicaid program to any       individual residing in the State who is between 50 and 64       years of age and who demonstrates that the least expensive       private health insurance coverage available to such       individual would require the individual to pay premiums that       would exceed 9.5 percent of such individual's income.                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Hirono moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) provide that, for each calendar year that begins after       the date of enactment--        (A) each State shall provide medical assistance through the       State Medicaid program to any individual residing in the       State who is between 50 and 64 years of age and who       demonstrates that the least expensive private health       insurance coverage available to such individual would require       the individual to pay premiums that would exceed 9.5 percent       of such individual's income; and        (B) The Federal medical assistance percentage applicable to       medical assistance provided by a State under the State       Medicaid program to individuals described in paragraph (1)       shall be equal to 100 percent.                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Hirono moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance of the Senate with instructions to       report the same back to the Senate within 3 days, not       counting any day on which the Senate is not in session, with       changes that would prohibit tax credits from being used for a       qualified health plan which has an annual or lifetime cap on       benefits, or any plan which does not cover all necessary       treatment for a condition until cured (including       rehabilitation or reconstruction procedures).     Mr. President, I intend to offer the following motion to  H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Hirono moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that any child who is enrolled in a State       Medicaid program shall not be disenrolled from such program       without proof that the child has alternative insurance       coverage that is equally affordable and that provides at       least the same level of coverage.     Mr. President, I intend to offer the following motion to  H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Hirono moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) would strike any provisions that restrict or prohibit       Federal funding to Planned Parenthood health centers or other       high quality family planning providers, or discriminate       against providers based on the provision of constitutionally       protected reproductive health care.     Mr. President, so many of us have spoken so many times  now against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which would hurt  millions and millions of people in our country and especially the  sickest, poorest, and oldest among us.   I would say that I am probably the only Senator here who was not born  in a hospital. I was born at home in rural Japan. I lost a sister to  pneumonia when she was only 2 years old in Japan. She died at home, not  in a hospital, where maybe her life could have been saved.   It is hard for me to talk about this. I think you can tell. Give me a  moment.   When I came to this country as an immigrant, my mother brought me and  my brothers to this country so we could have a chance at a better life.  We came here with nothing. She had low-paying jobs. There was no health  coverage. Growing up as a young girl in Hawaii, my greatest fear was  that my mother would get sick and, if she got sick, how were we going  to pay for her care, and how would she go to work? If she didn't go to  work, there would be no pay, there would be no money. I know what it is  like to run out of money at the end of the month. That was my life as  an immigrant here.   Now, here I am, a U.S. Senator. I am fighting kidney cancer, and I am  just so grateful that I had health insurance so that I could  concentrate on the care that I needed rather than how the heck I was  going to afford the care that is going to probably save my life.   Guess what. When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer and facing my  first surgery, I heard from so many of my colleagues, including so many  of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who wrote to me  wonderful notes sharing with me their own experience with major illness  in their families or with their loved ones.   You showed me your care. You showed me your compassion. Where is that  tonight?   I can't believe that a single Senator in this body has not faced an  illness or whose family member or loved one has not faced illness who  was not so grateful that they had healthcare. I cannot believe there is  a single Senator who has not experienced that in their family or their  lives.   I know how important healthcare is. What is in here? Why doesn't  every single Senator know that? Why are we here tonight voting on a  bill that has not had a single hearing? Why are we here tonight voting  on a bill that would eliminate healthcare coverage that could save  lives for 16 million people? Why are we here voting on a bill that  would probably mean that people like me, millions in this country, who  are now in the ranks of those receiving care with preexisting  conditions will not get the healthcare we need? Why are we here  tonight? Where is your compassion? Where is the care you showed me when  I was diagnosed with my illness?   I find it hard to believe that we can sit here and vote on a bill  that is going to hurt millions and millions of people in our country.  We are better than that.   I listened to John McCain calling on us to have hearings and to do  the right thing, and I am so saddened he was unable to move us in that  direction. I would call on him tonight to vote his conscience, to vote  for us who say we are going to stand for the millions of people in our  country who will be hurt by what we are contemplating tonight.   Mr. President, I will yield the floor by asking my friends to show  the compassion to everybody in this country that you showed me. We all  should be voting to send this bill to committee.   I yield the floor.
