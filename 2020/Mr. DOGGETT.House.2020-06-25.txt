 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her tremendous  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important start--not an end--of what  must be done to stop racism in America. So much more must be  accomplished by the local police departments across the country. This  is more than a few bad apples. It is a virus that has too often  infected the orchard. This is not a time for meaningless gestures or  watered-down proposals, but for real, meaningful action.   Black lives matter because for so often and for so long they have  been the subject of violence and prejudices as though they did not.   In Austin, Mike Ramos was fleeing. Javier Ambler couldn't breathe.  Both were unarmed, unthreatening, and both are now dead. While  technology has literally brought this violence into our homes, we also  recognize how many incidences have never been reported.   Failure by some law enforcement personnel to protect Black citizens,  threatens the very core of our democracy. What we do today is not only  about protecting those victims, but it is also with respect and thanks  to the many dedicated police officers who put their lives on the line  daily for our security.   What we need is to reach across the divide, to have protesters  educating police about their concerns, and officers listening and  affirming that they want to be a part of the solution that we offer  today.                                time  1730
