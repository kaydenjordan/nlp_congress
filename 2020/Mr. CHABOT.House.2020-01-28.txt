 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today  to honor two iconic Cincinnati leaders who passed away over the  weekend.   On Saturday, we lost longtime Hamilton County Commissioner and former  Cincinnati City Councilman Todd Portune.   Todd was a true leader, willing to put aside political differences  and work together on issues to benefit our community. He was also  someone I considered not only a respected colleague but a friend.   Then, on Sunday, Cincinnati suffered another loss with the passing of  Judge Nathaniel Jones.   As a civil rights leader, a Federal judge, and a person, Judge Jones  was one of those rare people who was universally admired and respected.  Having worked with Thurgood Marshall on Brown v. Board of Education,  having helped South Africa overcome apartheid, and having served as  general counsel for the NAACP, Judge Jones not only improved the lives  of people in Cincinnati but across the country and, in fact, across the  globe.   Madam Speaker, while Cincinnati will sorely miss Commissioner Portune  and Judge Jones, their accomplishments will be felt by our community  and across our Nation for generations to come.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule  to provide for a motion to recommit on the Senate amendment to H.R. 550  so that minority voices can be heard on the critical issue of war.
