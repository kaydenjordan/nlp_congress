 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.   The economy is not growing as it should be--about 0.7 percent last  quarter--and according to many of the employers in my district, our  workforce is not prepared to meet the needs of today, let alone the  future.   This legislation is important because it recognizes that we need an  education system that best prepares our kids for the future--a future  in business--as soon as they hit K-12, and they should be ready to  enter the job market or move on to additional training. Traditional 4- year colleges and universities cannot be the only pathway for the next  generation of students.   In Virginia, there were nearly 110,000 postsecondary students  enrolled in CTE courses in the 2014 year. Programs I am privileged to  represent in Virginia's Seventh Congressional District include Amelia  Nottoway Technical Center, the Chesterfield Governor's Career and  Technical Academy, and Chesterfield County Public Schools Governor's  Health Sciences Academy.   While these innovative programs in my district have excelled,  technical skills and on-the-job training must be ingrained in the  thinking of our entire K-12 educational system, across the curriculum,  in every class. I believe this bill is a positive step in that  direction.
