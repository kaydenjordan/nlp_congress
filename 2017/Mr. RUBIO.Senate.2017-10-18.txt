 Mr. President, I am very happy the Senate is engaged in  this debate on tax policy. It actually is long overdue. It has been  some 30-odd years since this country has undertaken a massive reform of  our Tax Code.   It is interesting. If we go back and think what life was like back in  1986, it was just a different planet, a different world, different  economics. So, at a minimum, our code needs to be modernized. Everybody  who has run for office--certainly every candidate for President from  both parties for over two decades now--has run on the promise of tax  reform and the need for it. So this is a very important debate.   What we are debating now on the budget, so people who are watching at  home understand--you and I at home think of a family budget as a plan  on what you are going to spend money on, and that is what the Federal  budget is. It is kind of an outline, a framework of how and the  parameters under which the government would spend its money. Then you  have to actually go out and spend it through a separate process called  appropriations. So this budget creates a framework for how we are going  to spend money in the year to come, and then it is going to be used as  a vehicle to pass tax reform, which is obviously the way and the system  under which we generate revenue for the government to pay for the  things we need to pay for. That is the first debate. But obviously the  debate on the budget has led us to this debate on tax reform, because  that is the primary purpose this year it is being used as a vehicle  for.   Why does that matter? There are a lot of speeches going on already  about tax reform and how bad the bill is and how this is a giveaway for  this group of people or that group of people. That is hard to do since  there is still not a bill, and the reason there is not a bill is that  it is going to be worked through the normal process of the Senate.   That was the criticism, for example, from my friends on the other  side and many outside of this building in the press. The criticism was,  you put together a healthcare plan, and you didn't even go through  committee, no one had any input, and there were no public hearings.  That is what they are going to do with tax reform, and that is what is  going to produce a bill.   The only thing that has been put out is called a framework, and the  framework basically says: These are some of the ideas we have. This is  our starting point that we want to operate from. But we are going to go  through the committee process, there are going to be votes, there is  going to be an opportunity to weigh in and make differences, and from  that, we intend to produce a tax bill.   So they can criticize the framework, I suppose, but to basically go  out and start trying to convince people that there is a tax bill that  will do this versus that when it is just not true and when you have a  seat here in the Senate and potentially on the committee where you can  actually weigh in about the specifics of what is going to be in the  bill and what is not, I think it is unfair and disingenuous. In any  event, that is kind of the way things go nowadays. So I look forward to  that debate.   The second thing that has been an interesting development is hearing  people talk about how horrible this is going to be, that this is going  to add to the debt, and then all of a sudden a bunch of people who have  never had any problem spending as much money as they possibly could out  of the Federal Treasury are suddenly becoming deficit hawks.   Here is what is so interesting. If we were to turn around and say:  Forget about tax reform. We are going to take $1.5 trillion over the  next 10 years and we are going to use it for debt spending. We are  going to borrow $1.5 trillion and use it to fund all these things the  government is going to do--for example, one of our colleagues here has  offered a plan to provide healthcare for everyone in America, paid for  by the Federal Government. That would cost tens of trillions of  dollars. Over a dozen Members of the Senate have signed on to it as a  plan. There is no plan to pay for it. It is not $1.5 trillion over 10  years; it is like tens of trillions of dollars over the next number of  years. So there is a lot of concern there. It kind of boils down to we  are prepared to borrow money and spend it so long as the government  gets to spend it, but if this is money we are going take and give to  you to spend, then that is a real problem, and that is irresponsible.  That is the framework.    The second point I would make on the debt is, I believe the debt is a  significant threat to the future of the United States. The problem is,  we can't tax our way out of it, and we can't simply grow our way out of  it. We have to do a combination of things. The first is, we have to  grow our economy. The second thing we have to do is bring some  constraint to future spending--not slash Medicare, not get rid of  Social Security.   My mother is on Social Security and Medicare. This may surprise many  people watching, but there are a significant number of people in my  home State of Florida on Social Security and on Medicare. As I said, my  mother is one of them. I am an enormous supporter of these programs. I  also look at those programs and I look at the number of people going  into them and how long they are going to live, and the math tells you  these programs are going to have some big problems in the years to  come, which threatens not just to take them down but threatens to  trigger a debt crisis in America.   We have to deal with the spending side and create a more disciplined  way of spending in the future years to bring some certainty, but we  also have to grow the economy. In essence, if you take a stagnant  economy, no cuts in the world are going to get you there. You can't  simply cut your way there, and you can't simply tax your way there. The  only solution to our debt problem--and it happens to be good for  America all around--is the combination of discipline in future spending  combined with rapid, robust, and sustained economic growth.   As much as anything else, this effort of tax reform is, among other  things, an effort to generate sustained economic growth and to do so in  a unique period in the history of the world. This is not 1986. Our  economy is not the only show in town anymore. There are now dozens of  developed economies around the world that are following our example  from the eighties--reduce taxes, reduce regulations, and, frankly, make  investments in infrastructure and the like--and today they are no  longer recipients of our aid. They are no longer nations looking to  work with the United States to get a little bit closer to the way we  are. They are full-blown competitors in the global economy.   Every 4 years--every 2 years, actually, once in the winter and the  next 2 years in the summer, we send our best athletes in different  events to the Olympics to compete. In our economy, it is the Olympics  every single day. What makes it even more complicated is, sometimes our  team isn't just made up of Americans. Our team is partnered with the  Japanese team to create a company or the Mexican team to create a  manufacturing chain. So that complicates it further.   The fundamental thing to understand is, America today is in a  competition--by the way, a competition that doesn't  [[Page S6501]]  have to be one where they lose and we win or we lose and they win but a  competition nonetheless. Every day, businesses, investors, people with  ideas are making a decision: Where do I want to do this activity? Where  do I want to create this new job? Where do I want to create this new  company? Where do I want to innovate this new idea? Where do I want to  hire people to do all of this? Do I want to do it in America or do I  want to do it somewhere else?   We are not performing well in that competition. It is not just  because of taxes. We have infrastructure problems that we have to  confront. We have a higher education system that is not built for the  21st century. We are not teaching people, in sufficient numbers, the  skills they need for some of the best jobs in the world. I have no  problem with a 4-year degree from a liberal arts college. That should  always be an option on the menu. We need a lot of plumbers,  pipefitters, electricians, and welders. These are important jobs as  well. In fact, oftentimes, they pay a lot more than a 4-year degree in  political science will ever pay you. We need to do a better job of  training those people in those fields as well.   We need to have an immigration system that is pro-American but a pro- American economy that allows us to compete for the best talent in the  world. If you think about it, I don't see anybody complaining that  their team just signed a guy who can throw 98-mile-an-hour fastballs,  but he is from the Dominican Republic. If in sports we go out and find  the best people, we should be able to do that in our economy as well.  You can do that without hurting the American worker.   We also have to have a tax code that is competitive. It cannot be  substantially more complicated and expensive to start a business or  operate one in America than it is somewhere else because if we do that,  we will lose. That, as much as anything else in this global economy, is  hurting the American people.   You talk about putting America first. I think it is about allowing  America to compete. I am not asking for an unfair advantage over other  countries. We are just asking for a fair chance to compete because I  believe the American people who have been given the chance to compete  can outthink, outinnovate, and outwork anybody in the world, and our  Tax Code is a key part of it.   The goal here is, when you hear a lot of this talk about businesses  getting this or that deduction, we want to make America an attractive  place to invest. We don't want people taking that money and investing  all of it in another country. We want them to invest it here, invest it  here to allow a company to grow and hire more people. We want companies  to decide that this is the place where we want to hire. This is the  place where we want to innovate. We have to have a tax code that  reflects that.   We have to understand that the vast majority of American businesses  don't pay taxes the way the big companies do. They pay the small  businesses through passthroughs. A lot of them--you know them because I  know them--are not sophisticated operations. They are successful, but  they don't have an army of lawyers to deal with a complicated tax code  and accountants who know every trick in the book. To them, the Tax Code  hurts them, especially since they are paying on their personal rates.   That is why the personal side is related to the business side. These  are things we need to deal with so we can be competitive, so we can  have more taxpayers--not more taxes, more taxpayers. More people making  more money not just improves their quality of life, it generates more  revenue to pay for the bridges, the roads, and the national security of  the United States of America. So tax reform, as much as anything else,  is the growth side of this endeavor, and it is not the only thing we  need to do, but it is an important thing we need to do if we are going  to let America compete and win in the 21st century global economy.   There is another dynamic of the 21st century that is different from  1986. From that, I rely heavily on my own personal experience, not just  today but growing up. In 1986, I was in ninth grade. My mom worked at  Kmart, and my father was a bartender in Miami. We owned a home. We  didn't have everything we wanted, but we had everything we needed. They  were able to sustain a family and allow us to go to school--public  school--go on to college and do those sorts of things on the salary of  a bartender and a stock clerk at Kmart.   I don't need to tell anybody here that there isn't a community in the  country at this point, in the 21st century, where my parents could  achieve the standard of living they had in 1986, for two reasons:  everything costs more, and those jobs either don't exist anymore or  have not kept pace with the cost of living.   Since the year 2000, up until today, my wife Jeanette and I have been  raising four children in the 21st century. I enter it by telling you  that while we certainly have been blessed to have more resources  available to us than the vast majority of people who will be impacted  by what we are about to do here, we certainly have enough people in our  lives and certainly have had periods in our lives where we understand  some of the challenges facing people today. Here is the bottom line.  Raising children in the 21st century is more expensive than raising  children at any point in the history of this country. The reason is,  there are more things to pay for. I know people may tell you that Wi-Fi  and access to the internet is a luxury. I am sorry, you can't do  homework in the 21st century with your kids if you don't have access to  the internet, and that costs money. Not only do you have to have access  to the internet, you have to have access to it on a mobile device.  Those mobile devices cost money. Those data plans cost money. If you  are paying for a data plan, you know how much they cost. It is not just  about watching movies on Netflix or talking to your friends on  Snapchat, you literally cannot do homework in many of the schools in  the country in the 21st century unless you have access to it. That is  why I personally have witnessed people at McDonald's at 6:30 in the  evening because they have free Wi-Fi, and the single mom or single dad  is there helping their kids with homework.   The cost of everything keeps going up, the cost of clothing, of food,  of everything. You look at our Tax Code, and it has not kept pace with  it. Let me give you an example. Accounting for inflation, from 1960 to  2015, which is when the latest numbers were available, the average cost  per child of raising that child, in a middle-income family, went up by  over $11,000. It is over $11,000 more expensive, accounting for  inflation.   Here is a stunning figure. Again, this is different in different  communities, but, by and large, for middle-income families--and by that  we mean a firefighter and a teacher who are raising a child--they are  going to spend approximately $230,000 to raise that child in the 21st  century from 0 to 18. By the way, my oldest is now 17\1/2\. I have been  told by plenty of my colleagues that it doesn't end at 18. In many  cases, it begins to accelerate in some form or fashion--but,  nevertheless, $230,000.    Let me tell you something else. That does not even include college.  That doesn't even include going to college, which is another thing we  are going through right now, which, by the way, is completely and  totally out of control in terms of what they are charging. It is more  than that. There are people out there spending $10 or $15,000 on SAT  prep courses. For the life of me, I don't understand how these schools  can expect someone who comes from a single-parent home in a poor  neighborhood to keep pace with people who are having these sorts of  resources available to them, but that is another topic for another day.  That is a cost that is involved in all of this.   How about childcare? In 38 out of 50 States, childcare is more  expensive than college. Think about it. Let's say you take home $900 a  week, and childcare is $250 or $350 a week. That is one-third of your  paycheck just for childcare. These expenses are reducing the ability of  families to afford to have children and to raise them. These costs keep  going up.   One of the things we have offered as a partial solution--it is not  going to solve every problem--is to increase the child tax credit and  to do so in a way that actually helps people. What it would do is it  would reduce families' tax bills on a per-child basis, increasing the  flexibility that family has at a time, for example, when childcare  costs  [[Page S6502]]  have risen more than ever before and are already higher than they have  ever been. We have to understand, the family is the most important unit  in all of society. It is the most important institution in society. It  is the first government. It is the first school. It is the core  institution that underlies everything else we do as a nation. There is  no more important job than any of us will ever do than the job of a  parent.   If you think about our Tax Code, it says: If you invest money in a  piece of equipment or a business, the Tax Code will help you with that,  but if you invest it in the future of an American taxpayer, if you  invest it in someone whom we are going to need to build the sort of  economy and future we want for our Nation, the Tax Code does not really  take it into account. That makes no sense to me.   I have two charts to outline how important this tax credit is to tax  reform. Again, I am operating off the framework because there is no  bill out yet, but based on the framework, the amount of tax relief a  working- or middle-class family will get almost entirely depends-- almost entirely--on what we do with a child tax credit.   Here is the first chart. This chart shows the average tax cut for  American families if the child tax credit is doubled from its current  size--not just doubled, but we make it refundable against payroll tax  liability, which is the tax every American pays. For Social Security  and Medicare, it is the first chunk that comes off your paycheck. No  matter how little you make, everyone pays it. If we make the child tax  credit double, and we apply it toward your liability on payroll tax,  this chart--which is what I propose, and it is what Senator Lee and I  have been working on, what Ivanka Trump has been advocating and we have  been working with her office on--shows you what the impact of that  would be. That is the blue line. You can see from the blue line that  the chart begins with some cut, depending on how much money you make,  and it begins to drop as the amount of--obviously, the more money you  make, the larger the credit will be up to its limit because you can't  get a credit if you are not making any money at all, even if it applies  to payroll tax. You start to see that it also grows with the number of  children because it is per child. It doesn't just phase off at two  children. That is the blue chart.   What is the red chart? The red chart is if we do nothing or basically  just do a gimmicky thing about it. Then you start to see that without  the child tax credit being made refundable and without the child tax  credit applying toward the payroll refundable, and without the tax  credit being per child and sufficiently increased, this framework would  be a tax increase. People would actually pay more, and the more  children you have, the bigger your tax increase will be.   Suffice it to say, we have to do it. This red line cannot be what we  wind up at. I don't think that is the intent of the people who drew up  the framework, but that is where we wind up if we don't do it. I pulled  that chart out to show you how important it is that we do it as part of  this framework. It has to happen. It has to. It will not pass without  it. It is the right thing to do. This is a pro-job, pro-family  initiative. I actually think it is pro-growth. It is hard for  economists to measure it that way, but it would be.   There are a lot of people who can't start a business because they  can't afford to leave the security of a certain type of employment. The  tax credit frees that up for them to be able to do it.   Let me get to the second chart. This shows you basically the same  dynamic but now based on how much people are making, what kind of jobs  they do. We arbitrarily picked out some of the jobs where many of us  know people who are in these fields: a home health aide, a retail  person working sales at Macy's, an office clerk--we all see office  clerks every day--a truckdriver, an individual with a vocation to be a  nurse, firefighters. Obviously, I have three firefighters in my own  family. Again, of the $1,500 child tax credit, only the first $1,000  was refundable, and you start to see that red line here and how  pathetic it is for these folks in these professions. It does not really  do much.    Now look at the blue line. That is what we want to get to, which  shows an at least $2,000 child tax credit being applied to their  payroll taxes. Now you start to see the figures get better here. You  start to see the home health aide getting about $1,000 in relief, the  retail salesperson getting a little bit under $1,000, the truckdriver  and the office clerk getting down to $1,400, the nurse getting down to  about $1,200, the firefighter getting down to about $1,200.   A lot of people will tell you that $1,200 or $1,400 is not going to  change the world, but it will help. I didn't say this was the solution  to every problem. Another solution is to get these salaries up higher.  That is the other part of it. Another solution is to get the cost of  some of these things lower, like get a grip on the cost of obtaining  college credits. Another solution is to provide more childcare options  for people. Yet there is no way that this does not help. It helps. It  helps the people whom we need to help, and it helps us get closer to  the goal that we all have for this Nation, which is being a place of  equal opportunity. We pride ourselves on equal opportunity, but I am  telling you that we are lacking equal opportunity if, of two children  who grow up in two different homes, one has access to quality pre-K  education, then to quality schooling, and then to the right support for  that schooling, and one does not. It starts by the time you are a  junior and senior. It hurts you. It absolutely hurts you in your way  forward in life.   This is not the solution to all of our problems--that would be  misleading--but it is a big step in that direction. It would show in  tax policy that we are supporting the most important institution in  society, which is the family, and the most important function that any  of us will ever have, which is being a parent. We are investing in  America's future.   The children being raised--the two, three, four children--do you know  who those are? Those are the people who are going to fund Social  Security and Medicare when I retire and when many of you retire. Those  are the people who are going to be starting the businesses. Those are  the people who are going to be the backbone of our economy not in 50  years but in the next 10, 15, 20 years. This is the future of America-- literally and figuratively the future of our Nation--in which we would  be investing. We would be allowing their parents to make that  investment on their behalf, who are the right people to be making the  investment.   This has to be a part of whatever else happens. I think this has  strong bipartisan support, and I know the White House supports it. I am  optimistic that it will happen. The only thing that would keep it from  happening is if tax reform itself goes down, but this has to happen.  There is no choice but to do it. We have to, and it is the right thing  to do.   I am pleased that we have come this far on it, and I look forward to  the work in getting it achieved, but it cannot just be a gimmick, it  cannot just be that we increase the child tax credit by a little bit.  If we do not do it right and sufficiently and structure it in an  appropriate way, we will be raising taxes on working families. That  cannot happen. I know no one here wants to see that happen.   We will have a lot of debate about everything else, but this is the  one that I hope will have strong bipartisan support as we move forward  on tax reform, and I am excited to be able to work on it.
