 Mr. Speaker, point of order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas will suspend.   The gentleman from Colorado will state his point of order.    Mr. Speaker, point of order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas will suspend.   The gentleman from Colorado will state his point of order.    The gentleman is referring to Members of the Senate,  which I believe is out of decorum and out of order by name.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman from Colorado demanding  that the gentleman from Texas' words be taken down?    Yes, sir.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas will be seated.   The Clerk will report the words.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my point of order, and I  withdraw my request that the gentleman from Texas' words be taken down.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman clarify that his request  is that the demand for the words of the gentleman from Texas to be  taken down be withdrawn?    Yes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The demand is withdrawn.   The gentleman from Texas is recognized.    Yes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The demand is withdrawn.   The gentleman from Texas is recognized.    Mr. Speaker, point of order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado will state his  point of order.    Mr. Speaker, the point of order is that poster that  is being brought is disparaging of a Member of the Senate.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend.   The Chair requests that the poster be presented to the Chair for his  observation.   The gentleman from Colorado raises an objection to the use of an  exhibit in debate. Under the rules of the House, the Chair may submit  the question of its use to the House or make a judgment on its use as a  matter of decorum.   The Chair has examined the exhibit and finds that it does not  constitute a breach of decorum.    Mr. Speaker, I move to appeal the ruling of the  Chair.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the  Chair stand as the judgment of the House?    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 20, 2018 on Page H592 the following appeared: Mr.  PERLMUTTER.
