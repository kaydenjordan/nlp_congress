 Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of  Nevada's Third District, I rise again to say it is time to end this  shutdown. My office is currently working with a couple, both of them  Federal workers, one of them a veteran, who are furloughed and now  being evicted because of this unnecessary shutdown.   Nevada's SNAP and housing authority are preparing to draw on their  reserves to make up for the lack of Federal funding. Over 400,000  Nevadans will face devastating consequences if these programs run out  of money.   Our Governor just asked our higher education board to step in and  protect Nevada's college students from penalties, and the speaker of  our legislature just introduced a bill to protect Federal workers from  debt collectors and landlords. Get the picture?   We are now stressing our State and local governments because our  President and our Senate cannot step up and do their job. This shutdown  has gone on far too long. My colleagues and I just voted for the 11th  time to reopen the government. I ask the Senate and the President to do  their duty and open it up now.                            ____________________
