 Madam Speaker, for far too long, Congress has allowed  the executive branch to usurp its constitutional responsibility of the  power to go to war. Now, we have seen how a President can misuse one of  his most solemn responsibilities as Commander in Chief.   The 2002 AUMF, which was built on a lie, on a lie of weapons of mass  destruction, is long irrelevant and must be repealed.   The American people do not want war. The American people do not want  war. Yet, the President has escalated the prospects of war in the  Middle East in a way that has not only severely endangered U.S.  interests and diplomacy to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon  but has also resulted in the injury of at least 50 American  servicemembers.   We must repeal the 2002 AUMF because the President has not been given  the authority to go to war. And we must exercise the power of the purse  and ensure that no funds are used for an unwanted, unauthorized war.
