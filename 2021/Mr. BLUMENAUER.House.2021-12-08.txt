 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.   Congress passed a law almost a century ago prohibiting the  importation of goods made with forced labor. But, you know, it was  really never enforced.   That changed in 2016, potentially, when we passed legislation to  eliminate the consumptive demand loophole that allowed people a way  around. Well, it is time that we finish the job.   Nothing is more chilling than what the Chinese are doing to the  Uyghur people. I have chaired meetings of our Trade Subcommittee that  were really appalling. It is Orwellian in terms of what they are doing  to detain Uyghurs in internment, re-education, slave labor camps; that  international concern the Chinese think will just remain on the  sideline.   Now, there are many American companies that are attempting to deal  with this, but we need to do more. We need to strengthen their resolve,  and we need to be able to get the attention of the Chinese Government.   A stronger regime is absolutely necessary. Crimes against humanity  require a response. We must not just vote our support for the Uyghur  people and other minorities across China. We need to make sure that  we are clear about who gets the benefit of the doubt.    More than a million Uyghurs have been enslaved; half of them forced  to harvest cotton, one of the Xinjiang region's largest exports. When  American consumers buy a shirt, they shouldn't have questions about  whether or not that was made with forced labor.   I strongly support this legislation to ensure that American dollars  aren't inadvertently contributing to forced labor. That is the language  that the Chinese understand; denying them access to our markets and  making sure that people are responsible for their supply chain.   This legislation, I think, is a great start. I am pleased that there  is bipartisan support for it. I hope we enact it, and then we work  together to make sure that it is enforced.
