 Madam Speaker, our democracy is in grave  danger. We are seeing unrelenting efforts across the country to  suppress voters and limit access to the ballot box, particularly in  communities of color. We are seeing record-breaking waves of dark money  backing candidates and campaigns with no transparency or  accountability, and we are seeing efforts to increase partisan  gerrymandering that allows politicians to pick and choose who they  represent.   It is wrong and it is undemocratic. We need to make it easier to vote  for those who are legally eligible otherwise to vote, not harder to do  so. We need more transparency in our campaigns, not less. We need to  strengthen ethics rules, not weaken them, and we need to pass the For  the People Act.   This bill will transform our democracy and return power to the  people, where it belongs. It will ensure that every American who is  eligible to vote can do so easily and securely. It will crack down on  the culture of corruption that has defined Washington for far too long.  It will finally end the era of dark money in our politics that has  plagued this House for years.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defend our democracy and to  support this legislation.
