 Mr. Speaker, as vice chair of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus, I will highlight some of the ongoing work my  colleagues and I from the CHC's Working Group on Migrant Families are  doing.   Last month, in anticipation of the elimination of title 42, a Trump- era measure, our working group sat to work and develop recommendations  that were subsequently submitted to Secretary Mayorkas outlining the  CHC's proposal to protect the values of our Nation. These include the  rights of immigrants, asylum seekers, the rights of families to enter  our country and make their case before government as they flee  political violence, as they flee gang violence, as they flee food  insecurity, as they flee environmental crises that forces, perhaps, a  mom to take her three children and walk for thousands of miles to our  border.   Mr. Speaker, immigration is not a matter that is exclusive to the  United States of America; it is a worldwide matter. Mothers and  families across the planet are often forced because of violence,  because of war, because of environmental crisis, and because of food  insecurity to seek a better life for them and their children.    We submitted a series of recommendations to Secretary Mayorkas, among  them was not to resort back to the family detention model that was  perpetrated during the Trump administration. This model we know, and  experts feel, scars children, some of them for life. We saw the photos  and the images of children incarcerated in cages during those days and  those children, experts feel, could be scarred and traumatized for  life.   We asked Secretary Mayorkas not to resort back to the family  detention model, and we were happy to see that he did not.   Next, in our series of proposals, was to grant and continue to grant  the parole program for Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, and Venezuelans.   Mr. Speaker, there is a crisis of democracy in the Western Hemisphere  and in this chapter of our history, it is not characterized by a left- leaning government crisis or a right-leaning government crisis.   It is impacting countries on both ends. Therefore, it is prudent and  appropriate to grant those that are fleeing political violence, whose  lives are in danger, as we grant to Ukrainians that come to the border  and other folks that are fleeing political violence and escaping  murder, the opportunity to make their case for asylum.   We were happy to see that that program will continue and provide a  legal pathway for those seeking asylum. Though several elements of this  parole program may not necessarily be the  [[Page H2142]]  best, it is one that provides a legal path of access to the United  States Government to make their case for asylum.   I further applaud Mr. Mayorkas' efforts to implement a new program  that basically applies to citizens of El Salvador, Colombia, Honduras,  and Guatemala. It provides the ability to have family reunification. We  often hear, time and time again, how family values are an integral part  of America and that when families are together, our Nation is stronger;  when families are divided, our Nation is weaker.   So this particular program will assist, again, in--through legal  pathways--providing family reunification efforts and the abilities for  citizens of El Salvador, Colombia, Honduras, and Guatemala. These are  both very good programs.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is a step in the right direction.                            ____________________
