 Mr. President, I love history, and we have been here  before. We were in exactly this place in 1886. Let me read you a quote  from Senator Thomas W. Palmer of Michigan on this floor in 1886. I am  going to try to channel my 19th century Senator voice:         Among the servants of our civilization none have approached       in efficiency the railway. It has annihilated distance; it       has not only made the wilderness blossom as the rose, but       also has enabled the rose to be readily exchanged for the       products of cities. . . . These are the modern highways for       commerce, and should differ only in extent and facilities       from their predecessors back to the days of the Roman roads.    The point is, in the 1800s, the railroads were in a position, because  of their unique nature as the highways of the time, to strangle  competition and hold small businesses hostage. The situation today with  the internet is almost identical, and the Senate is now going to  grapple with a rapidly growing but mature industry that is central to  economic opportunity in our country. Unfortunately, in both the cases  of the railroads and today, the internet, often, there are players who  have the means and incentives to engage in discriminatory pricing or  prioritization due to the frequent existence of last-mile monopolies.  It is the exact same situation.   My favorite quote from Mark Twain is that ``history doesn't always  repeat itself, but it usually rhymes.'' In this case, it is repeating  itself.   Back in 1886, here is what the Select Committee on Interstate  Commerce said about the causes of complaint against the railroad  system.   No. 1, ``that . . . rates are unreasonably high at noncompeting  points.''   That means small towns--rural America--at noncompeting points, which  is the same as what is happening with the internet. We see today,  particularly in rural areas, that there is only one provider of the  truly high-speed broadband that is needed to run an online business and  its expenses.   Here is point No. 2 from 1886: ``The effect of the prevailing policy  of railroad management''--you can put in internet management--``is, by  an elaborate system of secret special rates, rebates, drawbacks, and  concessions, to foster monopoly, to enrich favored shippers, and to  prevent free competition in many lines of trade in which the item of  transportation is an important factor.''   This is exactly what we are worried about with the internet. It could  come roaring back if we don't reimpose net neutrality rules. It is not  hard to imagine that if paid prioritization is allowed, which would  have a customer on the pipes of the internet be able to get a faster  speed, it will cement the dominance of Facebook and Amazon, which are  great companies, but it will stifle the development of smaller  competitors who can't afford the access fees.   One of the great things about the internet is its low barriers to  entry. If, indeed, the major internet providers are able to impose  barriers to entry, it will, by definition, stifle small businesses  across the country. That has been the glory of the internet; the  enabling of the development of small businesses throughout the length  and breadth of this country.   Here is another one from 1886: ``Railroad corporations have  improperly engaged in lines of business entirely distinct from that of  transportation, and that undue advantages have been afforded to  business enterprises in which railroad officials were interested.''   In other words, the railroads were getting into other lines of  business which they could then favor on the railroads. That is exactly  what we are worried about now. Large telecommunications companies are  becoming vertically integrated with content companies. There is a clear  potential for conflicts of interest. Net neutrality rules are so  important for preventing any attempts of existing incumbent carriers to  favor the delivery of their own content and degrade the delivery of  competitors' content. This is exactly the kind of thing we are worried  about.   Right now, anyone with a broadband connection has equal access.  General Motors or Amazon or Exxon or Facebook has the same access to  the internet as somebody who is starting a new company in his garage,  and that is why the internet has been such a dynamic job creator across  the country. Yet, in December of 2017, the Federal Communications  Commission repealed the idea of net neutrality and basically said to  the large providers: It is open season. You can do it. Do whatever you  want. They have unenforceable rules, and small businesses and startups  will undoubtedly, ultimately, be the losers. This is just the reality.   Quite often, we have issues around here that are in shades of gray,  that we have to think about, and that can be argued on both sides.  Reasonable people can differ. In this case, the people who repealed net  neutrality are all wrong. There is no good argument for repealing rules  that simply keep the pipes open for everyone just as the Interstate  Commerce Commission in the 1880s was designed to keep the railroads  open for everyone.   This is a little complicated because it is the repealing of a repeal.  What we are talking about is a CRA that would repeal the repeal by the  FCC of net neutrality rules. It is the ultimate small business bill. It  will allow small businesses to compete without limitations, and small  online companies and low-income consumers will not be left in the slow  lane. Innovation will continue to blossom, and opportunity will have  equal access to this incredibly important economic engine.   It is important to understand that what this bill does, in my view-- or what net neutrality does--is not government regulation, which is  what you hear: ``This is government regulation.'' Somebody is going to  have the control of the pipes. The question is, Should it be the people  who own the pipes so they can do whatever they want and discriminate  against small businesses or other carriers and favor their own content  or should the government simply be the referee that says, ``No. This is  going to be equal''? I think net neutrality is deregulatory in the  sense  [[Page S2583]]  that all it does is protect the neutrality and the openness of the  internet to competitors across the country.   I had a roundtable in Maine, on Friday, to which I invited small  businesses and ISPs, internet service providers. The opinion--the  response--was unanimous in that this is absolutely crucial to the  survival and the vitality of these businesses. We have a small company  in Maine called Certify. It has 150 employees. It is a web-based  solution for people who keep track of their receipts for business  travel. It is a nationwide business. It has 10,000 clients across the  country, but it is all about having equal access to the internet. It  has 2 million users around the globe, and it is based in Portland, ME.  That is the power of the internet. We don't want that business to be  choked off by a large competitor who can pay preferential rates and  make my companies in Maine pay higher rates and therefore unable to  compete.    A little company called Big Room Studios and Yarn Corporation are two  software development virtual reality companies based in Maine. They are  dependent on continued access to an open internet. Their founder got in  touch with me. He firmly believes that without net neutrality rules,  there is a real risk that startup companies like his will face barriers  to entry that will keep them from reaching their full potential.   Another great example is Dream Local Digital, a company in Rockland,  ME, where the employees and customers are all over the place. It is  based in a wonderful town in Maine, on the coast, Rockland. They have  customers in 65 cities. It is a digital marketing company serving  customers throughout the country, primarily small businesses, all  connected through the internet. Led by a visionary named Shannon  Kinney, their core existence and business model rely on the open  internet enabling a significant number of employees to work from home  in 9 different communities in Maine and 10 other States. They have to  have open access to the internet.   This isn't a debate about ISPs and consumers. The smaller ISPs that  were at my roundtable and that I have heard from around the country  feel that an open internet is as important to them as it is to their  customers. They support net neutrality.   OTELCO, a rural broadband company, provides voice over internet  protocol, or VoIP, services, and they are worried that larger  competitors can demand paid prioritization fees in order to maintain  service quality, and that would be the end of their business.   This is an incredible moment in the Senate, and I don't think this is  a political issue. I think this is a small business issue. This is a  public issue. The crucial point is, who is going to control the future  of the internet? Is it going to be the owners of the large pipes, or is  it going to be the public? Can the internet maintain the quality of  service, the openness of service, the fairness of service that has been  a part of it, that has allowed it to grow so fast and become so  important in our economy?   Again, the idea of net neutrality is really simple. It is that  everybody has a fair chance at a fair speed at a fair price and that  the owners of the pipes can't discriminate between certain businesses  and those that can pay more and those that are bigger or those that are  affiliated with the owners of the pipes. It is all about the small  businesses of this country.   This is a real opportunity for us to do something important for the  small businesses of America, and I believe this resolution is one that  will restore us to a place where small businesses will be able to  compete and blossom and prosper in the future of this country.   I urge support of the CRA that I understand will come to a vote in  about a week. I believe this is absolutely essential to the development  of the internet-based economy, in rural areas particularly. To go back  to 1886, this body stepped up at that time, controlled the dangerous  monopolies of the railroads, established the principle of  nondiscrimination and common carry, and that is all we are talking  about today.   Mark Twain was right: History doesn't always repeat itself, but it  usually rhymes.
