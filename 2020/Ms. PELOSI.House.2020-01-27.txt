 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership in bringing this important bipartisan legislation to the  floor. I thank Congresswoman Maloney for her relentless advocacy in  this regard.   Madam Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues on this International  Holocaust Remembrance Day in support of the Never Again Education Act,  strong, bipartisan legislation to ensure that ``never again'' are  simply not words but a solemn, sacred pledge to be fulfilled with  action.   Madam Speaker, I salute Carolyn Maloney, a longstanding leader in  this effort to educate the next generation about the Holocaust. I also  thank Chairman  Bobby Scott for his leadership in this regard and for  his cooperation in bringing this to the floor.                                time  1700    I thank all of our Members who have worked on this overwhelmingly  bipartisan effort reflecting the strong bipartisan commitment of this  entire Congress to standing with the Jewish community and allies to  ensure Holocaust education remains front and center in our schools.   Last week, I had the great and solemn honor of leading a bipartisan  congressional delegation to Poland and Israel to mark the 75th  anniversary since the liberation of Auschwitz. I see two of our  colleagues who were on the trip, Mr. Deutch and Mr. Schneider, who  brought so much to that delegation. Both of them serve on the board of  the Holocaust Memorial Museum.   At Auschwitz, we walked on grounds scarred by an almost unspeakable  evil, where more than 1 million innocents were murdered. I was  especially affected because--as my colleagues have heard me say--of  what my father said on the House floor on March 2, 1943.   Madam Speaker, I am quoting from the Congressional Record.   On that day, my father said: ``Action not pity can save millions  now--extinction or hope for the remnants of European Jewry?--it is for  us to give the answer.'' He was pleading for Soviet Jews in the midst  of the Holocaust.   He said: ``Daily, hourly, the greatest crime of all time is being  committed. A defenseless and innocent people is being slaughtered in a  wholesale massacre of millions. What is more tragic--they are dying for  no reason or purpose.''   He went on to say: ``It is a satanic program beyond the grasp of the  decent human mind. Yet, it is being carried out. Already 2 million of  the Jews in German-occupied Europe have been murdered. The evidence is  in the files of our own State Department.''   He went on to say, toward the end of his remarks--by the way, my  father is Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., a Member of Congress from Baltimore,  Maryland, a strong advocate for calling to public attention the plight  of Jews in Europe, as well as advocating for the State of Israel to be  established in Palestine earlier on than our country had gone forth.   He did say, though, that: ``We will spare no efforts and have no rest  until the American public will be fully informed of the facts and  aroused to its responsibilities.''   He then said: ``We believe in the overwhelming power of public  opinion as the greatest, if not the only, power in democracy.''   He went on to say: ``If people knew, then something would be  different.''   Madam Speaker, I ask that my father's full statement be included in  the Record because this is what he said on the floor of the House all  those many years ago.    [Rep. Thomas D'Alesandro: Speech in Congressional Record on Israel,                          Tuesday, March 2, 1943]                       Establishment of a Jewish Army         Hon. Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. of Maryland in the House of       Representatives        Mr. D'Alesandro: Mr. Speaker, on February 8, 1943, there       appeared a full-page advertisement in the New York Times,       placed by the Committee for a Jewish Army of Stateless and       Palestinian Jews, of which I have the privilege of being a       member. This ad calls for action, not pity, toward stopping       the wholesale slaughter of the Jewish people in Europe. I am       in total agreement with my fellow members of the committee       that too much has been said and too little done.        Under leave to extend my remarks in the Record, I include       the text of the advertisement so that it may become part of       the permanent record:        Action, not pity, can save millions now--extinction or hope       for the remnants of European Jewry?--it is for us to give the       answer.        Daily, hourly, the greatest crime of all time is being       committed. A defenseless and innocent people is being       slaughtered in a wholesale massacre of millions. What is more       tragic--they are dying for no reason or purpose.        The Jewish people in Europe is not just another victim in       the array of other peoples that fell prey to Hitler's       aggression. The Jews have been singled out not to be       conquered, but to be exterminated. To them Hitler has       promised--and is bringing--death.        It is a satanic program beyond the grasp of the decent       human mind. Yet it is being carried out. Already 2,000,000 of       the Jews in German-occupied Europe have been murdered. The       evidence is in the files of our own State Department.        The Germans dared to undertake this process of annihilation       because they know that the Jews are defenseless; that the       Jews are forgotten and deserted even by the democratic       powers.        The Germans believe that the United Nations, indoctrinated       by 20 years of anti-Jewish propaganda are to a great extent       apathetic and indifferent to the sufferings of the Jews. They       believe that for crimes committed against the Jews no       retaliation on behalf of the governments or armed forces of       the United Nations will be carried out. They know that there       is no instrument of power and force on this earth with which       the Jews can fight back to avenge their dead and save the       remaining millions.        Of what avail are the statements of sympathy and pity and       promises of punishment after the war. Since the perpetrators       of these slaughters are to be punished for the murders they       have already committed then they can kill no more by further       murder.        Such mere statements of sympathy and pity are to the       Germans proof that their judgement of democracy's attitude       toward the Jews is justified and in their criminal minds they       understand them as ``carte blanche'' to go on with the       slaughter.        What can be done?        What is necessary is to impress the Germans that the       governments of the United Nations have decided to change       their present policy of passive sympathy and pity to one of       stern and immediate action; that they consider the cessation       of atrocities against the Jews are an immediate aim of their       military and political operations. Under this premise       vigorous United Nations' intervention to save European Jewry       would become a matter of course. Exactly as it would be if it       were American or British civilians who were being killed in a       systematic campaign by the Nazis, the whole of the forces of       these great democracies would be utilized to find an       immediate and effective solution.        The inauguration of such a new policy on behalf of the       United Nations would logically result in enabling all those       Jews who have managed to escape the European-German hell to       fight back. The first dictate therefore, would be the       immediate approval of the demand for a Jewish army of the       stateless and Palestinian Jews--an army 200,000 strong.        Suicide squads of the Jewish army would engage in desperate       commando raids deep into the heart of Germany. Jewish pilots       would bomb German cities in reprisal.        A Jewish army would imply a call to arms of all stateless       Jews living in North Africa so that they may participate in       the imminent invasion of the European continent.        A Jewish army would immediately give a decisive moral       relief to the agonized Jews of  [[Page H544]]       Europe. Their psychology of despair and helplessness would be       transformed into one of hope for revenge and survival. A       Jewish army will give a meaning to their sufferings--to their       death.        They will then realize that they cease being helpless       victims and become partners in the global struggle for a       better world, in which their survivors will live in freedom       and equality as all other human beings.        The Jews of Palestine and the stateless Jews want to fight       as Jews. They want to prove to Hitler and to the world that       the Jews can be more than ``the persecuted people''--that       Jews can die in other ways than through murder. They want the       right to fight for the world's freedom, under their own       banner.        To die, if needs be, but to die fighting.        Of course, these are not all the practical proposals which       the human mind is capable of conceiving. It is unfair to ask       for a single solution to such a disastrous problem. What we       must realize is that it is our duty not to resign ourselves       to the idea that our brains are powerless to find any       solution; not to resign ourselves to the idea that the forces       of democracy are too weak to enforce such a solution.        Remember when a few thousand British soldiers were put in       chains by the Germans? How swift the retaliation? And how       practical.        The Germans chained no more British soldiers.        Remember when a tiny town in Czechoslovakia was horribly       ``punished''? How swift the hurricane of world indignation       that answered.        There have been no more Lidices.        Remember when small and encircled Sweden opposed vigorously       and stubbornly the expulsion of Norwegian Jews. The Germans       abandoned their plans.        The Jews of Norway are still there.        The American sense of justice and decency and American       ingenuity must also find ways to overpower the diabolical       plan to exterminate the Jewish people. It must find a way       now, before millions more perish.        It is, therefore, our primordial demand that an       intergovernmental commission of military experts be appointed       with the task of elaborating ways and means to stop the       wholesale slaughter of the Jews in Europe. This must be done       now, before the greatest homicidal maniac extends his policy       of extermination to other peoples; before he dares       introducing poison gas and bacteriological warfare.        Remember that for years the Germans rehearsed on the Jews       what they later practiced on other peoples. Therefore, we       have decided to launch an all-out campaign to save European       Jewry. We will spare no efforts and have no rest until the       American public will be fully informed of the facts and       aroused to its responsibilities.        We believe in the overwhelming power of public opinion as       the greatest, if not the only, power in democracy.       Governments in democratic countries like the United States       and Great Britain can act only when they feel sure that they       are backed by a powerful movement of public opinion. We plead       with everyone to help and to cooperate in this sacred       campaign we have launched. Join in this fight, write to your       Congressmen, contribute to our work, so that this message may       be carried to every city and hamlet in the United States as       is being done in Great Britain. You are part of the       collective conscience of America; this conscience has never       been found wanting.     Madam Speaker, after Auschwitz, our delegation then  traveled to Yad Vashem where we mourned the loss of--believe this--1.5  million little children, killed in this most evil of atrocities.   Before we left Washington, in Krakow, Poland, and throughout the time  in Israel, we were blessed to meet with and hear the testimony of  survivors. Their message to us was this: ``Never forget.''   As Elie Wiesel, one of the most important voices of conscience that  has ever lived said: ``If we forget, the dead will be killed a second  time. If forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices. The rejection of  memory . . . would doom us to repeat past disasters, past wars.''   ``Remembering the Holocaust, Fighting Anti-Semitism,'' that was the  theme of the Yad Vashem observance. It is the charge that we carry with  us.   We must always remember the horrors of the Holocaust, particularly  now as the forces of evil that led to the Shoah, are reawakening, and,  therefore, we must not only remember the Holocaust, but fight anti- Semitism.   Today, around the world, an epidemic of anti-Semitism and bigotry is  spreading with appalling hate crimes being perpetrated everywhere from  supermarkets to synagogues. Disturbingly, we have seen a surge of anti- Semitic attacks here in America.   230 years ago, President George Washington, under whose gaze we stand  today, our patriarch, wrote to the Jewish community that our Nation  would ``give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution, no assistance.''   Yet, from New York, to California, to Pittsburgh innocents are being  attacked and lives are being brutally threatened, and too often,  bigotry and persecution have been allowed to fester. More needs to be  done.   Last spring, the House proudly passed H. Res. 183, which condemns  anti-Semitism ``. . . as hateful expressions of intolerance that are  contradictory to the values that define the people of the United  States.'' And soon after, we passed legislation to secure Jewish places  of worship, which is now law.   Today, with this legislation, the House is taking another step to  fulfill our pledge of: ``Never again'' thanks to all of our Members.   This legislation authorizes funding for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial  Museum to support and strengthen their efforts to develop accurate,  relevant, and accessible resources; to promote understanding about the  Shoah, and the dangers of intolerance in our time.   We must educate the world about the dangers of what can happen when  hate goes unchallenged, and when oppression is met with indifference.   Some of us were there the day the Holocaust Memorial Museum was  dedicated. Elie Wiesel spoke so powerfully that rainy day, and years  later, I was honored to return to the museum to speak at Elie's  memorial service.   Inside the Holocaust Memorial Museum in the Hall of Remembrance  before the eternal flame, the words of Deuteronomy are inscribed in  stone. It says: ``Only guard yourself and guard your soul carefully,  lest you forget the things your eyes saw, and lest these things depart  your heart all the days of your life, and you shall make them known to  your children, and your children's children.''   With this legislation, we pledge to keep alive the memory of the  Shoah so that we can fulfill the promise: ``Never again.''   I anticipate an overwhelming, unanimous vote in support of this  bipartisan legislation, and I thank my colleagues for their leadership  on both sides of the aisle for making that victory possible.
