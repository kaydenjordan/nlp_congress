 Mr. President, I have listened to some of the remarks  [[Page S158]]  from my colleague from Maine. I appreciate so much of what he has said,  the reminder to us all to be acting in good faith here.   I would like to just take a few moments this morning to say: Count me  in. Count me in to be operating in good faith. Count me in as one of  the many in this body and the many around this country who want to  ensure that we have strong borders in this Nation, that we have true  and meaningful border security, whether it is at our southern border or  whether it is at our northern borders, whether it is our borders on  land or whether it is our borders on sea.   Count me in as one who is prepared to deal with the difficulties, the  true humanitarian issues that we are seeing on the southern border  today with an influx of children and families, those who are seeking  asylum, those who are frustrated with our system. Count me in as one of  those who want to address these issues. But also count me in as one who  says that shutting down the government is not governing. Nobody is  winning in this.   I have been reading all the accounts that are out there in terms of  whether people think this is on the President, whether this is on the  Democrats, whether this is on the House. Do you know who it is on? It  is on the backs of all of us, of the men and women who are the Federal  workers, who work hard, who get up every day and do the jobs we have  tasked them to do, some of whom are furloughed, some of whom are  working without pay, but all of whom are worried about where we are.   We are now in the longest shutdown we have seen. I think it is either  today or tomorrow that we will pass that benchmark. It is not just  Federal workers who are being impacted; it is those of us who rely on  the services of those who work in our Agencies.   I come from a State, as does my colleague from Maine, where fisheries  are a significant issue for us. NOAA and some of these other Agencies  have a great deal to do with the economic health and well-being of our  State right now. This is our big crabbing season. This is the time of  year where there are a lot of folks out there on the water who need to  be able to provide for their families--their livelihood. You think it  is all about looking for the crab at the bottom of the Bering Sea.  Well, in order to do that, you not only have to have certain permits,  you have to have the ability to unload your load at the dock with  certified scales.   Not necessarily in the crab fisheries, but in other fisheries, you  have to have observers on your boats. One of the things we are learning  is that the observers need to be checked out after their trip. They  have to be checked out before they can move to another vessel. You have  kind of a ripple effect that is going on out there. So if you are a cod  fisherman or a crab fisherman and you are thinking: The government  shutdown doesn't mean anything to me--it doesn't until it does. Our  reality is that there is impact, and I understand that it impacts us in  many different ways.   Every morning, I check in with the folks who are answering my phones  here in Washington, DC, along with staff back in Alaska, and I ask,  what are we hearing from folks back home?   I will tell you, I have a lot of people saying: Lisa, you have to  stand with the President. You have to stand strong on this because we  need to have border security.   Then I have an equal number who are saying: Please, please do  something to help reopen this government. We expect it of you. We need  it from you. We are begging you to make things work. Fix it back there.   I think about where we are right here and right now. There have been  some suggestions out there that we don't know how long this is going to  take, but we just have to hunker down, and you are just going to have  to figure out how you can make ends meet.   We have some great credit unions in the State of Alaska that have put  out notices that say: If you are concerned about how you are going to  make that mortgage, make that car payment, pay your landlord, come to  us and talk to us. I so appreciate that, but I also know that many  times, that is limited in its application.   This suggestion that I have heard by some that, well, you can just go  out there and get a second job--I come from a State where we have the  highest unemployment rate in the country right now, or maybe we are now  second from the bottom, but there are communities where there aren't a  lot of options.   Our Coast Guard base in Kodiak is the pride and joy of the Coast  Guard. We have a lot of coasties who serve us in Alaska--about 2,500,  and that is significant for us. But in the community of Kodiak, if a  military spouse or a Coast Guard spouse says ``I have to find a job  because my husband isn't getting paid, and we are not quite sure when  it is going to come,'' in Kodiak, it is pretty tough to find a  temporary job.   One of the things we have learned is that, you have a situation, OK-- the Coast Guard is required to show up, and we so appreciate that. We  so appreciate the work of the Coast Guard. They are out there in the  Bering Sea right now. They are helping those who are dealing with some  pretty extreme conditions. Every day, they put their lives on the line  for us. So the fact that they are not protected at this point in time  causes me great concern and anxiety and stress, as it does them as  well. But think about it. You have a situation where non-exempt  employees are those who are providing childcare at the childcare  center. So you are still going to work and not getting paid, but now  your childcare center is not open.   Think about these real-life applications, and then think about the  very easy answer: Well, go out and find something to tide you through.  So I asked my team back here--I said: Wait a minute, you could go out  and you could drive Uber. Well, if you are a Federal employee, you can  have secondary employment, but in order to ensure that there is no  conflict with your Federal job, you have to get permission to do so. So  if you are in the middle of a shutdown and if your Department is shut  down, where do you go to get permission to get that secondary job?  Where do you go to ask for permission and say: I want to drive Uber for  the next however many weeks until the government opens. There is nobody  there to give the approval.    It seems like this, where we can say back here in the Halls of  Congress: Just hang tough. Just be strong. Just talk to your landlord.  We are all going to get through this together.   We want border security. I want border security. I think the  President's request for a comprehensive view of how we address this is  not something that is so unreasonable. Let's figure that out. Let's  walk through it.   I was part of a group this week who was suggesting, let's take the  proposal that the Acting OMB Director sent to the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, and let's treat that as a request for  supplemental appropriations. Let's have that hearing. But in order to  do this, we have to get our colleagues on the other side to sit down  and go through this process with us. So maybe we can get a short-term  reprieve. Let's do a short-term CR to allow us to process this. But  let's not keep the government shut down while we do this. We can figure  out these things.   Everyone is talking about leverage--it is all political leverage.  Well, tell that to the people who are really worried right now.   We had a pretty tough earthquake on November 30 that a lot of folks  are still digging out of. They are writing checks to contractors  because they need to make sure they are going to have a boiler to get  through a cold winter or make sure the foundation in the home they want  to get back into--that they are going to get back into it sooner than  later. But what do you do if you are not sure if that paycheck, which  was supposed to come today, is coming today or coming 2 weeks from now,  and you have written the check to the contractor? There is a lot of  anxiety out there.   I hear from a lot of these folks who are dealing with unexpected  household expenditures after that earthquake. I shouldn't say it is  just after that earthquake; we just had another one yesterday, 4.7.  This is the fourth earthquake we have had since the first of this year,  January 1, that has exceeded 4.0. So we had the big one, and then we  have had thousands afterwards. So we are still dealing with a lot of  this stuff. When people hear that the requests for FEMA assistance or  for small business assistance may be delayed because the government is  not open--think about  [[Page S159]]  how we are compounding their stress, their anxiety.   I have been part of groups who have talked to the Vice President,  have talked to his negotiating team. I myself have raised these issues  with the President. I want to be part of the solution, and I want to be  part of the solution sooner rather than later because we owe it to the  people of this country to function, and when the government is shut  down, partial or otherwise, we are not functioning.   Let's stop talking about who has leverage and who doesn't have  leverage and when that is going to tip to advantage the other side.  Let's do what we need to do when it comes to ensuring the security of  our Nation and our borders. Let's navigate those issues. But let's not  hold hostage good men and women who are working hard to keep us safe  every day through the basic functions of government.   I am one who has signed on I think to most of the bills that are out  there that would help alleviate some of what individuals and their  families are seeing, whether it is the Pay Our Coast Guard Act, the End  Government Shutdowns Act, the Pay Excepted Personnel Act. But those are  simply bandaids, and quite honestly, they are probably nothing more  than messages right now.   What I am hearing from folks is, keep us secure, protect our borders,  deal with humanitarian issues, but allow our government to function. Go  to work, stop arguing about who is winning, and let's get the  government open.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the senior  Senator from Alaska be authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or joint  resolutions today through Monday, January 14.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  January 14; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that notwithstanding the  provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motion with respect to the motion  to proceed to S. 1 ripen at 5:30 p.m., Monday.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I asked that it stand adjourned under the previous  order following the remarks of our Democratic colleagues.    I thank my friend from Maine. I enjoy working with the  Senator as well.
