 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate  the anniversary of a west Texas treasure. 100 years ago today, Governor  Pat Neff signed senate bill 103 that created what would become my proud  alma mater: Texas Tech University.   Today, Texas Tech's student population consists of 40,000 of the best  and brightest young men and women from around the country and the  world.   I love Texas Tech and everything it represents. Our first president  Paul Horn said it best: ``Everything that is done on these West Texas  Plains ought to be on a big scale. . . . Let our thoughts be big  thoughts and broad thoughts. Let our thinking be in worldwide terms.''   Texas Tech has embodied that vision. Its students and alumni have  lived up to that calling for an entire century. I am so proud to bear  our banner far and wide.   On behalf of Red Raider Nation, as we strive for honor ever more,  happy 100th birthday to Texas Tech. Wreck `em, get your guns up, and  God bless west Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, my  fellow Budget Committee member, for his passion to save this country  from a sovereign debt crisis and protect our Nation's next generation  from reaping the whirlwind of this reckless spending and unsustainable  debt path that we are on.   We must fight for the future of our country. All the things that are  talked about in this great Chamber, all the great ideas, and all the  threats that are posed to this country of ours and its future will all  be undermined and jeopardized because we will have failed to simply  steward the taxpayers' resources and our children's future.   I thank the gentleman for his leadership and his passion.             Celebrating the Life of General Bernhard Mittemeyer     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of a  true American hero and a very dear friend, General Bernhard Mittemeyer,  who passed away this January after 92 rich, full, extraordinary years.  He was a first-generation immigrant from South America who really lived  the American Dream.   After 28 years in the military, he rose to the rank of general. He  served as surgeon general of the Army under President Reagan, and he  received a number of awards and recognitions, including the  Distinguished Flying Cross, which is the highest peacetime award in the  military.   I worked with him at Texas Tech, where he was a physician. He was the  dean of the medical school, and he was the president of the Health  Sciences Center.   He had an indomitable spirit. He had an infectious optimism. All of  those things helped culminate in his leadership efforts to create the  super-clinic for treating and servicing our wounded warriors in west  Texas, in partnership  [[Page H2116]]  with Texas Tech. It has been a phenomenal asset for veterans in the  western part of Texas. That is going to be one of many, but, I am sure,  for him, it was the most special legacy that he left for the people of  west Texas.   Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to know him. I am a better man for  having come alongside him in my time at Texas Tech.   I also want to say of his wife, Marie Beth, that we love her and the  Mittemeyer family. We are praying for them. We know that the general  has gone to the great commander in chief in Heaven, and he is in a  great place. He is alive as he has ever been.   We will be with General Mittemeyer once again. I take great hope and  joy in that.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to the gentleman from Wisconsin for his  indulgence.
