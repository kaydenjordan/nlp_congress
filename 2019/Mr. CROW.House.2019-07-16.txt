 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  highlight the importance of honoring our commitments, to keep Americans  and those who serve our country around the world safe.   Unfortunately, by virtue of being Americans and representing the  values of our country, our citizens are sometimes targeted by  adversarial countries and wrongfully detained. In those situations, we  must leverage all available tools and resources at our disposal to  secure their safe return. We must employ a whole-of-government approach  to return Americans wrongfully detained in foreign countries back to  their families.                                time  2145    We are a nation founded on the principle of due process. We must hold  other countries to the same expectations of equal treatment under the  law.   We must also support the foreign nationals who put their lives and  the lives of their families at risk to contribute to our national  security. We owe these extraordinary individuals our gratitude for  their assistance, particularly in light of the dangers that they often  face. Despite precautions, in some cases, their contributions have led  to their detainment or imprisonment.   One of our greatest strengths is the network of individuals and  nations that want to help us because they can rely on us to keep our  promises. That is why we must continue to stand by our commitments to  our partners, particularly when they are persecuted for their  contributions to the U.S.   Simply stated, we must honor our commitments to those who have stood  by us.   This amendment asserts the importance of this position, not just  because it is in the best interests of the United States, but because  it is the right thing to do, and that moral responsibility is an  essential virtue of being an American.   Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Schiff).    Madam Chair, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support my  amendment and uphold our obligations to our fellow Americans and  partners around the world. We are a country that keeps its promises,  and we must do so well into the future.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
