 Mr. Speaker, this is National Police  Week, highlighted by Peace Officers Memorial Day, which President John  F. Kennedy designated, in 1962, as May 15.   Law enforcement officers and their families selflessly serve our  communities across the country. Americans appreciate honoring officers,  their families, and fallen heroes on Peace Officers Memorial Day.   Law enforcement personnel are national heroes. We are grateful for  their sacrifices made to serve and protect our country on a daily  basis.   We also provide our deepest support and gratitude to those who have  been injured or lost their lives in the line of duty and to their  families. Grateful citizens across the country will take time to thank  a police officer this week.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
