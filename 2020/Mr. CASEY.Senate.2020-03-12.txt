 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms.  Eleanor Elkin, who passed away at the age of 103 on December 4, 2019.  Eleanor served as one of Pennsylvania's most distinguished disability  advocates. It is important that we remember a remarkable life dedicated  to the betterment of others. Eleanor transformed the love for her  family into a life of advocacy whose impact will be felt for decades to  come.   Eleanor's commitment to equality was evident long before her time as  one of Pennsylvanian's most prominent disability rights leaders. Born  in 1916 in Philadelphia, she graduated from Germantown High School in  1934 and married Philip Elkin in 1939. They raised two adopted  children, Margo and Richard. Richard was born with a disability, and  Eleanor came face to face with the discriminatory laws experienced by  those with disabilities. The State of Pennsylvania did not realize,  however, that it was about to confront a true fighter. Jim Wilson,  former president of the Arc of the United States, said it best when he  described Eleanor as ``a white glove, tenacious fighter who would not  accept `no' for an answer.'' That fighting spirit served Eleanor well  when the State put up roadblocks to adopting Richard simply because he  had a disability. When Richard was 2 years old, he was forcibly placed  in a State-run institution. Eleanor went to court to get Richard back  home. From that point on, she fought for his rights, beginning with a  fight for him to attend preschool. At a time when it was common to deny  children with disabilities access to education, Eleanor persuaded his  elementary school to create a classroom for him and other children with  disabilities.   The numerous obstacles faced by Richard convinced Eleanor to expand  her advocacy beyond her family. She was among a group of parents who  joined together and created The Arc of Philadelphia in 1948. She  founded a mothers' support group in Bucks County, which became The Arc  of Bucks County in the 1950's. She was integral to the development of  The Arc of Pennsylvania, and became the organization's president in the  1960's. She went on to become president of The Arc of the United States  in 1967 and 1968.   At a time when the norm was to force children with disabilities into  institutions, Eleanor was a leader in the fight to bring people with  disabilities into the community. She partnered with the Public Interest  Law Center of Philadelphia to expand the rights of people with  disabilities. She helped to win a significant victory in 1971 with the  ruling in PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which overturned a  Pennsylvania law that permitted schools to deny public education to  children with disabilities. This battle established the principles that  eventually led to the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in  1975, which is now referred to as the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act.   Eleanor also joined forces with the Public Interest Law Center in one  of the most consequential fights of her life, the closure of the  Pennhurst State School and Hospital. Pennhurst was an institution in  Pennsylvania for people with disabilities that was exposed in the  1960's as a center of abuse and neglect and which came to symbolize the  shameful belief that people with disabilities should be isolated and  hidden from view. Eleanor contributed her advocacy to the landmark 1974  case Halderman v. Pennhurst, which ruled that the constitutional rights  of the residents of Pennhurst were being violated. This was a stark  break from the common beliefs of the time which afforded people with  disabilities little respect and even fewer rights. The case helped fuel  the larger movement away from institutions and was an important step in  the eventual closure of Pennhurst in 1987.   On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania and our grateful Nation, we  extend our belated condolences to the family of Eleanor Elkin.  Throughout her life, she fought for the dignity and well-being of  people with disabilities. Whenever she saw injustice, she also saw an  opportunity to make the world a better place. Celia Feinstein, director  Emeritus of the Temple Institute on Disabilities, said that Eleanor was  once asked how she would like to be remembered, and Eleanor replied  simply that, ``I don't know that I need to be remembered as much as I  would want to know that what I've been doing [will] continue.'' I have  no doubt that thousands are ready to continue her work on behalf of  people with disabilities. Pennsylvania and all of America are better  places because of Eleanor's commitment and extraordinary efforts. We  may have lost Eleanor Elkin, but we will never lose the positive change  she brought to countless lives and the impact she had on disability  policy in our country.                            ____________________
