 Madam Speaker, serving in public office is and  should be a sacred responsibility, and that responsibility calls upon  us to condemn hate when we see it. If we let hate fester and spread,  then it will destroy us. That is why one in three women have been  attacked violently in this country and around the world.   But instead of apologizing today, Republicans chose to vilify  immigrants yet again which is an outrage when the victim is herself a  Latina.   Madam Speaker, do you remember the gunman who traveled to El Paso to  kill Mexicans after Republican politicians demonized them?   Scripture says: Love thy neighbor as thyself.   And we must also love this institution. It is the love for this  institution and the love for our fellow Members which is calling upon  us to pass this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, Monday was such an exciting day  for our country. President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment  and Jobs Act into law, and we came one step closer toward making the  necessary investments to help our communities thrive; to help them  thrive, not just survive.   And I want to point out that, although it is called the bipartisan  infrastructure act, we had very few Republicans in this House vote for  that bill. In my State, the Republican Congresswoman did not vote for  the infrastructure act; so she voted against the clean water. She voted  against the broadband. She voted against the infrastructure that we  need to keep our roads safe and our bridges strong enough so that kids  can cross them in their school buses to get to school.   But the Democrats delivered that bill, and the Democrats are going to  deliver the Build Back Better agenda.  [[Page H6357]]  And the reason why we need to pass the Build Back Better Act, it is  para la gente. It is for the people. It is for our communities.   Just a few weeks ago, my Progressive Caucus colleagues and I held a  Special Order hour dedicated to the many great things in the Build Back  Better Act. But, there is so much in there that is good that we are  back here tonight to continue to highlight the benefits for our  communities.   Madam Speaker, throughout the pandemic, New Mexicans lost their  livelihoods. They put savings toward just surviving. If it wouldn't  have been for the American Rescue Plan, they would have lost their  homes. The eviction moratorium helped them.   Housing--I want to talk a little bit about housing because that is  something I have worked on for many, many years in my district. We know  that housing instability and the shortage of affordable housing hurts  our working families.   Many saw their dreams of home ownership vanish with the pandemic and  the recession. But, with Build Back Better, we have an opportunity to  change that. We know that the biggest barrier to purchasing a home is  the lack of savings needed for a downpayment. People just don't have  $10,000 or $20,000 to put down on a downpayment.   And current benefits like mortgage deductions don't help low-income  families looking to buy a home. They don't help middle-class families,  because you need the money at the time you are buying the house, at  closing.   So, to successfully address the affordable housing shortage and the  growing racial gap that comes along with it, we need to make sure there  is access to home ownership, especially for communities like in New  Mexico, or Native American, Latino, African American, Black, Indigenous  communities, we need to make sure that we provide them with the  homeownership assistance when it is needed, which is at closing.   And you know what? Build Back Better does just that. It makes one of  the largest investments in housing downpayment assistance in history.   I am proud to have been one of those many in our caucus who advocated  for the $10 billion that is in Build Back Better to help first- generation homeowners purchase their home.   In my beautiful New Mexico, we are lucky to have an organization that  I have worked with for 20 years. It is called Homewise, an organization  that helps create successful homeowners so that families can improve  their long-term financial wealth. We have financial fitness classes. We  also help people with downpayment assistance. But we could use more of  that. We never have enough downpayment assistance.   But one of the people that we helped was Maria Luisa. Maria Luisa  first came to the United States from Mexico. She had a dream to own a  home of her own and to create that better life for herself. She found  that dream hard. She found herself living on the streets of Santa Fe,  but she turned her life around. She got her GED. She got her residency,  her green card. She took classes at the Santa Fe Community College in  community health, and she found Homewise, and she found her first home  with our help.   She says that being a homeowner lifts her spirits and gives her  confidence in her own future. She knows that she will be able to pass  along the savings that are incorporated into that home of her own to  her children.   Spirit and confidence in the future, that is what Democrats are  about. We are about opportunity. We are about creating that belief in  the future and making it possible for working families.   I am glad to be on the floor with my progressive colleagues to talk  about the many opportunities that Build Back Better has.   But I want to take a little moment right now and have us walk back a  year. Thanksgiving. Do we remember what Thanksgiving was like a year  ago?   In my household, we always have a sit-down dinner for about 24  people. You know, we believe in those extended tables. And everybody  comes. Somebody will make the turkey, somebody else will make the green  chili and the red chili, because you can't do without red chili and  green chili if you are from New Mexico. And everybody brings what they  made with such love to the table, and we sit around together and share  stories and share good food and laugh and tease.   Last year, did we do that? No. Last year, we had a Zoom Thanksgiving.  Last year, we were living in despair. We were living with our former  President, who made fun of COVID. We were living with politicians from  the other side of the aisle who called it a hoax. And we could not  gather. We could not celebrate.   What a difference a year makes. What a difference leadership makes.  Under President Biden and the American Rescue Plan, we have made it  possible for our families to gather together once again because we made  sure that they didn't get kicked out of their homes; that they had a  place to invite their family too with the money that we put into rental  assistance.   We made sure that they could get that vaccination; that they could  have those shots. And anybody who wants it in the United States can get  a shot, can be vaccinated, can get their booster, so that they protect  everybody in their community. And that is what we need to celebrate,  and that is what we need to respect because a year later, the American  Rescue Plan has done so much for our communities.                                time  1800    But, yes, it is true. As those on the other side of the aisle state,  we are seeing inflation. But gas prices, who controls gas prices? Oil  and gas companies do. Who protects oil and gas companies? Republicans  protect oil and gas companies.   They protect those corporations. They do not let us attack their  corporations or tax those corporations. So Democrats have to do it  themselves.   We need to remember that it is greedy corporations that are raising  the prices and profiting off of working families.   We need to remember that it is Grubhub that is increasing the price  of deliveries by 30 percent, and none of that is going back to the mom- and-pop restaurants. It is going to those corporations that don't want  to pay taxes.   But in the Build Back Better Act, we are going to make sure that  corporations pay their fair share so they can stop fueling the  inflation that the Republicans protect. They are fueling the inflation,  and Republicans are protecting those corporations. Let's call it like  it is.   But right now, I want to go back to all the amazing things that are  in the Build Back Better Act. I am going to call on our wonderful  Representative Watson Coleman, my colleague, who always stands ready to  tell the stories of what it means on the ground in our community, for  our people, from visions like Build Back Better.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman).    Madam Speaker, New Jersey is so lucky to have  Representative Watson Coleman because she knows what is needed on the  ground.   Yes, indeed, it is together, and that is what I like about our Caucus  and what we are doing. We are doing it together. We are not about  division. We are about unity.   That is what we represent, right? Because we know that community  working together, living together, and growing together is how we  succeed in life.   I want to raise another part of where Build Back Better is very  important. I am chair of the Indigenous Peoples Subcommittee. I am so  lucky to have the Jicarilla Apache Nation, the Navajo Nation, and 16  different Puebloan Tribes in my district. They tell me about their  needs. I have walked in their villages. I have sat at their feast days.   I know the pandemic hit them hardest of all. We saw the death and  despair in our Tribal communities. So what we did in Congress, what we  did in the Natural Resources Committee, was to make sure that their  voices were heard. We provided $14 billion in the American Rescue Plan  and another $12 billion for their communities.   We have been hearing lately about the incredible, sad stories that  come from the fact that there was a time in America's history when we  took children away from their Tribes, away from their culture, and we  put them in boarding schools, and many died. We were trying to erase  the savage Indian, and those were the words that were used. It didn't  work. The Tribes are alive and with us. We must respect that history.   I am proud that both the American Rescue Plan and the Build Back  Better Act have $200 million for Native American languages because it  is through language that you preserve a culture and that you preserve  an identity.   Add that together with the fact that we are going to have $470  million for Tribal climate resilience because we have moved Tribes from  their homelands and put them in places where they are at the greatest  risk from the climate crisis. We include money for drought relief  because they are at the greatest risk of thirst because of the droughts  that will be caused.   We have $2.3 billion for the Indian Health Service. This will help us  address the backlog. 1993 is when we started setting out the list of  Indian Health Service buildings that needed repair, and we still have a  1993 list that we have not met.   I am very proud of what we have done in Build Back Better to address  the needs of our Native Americans and our urban Native Americans in our  Tribes.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Pressley), my colleague in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a  gentlewoman but fierce and proud.    Madam Speaker, I think this reference to how  history will judge us is important because we are facing a historical  moment right now. The decisions we make on the floor of this House this  week will determine whether our future is one that is inclusive and  that includes every single family and community in this great Union of  the United States or whether it continues to leave people behind.   Right now, those who are being left behind include the vast majority  of Americans. What we are doing with this legislation is creating the  kind of opportunity, creating the kind of jobs so that everybody can  come forward and thrive.                                time  1815    We are focusing on women. This is a women's agenda. The Build Back  Better Act is a women's agenda because it is the women who had to drop  out of the workforce to care for their children because there wasn't  enough childcare available or it was too expensive.   In New Mexico, we just learned that almost 21 percent of the women in  New Mexico dropped out of the workforce because they could not afford  childcare.   Build Back Better addresses that. It is going to make sure that no  family pays more than 7 percent of their income on childcare. That is  the kind of agenda that every family wants, because they want to make  sure that their children are cared for and are either in a great  childcare center or are in that pre-K that is so essential so that they  can succeed later in life.   We know that the science has shown us that if you have quality pre-K  for your 3-year-olds, for your 4-year-olds, you are going to have a  successful life, you are going to earn more in income, you are going to  graduate from high school, you are going to earn additional degrees. It  is going to be better.   So we are taking the investments today and we will recoup the  benefits 12 years from now, 18 years from now. And that is believing in  our future. We are investing in what we believe in.   I also want to take a moment to address the fact that this bill is  fully paid for, so when anybody ever says that it is going to increase  our deficit, know ye that it is not true what they say because this  bill is fully paid for.   It is paid for by making sure that tax cheats don't get to cheat  anymore. We are going to invest in the IRS so that they can audit and  go after tax cheats. Who wants to defend tax cheats? Do you really want  to be defending tax cheats? I hope not because everybody should pay  their fair share.   We are going to make sure that nobody earning less than $400,000 a  year pays any more in taxes. Indeed, this is one of the biggest tax  cuts that we are doing for regular people. Not like the tax cut they  passed in 2017 which benefited only the wealthy and the corporations.  This tax cut is a benefit to our working families, to our middle-class  families.   The child tax credit is available to all now. Everybody who is  receiving that $300-per-child payment every month, that is going to  continue because of the American Rescue Plan and because of Build Back  Better. If anybody says it is going to add to the debt, know that they  are not speaking the truth.   The other thing that Build Back Better does is it has the biggest  impact on addressing and combating climate change in American history.  Anybody who has lived through this summer, through last winter, the  storms, the climate disasters knows that it is not a hoax, as some have  argued.   Climate deniers have been proven wrong because we all witness what is  happening with our climate. We all know that it will cost us billions  and trillions of dollars if we do not act.   In my beautiful New Mexico, if we do not act to combat the climate  crisis, we will become an extension of the Sonoran Desert. I love my  mountain streams. I love the snowfall that falls on our ski resorts and  in our mountains and trickles down to our rivers and provides us with  the water we need for our farms and our fields and to quench our  thirst.   I love that snow. If we do not address the climate crisis, we will  not see that snow in winters to come. We might not see it this winter.  So I am very pleased at the investments that we are making to combat  the climate crisis in the Build Back Better Act.   The infrastructure bill also included some key provisions. It  included provisions for my Orphaned Well Cleanup and Jobs Act to plug  orphaned wells and protect our communities from the dangerous methane  they spew into the air. We know that methane is many times, 35 times  more dangerous to our climate than carbon, and so it is important to  plug up those orphaned wells that oil and gas companies have abandoned.  Not all of them, but there are too many that have abandoned those  wells, and they are called orphaned. They are spewing methane into the  air right now.   I visited one with our Labor Secretary. It was right next door to a  school. The methane that leaks from that abandoned and dirty well is  breathed into the lungs of our students. The infrastructure bill will  help clean it up, but the Build Back Better bill will say we don't want  this to happen over and over again.   Build Back Better says: You can't walk away, oil and gas companies,  you can't walk away from those wells and leave the mess for the  taxpayers to clean up.   We asked the Interior Department to strengthen the bonding  requirements so that the bonds cover the cost of cleaning them up. We  also establish an idled-well fee so that oil and gas companies don't  have and don't let these wells just sit unattended. If you are not  going to be pumping from the well, close it down. Don't just let it  spew methane into the air.   I also helped secure $240 million for a Just Transition investment  fund to create new economic opportunities in our energy communities.  New Mexico relies on oil and gas for jobs and tax revenues. I am  acutely aware of the benefits that this industry has brought to our  State, but I am also acutely aware of the need to transition in a way  that honors our communities and our workers who have worked in this  industry, who have fueled our economy.   We now need a transition to renewable energy and to a clean energy  economy, but in that transition we cannot leave any worker behind. And  so Build Back Better includes money to invest in those communities so  we can see new businesses arise. It also includes money to invest in  the workers so that if they need to gain new skills that we are there  for them, that our community colleges are there for them, that our  apprenticeships are there for them.   But many of the skills that we need, like cleaning up the orphaned  wells, are the same skills that you would use in the industry itself.  So we are going to be creating good-paying jobs, and we are making sure  in the Build Back Better plan that those jobs are union, if they want  to be. We are making sure that we prioritize the jobs that pay well and  that treat their workers well.    We also are investing in a civilian climate corps. I am very proud to  have had my first job in the conservation corps, the Youth Conservation  Corps. It taught me that cleaning and protecting our environment is  hard work. I went out there with my boots and my shovel and my pickaxe,  and we helped create trails, and we helped clean up those trails. It  taught me about work ethic, but it also taught me about the importance  of caring for the land that we love.   The civilian climate corps will do the same, but it will grow it. I  have met with those who are engaged, like the Rocky Mountain Youth  Corps. I give a shout-out to the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps because  they are there managing our forests, working to protect our forests,  and earning their degrees, starting new businesses coming from that  experience in the climate corps, in the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps.   We are going to be investing in thousands and thousands of jobs for  young people who will be able to go on and secure education, if that is  what they  [[Page H6360]]  want, or start a business, if that is what they want, from the skills  that they will have learned from the climate corps.   We also are going to be strengthening domestic manufacturing and the  supply chains for critical goods because it is only when you address  the root cause of the problems, which is our supply chains that you  solve the problem.   We want to bring back manufacturing to this continent, to this  country. There are those who talk about it the same way they talked for  years about infrastructure week, but it doesn't help if all you do is  talk about it. What you need to do is deliver. In the infrastructure  plan, we are delivering to bring back the jobs that are needed to build  those bridges. We are building that infrastructure.   We are delivering because Democrats deliver. In Build Back Better, we  are going to be delivering the jobs of the future. We are going to be  delivering the investments in manufacturing. We are going to be  delivering the investments so our consumers can realize the benefits so  that they are paid more and can really have the respect that comes  along with a job that has the kind of benefits you need.   We are going to be delivering prescription drug price negotiation. We  are going to be delivering the lowering of healthcare costs because for  too long we have had those who would stand for Big Pharma instead of  for those who need insulin, those who need Humira, those who need the  kinds of drugs that make their life bearable, those who need the kinds  of drugs that allow them to survive.   What we are doing in Build Back Better is making sure that we can  negotiate to reduce those drug prices. That is something that we know  Americans want. And so when we do not get a single Republican vote for  lowering drug prices, remember that, that Republicans were unwilling to  vote to lower drug prices because that is what this bill does.   Remember that Republicans were unwilling to vote for infrastructure,  because that is what the infrastructure plan did.   I am asking, however, that we receive those votes, that we receive  bipartisan support for the kinds of investments that we are going to be  doing for our people.   I yield now to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), an  amazing colleague in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, an amazing  colleague from the Equality Caucus who has fought for the rights of all  Americans. He has fought for the Equality Act. He is one of the  drafters of the Equality Act.    Madam Speaker, I do love it when this President  always says we are going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up and  the middle out because that is exactly who he is focused on. He is  focused on giving us the opportunities, my constituents as well.   You know, there could not be two States that are more different than  Rhode Island and New Mexico, but these are the same things we hear in  New Mexico. We are addressing those in Build Back Better, and I can't  be more excited as a freshman to be able to be here on the floor of the  House and to vote for the American Rescue Plan because that really was  the first step.   The American Rescue Plan saved our economy. It saved families from  homelessness. It lowered hunger. It addressed the pandemic by giving us  the vaccine.   The second step was the infrastructure bill. We talked earlier about  how, last Thanksgiving, we were apart. This Thanksgiving, we are  together because of the American Rescue Plan.   But the infrastructure bill, that is about repairing our  infrastructure, which has been too long ignored.   Then this last one, Build Back Better, I am just overjoyed that I get  to serve in Congress in this historic moment to work on these things  that will be benefiting my grandchildren and their grandchildren. I  want to leave them with this beautiful place we call home intact.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
