 Mr. Speaker, as a Texan, I rise today to speak on the  expiration of title 42, but our immigration story neither begins nor  ends there.   As a child, I was taught songs like ``America the Beautiful,'' but  today I can honestly say that beauty must really be in the eye of the  beholder because the inhumanity that is playing out around migrants is  far from beautiful.   Congress needs to pass humane, substantive, and sustainable,  bipartisan immigration reform that provides for an orderly,  transparent, and efficient process for asylum seekers, clears out the  decades-long backlog, and keeps our communities safe.   For years, House and Senate Democrats have worked to pass immigration  reform with little to no support from our Republican colleagues.   I am left asking: Is this what America the beautiful looks like?   Republicans are constantly fanning the flames of hate instead of  offering help to a country that is craving more leadership and less  lies. Republicans have essentially decided that immigrants make for  great political pawns. The problem is, we aren't playing chess. This is  real life, with radical rhetoric that has real-world consequences and  getting people killed.   Just this weekend a man in Brownsville, Texas, used his truck to plow  through and kill eight people sitting at a bus stop. We have got to do  better. America really needs to be beautiful.   I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.   As a Texan, I rise today to speak on the expiration of Title 42. But  our immigration story neither begins nor ends there.

Republicans have essentially decided that immigrants make for  great political pawns. The problem is, we aren't playing chess, this is  real life, with radical rhetoric that has real-world consequences-- getting people killed.   Just this weekend a man in Brownsville TX used his truck to plow  through and kill 8 people sitting at a bus stop next to a shelter for  migrants. And four years ago, a man radicalized by republican rhetoric  walked into a Walmart in El Paso and murdered 23 people he believed  were invading the border as part of the so-called ``great  replacement''.   America, the beautiful? Not so much, but we can be. We used to be.  And so with that maybe we need a little history. This country  [[Page H2155]]  was founded by and is made up of immigrants. It is within the very  fabric of who we are to do what the greatest speaker for this house  always reminds us to do--recognize that our diversity is our strength  and our unity is our power.   So let's ask ourselves, is America's continued inhumane treatment of  immigrants beautiful? Does it live up to our values.   I yield back.                            ____________________
