 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, I was  grateful to attend the campaign kickoff for Donald Trump at the South  Carolina State House in Columbia with the former President, Governor  Henry McMaster, and Ambassador Ed McMullen.   My public service has been committed to promoting job creation with  the slogan of ``Joe Means Jobs.'' That is why I appreciate the success  of Governor McMaster last year recruiting over $10 billion in  investments. This enhances South Carolina as being first  [[Page H495]]  in the export of sales of both tires and passenger cars.   The triumphant policies of President Trump reducing taxes and  regulations created jobs. He created record unemployment lows for  African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and women. Donald means  jobs.   A political consequence of the Trump and McMaster success is the  super majority of Republicans in this South Carolina State House and  State Senate with the most Republicans in over 150 years. Until 1961,  there were no Republicans in the legislature in the 20th Century.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
