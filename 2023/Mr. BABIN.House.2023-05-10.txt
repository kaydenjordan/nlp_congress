 Mr. Speaker, I am up here in my capacity as not only a  United States Congressman, but also one of the co-chairs of the House  Border Security Caucus.   On a monthly basis, we have had dozens of speakers come to speak to  our Caucus. Normally, there are probably 30 who are present, but we  have an enrollment in our Caucus of about 60 to 70, quite frankly.   It is amazing to me to hear our colleagues and friends on the other  side of the aisle talk about humanity and humane treatment because I  remember in the previous administration, when we had these so-called  kids in cages.   I took a congressional delegation down to the Rio Grande Valley, we  went to Donna, Texas, to see one of the detention facilities. After  that, we went out to Carrizo Springs to the HHS facility there. Then we  went, at a later time, to Fort Bliss out in El Paso. At each one of  those, we saw these so-called kids in cages.   Then we went back after the change of administration and  dramatically, there was nothing really different, except the enormous  numbers of detainees in pods that were equipped to hold maybe 25 or 30,  and they had a couple hundred people packed in these little pods.   I remember being told by the facilities there that the  administration, the Biden administration, at the time that these  unaccompanied children were coming in--and we are talking about 13,000  per month of unaccompanied children coming in now--that they were being  so well cared for, and they were being reunited with their families and  their loved ones.   I remember asking the folks who were in charge of these facilities,  okay, if they are being taken care of, let me ask you a question  because I have 17 grandkids. Kids mean a lot to me. My wife and I have  been married 50 years. We have 5 children and now 17 grandkids. Kids  need to be cared for, without question.   I said, are you doing any vetting of these so-called families?   Are you doing background checks?   Are you doing criminal history checks on them?   Oh, well, we don't have the resources to do that.   Are you doing DNA testing?   Well, we don't have DNA. We don't have the resources to do DNA  testing, as well. Although during the Trump administration they were  doing some DNA testing.   So now we come to the point where there are 85,000 unaccounted for  children, UACs, under this administration's watch.   Where are these kids?   They are supposed to be followed up on by the authorities and the  administration where these children are being sent. There are 85,000  that are unaccounted for.   We have seen a skyrocketing of violations of child labor laws. We  know that there are some real shady deals going on in this country and  that human trafficking, sex slavery, et cetera, is rampant.                                time  2030    Is this part of that deal? I am not up here pointing fingers in an  accusatory way. But if you can't keep up with 85,000 UACs, we have got  some real problems in this administration.   We have also had conversations with Alejandro Mayorkas, who is the  DHS Secretary. I actually led that meeting. Of course, he is not under  oath talking to our caucus.    Mr. Speaker, we are being told that Mr. Mayorkas says that  he has operational control over the border. We are being told that his  policies are actually being successful. We are told that we have a  secure border.   Let me tell you something: We have anything but a secure border when  you have 5 million people who come across our border, all of them  getting a free education.   I am 300 miles away from the border. My district is Houston over to  Louisiana. We have a school district there that is growing faster than  just about any district in the country, and it is because of the influx  of illegal aliens. We are mandated to not only provide them with  healthcare but also with an education.   This is an enormous burden on our people, the local governments, and  the school districts that we have. This bill needs to be passed. I urge  my colleagues very strongly to vote ``yes'' on this.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Cammack), my good friend, for having this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, for years our men and women in blue have endured  relentless attacks by leftists who wish to see them defunded and  abolished completely, incredible as it may seem, a sentiment so out of  touch with reality that it is incomprehensible.   What rational person would abolish the very force, that thin blue  line that prevents mayhem and murder in our society?   This incessant demonization has pushed police officers all across  this great land to resign in record-breaking numbers. Why stay in a  role where you are hated, you are targeted, and without the resources  necessary to do your job? Especially when the past 3 years have proven  that the Democratic Party actually celebrates lawlessness.   Since actions have consequences, we are watching a tsunami of crime  wash over our entire Nation. Yes, the radical Democrats have sown the  wind, and now we are going to reap the whirlwind and are doing so now.  Between their defund the police agenda and soft-on-crime policies, the  left has created a system where criminals thrive and prosper instead of  law-abiding citizens.   Twenty-seven of the top thirty crime-ridden cities in the Nation are  run by the Democratic Party. The crime rate in Washington, D.C., alone  is up 24 percent.   America is a nation of laws, not anarchy. We need our police officers  who run toward the danger and the chaos. They put their lives on the  line daily and deserve our full support and utmost respect and  admiration.   Today and every day, we must thank law enforcement for the courageous  work that they do to keep us and our families safe. We must always back  the blue.
