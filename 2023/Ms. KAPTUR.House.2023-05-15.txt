 Madam Speaker, last week we celebrated both National  Nurses Week and Mother's Day. Today, I rise to highlight a Great Lake  story of perseverance that ties them both together.   Shalisa and Mishay Davis, mother and daughter, are from Detroit,  Michigan. This spring they graduated together on the same day in  Toledo, Ohio, both with nursing degrees.   When a mother watches their daughter or son graduate from college, it  is a larger-than-life moment, but to do it together is something  unforgettable. You don't often get to follow so closely in your  mother's footsteps.   Mishay passed her boards and plans to continue schooling and hopes to  become a family practitioner. Shalisa wants to open her own clinic to  help communities with limited access to healthcare. Bravo.   Congratulations to mother and daughter on their proud  accomplishments. Bravo for embarking on a noble  [[Page H2332]]  journey to help strengthen healthcare in our region.   May all nurses in Ohio's Ninth District and beyond prevail in their  dedication to care for and heal the people of our Nation.                            ____________________
