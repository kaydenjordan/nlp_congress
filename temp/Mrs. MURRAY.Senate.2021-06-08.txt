 Madam President, construction is hard, dangerous work,  and too often, when it comes to wages for workers, we see a race to the  bottom, where workers and communities lose.   Prevailing wage requirements, such as we have in this bill, help make  sure that construction jobs created by the Federal Government come with  a fair wage that supports our local community.   Prevailing wage requirements have long had bipartisan support,  including in this bill. This amendment would strip those protections  for construction workers at the same time we need to help rebuild our  country's infrastructure.   The workers and the communities that build our bridges and our  highways and other critical infrastructure deserve the protections and  benefits prevailing wage provides.   I urge my colleagues to oppose amendment No. 1858.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1858     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I and  Senator  [[Page S3980]]  Schumer be permitted to complete our remarks prior to the next vote.    Mr. President, you know, it has been more than half a  century since the Equal Pay Act became law, and 12 years since  President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, but women in  the United States still, on average, earn only 82 cents on the dollar  compared to their male counterparts, and the wage gap is far greater  for women of color because, even though the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly  Ledbetter Act were critical steps forward, there is clearly a lot more  we have got to do.   Right now, an employer can brush aside reports of pay discrimination  by saying things like, ``Well, he was a better negotiator'' or ``They  work in different buildings.'' I mean, what does that have to do with  it?   And too often, a woman's history of being paid less means she gets  paid less in the future because her past salary can be used to  determine her future salary, regardless of what her counterparts are  making or her new responsibilities, and that has real consequences for  women and their families.   Today, 4 out of 10 mothers with children under the age of 18 are  their family's primary or sole breadwinners. As families rely more on  women's wages to make ends meet, the gender pay gap has an even greater  impact on children.   For example, over the course of just 1 year, the wage gap for Latino  women averages almost $30,000 less compared to what a White man earns.  We are talking about women losing out on hundreds of thousands of  dollars over the course of their working lives, and that is money that  could go to pay the bills, put food on the table, buy a house, start a  business, save for retirement, get an education, and so much more.   Instead, women struggle with lifelong financial effects, including  higher poverty rates as compared to men. Women are being shortchanged,  plain and simple.   And this pandemic, by the way, has made things worse. Millions of  women now, as we know, have left the labor force, and many have fallen  behind just as caregiving responsibilities have disproportionately  fallen on them.   According to one study, a woman who was earning about $47,000 a year  before the pandemic, could lose nearly a quarter of a million dollars  over her lifetime, assuming she is able to return to work this year.   The pandemic has set women--and in particular, women of color--back  even further and made clear just how urgent it is for us to act  because, you know what, if women don't recover from this crisis, our  economy will not either, which is why we desperately need to close the  wage gap.   We have got a responsibility to finally make sure women are paid  fairly for their work so women can build financial security for  themselves, for their families, for their communities, and so our  economy--so much of which is driven by women, by the way--can fully  recover from this crisis.   We have been fighting for the Paycheck Fairness Act for quite some  time, but for those who need a reminder, here is what it would do  simply, very straightforward: It will close the loopholes that allow  pay discrimination to continue and protect workers from retaliation for  discussing their pay; it will limit the use of prior wage history in  the hiring process so pay discrimination cannot follow workers from job  to job; and it will increase transparency and accountability so workers  know whether they are being treated fairly and so they have the  evidence to hold their employers accountable if they are not.   These are commonsense steps, and that is why this bill already passed  the House with bipartisan support, and it is up to the Senate now to  get this done because the reality is each and every Senator represents  a State where half of the population earns less than they deserve, and  that is ridiculous.   It is past time we end this injustice. I urge my colleagues to join  me in voting to finally put money women have earned fair and square in  their pockets where it belongs and take an essential step toward  ensuring our economy can build back stronger and fairer from COVID-19.   There is absolutely nothing controversial about making sure every  worker gets paid fairly for their work. Women have been waiting long  enough. They need the Paycheck Fairness Act now more than ever. Let's  get this done
