 Madam Speaker, I was unable to vote on December 3,  and 4, 2020, due to not being in town. Had I been present, I would have  voted as follows: ``no'' on rollcall No. 230; ``no'' on rollcall No.  231; ``no'' on rollcall No. 232; ``no'' on rollcall No. 233; ``yes'' on  rollcall No. 234; and ``no'' on rollcall No. 235.
