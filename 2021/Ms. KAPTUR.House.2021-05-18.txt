 Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the  achievement and advancement of a longtime member of our Ninth  Congressional District team, Theresa Morris of Toledo, Ohio.   Theresa is an intelligent, compassionate daughter born into a  working-class family in Toledo. She is a true public servant. Theresa  has served as a congressional aide in our office for 27 tireless and  honorable years.   She has advanced her capacities across a wide spectrum of duties,  such as outreaching to small businesses, coordinating the district's  efforts on the Congressional Art Competition, serving as a grants and  funding coordinator, and being a dependable project assistant.   She developed firsthand experience on a far-ranging set of issues  relating to immigration, the State Department, and Homeland Security.  Her service has been invaluable to thousands upon thousands of our  citizenry.   Theresa knows and loves our Toledo community as fiercely and as well  as anyone. That is why I am thrilled that she was recently appointed to  serve on the City Council of Toledo, Ohio, taking her first step into  elected office. I could not be more proud of her, her family, and all  those who treasure Theresa as a coworker, a friend, and a confidante.   Theresa is a graduate of Start High School in Toledo; Alma College in  Michigan; and Lourdes University in Sylvania, Ohio, where she earned  her bachelor of arts and master of organizational leadership degrees,  respectively.   Theresa has served on the boards of the YWCA of Greater Toledo, the  City of Toledo Youth Commission, Team Recovery, WGTE Public Media, and  the Arts Council of Lake Erie West.   Theresa received the 2018 Distinguished Hispanic Ohioan Award. She  has a certificate in Minority Executive Leadership, and is a graduate  of the Toledo Citizens Police Academy.   Her interests are wide-ranging and unending. Some have observed she  may be the longest-serving Hispanic congressional staff member in  United States history. Mark that one down for the record.   Madam Speaker, Theresa is made of good humor, tenacity, and grit. She  always has a smile. While we are sad to see her go, I can tell you with  absolute certainty that no one is better prepared to fight for the  working people of Toledo than Theresa.   Along with the entire staff, I wish her fair winds and following seas  as she takes her career in public service to new heights on the ``Good  Ship Toledo.'' I look forward to working closely with Toledo  Councilwoman Morris as she ably steers her craft full steam ahead.   Onward, Councilwoman Theresa Morris. God bless you.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
