 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Korean American  Day, January 13.   I proudly represent Los Angeles and its Koreatown. It is the largest  Korean population of any congressional district in the country.   My legislation, H. Res. 38, supporting the goals and ideals of Korean  American Day, gives us an opportunity to appreciate the countless  contributions Korean Americans have made to this country.   On this occasion, we pay tribute to the influence Korean Americans  have had on all facets of American life, from the private and public  sectors to the world of art, food, education, and entrepreneurship.   Mr. Speaker, 117 years after the first Korean immigrants came to the  United States, the story of the Korean American community is one of  honor, inspiration, and resolve. Like other immigrant communities  across the country, they have thrived through their strong work ethic,  family bonds, and unbreakable spirit. I would like to thank them for  entrusting me with the honor of representing them in Congress.   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 38, commemorating Korean  American Day.                            ____________________
