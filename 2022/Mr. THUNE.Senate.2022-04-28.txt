 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, from the beginning, the Biden  administration has displayed a hostility to fossil fuels.   President Biden set the tone on day 1 of his administration when he  canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline, an environmentally responsible  pipeline project that was already underway and that was to be paired  with $1.7 billion in private investment in renewable energy to fully  offset its operating emissions. He almost immediately froze new oil and  gas leases on Federal lands and is only now making new onshore leases  available for sale after being ordered to do so by a Federal judge. His  first budget contained a series of tax hikes on conventional energy  production, and his budget this year, released in the midst of an  energy crisis, calls for hiking taxes on fossil fuel companies to the  tune of tens of billions of dollars. And the list goes on.   Perhaps even more troubling, however, is the more insidious campaign  the President has been conducting against conventional energy  production, using the long arm of financial regulation and government  pressure to directly or indirectly discourage investment in fossil  fuels and other industries disliked by his political base.   The Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued a completely  unworkable proposed rule requiring publicly traded companies to  disclose information not only about their own greenhouse gas emissions  but about those of their suppliers and even their customers--clearly  attempting to make companies diminish or outright cut ties with  traditional energy. Never mind whether this expanded environmental,  social, and corporate governance--or ESG, as it is called--desired by  the far left can be accurately or consistently measured, much less  proved to have a positive impact on the economy or for the climate.   But the administration doesn't stop there. The Commodity Futures  Trading Commission established a so-called Climate Risk Unit that  potentially seems designed to pressure industries into making certain  investment choices. The Federal Reserve, which has zero business  inserting itself into debates over climate policy, is suggesting that  it should provide ``supervisory guidance'' to large banks on so-called  climate-related risks. Similarly, the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency recently issued draft principles for banks on ``climate- related financial risk.''   President Biden's climate envoy, former Secretary of State John  Kerry, has actively--actively--pressured banks not to invest in fossil  fuels. And disturbingly, the original draft of the National Credit  Union Administration's Draft Strategic Plan for 2022 to  [[Page S2200]]  2026, though it has since been revised, went beyond discouraging  investment in conventional energy production and actually suggested  that investing too heavily in agriculture--agriculture--could be  problematic for climate-related reasons. Now, I am not sure where the  National Credit Union Administration thinks our food is going to come  from if banks and credit unions don't provide capital to their farms  and ranch clients.   All of these measures, as I said, are designed to directly or  indirectly discourage investment in conventional energy production and  other industries that the far left believes interfere with its  unrealistic environmental agenda. And that is a problem. While I am a  longtime supporter of clean energy and come from a State that in 2020  derived 83 percent of its energy generation from renewables, the fact  of the matter is that our country is nowhere close to being able to  eliminate our reliance on fossil fuels. Clean energy technology has  simply not advanced to the point where we can replace all conventional  energy production with renewables.   And cutting off investment in clean, responsible oil and gas  production will do nothing but drive up energy prices for American  consumers and increase our reliance on energy from unstable or  unfriendly countries, which, I might add, often extract energy in far  less environmentally friendly ways than do U.S. producers.   Americans are already struggling with high energy prices, thanks, in  part, to the Biden administration's hostility to domestic oil and gas  production, and I don't think too many Americans are eager to see  energy prices rise even further. In the worst-case scenario, limiting  investment in U.S. conventional energy production could not only drive  up prices but contribute to fuel shortages here at home, as we may end  up seeing with countries that are overly reliant on Russian energy. And  I am pretty sure there aren't many Americans who are eager to wait in  line at gas stations for a rationed amount of gas.   And it is not just high energy prices that Americans could have to  worry about. If Democrats take their climate hysteria as far as  discouraging lending to certain sectors of the agricultural economy,  like livestock, which now seems possible, Americans could also see food  prices rise sharply. I think it is safe to say that it is the last  thing American families need in an economy that is already beset by 8.5  percent inflation, not to mention the fact that agriculture should  actually be regarded as a good investment when it comes to climate  change considerations. American agriculture should be leveraged as part  of environmental and conservation policies, and our farmers have a  vested interest in our land and water.   Add in the biofuels industry, and our agriculture sector can  responsibly provide food, fuel, and fiber for the Nation. In fact, the  Department of Energy has found that ethanol derived by increasingly  higher crop yields has a more than 40 percent lower lifecycle carbon  footprint than gasoline.   Beyond all this, Mr. President, is the fact that the President's  attempt to dictate investment by privately owned banks and credit  unions and companies is a misuse of the financial regulatory system.  The President's use of the financial regulatory system to pressure  companies on energy investment has all too familiar echoes of the Obama  administration's Operation Choke Point initiative, which used the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Department of Justice to  target companies whose activities the Obama administration didn't like.   The question also becomes, Where does this end? The government is  already pressuring companies on firearms and energy investment, and now  there are dangerous signs that agriculture could be targeted on  perceived climate-related grounds.   Well, what is next? Is the Biden administration going to pressure  banks not to lend to companies who don't espouse the Biden  administration's extreme abortion agenda or who donate to causes the  Biden administration doesn't support? Is it going to pressure banks not  to lend to States with laws the administration doesn't like?   These are legitimate questions. As we have seen more than once, the  Biden administration doesn't have a lot of tolerance for those who  disagree with its far-left policy goals. Concerns like these are one  reason why I led 10 of my fellow Republicans earlier this month in  sending a letter to the President expressing our alarm with his  administration's use of the financial regulatory system to attempt to  choke off lending to conventional energy production and potentially  target American agriculture. And I will continue to work with my  colleagues to ensure that the Biden administration and its regulators  are not making improper use of executive power to discourage investment  in essential production and to pick winners and losers among American  industries.   Americans should not have to suffer because Democrats' climate agenda  is out of control.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

On April 29, 2022, Cornerstone will mark its  40th anniversary of feeding and sheltering people in crisis.   Cornerstone Rescue Mission is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,  and it provides nearly 200 beds to men, women, and children. This  organization's longevity is a testament to its hard work and dedication  to serving others in need. Cornerstone serves an average of 440 free  meals per day and has provided more than 180,000 people with a warm bed  over the past 5 years alone.   Not only do they provide food and shelter to those in their community  who live in poverty, but they also emphasize the importance of helping  people improve their situation for the long term. The mission will  assist people with obtaining legal identification, getting clothing for  interviews, transportation, spiritual guidance, and case management  services to help find employment and housing.   Cornerstone has changed the lives of countless South Dakotans,  including American veterans who have served our Nation and sacrificed  to preserve our freedoms, while showing them kindness and support when  they needed it the most. The men and women who work and volunteer at  the Cornerstone Rescue Mission are living a life of purpose and are  difference makers in their community.   I commend the staff and leadership of Cornerstone Rescue Mission for  40 years of service and wish them continued prosperity in the years to  come.                            ____________________
