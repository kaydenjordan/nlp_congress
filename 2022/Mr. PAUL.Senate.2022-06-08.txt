 Madam President, the Kentucky Chapter of the  National Association of Women Business Owners--NAWBO--provides dynamic  opportunities for women to network with other business owners, mentor  one another, develop partnerships, and incubate and foster that next  big idea. It is composed of women of all ages and levels of experience  from all sectors of the marketplace.   This year, as NAWBO Kentucky continues to celebrate three decades of  success stories that are as diverse as our Commonwealth, its members  have established a series of awards to recognize women business owners  who have excelled. These include the Woman Business Owner of the Year,  the Next-Gen Women Business Owner of the Year, the Public Policy  Catalyst of the Year, NAWBO Corporate Partner of the Year, and the  NAWBO Member of the Year.   Christine Smalley, owner of Fort Thomas Coffee, was named the Woman  Business Owner of the Year. FTC opened in March of 2019 and will expand  in June of 2022, to include a wine and cocktail bar and a business  center. Christine's husband Justin and their two children Kaelan and  Cadence have been embraced by their community as ``The Hot Chocolate  House,'' by serving hot chocolate instead of candy to their neighbors  on Halloween. To this day, trick-or-treaters will make plans weeks  ahead to visit the Smalley household and it delights the family to no  end.   Brooke Corder, owner of Squeaky Cleaners, was awarded as the Next-Gen  [[Page S2863]]  Women Business Owner of the Year. Brooke has developed what was once an  idea into a beautiful dream with her housekeeping, residential, and  commercial cleaning services business in Louisville that opened in  February of 2020.   Adriane Polyniak, owner of the Kentucky Cannabis Company, was awarded  the Public Policy Catalyst of the Year. Based in Midway, this family- owned business has been involved in multiple policy changes that have  been beneficial to women business owners. Some of these policies  include the legalization of hemp, Shawna's Law, and improved access to  cannabis research.   The NAWBO Corporate Partner of the Year was awarded to Wiser  Strategies, a public relations and communication firm in Lexington, KY.  President and APR Nancy Wiser has worked with NAWBO on many projects,  including the NAWBO website and media relations efforts that made the  EPIC event possible.   Vanessa Pennoyer, founder and owner of Go2Girl, LLC, was awarded the  NAWBO Member of the Year. Vanessa helps diverse-owned businesses seek  and obtain certification by navigating the time-consuming portal  process. Vanessa has also been involved with NAWBO for years and  stepped up this year to assist with all marketing efforts, as well as  assistant duties.   I am proud to salute the Kentucky Association of Women Business  Owners on its 30th anniversary and to honor these awardees.                            ____________________
