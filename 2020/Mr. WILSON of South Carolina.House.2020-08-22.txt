 Madam Speaker, this week's announcement  of a U.S.-promoted peace treaty between the United Arab Emirates and  Israel is an achievement of historic proportions. It is the clear  result of President Donald Trump's bold foreign policy agenda with  Jared Kushner creating peace through strength. This is a major step  towards a more stable, peaceful, and prosperous Middle East in which  all people and religions can coexist and prosper.   Credit is due to President Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu, and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan  for their commitment to peace and prosperity.   The Washington Examiner editorial titled, ``Team Trump Deserves  Congratulations on UAE-Israel Peace Deal'' is right. This agreement is  a substantive and significant victory for Israelis, Emiratis, and the  Trump administration.   UAE is ably represented in Washington by Yousef Al Otaiba working  with Ambassador David Friedman in Jerusalem.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
