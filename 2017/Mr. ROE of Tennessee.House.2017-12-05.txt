 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 1266) to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to enter into contracts with nonprofit organizations to investigate  medical centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1266         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Veteran Care       Act''.       SEC. 2. INVESTIGATION OF MEDICAL CENTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       contract with a nonprofit organization that accredits health       care organizations and programs in the United States to       investigate a medical center of the Department of Veterans       Affairs to assess and report deficiencies of the facilities       at such medical center.        (b) Authority of Directors.--        (1) In general.--Subject to coordination under paragraph       (2), the Secretary shall delegate the authority under       subsection (a) to contract for an investigation at a medical       center of the Department to the Director of the Veterans       Integrated Service Network in which the medical center is       located or the director of such medical center.        (2) Coordination.--Before entering into a contract under       paragraph (1), the Director of a Veterans Integrated Service       Network or the director of a medical center, as the case may       be, shall notify the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the       Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and       the Comptroller General of the United States for purposes of       coordinating any investigation conducted pursuant to such       contract with any other investigations that may be ongoing.        (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be       construed--        (1) to prevent the Office of the Inspector General of the       Department of Veterans Affairs from conducting any review,       audit,  [[Page H9642]]       evaluation, or inspection regarding a topic for which an       investigation is conducted under this section; or        (2) to modify the requirement that employees of the       Department assist with any review, audit, evaluation, or       inspection conducted by the Office of the Inspector General       of the Department.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1266, the Enhancing  Veteran Care Act. S. 1266 would authorize the Department of Veterans  Affairs to contract with a nonprofit entity specializing in civilian  accreditation or healthcare evaluation to investigate and assess  deficiencies at VA medical centers and to coordinate any such  investigations with the VA inspector general and the Government  Accountability Office.   This bill is sponsored by Senator James Inhofe from Oklahoma and is  companion legislation to H.R. 42, which is sponsored by my good friend,  Representative Markwayne Mullin from Oklahoma's Second District. I am  grateful to both Senator Inhofe and Congressman Mullin for their work  on this legislation.   We are all familiar with the various challenges and scandals that  have plagued VA medical centers across the country since the 2014  systemwide VA access and accountability crisis.   I, along with Ranking Member Walz and other committee members, our  Senate colleagues, Secretary Shulkin, veterans service organizations,  and others, have been working tirelessly to transform the VA healthcare  system into the modern, high-performing healthcare organization that  our veterans deserve.   S. 1266 is in line with those efforts in that it would provide VA an  additional avenue to identify and resolve problems impacting the care  our veterans receive in VA medical facilities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin), my good friend and sponsor of the House  companion bill, H.R. 42.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  This has been a team effort on the Veterans' Affairs Committee to work  to try to improve the care that our veterans and Nation's heroes get  throughout this country. The involvement on both sides of the aisle on  our committee is unprecedented, I think, for a committee working toward  a single goal and purpose.   Many times, we have differences of opinion, but this bill is just  another tool that the VA will be able to use to improve the care that  veterans get.   I received a letter today from a gentleman in New Mexico who had a  very different experience 6 or 7 years ago with the VA. He was even  hesitant to go back. He went back to this VA hospital and had a very  pleasant experience. So I think things are changing for the better, I  think due to the hard work of the leadership at the VA, the people who  work there every day, and this committee.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. McClintock). The question is on the  motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1266.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
