 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member  Katko for this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is simply about the truth. It is about the  truth behind the assault on our Capitol on January 6. Enough with lies.  Enough with conspiracy theories. The January 6 commission will have the  power, power to find the truth. It will have subpoena power to compel  people to testify, to testify under oath under penalty of perjury.   An attack on our Capitol, an attack on our democracy, an attack on  the election of our President--these cannot be tolerated, and they  cannot happen again.   What happened? What happened January 6? This bill is about sunshine,  this bill is about transparency. That is why I ask for every Member on  this floor, I ask you to vote ``aye'' on this most important measure.
