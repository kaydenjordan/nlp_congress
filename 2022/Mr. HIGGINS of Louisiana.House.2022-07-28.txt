 Mr. Speaker, I will tell my colleague what  we can agree on in the hallowed Halls of this Chamber. We can and  should agree that men of principle do not intend to build the future of  our Republic upon backroom deals in the dark of night in the upper  Chamber of our bicameral Congress, which is exactly what happened with  this bill, which is why it is now strongly opposed by my colleagues in  the Republican Party.   Everything we do here to advance the future of America should be  based upon the core principles that gave birth to America.   Perhaps my colleague could agree with me upon that.
