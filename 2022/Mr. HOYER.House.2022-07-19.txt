 Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v.  Jackson demonstrated not only the extremist majority of justices'  disregard for constitutional precedent; it also showed their disregard  for the individual liberties of the American people. As if depriving  women of their constitutional right to reproductive health care weren't  enough, Justice Thomas' concurring opinion specifically opened the door  to the overturning of United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v.  Hodges--and implicitly we can read this to mean Loving v. Virginia as  well. These cases established constitutional protections for same-sex  and interracial marriage in America.   Today, 1.1 million Americans arc in same-sex marriages. Almost ten  times as many are in interracial marriages. One of the very first votes  I took as a young state senator in Maryland after my first election to  public office was to repeal our state's vile and racist anti- miscegenation law. That was in 1967, five years after the Supreme  Court's decision in Loving v. Virginia. Fifty-five years have now  passed since that ruling. It has been nine and seven years,  respectively, since the Windsor and Obergefell rulings. Americans have  become used to knowing that they have a constitutional right to equal  marriage. Indeed, American women had gotten used to the security of  knowing that they had a constitutional right to reproductive choice for  forty-nine years until last month.   Just as was the case with the immediate aftermath of the Dobbs  ruling, at least thirty-five states already have laws or amendments in  their state constitution that would outlaw same-sex marriage if  Obergefell were overturned. We must do everything in our power to  ensure that Republican-controlled state legislatures don't have the  opportunity to restrict the rights of LGBTQ or interracial couples in  America. Neither government officials nor Supreme Court justices should  be able to decide that consenting American adults cannot marry. That's  why I'm bringing the Respect for Marriage Act to the Floor today to  codify the marriage equality precedents set by Loving, Windsor, and  Obergefell into federal statute.   I want to thank Chairman Nadler, Rep. Cicilline, all the Co-Chairs of  the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, Chairwoman Beatty, Chairman Ruiz,  Chairwoman Chu, and Democratic Caucus Chairman Jeffries for taking the  lead on this crucial legislation.   We cannot afford to underestimate the risk to marriage equality. We  cannot afford to be complacent and take for granted the rights we have  under the constitution as Americans. The millions of same-sex and  interracial couples throughout the United States should not have to  live with the fear that extremist Supreme Court justices--who act as  though they are legislators--could end legal recognition for their  families or prevent millions of others from being able to build  families with equal legal status. They deserve the assurance that their  marriages will always be recognized in every city, county, and state  across the country. That is the overwhelming consensus of the American  people, and it is the clear view of our constitution.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting `yes' on this legislation  to protect and respect marriages across our country.    Mr. Chair, this is a bill that has to pass if we are going  to keep the government operating. The chair of this committee has  worked very hard to get that done, and she has been successful, as  chair, of moving most of our bills through this House.   The Senate has not yet moved any of its bills, as it did not last  year. This is an important, critical part of our process to fund  government and keep it operating and invest in the priorities of the  American people. That is what we are doing today in these appropriation  bills.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and members of the staff  of the Appropriations Committee for their hard work on this package.   Once again, our majority is passing appropriation bills in a timely  manner. Sadly, as I said, the Senate has yet to bring any appropriation  bills to the Senate floor.   Today's package funds about a quarter of the total expected  discretionary funding for next year. It reflects the budget request  from the Biden administration, and in some cases funds programs at  levels we have determined should be increased.   It also includes Community Project Funding for investments in our  communities that will help improve public safety, encourage economic  growth, and fight poverty.   Bringing back Community Project Funding was an essential tool in  helping to restore Congress' power of the purse. I add that it was done  in a bipartisan way, and it was done--thanks to the chair--in a very  transparent way. We wanted to make sure that more funding decisions are  being made by the Members who know their districts best.   There is much to celebrate in this package, which is why I rise in  support of this package. Many important and worthwhile investments in  the American people, in our communities, in economic opportunity, and  in so many areas--I am not going to go into all of them, they will be  discussed.   I do want to highlight just a few of the important victories in this  bill, particularly for the constituents and communities I represent in  Maryland's Fifth District.   First, Mr. Chairman, this bill moves us a major step closer to  realizing a new, badly needed, consolidated FBI Headquarters, a  critical national security project that many of us have worked on for  more than a decade.   In fact, I started working on this in 2009 when the director of the  FBI said: This building is very out of date, does not accommodate the  work that we need to do, and we must have a new building--and requested  that there be a campus-like setting where all of the FBI could be  consolidated from the almost 20 different locations that they were  located in in the city.   This legislation will ensure that we can build a fully consolidated  FBI Headquarters that meets the needs of the Bureau with a substantial  payment of $500 million toward that project. It limits the GSA to  committing any of those funds only to one of the two sites in Maryland  and one in Virginia. The GSA just recently adjudged all three of those  sites to be eligible sites.   This project, first requested, as I said, by the FBI in 2009, is now  ready for final site selection. This building, which had been delayed  at a cost of giving the Bureau the tools and facilities necessary to  fulfill its missions, can now be advanced in the timeframe I have  understood from the administration, which is before the end of the  fiscal year.                                time  1600    In May of last year, the four Senators from Maryland and Virginia  wrote to President Biden and urged his administration to move forward  expeditiously. That was some 15 months ago. It is long past  expeditiously, and I look forward to seeing this project realized.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chair and the chair of the subcommittee, Mr.  Quigley, for his help on this effort. It is an important one for our  country.   Furthermore, this package would provide civilian Federal employees  with a 4.6% cost-of-living adjustment--at parity with the raise being  provided to military personnel--and makes DREAMERS eligible to serve as  Federal employees.   It increases the V.A. Health Care System's budget by nearly $22  billion over last year, which will help provide high-quality care to  7.3 million veterans in our country.   And it provides the Army Corps of Engineers with $3.5 million to  further oyster recovery in the Chesapeake Bay.   In addition to these priorities for Maryland's Fifth District, there  are other critical investments for which I have advocated for a long  time.   These include $400 million in Election Security Grants through the  Election Assistance Commission, which was created under my Help America  Vote Act Legislation in 2002.   It also funds a program I've championed to encourage college students  to become nonpartisan poll workers in their communities.   I was also glad to see the inclusion of $100 million for the  Technology Modernization Fund, which was launched under bipartisan  legislation I led with Leader McCarthy.   This will help agencies upgrade technology systems so that they can  serve americans more efficiently and securely.   Additionally, this package makes a strong investment in combatting  hunger by providing W.I.C. funds to serve more than 6 million people  and $28.6 billion toward child-nutrition programs.   It will also ensure that S.N.A.P. does not run out of money in 2023  and can continue helping those with the lowest incomes put food on the  table.   Mr. Chair, this is a very solid and robust funding package, and it  is--as I said--a first step in our effort to continue funding  government and delivering the priorities of the american people on  time.   I urge the Senate to match our pace in the appropriations process so  that we can continue governing responsibly `for the people.'
