 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank Ms. Shalala for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering a bill that does a lot of  things, and, if nothing else, this should be an object lesson on why  you don't leave everything to the last minute because, indeed, that is  what we have done in this year, this session of Congress. So we have  got a rule that has three fairly different bills contained.   We are considering a bill to reform the H-2A guest worker programs,  the National Defense Authorization Act conference report, and H.R. 3, a  bill that will limit American patients from treatments and cures of  tomorrow.   H.R. 5038, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, allows aliens who  have worked in the United States for 180 days, are deportable, and have  been continually present to be granted certified agricultural work  status. The status may also be extended to a recipient's spouse and  children. Certified workers can then apply for a green card path to  citizenship, and they are not counted toward the statutory cap.   In addition, the bill would subject H-2A users to a private right of  action and will not provide long-term wage relief. While the H-2A guest  worker visa program arguably needs reform, this bill expands the  ability to obtain legal status without adequate requirements,  documentation, or protections for the H-2A program users.   Second, the National Defense Authorization Act is a bipartisan  agreement to provide for a 3.1 percent pay raise for our troops, reform  privatized military housing, continue rebuilding readiness, provide  security assistance to our allies, and hold the Pentagon accountable  through reports on auditability.   The bill also protects the homeland by including my language  requiring an effort to identify hostile International Mobile Subscriber  Identity catchers, known as stingrays, which are used to locate and spy  on Americans.   Last, the NDAA repeals the widow's tax and prohibits the use of a  chemical compound known as PFAS in firefighting foam after October  2024.   I am pleased that we were able to reach an agreement to maintain the  strongest military in the world.   Now, let's turn to H.R. 3, the third bill that is being contained in  this rather wide-ranging rule. This bill attempts to address the high  cost of drugs, a goal of which I am supportive, but this bill severely  limits patient access to potentially new lifesaving drugs.   Republicans have offered a substitute bill, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs,  More Cures Act of 2019, that includes bipartisan policies to lower drug  costs for Americans.   There are a lot of reasons that Members should support H.R. 19, which  will now be our amendment in the nature of a substitute. Since it is  H.R. 19, let me limit myself to 19 reasons.   One, H.R. 19 will lower drug costs for American patients, while  protecting access to new treatments and cures.    Two, H.R. 19 is bipartisan, including more than 40 drug pricing  policies that have passed through House and Senate committees this  year.   Three, H.R. 19 would pass--could pass--both Chambers of Congress and  be signed into law in calendar year 2019.   Four, H.R. 19 will cap out-of-pocket costs in Medicare part D for  seniors at $3,100 per year, ensuring protection from the high cost  encountered with prescription drugs.   Five, H.R. 19 saves money for patients and their families rather than  saving money just for the government.   Six, H.R. 19 includes policies such as the CREATES Act and pay-for- delay to prevent pharmaceutical companies from gaming the system.   Seven, H.R. 19 promotes healthy competition for lower cost generics.   Eight, H.R. 19 corrects for the increased threshold it takes to reach  catastrophic coverage in part D, which is not yet fixed for plan year  2020. This bill will provide seniors with a refund in 2020 for costs  they should never have had to incur in the first place.   Nine, H.R. 19 strengthens transparency and accountability in the  existing drug pricing system.   Ten, H.R. 19 lowers the cost of insulin by capping the costs for  seniors in Medicare part D at $50 per month and adds additional  incentives for insurance to cover their fair share of insulin costs.   Eleven, H.R. 19 lowers the cost of drug administration by not paying  drastically more for the same service, whether it is provided in a  hospital or  [[Page H10036]]  other more traditionally expensive environments, the so-called site- neutral provision.   Twelve, H.R. 19 establishes a new negotiator at the United States  Trade Representative to ensure that America is not subsidizing the  world's drug costs.   Thirteen, H.R. 19 makes permanent a threshold of 7.5 percent of the  adjusted gross income for purposes of the medical expense tax deduction  in the Internal Revenue Code. Recall that, under the Affordable Care  Act, this threshold was increased to 10 percent, which many seniors  found onerous. It was reduced in the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act of 2017 to the threshold of 7.5 percent, but that threshold then  expires, and it goes and reverts back to the 10 percent threshold at  the end of this year. This would make that permanent.   Fourteen, H.R. 19 requires pricing information in direct-to-consumer  advertisements.   Fifteen, H.R. 19 cracks down on pharmacy benefit managers by  requiring more transparency in the reporting of aggregate rebates,  discounts, and other price concessions.   Sixteen, H.R. 19 helps access to prescription drugs in rural areas by  reforming direct and indirect remuneration fees, the so-called dreaded  DIR fee clawback that every community pharmacist dislikes so intensely.   Seventeen, H.R. 19 increases transparency into patient listings so  that manufacturers of generics and biosimilars will have adequate  information to enter the market.   Eighteen, H.R. 19 removes uncertainty at the pharmacy counter by  requiring insurance companies to provide pricing information to doctors  so that patients and their doctors can have discussions about what  medicine is best for them and what the cost will be.   Finally, number 19, H.R. 19 allows biomedical innovation to continue  to thrive. It does not abandon the success of the 21st Century Cures  bill. It lowers drug costs for Americans, while maintaining access to  drugs that exist now and ensuring that that access is sustained in the  future.   Mr. Speaker, there are many more than three reasons to oppose H.R. 3,  but let's limit ourselves to three reasons so compelling that, really,  you shouldn't need to go into any more.   Number one, the Congressional Budget Office, the Council of Economic  Advisers, and the California Life Sciences Association have found that  H.R. 3 will result in fewer drugs for Americans. There is no way to  predict what could be included in this fewer drugs. It could be the  cure for Alzheimer's; it could be the cure for ALS; or it could be the  cure for pancreatic cancer.   There is some disparity in the number of cures that would be lost  with the passage of this bill, but here is the central thesis: Every  organization that has looked at this has said that there will be fewer  drugs introduced after the passage of this bill.                                time  1300    In addition, access to drugs that help or cure or maintain a healthy  life will be at risk. The six-referenced countries in H.R. 3 have 30 to  60 percent fewer new medications than the United States of America.  This is what is at stake today.   Number 2, H.R. 3 claims to negotiate drug prices, but with a 95  percent excise tax for manufacturers who fail to reach a price  agreement with the government, it is more akin to a hostage-taking and  then shooting the hostage.   There are concerns that this is unconstitutional under the Takings  Clause of the Constitution. This takeover of the entire drug industry  in the United States is not only bad policy but may be constitutionally  perilous.   Interestingly enough, when this bill was marked up in our committee,  one of our Members on the Republican side spoke to this issue, tried to  offer an amendment that would have provided severability, so that if  the law was found to be unconstitutional, that the part that was  unconstitutional could be struck down and the rest could stand. But for  whatever reason, the majority rejected that amendment and it was  defeated on a party line vote.   Number three, and this is critically important, H.R. 3 will never  become law. The majority leader of the other body has said that H.R. 3  is dead-on-arrival in the Senate. And President Trump has related how  H.R. 3 is not good for Americans.   I think it is important that we fight for a world where research into  life-threatening illnesses never ceases, no matter how many failures  occur before a cure is found.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, opposition to the  underlying bill, H.R. 3, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), a valuable member of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 3, runs the risk of quickly stifling  innovation in the new drug space. A preliminary Congressional Budget  Office analysis of this bill has stated that it would result in 15  fewer new drugs coming on the market over the next 10 years, and we all  know drugs are in the pipeline for much longer than that. The actual  pipeline to deliver new product is 14 years, so it is that second 10  years where the real risk of this bill becomes apparent.   The cure for Alzheimer's may be one of those ones that is included in  that list of drugs that are never developed in the first place. That is  why we need to defeat H.R. 3.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington State (Mr. Newhouse), previous member of the Rules Committee  and a valuable member of the Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I want to share a letter that I received. This is from a  woman who had lost her daughter to suicide following an episode of  severe postpartum depression. She writes:         After many long years of research and development, on 3/19,       calendar year 2019, the Food and Drug Administration approved       Zulresso, the first medicine to successfully treat moderate       to severe postpartum depression worldwide. It is a 60-hour IV       treatment, administered in a certified hospital setting. It       is effective in as little as 20 hours. Had this medicine been       available, I feel that my daughter would be alive today.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, Republicans will amend the rule  immediately to consider H.R. 2207, the Protect Medical Innovation Act  of 2019. This bill, which now has 256 bipartisan cosponsors, will  repeal the excise tax on medical devices that is set to go into effect  January 1, 2020.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), my good friend, a valuable member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Baird) to speak on the amendment as part of the  defeat of the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Bucshon) to continue our speakers on the defeat of the  previous question and in support of their amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Pence) to continue to speak on the amendment that we will  offer if we defeat the previous question,    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have been hearing from our colleagues from Indiana  about the excise tax on medical devices and how important it is to  repeal that excise tax on medical devices.   That tax has been delayed several times but does go into effect  January 1. It is a 2.8 percent excise tax on gross receipts. We are  talking in H.R. 3 about a 95 percent excise tax. They are talking about  the number of jobs that have been killed with a 2.8 percent Federal  excise tax. How many jobs are going to be lost with a 95 percent excise  tax?   Again, as I said earlier, this is not a good faith negotiation with  the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This is akin to a hostage  situation because the threat of a 95 percent excise tax hangs over that  discussion.   We have heard a lot about innovation. Let me share with you an  excerpt from a letter that I received from a constituent after the  introduction of H.R. 3. The letter says: ``I started taking  antidepressants when I was 15. Since then, I have been hospitalized  three different times for attempts at suicide. Now I am at a place  where I have found the medication that works for me; it is literally  lifesaving. This medication is only possible through years of careful  research and investment and in good supply because of a free market.    ``If we had allowed a bill like H.R. 3 to pass into law previously,  then the medications that have helped me might not exist. I cannot  imagine a world where people just like me might go without the proper  medication due to government overreach.''   The story is repeated over and over again. Mr. Speaker, Congress  passed at the end of the session in calendar year 2016 the last bill  signed into law by President Obama, the 21st Century Cures Act.   Mr. Speaker, since the time that bill was signed into law, it really  has been impressive the number of new things that are coming onto the  market and those new things that are just over the horizon.   This bill, H.R. 3, strips the ability for the 21st Century Cures Act  to deliver on the promise. But here is the good news. The Rules  Committee, in its wisdom, made available an amendment in the nature of  a substitute.   I have discussed H.R. 19 in some detail. The amendment in the nature  of a substitute will be the text of H.R. 19 so Members will have an  opportunity to vote for bipartisan consensus agreements that will lower  drug prices now, that will protect innovation in the future, and that,  most importantly, could be signed into law before the end of the year.   Think about it. This is a deliverable that we have within our power  to bring to the American people. We should not give up on that chance.   I have been speaking against H.R. 3. The NDAA, which is also included  in this legislation, I do support. I cannot support the guest worker  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question. Let's  take up the amendment about the excise tax on medical devices, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   In the early days of my medical practice in the 1980s, I would sit  around with other doctors and kvetch that there were treatments  available in Europe that were not available in the United States. But  Congress acted and enacted the prescription drug user fee agreements in  1992, sped up the regulatory process, and broke the regulatory  bottleneck. The drug approval process over the past four decades has  significantly improved to the point that American doctors now have more  tools at their disposal to alleviate human suffering than at any time  in the Nation's past.   The President weighed in right around Thanksgiving with what he  [[Page H10102]]  thought would be the correct path forward. Indeed, in the Rules  Committee last night, we received the Statement of Administration  Policy from the President that said he would veto H.R. 3 if presented  in its current form. But he goes on to say that H.R. 19 is a far better  approach to lowering drug prices and discovering lifesaving cures. The  President believes there is a path forward. The administration remains  committed to working with both parties to pass legislation.   What H.R. 3 represents to me is a lost opportunity. It was an  opportunity to work together. The President wanted to work together.  But it is a lost opportunity to bring down drug costs for American  patients. We can vote against H.R. 3. We can support the amendment in  the nature of a substitute. H.R. 19 could become law this year, in  2019.
