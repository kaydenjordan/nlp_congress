 Mr. President, I am here to talk about my support for  confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court.   Judge Barrett's qualifications and her character are indisputable. I  had the honor of meeting with Judge Barrett earlier this month when she  said her guiding principles as a judge were in the mold of a great  Justice--the late Justice Antonin Scalia. In fact, during our meeting  and over the course of her hearing before the Senate Judiciary  Committee, Judge Barrett demonstrated her understanding of the purpose  of the U.S. Supreme Court and the proper role of a judge.   Judge Barrett believes that judges shouldn't legislate from the  bench. Keep in mind that she is currently a sitting judge on the  Seventh Circuit Court. She won't misuse her power as a judge to impose  her policy preferences, and she won't twist the original and the true  meaning of the Constitution to advance a political agenda of any kind.  Judge Barrett will uphold our cherished constitutional rights,  including the Second Amendment.   I have an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association and the  Montana Shooting Sports Association. I firmly believe that a correct  understanding--a profound understanding--of the Second Amendment is  essential. In the discussions I had with Judge Barrett, she confirmed  she has that understanding. Judge Barrett's strong support of the  Second Amendment can give every law-abiding Montanan who owns a firearm  the full confidence that she will never allow the government to take  away our guns. She understands what ``shall not infringe'' truly means.   I believe Judge Barrett will stop Congress in its tracks when it  exceeds its limited constitutional powers. For decades, Congress has  imposed policies that this body has had no authority in creating in the  first place. Judge Barrett will ensure that Congress stays within its  limited constitutional powers while returning powers to the States and  back to the people. She will defend the Constitution. She will protect  our Montana way of life, including our Montana jobs. Judge Barrett will  not bend to the radical fringe groups that are looking to kill Montana  timber and coal jobs. She will be a fairminded Justice whom Montanans  will be proud of.   Yet some on the far left not only oppose Amy Coney Barrett's  confirmation but have also said they are open to packing the Supreme  Court with liberal judges. Let me just define what ``packing'' means.  That means increasing the number of Justices on the Supreme Court from  9, which has been the case for 151 years, to 11 or 13 or more, perhaps.  That will be an attack on our  [[Page S6445]]  Montana way of life. I stand with Montanans in strongly opposing this  dangerous power-grab proposal. With Judge Barrett on the Supreme Court,  the age of activist Justices rewriting the laws to accomplish their own  policy agendas will be gone.   She is a mother of seven children--five biologically and two adopted  Haitian children. We will have a Supreme Court Justice whom we can also  call a minivan mom. Judge Barrett is an inspiration to professional  women, to working moms, and to school-aged girls across Montana who can  feel certain there is no American dream that women cannot achieve.   Just last week, I met with several northwest Montana businesswomen  leaders in Kalispell to talk about their support for Judge Barrett's  confirmation. These Montana businesswomen shared their views of Judge  Barrett as a mentor, a role model, a wife, a mother, a brilliant  jurist, and a great leader.   I would also like to take a moment to congratulate and thank  President Trump for nominating such outstanding and well-qualified  individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court. With Judge Barrett's  confirmation, we will take another major step toward restoring the  Founding Fathers' vision for the Supreme Court and the separation of  powers they brilliantly created.   As a U.S. Senator from Montana, supporting Judge Barrett's  confirmation to the Supreme Court is an easy call. She is someone whom  Montanans can be proud of and whom Montanans can look up to on the  Court.   I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.                    Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 758    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an effort that, frankly, I  never envisioned I would have to, something that is so beyond radical,  and that is packing the U.S. Supreme Court.   This plan, hatched by a Democratic President in 1937, was so radical  then that it was soundly defeated here in the U.S. Senate--a Senate, I  might add, in which 76 of the 96 Members were Democrats.   This was a plan that was so hostile to institutional principles that  the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1937 said that it was ``a measure  which should be so emphatically rejected that its parallel will never  again be presented to the free representatives of the free people of  America.''   In fact, as recently as 2019, the brilliant late Justice Ruth Bader  Ginsburg stated: ``I think it was a bad idea when President Franklin  Roosevelt tried to pack the court . . . and if anything would make the  court look partisan, it would be that.''   Well, today we find ourselves in the same spot, and the reason why is  simple: The Democratic Party still does not accept the legitimacy of  President Trump or his highly qualified judicial nominees.   Don't forget it was just earlier this year that the Democratic  leader, Senator Schumer, stood in front of the Supreme Court and openly  threatened President Trump's two Supreme Court picks if they didn't  vote the way he wanted by saying, ``I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want  to tell you, Kavanaugh: You have released the whirlwind and you will  pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these  awful decisions.'' That is disturbing--disturbing, indeed.   Let's be clear. This is nothing more than an attempt at a partisan  power grab by Democrats. You see, packing the Supreme Court by moving  from the current 9 Justices to 11 or 13 would essentially eliminate the  Supreme Court from being a check and a balance on Congress and the  executive branch, paving the way for a radical, far-left agenda put  forth by Chuck Schumer and the Democrats if they get the majority.   Packing the Supreme Court is a direct attack on our Montana way of  life. Packing the Supreme Court with activist, liberal Justices will  help the far-left radicals strip away our Second Amendment rights,  destroy good-paying energy and natural resource jobs, and cripple the  Montana and American economy by blocking forest management and energy  projects.   For us in Montana, we know exactly what it means to have an activist,  liberal judge on the bench. Look no further than Judge Brian Morris of  Montana. Judge Morris has done everything in his power to try to kill  Montana's energy jobs. In fact, he specifically blocked the Keystone XL  Pipeline. This project would create thousands of jobs and generate tens  of millions of tax dollars every year for Montana schools and Montana  communities.   Packing the Supreme Court will also erode a major principle of our  Constitution; that is, the separation of powers into three coequal  branches of government. Packing the Supreme Court would simply make the  Court an extension of the legislative branch. It is the independence of  the judiciary that is essential to check and balance both the executive  and legislative branches. Packing the Court would simply turn the U.S.  Supreme Court into an extension of whatever political party happens to  control the White House and the Senate.   Here is how it would work: Whichever President is in power, if they  have the same party in power in the Senate, they could keep escalating  the number of Justices. It would go from 11 to 13 to 15 to 17. It would  absolutely spin out of control, and our Founding Fathers would be  rolling over in their graves. The packed Court would simply turn the  Supreme Court into an extension of whichever political party happens to  control the White House and the Senate.   So I am here today to call out the shameful partisan attack on our  judiciary, and I hope the rest of my colleagues will join me in passing  this resolution that calls for the Supreme Court to simply remain as it  has been for 151 years at nine Justices. That is all it says--we are  going to keep the Supreme Court at nine Justices.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to consideration of S. Res. 758, submitted earlier today.  Further, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I appreciate the Senator from Rhode Island bringing up  dark money spent in our elections.   We all agree that dark-money spending has gotten out of control;  however, the Senator from Rhode Island gives me an opportunity to point  out the blatant hypocrisy from those in the Democratic Party on this  very issue.   I know I speak for probably every Montanan, if not most, when I say  that we are tired of being bombarded with never-ending television,  digital, radio, mail pieces, and most of it is from dark-money  organizations. And where do you think much of this dark money is coming  from? It is from groups aligned with the minority leader and the  Democrats. In fact, according to a September 2020 report by  OpenSecrets, which tracks political spending, two dark-money groups  aligned with the Democratic Senate leadership have spent more than $44  million on political TV ads--more than any other outside group on  television ads during the 2020 election cycle.   Let me say that again. These are two dark money groups aligned with  Democratic Senate leadership that have spent more than any other  outside group on television ads during the 2020 election cycle. Yet  neither group has reported any spending to the FEC at all--zero.   You may ask yourself why the minority leader and his dark money  allies are dumping so much money into races across our country,  including Montana. The reason for that is the minority leader wants to  be the majority leader and take control of the U.S. Senate. He wants to  change the rules, destroy 151 years of precedent, and pack the Supreme  Court with activist, liberal judges who will strip away our rights and  our freedom.   Packing the Court is a direct attack on our Montana way of life. That  is why, more than ever, my Court packing resolution is so important. It  just says: Let's keep it at nine.   It is not that complicated. We cannot let this Court packing occur.   So while the Democrats continue to decry dark money--until it  benefits their campaigns, of course--we must all take a stand in  ensuring that our Montana way of life is protected.   For those reasons, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have  already made my remarks about the hypocrisy on this issue of dark  money.   I think it is also worth pointing out that it was a very different  situation in 2016, when Merrick Garland was nominated by President  Obama. In every White House controlled by one party and the U.S. Senate  by another, the President of the Senate, going back to 1888--in an  election year when both the Senate and the Presidency are controlled by  the same party, you move forward; when not, you don't.   That is exactly what we did. We had an election in 2016. President  Trump won, and here we are in 2020 with Republicans controlling the  Senate, and the White House began to move forward.   So with that, I object.
