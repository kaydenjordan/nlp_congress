 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong and enthusiastic  support of my bill, H.R. 4380, the El Paso Community Healing Garden  National Memorial Act.   My bill will designate the El Paso Healing Garden at Ascarate Park in  El Paso, Texas, as a national memorial, and help ensure that our entire  country honors the 23 innocent lives we lost in  [[Page H3730]]  the attack on El Paso on August 3, 2019.   I rise today for my legislation, but I also rise in memory of the 23  souls who were killed by a domestic terrorist. I rise for the 22 other  victims who were injured in the attack. I rise for their loved ones-- their families, friends, and for an entire community rocked by white  supremacy.   On the morning of August 3, 2019, a 21-year-old gunman drove more  than 11 hours and hundreds of miles to get to El Paso. He used an AK-47  and opened fire at a busy Walmart while families were shopping for  groceries, getting their prescriptions filled, and buying school  supplies for their children. He killed couples, grandparents, siblings,  brand new parents. His youngest victim was just 15 years old. It was  the deadliest targeted attack on Latinos in modern American history.   The weapon he used wasn't just intended to kill--an AK-47 rips flesh,  bones, and arteries to shreds. Most of the survivors from the attack  don't just live with the scars that we can't see in front of us, but  they live with unbelievable physical agony, and they also have to  shoulder the financial consequences of ongoing surgeries and medical  care, even years later.   When he turned himself in, the domestic terrorist confessed to police  that he drove to El Paso to slaughter Mexicans and immigrants. He  published a screed online just before the massacre, and in it he cited  the anti-immigrant Great Replacement theory and xenophobic hate speech,  claiming that he was combating what he called the ``Hispanic invasion  of Texas.''    This is the same language, these are the same theories, the same hate  and racism that we still hear today from rightwing public figures and  the former President, whose favorite scapegoats are still vulnerable  immigrants.   These people should have seen that their words have power.  Unfortunately, however, instead of learning from this tragedy, racists  and supremacists have grown more emboldened. And why wouldn't they?  They are radicalized nightly by a national media outlet disguised as  ``news'' that runs unchecked, their talking points openly parroted by  leaders here, in the Halls of Congress.   Our safe, loving, welcoming community, a community of good will, is  seen as a threat by people with hate in their heart. The language of  hate draws a target on the backs of the most vulnerable. On August 3,  El Paso paid the price.   El Pasoans, however, came together in the immediate aftermath of this  shooting and we did what we do best: take care of each other, stand  united, stand in love. We represent the best of America, and El Pasoans  continue to be a source of great hope for me.   El Paso is strong. We are resilient. But we deserve justice and  recognition. I am honored to help ensure that what happened in El Paso  is not forgotten, not anywhere, not in any corner of this country. That  we remember every victim and we work to prevent more tragedy.   Madam Speaker, I will close by sharing the names of the victims:   Andre Pablo Anchondo, Jordan Kae Anchondo, Arturo Benavides, Jorge  Calvillo Garcia, Leonardo Campos, Jr., Maribel Hernandez-Loya, Adolfo  Cerros Hernandez, Sara Esther Regalado Monreal, Guillermo ``Coach  Memo'' Garcia, Angelina Silva Englisbee, Maria Munoz Flores, Raul  Estrada Flores, Gerhard Alexander Hoffmann, David Alvah Johnson, Luis  Alfonso Juarez, Maria Eugenia Legarreta Rothe, Ivan Manzano, Gloria  Irma Marquez, Elsa L. Mendoza, Margie Reckard, Javier Amir Rodriguez,  Teresa Trinidad Sanchez Guerra, and Juan De Dios Velazquez.   May they rest in peace, may their families find comfort, and may our  country learn from this tragedy.                                time  1530
