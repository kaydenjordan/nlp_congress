 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1159) to provide for continuing cooperation between the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Israel Space Agency, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1159         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States and Israel       Space Cooperation Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds that--        (1) authorized in 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration (NASA) supports and coordinates United States       Government research in aeronautics, human exploration and       operations, science, and space technology;        (2) established in 1983, the Israel Space Agency (ISA)       supports the growth of Israel's space industry by supporting       academic research, technological innovation, and educational       activities;        (3) the mutual interest of the United States and Israel in       space exploration affords both nations an opportunity to       leverage their unique abilities to advance scientific       discovery;        (4) in 1996, NASA and the ISA entered into their first       agreement outlining areas of mutual cooperation, which       remained in force until 2005;        (5) since 1996, NASA and the ISA have successfully       cooperated on many space programs supporting the Global       Positioning System and research related to the sun, earth       science, and the environment;        (6) the bond between NASA and the ISA was permanently       forged on February 1, 2003, with the loss of the crew of STS-      107 including Israeli Astronaut Ilan Ramon;        (7) the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of       2014 (Public Law 113-296) designated Israel as a Major       Strategic Partner of the United States; and        (8) on October 13, 2015, the United States and Israel       signed the Framework Agreement between the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of       America and the Israel Space Agency for Cooperation in       Aeronautics and the Exploration and Use of Airspace and Outer       Space for Peaceful Purposes.       SEC. 3. CONTINUING COOPERATION.         The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration shall continue to work with the Israel Space       Agency to identify and cooperatively pursue peaceful space       exploration and science initiatives in areas of mutual       interest, taking all appropriate measures to protect       sensitive information, intellectual property, trade secrets,       and economic interests of the United States.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice  Johnson) each will control 20 minutes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on H.R. 1159, the bill now under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States and Israel Space Cooperation Act  deserves  [[Page H10162]]  our support. The peaceful use of outer space and cooperation with our  friends and allies lie at the very heart of NASA's mission.   The United States has been a partner and a friend to the Israeli  space program since its creation three decades ago. Our voyages have  brought us closer together as nations, as partners, and as friends. Our  shared quests for peace, knowledge, and friendship echo our experiences  together on Earth.   But sadness and sorrow have tested that relationship. Israel's first  astronaut, Ilan Ramon, flew to space for the first time on the ill- fated Space Shuttle Columbia. Even though that accident tragically  ended the life of Ilan and six U.S. crew members, the U.S. and Israel  turned that tragedy into hope, working together even more closely.   In 2015, the U.S. and Israel again renewed their partnership with  another 10-year commitment to peaceful cooperation in space. That  mutual commitment to the peaceful exploration of outer space has grown  even stronger with the passage of this act under consideration today.   Peaceful space exploration offers all humanity a common, noble goal,  extending our collective reach further into the heavens. Reaching  farther and broadening our understanding of the universe is one of the  most important and honorable challenges that we can face together. I  believe that working together with our allies and partners on the  peaceful exploration of space is an essential part of what makes NASA a  vital national asset. This bill strengthens NASA's ability to do this  important work.   I am also pleased that the bill includes a recognition that sensitive  and proprietary information should be protected.                                time  1800    Mr. Speaker, I invite all of my colleagues to join me in support of  the United States and Israel Space Cooperation Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1159, the United States and  Israel Space Cooperation Act. The cooperation between the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, and the Israel Space Agency  is just one example of peaceful international cooperation that has been  a hallmark of NASA's approach since its inception in 1958.   In fact, when Congress passed NASA's founding legislation, the Space  Act of 1958, one of the primary objectives established for the agency  was: ``7, Cooperation by the United States with other nations and  groups of nations in work done pursuant to this act and in the peaceful  application of the results thereof.''   NASA has followed this objective over the years in a variety of ways.  Since its establishment in 1958, NASA has entered into over 5,000  original agreements with international entities, and currently NASA has  over 800 active cooperative agreements across a range of disciplines  with over 120 countries and international organizations.   These international partnerships have led to a range of benefits in  scientific advancement, access to scientific data, partnering in  exploration, and sharing the costs and risks of space missions.   NASA has had a long and fruitful relationship with the country of  Israel, and that cooperative relationship continues to this day.  Current activities with Israel include the involvement of almost 200  Israeli schools in the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the  Environment, GLOBE, educational project; collaboration on atmospheric  and climate research; and numerical cloud modeling, among other  activities.   I think it is also fitting to remember that the crew of the ill-fated  Space Shuttle Columbia mission, STS-107, included an Israeli astronaut,  Ilan Ramon, who, along with the entire STS-107 crew, tragically  perished with the loss of the space shuttle orbiter on February 1,  2003.   Israel has shared in the great achievements of NASA as well as great  losses that have paved the way for future space explorers. Their  sacrifice will be held in our hearts as we work to further space  exploration for the benefit of mankind.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the sponsor of this legislation, Mr.  Kilmer, for introducing the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice  Johnson) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4323, the bill now under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4323, the bill now under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4323, the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act,  is about helping expand veterans' job and education opportunities in  the sciences.   The bill requires the National Science Foundation to develop a  veterans outreach plan and to publish data on veterans' participation  in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields in its  annual Indicators report.   The bill also updates the Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, its  fellowship programs, and cyber grant programs to include outreach to  veterans.   Additionally, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy  is tasked with overseeing an interagency working group to examine how  to increase veteran participation in STEM career fields, including  addressing any barriers for servicemembers and their spouses.   In the next 5 years, between 1 and 1.5 million members of the United  States Armed Forces will be leaving the military, according to the  Department of Defense. Many of these veterans will be seeking new  careers. By a great margin, veterans cite finding employment as their  number one need when returning home.   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, occupations in the  STEM fields are projected to grow to more than 9 million between 2012  and 2022, an increase of 1 million jobs.   Research shows that many military veterans already have skills and  training that align with STEM careers, particularly in information  technology. However, research has also shown that veterans face many  barriers as they reenter the workforce, including a lack of formal STEM  education, career guidance, and the difficult task of transferring  military credits to civilian credits.   Our Nation's veterans deserve every opportunity to transition to a  healthy  [[Page H10164]]  and successful civilian life. This bill will help our servicemembers to  continue to serve our Nation in many new ways by filling 21st century  jobs and keeping America on the cutting edge of innovation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Takano, the ranking vice chair of  the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a fellow member on the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee, for cosponsoring this bipartisan  legislation. I also salute all of my fellow veterans on the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee who joined me in introducing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4323, the Supporting Veterans  in STEM Careers Act, and I thank Mr. Dunn and Mr. Takano for  introducing this good legislation.   The demand for a workforce equipped with STEM skills is growing. At  the same time, many veterans developed valuable technical skills during  their service. We must do more to take advantage of those skills and  increase veteran participation in STEM careers if we are to meet the  workforce demands.   This summer, I was pleased to see the passage of the Forever GI Bill,  which extended GI benefits for veterans enrolled in STEM degree  programs. Now that STEM degrees are more accessible for veterans, we  must do more to support veterans during their transition into STEM  degree programs and careers.   H.R. 4323 directs the National Science Foundation to report data on  veterans in STEM studies and careers and develop a plan to increase  outreach to veterans.   This bill also creates an interagency committee that will examine how  Federal programs and policies can best be leveraged to equip veterans  with the skills they need to transition into STEM careers.   H.R. 4323 is a good step toward strengthening our STEM workforce and  creating opportunities for an eminently deserving sector of our  citizenry.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
