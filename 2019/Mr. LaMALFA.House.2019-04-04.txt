 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight some pretty  disturbing numbers released by Customs and Border Protection that help  put our border crisis into perspective.   In 2018, Customs and Border Patrol agents and officers seized more  than 1.7 million pounds of narcotics, including 1 million pounds of  marijuana; 280,000 pounds of cocaine; 248,000 pounds of  methamphetamine; 6,500 pounds of heroin; 2,400 pounds of fentanyl,  which is enough doses to kill everyone in the United States; and  139,000 pounds of other illicit drugs.   It is also a humanitarian crisis. Border Patrol agents rescued from  trafficking 4,300 men and women near the border last year. There is no  telling how many more have been caught up in human trafficking that  slipped through the cracks.   Border Patrol says nearly every sector across the Southwest border  has exceeded their capacity. Each day, nearly half the agents on the  Southwest border are diverted away from border security missions to  instead care for, transport, and process family units and unaccompanied  children.   Even former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Jeh  Johnson of the Obama administration said that we have a crisis with  these huge numbers.   Madam Speaker, we need to do our job and get this border crisis  solved.                            ____________________
