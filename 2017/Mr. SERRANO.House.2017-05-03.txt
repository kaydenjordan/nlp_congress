 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise--and you should listen to this very closely--in  support of this bill. I do it because both sides understood the  importance of coming together and trying to work on a solution to this  situation. I have to say that the Republicans came to the table  understanding that they had the majority of the votes, but that they  also had the majority of the responsibility to make sure it was a  unified decision that was made.   For my hometown of New York, there is money to reimburse the  protection of Trump Tower, where the President has spent a lot of time  and where the police department has to be picking up the bill. The  Legal Services Corporation, one of our greatest programs, was scheduled  to disappear. This bill does not allow that. Hispanic-serving  institutions at the National Science Foundation are still alive and  doing well. This bill allows for so many different issues in NOAA and  in NASA to continue to grow.    But most of all what this bill does, in my opinion, is prove  something that perhaps--and I'm not being naive here--we can carry  forward. When we set our minds to coming together and when we set our  minds to working as one group of people on behalf of our country, we  can do it.   This bill we will vote on today, I will vote proudly because I know  that we could have made this into another fight. I know for the next  budget we will have differences. But please, my brothers and sisters,  remember we were able to come together. And some on TV tonight will say  that this side sold out or that side sold out. No. Both sides worked  for the American people, and it works well.
