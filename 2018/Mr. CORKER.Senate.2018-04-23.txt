 Mr. President, for the Committee on Foreign Relations I  report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in  the Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save  the expense of reprinting on the Executive  [[Page S2342]]  Calendar that these nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the  information of Senators.
