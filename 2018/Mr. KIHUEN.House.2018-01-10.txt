 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Candice  Bowers.   Candice was a single mother to her three children: Kurtis, Katie, and  her recently adopted daughter, Ariel.   She was a hardworking waitress who was selfless and always ensured  she was able to take care of her family. Candice had a loving heart, a  big smile, and an infectious laugh.   She went to the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas with her best  friend so she could take some rare time for herself.   Candice was known for her strength, fierce loyalty, and generosity.  She would give her last dollar to anyone who was in need.   I would like to extend my condolences to Candice's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas and the whole country  grieve with you.                            ____________________
