 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Republican lack  of support for their leaders. Two months ago, House Democrats saved the  country from a devastating government shutdown, and I thank current  Speaker Johnson for working with us to avoid another one. I would not  feel very confident if I were the current Speaker.   Republicans have a history of rejecting their leadership. They did it  to Newt Gingrich. They did it to Speaker John Boehner. They did it to  Speaker Paul Ryan. They did it to Speaker Kevin McCarthy. They could do  it to Speaker   Mike Johnson.   Democrats support our leadership. We work to increase jobs, support  families and veterans, protect women's rights, and fight for all  Americans. We work together to avoid government shutdowns.   Mr. Speaker, everyone in Congress should have that same commitment to  the American people.                            ____________________
