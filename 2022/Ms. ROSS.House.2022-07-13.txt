 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, PFAS chemicals affect our drinking water, our  crops, the air we breathe, and the products we bring into our homes.   As Members know, PFAS are a large class of chemicals that are highly  persistent and mobile in the environment. They are commonly referred to  as forever chemicals.   PFAS have contaminated more than 2,300 sites across 49 States,  polluting the drinking water of an estimated 200 million Americans,  including thousands of households in my home State of North Carolina  and at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.   Forever chemicals have been associated with a wide range of serious  health effects, including a probable link with cancer, thyroid disease,  lower fertility, and more. Over 500 PFAS are included on the Federal  inventory of chemicals that can be used in commerce, but we know very  little about what these chemicals are, where they are manufactured and  used, and how the American people and our troops are being exposed.   Thankfully, after years of indecision, Congress took bipartisan  action in the fiscal year 2020 NDAA, directing EPA to complete a PFAS  reporting rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The rule  requires EPA to use its existing authority to obtain information about  all PFAS manufactured since 2011, including their identity, where they  are manufactured, total amounts produced, general categories of how  they are used, and existing information on environmental and health  effects.   We lack this information for virtually all of the PFAS that have been  manufactured and released into the environment in our country, a  critical blind spot that hinders our ability to understand the full  scope of the challenge we face and how to protect the public and our  troops.   Unfortunately, EPA's proposed rule contains a significant flaw. It  defines ``PFAS'' far too narrowly, excluding hundreds of these forever  chemicals, including some that have already been found in drinking  water or that have been incinerated as waste around the country.                                time  0040    During the comment period, numerous stakeholders, including drinking  water utilities, State environmental protection agencies, PFAS  scientists, 17 State attorneys general, all urged EPA to use a broader  definition in the final rule, with many advocating for the consensus  definition recently adopted by the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development.   A reporting rule that fails to capture the full universe of PFAS will  deprive EPA, Congress, the States, and the public of information  necessary to address the effects of PFAS effectively and efficiently.   My bipartisan amendment with Representative Mace directs EPA to use a  simple definition of PFAS--one fully fluorinated carbon atom--that is  consistent with the international definition.   A final PFAS reporting rule using the definition in our amendment  will ensure that we have the full picture of the nature and extent of  the PFAS effects, enabling Congress and the administration to formulate  an effective plan of action to address these problems.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to make it clear that this is a  reporting rule, it is not a regulation. It is more like a law requiring  labeling on food and packaging, and it gives the public information  about chemicals that affect their health. Our water resource agencies  are asking for this. We are trying to clean up some of the effects.   In North Carolina, we are seeing this in the Cape Fear River. Again,  it is affecting the health of our people and our troops.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the public, in the comment  period, has said that we need more information and a more robust  definition.   It also belongs in the NDAA because it originated in the 2020 NDAA,  and it has affected troops in North Carolina, particularly adjacent to  the Cape Fear River.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
