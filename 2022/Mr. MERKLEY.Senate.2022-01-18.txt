 Would the Senator from Iowa yield for a question?    Thank you very much.   First, thank you for coming to the floor to debate such an important  issue as how to make the Senate work well as a deliberative body and  how to make our country work well.   I was struck by a couple of things that you mentioned, and that is  that you had stood strong fast against striking down the filibuster,  and you noted how consistent you were. But you also criticized  Democrats for changing position.   But can you help my memory out on this, because did you not vote to  strike down the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations?    So you changed your position, as well you would concede,  since previously you had opposed getting rid of the filibuster?    I do appreciate your response, and it is so rare that we  actually have any dialogue on the floor of the Senate. It is one of the  things we lost.   I do recall in that moment that, for over a year, we had working  groups trying to resolve the extraordinary level--the new level--of  cloture motions on President Obama's nominations. It concluded in a  meeting in the Old Senate Chamber where the agreement was reached to  stop doing that. And then, as you point out, Mitch McConnell came to  the floor and said: It doesn't matter the quality of the individual who  is nominated. I will not let any judge be considered for these three  vacancies.   That is a completely unprecedented new element that is brought in to  bear on that particular conversation. That is just to, kind of,  illuminate some of the details that were left out.   I was struck by another thing you said, which is that the filibuster  is not a relic of Jim Crow. I was struck about that because from 1891  through 1965--so we are talking over 80 years--the only thing that was  blocked in the U.S. Senate by filibuster was civil rights for Black  Americans. Given that, wouldn't you say it is fair for us to say that  the filibuster in that history was, indeed, a relic of Jim Crow?    Thank you for answering and responding to my questions.  I appreciate that.    Mr. President, I think I will start just by returning to  the 1800s and a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Sumner. Senator  Sumner later played a key role in the civil rights debate, which is why  I am returning to that story. I think it is a story about the Senate  floor.   Sumner gave a speech about Kansas being admitted into the Union, and  he was a Republican Senator who called out two Democratic Senators,  insulting one of them. And a Representative from the House of  Representatives, on the other end of this corridor, came over here. His  name was Preston Brooks, and he took considerable offense, and he  proceeded to come to the Senate floor and cane Senator Sumner. Senator  Sumner was gravely injured, but he did recover--recovering slowly. He  served for another 18 years, which leads me to the fact that he  proceeded to put forward civil rights legislation in 1875--in 1875--150  years ago--almost 150 years ago, 145 years ago.  [[Page S238]]    And so he argued after the Civil War that our Black Americans were  being discriminated against and it needed to end; that anyone should go  into any public accommodation and be treated equally here in the United  States of America--a Constitution that says: All men--and let's include  women--are created equally.   So he put forward this bill, and it said that every person gets equal  access to theaters, to public schools, to churches, to cemeteries,  equal opportunity to serve in jury duty, and that any suits brought in  this regard would be tried in Federal court, not State court, so we  could enforce a Federal standard of nondiscrimination across this land.   Sumner died of a heart attack in 1874. He had put forward this  originally as an amendment--actually, an introduction in 1870, as a  bill. He died before it could be passed. As he was dying, he pleaded  with Frederick Douglass and others at his bedside: You must take care  of my civil rights bill.    In the months following his death, the Senate did act, and they  supported that bill, and it was passed into law in 1875. At that  moment, it would be hard to envision that, after I was born, we would  still be fighting for equal access to public accommodations. The Senate  passed that bill and made it into law in 1875. But the Supreme Court of  the United States struck down that law 8 years later. Boom--equal  access in America supported by the elected Representatives in the House  and the Senate was blown to smithereens by a Supreme Court of the  United States of America.   Well, that did set the stage for another civil rights battle, and it  was 1890. It was after Benjamin Harrison's successful Presidential  campaign, in which he promised election reform and election integrity  because, you see, anyone looking at our Republic would know that we are  all affected, no matter what State we come from, by the integrity of  the elections in the other States. There has to be integrity in all of  them for this U.S. Senate to have integrity. There has to be integrity  in all of the State elections for that House of Representatives down  the hall to have integrity.   So Benjamin Harrison was elected campaigning on this type of reform.  And there was a Senator, Senator George Hoar, who championed amendments  or an attempt to bolster national protections for Federal elections. It  was particularly targeted at stopping voter suppression that had really  arisen in the southern part of the United States following the Civil  War. So this bill, known commonly as the Lodge bill, also known as the  federal elections bill, passed the House of Representatives in 1890.   What did this bill do? It allowed citizens from any district to  petition a Federal circuit court to appoint Federal supervisors for  congressional elections in case of efforts to suppress the vote by  local officials. It permitted the Federal Government to appoint  supervisors to oversee all phases of Federal elections, including voter  registration and the certification of the election results to make sure  there were no shenanigans at the State level that would corrupt the  core vision of equal representation, the core foundation of integrity  of elections. It is the foundation of the vision of the legitimacy and  the production of government of, by, and for the people.   And this bill even enabled Federal election supervisors to request  deputy U.S. marshals, as necessary, to protect the ballot box for every  citizen to have access. It passed the House of Representatives, and it  came here to the Senate, and it failed because they couldn't get  unanimous consent to close debate. At that time, there was no cloture  motion.   The Senators, in 1805, had gotten rid of the prior question rule,  which would have allowed debate to be closed because they had a social  contract. That social contract was that we listen to everyone to get  their perspectives. People can speak, not once, but twice on a  question. They can speak for as long we wanted to listen to everyone  and then we take a vote. That was the social contract.   But this filibuster broke that social contract because everyone was  listened to, but you couldn't get unanimous consent to close debate and  so the bill died. It had the support of the people of the United States  of America through their elected representatives down the hall. It had  the support of this Senate to protect the fundamental right to vote in  our Nation by the majority of this body here in the U.S. Senate. But  the social contract was broken to block Black Americans from voting; to  allow States and local election officials to rig the registration  system so you could never sign up; to allow intimidators to gather at  the polls to keep Black Americans from getting through them to put  their ballot in the box.   I would like to say that all traces of inequality in voting are gone  from America. I would like to say that. And, indeed, that was  reasonably true--reasonably true--through the recent years, before the  Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, because any changes in your  voting rules had to be preapproved in States that engaged in these  intimidating practice. I say ``reasonably true'' because the real fact  is there was still a significant blemish in our elections, and that is,  on election day, in certain States and certain precincts, there was a  game being played to make it harder for some citizens to vote than  other citizens to vote.   The game worked like this: If you have an area where you want low  turnout, you proceed to create a big precinct so that there are a lot  of people who have to go to that one place to vote. And if you have a  desire to encourage the people in another precinct to vote, a White  precinct, you create smaller precincts so the voting line won't be as  long.   And then there were other tricks like, for example, understaffing the  voting precinct where it is predominantly Black Americans to make it  harder for them to vote and making sure you staff really well the  precinct where you want the White Americans to vote.   And there were other tricks, as well. For example, relocating the  voting location in the Black precinct so that people go to the wrong  place, or putting it where parking is virtually impossible so it is  much harder to get to the poll, or putting out false information about  the date and the location of the voting.   These things are all wrong. Voter suppression exists today. And it  was powerful to see how a couple tools have greatly reduced those  tricks and traps.   One of those tools is early voting. If you have an early voting  period, it is hard to create long lines. It is hard to sustain wrong  information about where to go. It is very difficult to deny people the  ability to vote simply by having too few staffers.   Even more so, vote-by-mail is powerful. Now, we have Republican  States like Utah that have vote-by-mail, and they love it. And it  elects Republicans. You have more blue States like Oregon that have  vote-by-mail, and they love it. That is my home State.   I was really struck, when I was first running for the Oregon State  Legislature--it was 1998, and we still voted at the precincts' voting  polls, except the Republican Party had said: We can increase turnout if  we get all the Republicans to sign up for absentee ballots. So they got  a high percentage of Republicans to sign up for absentee ballots. Then  the Democrats said: Well, OK, yes, we can get Democrats to sign up for  absentee ballots. So 50 percent of the electorate in 1998 in Oregon was  voting by mail and 50 percent, polls.   As I went door to door in my first race for the Oregon House and  asked people what they liked and didn't like, they normally said: What  I really hate is that we have too many potholes, and I am not happy  with city hall. What I really like is my absentee ballot.   I would say: Well, why is that?   They would say: Well, you know, I don't have to worry about where to  park, and I don't have to worry about long lines. Do you know what  else? It is a complicated set of issues under the initiative system we  have in Oregon, and I can be able to sit at my table, study them,  discuss them with my spouse, and have my children come to the table and  see what we are doing.   Well, these two tools really opened the doors to the election process  in the last election, and the response of my Republican colleagues was:  Oh, no, we can't let that happen. We don't want those people to vote.  We better rein in vote-by-mail. We better rein in voter registration.   Georgia got rid of voter registration in between the main election  and the  [[Page S239]]  runoff because 70,000-plus Georgians registered in that period, and  they think it helped Democrats more than Republicans. So, in a  prejudicial way, they said: Let's make registration harder.   Well, it is not acceptable in our country to erect barriers for  targeted communities--not for Black Americans, not for Hispanic  Americans, not for college students, not for young voters, and not for  Native American reservations--not for anyone.   But why are those groups being targeted in a surgical way by the  strategies in State after State after State with Republican  legislatures and Republican Governors? Because those constituencies  tend to vote more often for Democrats than Republicans. So they are  stealing the vote of millions of Americans. They are corrupting the  election process for millions of Americans.   We stand here today in the Senate with the same issue we were  debating in 1890 and 1891. The House had set national standards so  every American could vote, and the Senate would not give unanimous  consent to get to a final vote and contributed to eight-plus decades of  discrimination in our country, of corrupted elections in our country-- until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   I see a colleague here preparing to speak, and I haven't even begun  my real speech yet. I am going to close to hand the floor to him, my  colleague from Maryland, but let me summarize a couple points before I  do so.   I believe the Senate is far better off when the minority has the  power to slow things down. I think that is value, to be able to have  leverage to get amendments; to be able to negotiate a compromise; to be  able to make sure a technical bill has been examined by experts and you  understand what it really does; to make sure we have seen all the  provisions; to make sure the public has seen all the provisions; to  make sure the press has been able to investigate the provisions. All of  that is incredibly positive, and it is why, whether I have been in the  minority or been in the majority, I have argued we need to sustain 60  votes to close debate, and I still hold that position now--60 votes to  close debate by a vote.   There have traditionally been four ways that a debate on the floor  comes to a conclusion.   The first is a break in the debate. At that point, I was struck when  I asked the experts ``Is the Chair allowed to call the question?'' and  I was told that not only can they call the question, they have a  responsibility to call the question when there is a break in the  debate. So a break in the debate is one.   The second is by unanimous consent. Everyone agrees we have been at  this long enough. Let's do four more amendments and then go to final  passage, and there is a unanimous consent agreement to do that. We  still do that quite often.   The third is to have a vote on closing debate, and we have to get 60  votes. It is not a ratio of those who show up to vote. So the irony is,  those who want a debate often don't show up. You can have a vote 59 to  5, and the 59 lose. You have to get 60 votes.   The fourth is rule XIX, which says every Senator gets to speak twice.  Now, as far as I am aware, there has never been a debate in the U.S.  Senate that was finally brought to a close by everyone using up their  two speeches, but it always hovers there, saying there is an eventual  ability to vote on the question.   These are the four traditional strategies. We need to apply those  four strategies to a period of debate addressing final passage of the  bill. The cloture motion would still be there. The possibility of a UC  would still be there. A break in the debate would still be a break in  the debate, and a UC would be a UC. All four tools would still be  there, but we would be addressing final passage.    The problem we have--a little kind of behind-the-scenes complexity of  Senate rules--is that in the modern Senate, there is always a pending  amendment. So you can't actually get to final passage unless you have a  period of debate dedicated to final passage, and breaking the debate  would call the question on the amendment, not final passage.   This means that those who want more debate could hold the floor for  weeks and weeks on something they are determined to keep presenting to  the American public, but it brings in the public. It brings in the  public. They can weigh in on whether we are heroes or whether we are  bums. They can weigh in on amendments we say we are going to bring up  the next day. They can help us understand how folks back home feel.   There is no public in the no-show, no-effort, invisible filibuster we  have had since 1975. There is no public, and there are no amendments  because amendments require a supermajority to close debate. Someone  says: Well, I am not going to agree to that until my amendment gets up.  There is no longer a social contract: You do your amendment. I will do  my amendment. We will all do them. They will be on topic.   It is gone. So the number of amendments has dropped tenfold between  the 109th Congress and the 116th Congress. The number of amendments  dropped more than tenfold over that time period. Instead, the floor  managers negotiate. The leaders negotiate. They produce a list and then  ask everyone to agree to that list, and someone objects: You left out  my amendment.   So we--a room full of former House Members and industry leaders,  former Governors, former speakers of their State house or presidents of  their State senate; all of this talent sitting around here--do nothing  day after day after day while the invisible, no-show, no-effort  filibuster destroys debate in the Senate of the United States of  America.   It is our responsibility to restore debate in this Chamber, to  restore amendments. The advantages of the restoration are, No. 1, that  you have amendments; No. 2, that you have public debate; and No. 3,  perhaps the most important, you have an incentive for both sides to  negotiate, because under the no-show, no-effort, invisible filibuster  that we have had since 1975, the minority of either side says: You  know, if I can get 41 of our minority Members to agree not to close  debate, and all they have to do is not even show up to vote or show up  to vote if they like but vote no, then the majority can never get  anything done, and won't that enhance our political power in the  minority party?   That is an almost irresistible temptation in the tribal, partisan  warfare of today. So each minority is tempted into basically exercising  a veto over the majority party's policy agenda. That is ``an eye for an  eye makes the whole world blind,'' strategy. The Democrats sabotage the  Republican majority. The Republicans sabotage the Democratic majority.  But under the public filibuster, not only is the public involved, but  the minority has to maintain continuous debate, which can be hard, so  they have an incentive to negotiate. The majority, seeing the time  burned up that they need for other things, other policy bills and  nominations, they have an incentive to negotiate. So you get  amendments. You get the public involved. Most important, you recreate  an incentive to negotiate. That is the reinvigorated filibuster  strategy, the talking filibuster.   Call it the public filibuster or just call it extended debate on  final passage of the bill. Whatever you call it, it is better than the  paralysis and partisanship that are destroying the Senate's ability to  address the questions that face this Nation, and there is no more  important question than defending the right of every citizen to vote.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, voting rights are really at the heart  of our ``We the People'' Constitution.   I will tell you, every time I look at a printed copy of the  Constitution and I see those three words in supersize font, ``We the  People,'' I think, you know, it is a beautiful thing that our Founders,  when they were writing the Constitution, reminded us of the heart of  what it is all about: not power that flows down from Kings or dictators  but power that flows up from the people of the United States.   And how does that power flow? It flows through elections. So if you  don't have integrity in the elections, then, you really don't have  government of, by, and for the people.   Now, over the course of our Nation, we know that we have worked to  expand the vision the Nation was founded on, but it wasn't reached in  the beginning. It was often the case that only White Protestant male  landowners got to vote in the beginning.   And we recognized that every person created equal needs to have an  equal  [[Page S263]]  part of the franchise, and so we have, through battles over more than  200 years, fixed those challenges. And there have been some dramatic  debates over this, and it hasn't been easy.   But I want to take us back specifically to the debate of 1890-1891.  Now, this was during a period when, in the Southern States, more and  more clever strategies were being developed to prevent people from  voting, either through the registration process or through the polling  process.   Now, in the registration process, there would be things like: Explain  what this letter of the Constitution means or how many beans are in  this jar of jelly beans or other ridiculous questions, to which those  at the registrar's office could say: We are sorry. You can't register.   And if you got registered, then you would have actually the  possibility of intimidation at the polling place. There was one case  where men on horseback formed a circle around the ballot box so,  essentially, a Black American couldn't get to the ballot box, but for a  White American, the horses would part and let them vote--voter  intimidation.   Well, those crude barriers are part of history. They are in the  dustbin. Great. But, unfortunately, there are many modern strategies  designed to get to the same result, strategies to make it hard to  register to vote. Sometimes it is very prejudicial ID requirements or  multiple ID requirements designed to fit the profile that members of  one party are more likely to have than members of another party to bias  the outcome.   Sometimes it is taking and saying: We are going to be able to have a  private contractor purge the voting rolls of people who haven't voted  in the last few elections--knowing that it is being done specifically  because the members of one party are a little worse at turning out  every single election than the members of the other party.   Now, these strategies on registration are at one stage, and then  there are the strategies at the polling place, all designed to  undermine ``We the People.'' And they are mostly election-day  strategies.   What are those strategies? Well, take a--have a really large precinct  with a single voting location in places you don't want people to vote  because so many people have to get into that precinct voting place that  there will be a long line or understaff it so the movement through the  polling place is slow or put in machines that don't work really well or  put it in a location where there is no parking, which makes it really  hard for people to get to the polls.   You might think that these strategies don't still exist, but I am  sorry to report to you they absolutely do exist.   A member of our caucus today, Cory Booker, was noting that, across  America, the average wait time for Black Americans is twice as long as  the average wait time for White Americans. But in Georgia--in Georgia-- in the last election, the average wait time was, by numbers that I  have, 5 times as long or, excuse me, 10 times as long: about 5 minutes  in a predominantly White precinct, 80 percent-plus White, and about 50  minutes in a predominantly Black precinct--about 10 times as long.   So along comes a couple strategies to really enable people to vote  without that type of intimidation. One is vote-by-mail, and one is  early voting.   Now, my State of Oregon is quite proud of being the first vote-by- mail State. So let's talk about that for a moment. Back in the 1990s,  the Republican Party said: You know, we have noticed that people who  have requested absentee ballots have a higher turnout rate than those  who vote on election day.   It makes sense because they receive the ballot in the mail and have  plenty of opportunity to fill it out, mail it in; whereas, on election  day, well, life happens: You were planning to vote, but you had to go  pick up your child from daycare. You were planning to vote, but your  boss asked you to work late. You were planning to vote, but you went by  the polling place, and it had been moved from the previous 2 years-- another trick--and you didn't know where it was. You went by the  polling place, but you saw a long line, and you knew you didn't have 3  hours to stand in that line.   So the Republicans in my State said: You know what, we will have an  advantage if we get all the Republicans--or as many as we can--to ask  for absentee ballots. And so they did. Then the Democrats said: That is  pretty smart. We will do the same thing.   So the first year I was running for the State house of  representatives, 50 percent of the people in the State were voting by  mail by getting on a list to ask for an absentee ballot.   So everyone said: This is such a good idea; why don't we do this for  everybody and not make people request absentee ballots. So in the next  election, which was the 2020 election, essentially, it was all vote-by- mail. And people loved it.   I found out going door-to-door--I always kind of had a nostalgic  point in my heart for election day when we all go to the polls  together. And I would go door-to-door in my first campaign in 1988, and  I would say: What do you like or what do you not like? And people would  generally say: The thing that I am really frustrated about--and it  would be some issue for transportation. It would be some problem,  including just simply the potholes in the street.   And I would say: Well, that is a city issue, but I am running for the  State legislature. But maybe the State can help get more money to the  municipality. But what do you like?   Oh, we love voting by mail because we can sit at the kitchen table  and talk over the issues. We are not trying to make decisions in the  heat of the moment in a voting booth.   We have complicated ballot measures in my State.   We can read through the pros and cons. And--you know what--we can  invite our children to the kitchen table and discuss it with them.   They really loved vote-by-mail, and we went to that system. But it  wasn't something driven by Ds or Rs. In fact, Republicans controlled  the house and senate of the legislature in the State of Oregon at that  time. They controlled both chambers.   Utah went to vote-by-mail. Utah is a reliably Republican State.  Again, it wasn't to advantage one party or the other; it was to ensure  that the franchise is available for every single American and that  there are no shenanigans on election day. And shouldn't that be what we  are all about? Because if you really want to look at where voting is  compromised, where essentially votes are stolen from our citizens, it  is the shenanigans on election day, which means vote-by-mail and early  voting are very important to address that.   So what do we see now in some 19 States across our country? In those  19 States, there are strategies being implemented to make it harder to  register and easier to purge the registration lists. There are  strategies to make it harder to vote by mail, including saying: There  will be no permanent vote-by-mail list; you have to sign up every  single time. There are strategies to limit and curtail early voting.   Every State is a little different, but those 19 States that are  passing laws, those laws are targeted with strategies specifically  focused on things that they think will hurt the turnout of Democrats  rather than Republicans, and it is just wrong. We need to be blind to  party divisions when we are protecting the ballot box for all  Americans. We need to be blind to race.   Now, folks say: Surely, there is still not a racial component in this  effort to keep people from voting. And I would like to affirm that that  is the case, but these strategies often target predominantly precincts  that are high minority populations: Hispanic or Black precincts.    And other strategies target the young and college students. Why?  Because they tend to vote a little bit more to the Democratic side of  the ballot.   And some of these are targeted specifically at Native American  reservations to make it so those on reservations have to drive an hour  to 2 hours to drop off their ballot, and they won't vote in the same  numbers as if you have a voting location on the reservation or they can  vote by mail.   So we have struggled. Going back to the debate of 1890, down the hall  in the House of Representatives, the conversation was initiated by  Henry Cabot Lodge, and Lodge put forward a voting rights bill that  said: You know what, things are going wrong in America, and we need to  protect the right to register, the right to vote, and the right to  [[Page S264]]  have those ballots fairly counted. So he basically said that  jurisdictions could appeal to the district courts to get Federal  supervision on the three critical stages of registering citizens, of  conducting the election, and of counting the ballots afterward--those  three phases. And it passed in the House of Representatives.   And at that time, it was the Republican Party that backed this  fundamental right for all Americans. You know how many Democrats voted  for Henry Cabot Lodge's bill? Zero. Zero. Every vote for it came from  the Republican Party. That was the Republican Party in 1890.   In 1891, the bill was here in the Senate. Well, what happened in the  Senate? Well, a group of Senators said: We don't want the Senate to  ever vote on this bill. So they spoke at length, refused to give  unanimous consent to get to a final vote.   Now, why do we call that a filibuster? So, at our founding, the whole  vision that our Founders laid out was that you hear everyone speak, and  then you vote and you take the path the majority favors over the  minority.   Now, they really emphasized--this is important--that you shouldn't  have a supermajority because they wrote the Constitution while they  were under the Confederation Congress. The Confederation Congress had a  supermajority. And because of that supermajority, they couldn't get  anything done. They couldn't raise the money to take on Shays'  Rebellion. The Senate was paralyzed over policymaking.   So the Founders said: Whatever you do, do not have a supermajority  because it paralyzes the body, and the body ends up taking the path the  minority prefers, who are obstructing a final vote, rather than the  majority.   Let's just look at some of the comments that our Founders made. James  Madison:         In cases where justice or the general good might require       new laws . . . or [new] measures . . . the . . . principle of       free government would be reversed.    He is speaking to a supermajority because it would no longer be the  majority that would decide; it would be transferred to the minority.  And he went on to say the damage that would be done if that happened:  The basic principle of free government would be assaulted if the  minority makes the decision instead of the majority.   What possible logic could there be to say the path that most people  think is the wrong path is the path we will take? That is what happens  when the supermajority blocks a final simple majority vote.   And we have Hamilton. Of course, Hamilton gets a lot of attention  with the play done on Hamilton and his general supersized role in the  early stage of our Republic.   Again, Hamilton was very aware of how the Confederation Congress was  polarized before we got our Constitution in 1787. He, again, refers to  the supermajority: It would be, in practice, as if you need everybody;  and the history of any establishment that takes this principle is the  result of impotence, perplexity, and disorder. He is referring to the  supermajority requirement of the Confederation Congress.   What else did he say? Well, Hamilton said--and he uses some language  we don't really use today: ``If a pertinacious minority can control the  majority . . . tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue;  contemptible compromises of the public good.''   I sometimes think that sounds like a description of the Senate  today--tedious delays, intrigue, contemptible compromises of the public  good. The public good is compromised when the Senate is not able to  debate issues that face the United States of America.   He went on to say: ``The supermajority's real operation is to  embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the  government.''   ``Destroy the energy of the government''? Doesn't that ring somewhat  true of what we have gone through in trying to get to a vote on Build  Back Better over this last year, any components of it, and trying to  get a vote to protect our fundamental right and freedom to vote? And it  has gone on all year. We are a year into the administration now.   So in modern times, we now are facing, again, what was faced in 1890.  And I didn't really tell you the outcome of that 1890 debate. The House  passed it. All Republicans came over here, and a number of Senators  said: We are not going to give consent to get to a final vote.   They broke the contract--the social contract that you listen to  everybody, and then, having heard all the ideas, having had a debate  that maybe stretched many, many days or maybe weeks, you vote.   So the newspapers started to call this tactic, way back in the mid- 1800s--they called this tactic--``piracy,'' because the core principle  was being violated by people taking over the Senate--pirates taking  over the Senate. And the common term for pirates, ``freebooters''-- freebooters, that is where ``filibuster'' comes from. It is a  corruption of the term ``freebooter.''   The pirates are taking over. They are breaking the deal of America.  They are breaking the design of the Senate. It is supposed to be that  after you listen to everyone--everyone has made their points--you vote  by simple majority.   Now, we have had a particular development over the last three decades  in which the Senate has become more and more dysfunctional. I had the  chance to see this evolve because I first came here as an intern in  1976. And up in the staff Gallery, I would go up and watch each  amendment being debated.   And there was no television. So Senators couldn't see what was going  on. Staff back in the offices couldn't see what was going on. There was  no cell phone. There was no fax machine. And so each Senator had a  staff member watching the debate. And then when the vote came, you  would rush down to those elevators that are outside that door. And when  the Senators came up from the subway train that comes over from the  office buildings, you would meet your Senator, and you would describe  the debate that had happened. And if it was your particular topic area,  you would describe what people back home were saying or what you had  understood was the key question. And then the Senator would come in and  vote.   And then, when the vote was tallied, there would be 6 or 12 Senators,  generally clustered here, and they would all say ``Mr. President,''  because whomever got called on first got the next amendment. There was  no set of amendments lined up on the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which is  what I was staffing for Senator Hatfield.   I was very intrigued by the functioning of our government. So I went  back to college and then dropped out 3 months later to come back here  for the start of the Carter administration to watch what was going on  in our government with a new Presidency. I waited tables. I volunteered  for nonprofits. I went door to door for the Virginia Consumer Congress,  working on issues related to renewable energy or energy efficiency. But  I watched the Senate, and what I saw was a Senate that could debate  issues in that year of 1977.   Then I came back here after graduate school, and I was planning to go  overseas to work on issues of economic development in very poor  countries--fundamental issues of healthcare, fundamental issues of  education. But I was offered an opportunity to work on something here  in DC as a Presidential fellow, to work on the issue of ``How do you  decrease the threat of blowing up the world with nuclear weapons?''   So I went to work for the Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger,  under President Reagan. Then I went to work for the Congressional  Budget Office, after 2 years of working for President Reagan and Caspar  Weinberger. The Congressional Budget Office works for Congress, and I  did studies and did briefings here on the Hill, watching the Senate.  And the Senate started to have troubles, but it was still pretty  functional.   Nothing prepared me for arriving here as a U.S. Senator in 2009,  January, and seeing the utter decay and dysfunction of my beloved  Senate--your beloved Senate, the Senate once called the greatest  deliberative body in the world.   So I started to have conversations with colleagues about what had  happened, and I saw that we had cloture motions--that is a motion to  close debate--one after the other after the other and very few  amendments.   Now, on the amendment side, this is a chart that shows the decline in  amendments from the 109th Congress to the 116th. The 116th Congress is  the  [[Page S265]]  one that just ended. There is a tenfold reduction in the number of  amendments over those 14 years--a tenfold reduction in amendments, a  steady line downwards.   Well, that is one symptom of the problem, but then there was another  piece of this problem, which was more and more motions to close debate.  And those motions are designed to be rare. So they take--after you make  the motion--a day plus. You have to have an intervening day, and then  the second day after you make the motion, you can hold a vote on  closing debate, because it is supposed to be such a rare moment, once  or twice a year.   Then, if you succeed in getting the votes to close debate, it is 30  hours of debate. Well, that takes 2 or 3 days to get 30 hours of debate  in and then an extra hour for any Senator who didn't have the chance to  speak. So there is that factor. And then, finally, you can get to the  final vote.   Those cloture motions eat up entire weeks. So you come in, and, on  Monday, you file a motion to close debate. On Wednesday, you vote on  actually closing debate because you have to have that intervening day  of Tuesday. Then you have 30 hours, which takes the time up of the  normal day of Wednesday and Thursday, and maybe on Friday you get to  vote.   That is what I am saying: Every cloture motion takes up a week. Well,  the Senate is normally only here 30 to 40 weeks a year. So if you have  30 or 40 cloture motions, you have essentially taken up all the  Senate's time. But the Senate has an incredibly complex, extensive  agenda. It needs to address so many issues in healthcare and housing  and education, good-paying jobs, the environment. How do you take on  climate? How do you take on international trade? How do you take on  human rights in foreign countries like China, which are conducting  genocide? So many issues around the world, plus it has so many  nominations that have to be addressed.   I am told--I haven't double-checked this yet--that there were four  Cabinet positions that required confirmation in the first Congress-- four. Then you had Ambassadors, and you had judges. But you had a  pretty small number of nominations in those positions. Now, we have  well over a thousand positions--well over a thousand--and we have a  nomination process in which people are nominated to have a higher rank  in the military or advancement to certain ranks in the civil service.  And so you have extensive lists that need to go through as well.   So let's take a look at what happened with the growth of cloture  motions. This is the history going back to 1910. We actually only had  cloture starting in 1917. And, in 1917, you see that there were very  few cloture motions in a decade--3 in a decade, 10 in a decade, 5 in a  decade, 8 in a decade, 3 in a decade--less than 1 per year.    Well, that intervening day kind of made sense because they were less  than one time per year. It was supposed to be a rare moment in which  you would address the fact that some Senators were not going to let the  Senate proceed as our Founders envisioned, which was, after hearing  everybody, to conduct a vote.   Then you start to see in the 1970s a big change. I think we have a  chart that shows it year by year. We don't. Well, this will give you  some sense of it. So we have--divided by 10, since these are by  decade--we had growth in the 1980s to more than 20 per year; a growth  in the 1990s to more than--well, an average of 35 to 36 a year. In the  2000s, an average of 45 per year. In the 2010 decade, an average of  over 100 per year, taking up an entire week of the Senate's time.   So how did this unfold? Well, let's think a little bit about the fact  that that filibuster that occurred in 1891 was about blocking Black  Americans from having power--the power to vote--because if you have the  power to vote, you have the power to weigh in. That means you have a  lot of power in our society. So there was a deep determination to keep  Black Americans from voting.   That was the filibuster of 1891. And its failure in the Senate-- remember, it passed by a majority in the House, and it had majority  support in the Senate, but the filibuster was used to crush this.   Now, that process meant that, from 1891 through 1965, when we passed  voting rights in this Chamber, the filibuster was used for one thing:  crushing the political rights of Black Americans.   Now, someone will say: Well, that is not quite right. There was an  episode in 1917 in which the issue wasn't civil rights or voting  rights. The issue was whether to arm our commercial ships against  potential attacks by the Germans.   And that is partly true.   In March of that year, 1917, we weren't yet in the war, World War I.  And there was a group of Senators who said: If we arm these ships and  they deployed depth charges against German submarines or so forth, we  are going to be in the war, and we will not have had a declaration of  war. We will be pulled into the war by essentially this process of  arming ships.   So they spoke at length during the last week of Congress, and time  ran out, and the bill died. And the next week, the new Congress  started. This is back when the transition happened in March. And the  new Congress immediately said: We can close debate with 67 votes or  two-thirds of the Senate. Actually, it was two-thirds; we didn't have  100 Senators here--two-thirds of the Senate, showing up to vote and  close debate. So that was the first time that we had a motion to close  debate since 1805.   And the reason I say it is since 1805, is that our original rules had  a motion called the previous question. And on the previous question,  there is a little bit of uncertainty of exactly how it was used. It  sometimes said that, basically, you got to speed things up so we can  get to the final vote. Other times, it has been interpreted as ``No,  the previous question means we vote; we vote on the question before  us.'' But it was never actually used, and it wasn't used because there  was a social contract.   The Senate said: We can listen to everybody, and, then, having heard  everybody, we can vote.   Fair enough. Fair deal. Square deal.   So in 1805, when Aaron Burr was in charge of rewriting the rule book,  he said: We don't use this rule. We don't need this rule. We have a  social contract. We listen to everybody and then have a simple majority  vote, as our Founders designed the Senate. No need.   So we hadn't had a rule that essentially enabled this body to come to  a vote in that period from 1805 through 1917. So it is true that the  bill was delayed for 1 week. But the new Congress immediately came in,  created a new rule to close debate, closed debate on that bill, and  passed a bill to arm ships. So the only real thing that was crushed in  those years from 1891 through 1965 was voting rights for Black  Americans because the idea that you would prevent a simple majority  vote, as our Founders intended, was piracy.    Well, in 1965, we passed voting rights, and the national consensus  was we are putting that behind us; we are putting the discrimination  behind us; we are putting the manipulation on election day behind us.  We are going to have a fair opportunity for everybody to vote in this  country. So the filibuster lost some of its taint because it was no  longer primarily an instrument to crush the political rights of Black  Americans.   People started saying: You know, maybe I can use this on something  other than civil rights or something other than voting rights.   By the way, it had been used almost entirely on final passage of  bills.   Maybe I can use it on nominations, to prevent nominations from going  through expeditiously. Maybe I can use it on amendments. Maybe I can  use it on motions to proceed.   Let's take a look at the issue of amendments. Prior to the sixties,  one time, there had been a cloture motion on an amendment.   You know that vision that I saw in 1976 where one amendment was  debated, and then when it was done, there were no pending amendments,  so the next person would say: ``Wait''--they would always say ``Mr.  President'' because there was always a man in the Chair at that point;  I am now glad to say ``Madam President''--``Madam President,'' and  whoever got heard first would put up the next amendment.   Well, that world started to change along the way. People started to  obstruct not just final passage but obstruct amendments. There has been  [[Page S266]]  steady growth in that over time. We are now up, in the last decade, to  about 14 times per year or 143 times in the decade.   Then we have the question of the motion to proceed. You would think-- we have a legislative calendar, and that calendar has a list of bills  eligible to consider. Someone says: I want to make a motion--normally  the majority leader--to go to a particular item, a particular bill on  that calendar. You would think that it would be like ``Hey, we are  going to go to the election bill. Do I have majority support to do  that?'' You would have a 15-minute debate and vote. You decide to go to  that bill or not.   Why would you take up a lot of the Senate's precious time debating  whether to debate a bill? But that logic has not prevailed, so we have  a continuous increase in the attack on the ability to get a bill to the  floor. Well, in the sixties, about one per year; in the seventies,  about one per year; four times per year in the eighties; more than 10  in the nineties--it escalates.   Here is the thing: To get a bill to the floor, if a group is intent  on forcing a cloture motion, you have to have a motion, an intervening  day, 30 hours of debate, and then you have to be able to have an  additional hour for any Senator who wasn't able to speak in those 30  hours. In other words, it takes an entire week to decide whether to  actually debate a bill. That is absolutely insane.   If you want the U.S. Senate to be unable to address issues, then  allow unlimited debate until there is a cloture motion on the motion to  proceed. I think most Senators agree that that should go. But here is  the problem: Whichever party is in the minority doesn't want to make  things easier for the majority. And this really goes to a core  challenge of our highly tribal parties.   In the Senate that I first saw, the philosophies of the two parties-- if you were doing a bell curve of each party, they overlapped. They  overlapped a lot. There were Republicans who voted more like Democrats  and Democrats who voted more like Republicans. There was a lot more,  therefore, bipartisan work. Now, if you do those same two bell curves  on how people vote, there is a chasm. If you do a bell curve where the  Democrats are and a bell curve where the Republicans are, there is a  deep valley, a chasm in the middle.   We have become more intensely tribal in ways that are absolutely  reinforced by social media, all those commentaries on various  Instagrams or a tweet reinforcing the idea that the other side is evil,  that the two sides are far apart, which leads the minority in this  Chamber to say: Since the other side is evil, we will just prevent them  from ever getting to a bill. If 41 of us--and right now, there are 50  desks on this side of the aisle, and there are 50 desks on that side of  the aisle--if 41 of us proceed to say we will not vote to close debate  on a motion to proceed, you can never get to a bill.   We have had that happen multiple times this year in which my  Republican colleagues voted to prevent us from debating voting rights,  the protection of voting rights. What a change from 1890, when, in the  House of Representatives, every vote cast for the bill to defend the  right to vote in America was a Republican vote. Now, every vote against  debating the issue has come from the Republicans. What a swap over the  time period.    This, essentially, is a strategy to kill bills in the cradle before  they are debated on this floor.   Both caucuses, by the way, have done this. When I speak of voting  rights, it is now my colleagues across the aisle who are deliberately  blocking it from being debated time and again, but on other issues and  when the Democrats have been in the minority, we have done the same  thing. It needs to end.   You know, I had conversations with a whole group of Republicans last  year saying: Next year, we have no idea who will be in the majority. We  have no idea. So let's just have 1 hour at most, evenly divided, to  discuss whether a bill comes to the floor, and then we will vote.  Instead of an intervening day and 30 hours, plus extra hours if you  didn't get to debate, you have 1 hour evenly divided. If one side  yields back its time, that means in 30 minutes, we can then decide to  get on the bill or not.   Thirty hours, an intervening day, or 30 minutes. That makes a lot  more sense. We have to end this.   I have had this conversation with nine of my colleagues across the  aisle and said: Let's do this. Let's fix the motion to proceed and  guarantee germane amendments on the floor.   They were interested. Some said they would go and take it to their  policy team, some said they would take it to their caucus, and some  said they would take it to their leadership. Then they all said  ``Sorry'' because their leadership said ``No way are we going to have  kind of the ordinary Senators who aren't in leadership have a movement  to fix the Senate.''   Mitch McConnell told them: No. We will make changes depending on what  is best for our caucus. And if we are in the majority, that is  different than if we are in the minority.   So those efforts failed, and people keep saying to me: Hey, wouldn't  it work if you draw up rules and implement them with the next Congress?   Well, we have tried that. My colleague Tom Udall, who is now our  Ambassador to New Zealand, was there, coming in with my class in 2009.  He had followed this as well. So we teamed up, and we worked on these  conversations, but ultimately we couldn't make it happen.   We need to fix the Senate. We need to guarantee germane amendments.  When I say ``germane amendments,'' I mean amendments that are on the  topic.   When I was staffing that tax bill for Senator Hatfield, every  amendment was on taxes. Should we proceed to increase or rein in the  tax credit that goes--or the tax deduction that goes to deducting the  cost of your home office if you are a teacher in our public schools? It  was one I heard in a lot of letters. There were a ton of letters from  teachers in Oregon about that.   I remember that another amendment was on employee stock ownership  plans, which enable you to be able to enable your workers to own a  share of the company. How do we make those ESOPs work better? and so on  and so forth, one tax issue after another--nothing to do with highly  polarizing social issues on a tax bill because people knew that when  another bill came on healthcare, they could put healthcare issues on  that. When one came on transportation, they could put their  transportation amendments on it.   Now the assumption is, hey, if there is a bill that is going to pass,  we better throw in every idea we ever had because that is like the only  bill that will get through the Senate. The result is these massively  thick bills, which are an insult to democracy because in a 1,000- or a  2,000-page bill, you are talking about thousands of ideas, of new laws,  of new ideas being embedded.   There is no way the citizens can hold us accountable when we are  voting on a bill that is yea thick. There are a bunch of things that  are good. There are a bunch of things that are bad. Plus, we can't even  figure out what some of them are before we have to vote because when  the deal is struck off the floor because we can't do amendments and  because there is no debate, well, we are stuck with a big bill being  delivered and described to us. That is not the way it should work. That  is not good for us. That is not good for the citizens.   Let's note that what is happening in those 19 States puts us at an  absolutely critical moment. You can think of democracy as a flickering  flame or a flame that has to be maintained and nurtured from one  generation to the next. Now, it is our challenge--our challenge-- because laws are being passed on registration, laws are being passed on  the process of voting, and laws are being passed on the process of  counting that are designed to manipulate the outcome, to basically  cheat Americans out of a fair election and, in many cases, cheat them  out of the opportunity to vote at all or if they can vote, not have  their vote fairly counted. So it is our responsibility to act.    I see my colleague from Massachusetts has come to the floor. I think  she is ready to speak.   I just want to sum up with this notion: The failure of this Senate to  act in 1891 led to three generations in which civil rights for Black  Americans were suppressed in our country. If we fail to act--if we fail  to act this year, 2022, and allow the authentic integrity of  elections--then we may see three generations in which we lose  government of, by, and for the people.  [[Page S267]]    You see, voting rights are the critical component because if those  who are elected break the laws or go off track, you throw them out  through fair elections, but if they go off track and there are no fair  elections, they increase their power.   You have to have fair elections to maintain government of, by, and  for the people. That is the reason we must act this week to pass the  John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act that are  before this Senate right now.   I yield to my colleague from the great State of Massachusetts.
