 Madam President, I rise today to support legislation  that would rename local post offices in California to honor the life  and legacy of two Californians.   The first bill, led by Congresswoman Katie Porter, would designate  the Northwood Post Office in Irvine, CA, as the ``Tuskegee Airman  Lieutenant Colonel Robert J. Friend Memorial Post Office Building.''   Lieutenant Colonel Friend was among the 355 pilots who served in the  all African-American unit known as the Tuskegee Airmen during World War  II. During his military career, Lieutenant Colonel Friend fought in 142  combat missions and served as an operations officer for both the 301st  Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group. He received various military  awards, such as the Distinguished Flying Cross, Presidential Unit  Citation, and Air Medal. In 2007, he was awarded the Congressional Gold  Medal, along with the rest of the Tuskegee Airmen.   After retiring from military service, Lieutenant Colonel Friend  worked on the development of missile systems and space station  components in Irvine, CA. He continued to participate in speaking and  educational engagements about his experience with the Tuskegee Airmen  into his 90s.   Lieutenant Colonel Friend died in 2019 in Long Beach, CA, at the age  of 99. He exemplified all that it is to be a public servant by devoting  his life to his country as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen and further  serving his country after his military career ended.   The second bill, led by Congressman   Mike Thompson, would designate  the Cotati Post Office in Cotati, CA, as the ``Arturo L. Ibleto Post  Office Building.''   Arturo L. Ibleto was an Italian-born immigrant and resistance fighter  in World War II before moving to Sonoma County. It was there that he  met his wife, and they built a successful Italian restaurant and  catering business. For nearly 50 years, Art was an institution in the  Sonoma County food and wine community, where he became known as the  ``Pasta King.''   Additionally, Art lent considerable time and resources to local  charitable, educational, and civic causes that left a lasting mark on  the community. He continued working full time until his passing in 2020  at the age of 94.   It is an honor for me to be able to speak on behalf of these two  bills to honor notable Californians and celebrate our rich history.   Both of these bills passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan  support, including the support of all 53 Members of the California  House Delegation as cosponsors. Both Senator Padilla and I urge our  colleagues to support quick passage of these bills.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the STREAM  Act (Support to Rehydrate the Environment, Agriculture and  Municipalities Act), which I am introducing today alongside my  cosponsors Senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema. This is a bill  intended to address the massive drought affecting much of the Western  United States.   As the past 2 years demonstrate all too painfully, drought  exacerbated by climate change--increasingly severe and prolonged  drought--is a stark reality for California and the West.   This has resulted in shortages of water for agriculture, for  irrigation, and increasingly threatens residential and business uses.  The drought has threatened endangered species and results in a drying  of the ground and plantlife that makes wildfire an even greater threat.   If we don't take action now, it is only going to get worse. Lawrence  Berkeley National Laboratory scientists project that climate change  will cause a 54-percent drop in the Sierras' snowpack within the next  20 to 40 years and a 79-percent drop by the end of the century. This  change alone could be devastating for California, because we absolutely  depend on this snowpack. The Sierra snowpack provides 30 percent of our  water supply and is our biggest reservoir.   For these reasons and others we need an ``all of the above'' water  strategy, including No. 1, increased water supply; No. 2, incentivizing  projects that build in environmental benefits and drinking water for  disadvantaged communities, and No. 3, investing in separate  environmental restoration efforts.   The bill I am introducing today helps meet this challenge in four  fundamental ways:   No. 1, it authorizes significant water supply funding that, in  combination with the bipartisan infrastructure law, would provide  California with 1.04 million additional acre-feet of water per year on  average, enough water for over 6 million people;   No. 2, it provides additional financial incentives for water supply  projects that include environmental benefits and drinking water for  disadvantaged communities;   No. 3, it reforms the Congressional review process to more quickly  approve water supply projects, and a new loan program combined with  grants to more cost-effectively fund new non-Federal water supply  projects; and   No. 4, it significantly invests not only in water supply projects but  also in environmental restoration to help imperiled species adapt to  climate change as well.   To demonstrate why this bill is so desperately needed, let me  illustrate the extent and damage caused by the current drought in the  West.   A precursor of the even more prolonged dry spells coming with climate  change, California's 2020 to 2022 drought has had severe impacts on  farms, cities, and the environment.   In 2021, the drought caused the California agriculture industry to  shrink by an estimated 8,745 jobs and incur $1.2 billion in direct  costs, according to a report prepared for the California Department of  Food and Agriculture by researchers at the University of California at  Merced. In addition, reduced water deliveries resulted in 395,000 acres  of cropland left dry and unplanted.   Counting ``spillover effects'' in the broader economy, the U.C.  Merced analysis found the total impacts were more than 14,600 lost  jobs, both full time and part time, and $1.7 billion in gross revenue  losses.   In both 2021 and 2022, homes in significant parts of the State have  been at risk of running dry. Last year, large parts of Marin and Sonoma  Counties and the Mendocino coast came very close to losing all water  supply. This year, much of Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Bernardino  Counties have been placed under emergency orders limiting them to once  a week landscape irrigation, with the possibility of a complete  irrigation shutoff by fall.  [[Page S2546]]    In California, one in eight acres statewide has burned from wildfires  in the last decade, with the past 2 years being the worst on record.  With 95 percent of the State experiencing drought as we enter into the  traditional wildfire season, we are poised for an even worse year this  year.   The drought has been devastating to the aquatic ecosystem as well as  our forests. As just one example, the endangered winter-run Chinook  salmon depend on sufficient cold water released by Shasta Dam to rear  juveniles in the Sacramento River.   With limited water available in 2021, NOAA Fisheries models predict  that approximately 75 percent of the winter run chinook salmon's eggs  died from elevated water temperatures. This is a species with three 1- year age classes, and a prolonged drought could threaten the survival  of the species.   In order to increase drought resiliency in California and other  Western States, the bill authorizes the following funding over the next  5 years: $750 million for surface and groundwater storage projects, and  supporting conveyance, including $50 million for natural water  retention and release projects; $300 million for water recycling  projects; $150 million for desalination projects; $250 million for  environmental restoration projects; $100 million for drinking water for  disadvantaged communities; and $150 million for low-interest loans for  water supply projects.   This funding builds on the bipartisan infrastructure law's funding of  $1.15 billion for storage projects, $550 million for water recycling  projects, and $250 million for desalination projects.   The STREAM Act, in combination with the bipartisan infrastructure  law, would provide California with the Federal cost-share for  approximately 1,042,000 acre-feet per year of additional water supply,  or enough water for over 6 million people. This comes from the  following:   Enough funding for California to finally build three major off-stream  storage projects providing 370,000 acre-feet of water on average each  year: Sites Reservoir, the Los Vaqueros Expansion, and the BF Sisk  raise. In addition, the storage funding could provide an additional  55,000 acre-feet per year from some combination of other smaller  surface and groundwater storage projects like the Sacramento Regional  Groundwater Bank or Del Puerto Canyon Reservoir. All of the projects  are non-Federal projects with a 25 percent Federal cost share, with the  exception of the Federal BF Sisk Raise with a 50 percent Federal cost- share.   Enough funding for 532,000 additional acre-feet from water recycling  projects, from the $300 million authorized in the bill plus $550  million in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, with a 25 percent  Federal cost-share for projects.   Enough funding for approximately 85,000 additional acre-feet from the  $150 million authorized in the bill for desalination projects, plus  $250 million in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, with a 25  percent Federal cost-share for projects.   While virtually everyone supports water recycling projects, surface  and groundwater storage projects are sometimes more controversial. I  want to point out a report just released today by the widely respected  Public Policy Institute of California, PPIC, which relates to the  benefits of additional surface and groundwater storage as California's  climate is changing.   Many climate forecasters emphasize that as climate change  intensifies, California will get more of its precipitation in a few  large to extraordinarily large storms fueled by atmospheric rivers, and  more of the precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow. In  between the bursts of atmospheric rivers, there will be longer and more  intense droughts. We have definitely seen a preview of this pattern  this year.   PPIC has studied these projections and estimated that there is  substantial water in wet years that is not needed to maintain healthy  Delta outflows but currently cannot be captured because California  lacks the infrastructure to store for future dry periods. PPIC suggests  that given this reality, cost-effective storage projects in appropriate  locations could help improve California's drought resiliency.   PPIC also argues that these storage projects should be managed for  environmental flow benefits as well as water supply benefits. This bill  would help with that because Federal funding for Sites Reservoir would  help provide cold water for salmon, and Federal funding for the  expansion of Los Vaqueros Reservoir would provide needed water for  wildlife refuges. Regarding cold water reserves for salmon in  particular, these reserves will be critical to prevent salmon runs from  being wiped out during the potential fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh  years of devastating droughts.   The bill's funding authorizations apply not just to California but  throughout the 17 Western States where the Bureau of Reclamation has a  presence. Many of these States have recently benefited from the Bureau  of Reclamation's storage, water recycling, and desalination programs  and/or have projects currently seeking funding from these programs,  including Arizona, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Nevada, and  New Mexico. I believe the Federal funding assistance authorized by this  bill will be particularly important for all seven Colorado River basin  States as the States negotiate the next painful round of water supply  cuts from the Colorado River between now and 2026 in order to meet the  challenge of an increasingly dry Colorado River basin.   In Arizona, the STREAM Act would significantly advance the Salt River  Project's proposal to raise Bartlett Dam on the Verde River to  counteract the loss of approximately one-third of the nearby Horseshoe  Dam's capacity from accumulating sediment. The Bartlett Dam raise would  provide an additional 60,000 to 115,000 acre-feet per year or enough  water for 360,000 to 690,000 people.   The bill uses financial incentives to encourage storage and  conveyance projects to include environmental benefits and other public  benefits such as drinking water for disadvantaged communities. This is  important to ensure that the environment and disadvantaged communities  are included in our drought resilience strategies.   The bill authorizes low-interest loans for sponsors of storage and  conveyance projects if those projects solely provide irrigation and  general municipal and industrial water supply benefits.   In contrast, the bill authorizes grants for storage and conveyance  projects that include environmental benefits, drinking water benefits  for disadvantaged communities, or other public benefits either as part  of the project design or as part of a watershed restoration plan  adopted together with the project.   This access to grants gives project sponsors a strong financial  incentive to design environmental and disadvantaged community benefits  into their projects. This approach builds on the experience of the  Proposition 1 water bond California's voters passed by a 2-to-1 margin  in 2014, which also incentivizes projects with environmental and other  public benefits.   If storage and conveyance projects take these steps, they can get  Federal grants both directly for the public benefits and for an equal  value investment in the water supply component of the project. Thus,  the Federal Government will provide $50 million for the general water  supply benefits of a project if the project also has $50 million in  fish and wildlife or water quality benefits either directly from the  project or from an associated watershed restoration plan.   The bill not only increases funding for drought resiliency projects,  it expedites their approvals and assists them more cost-effectively,  stretching taxpayer dollars further.   The traditional Bureau of Reclamation model for approving and funding  new water supply projects has involved the following:   No. 1, reclamation studies new projects in detail, which can take a  decade or more for major projects;   No. 2, once Reclamation's studies are complete, Congress authorizes  projects individually, which can take another 3-5 years or longer in  many cases; and   No. 3, the design and construction can take a decade or longer.   One can quickly see that this model can end up taking decades to  construct significant new water supply projects. This is especially the  case given the limitations of Federal budgets and the increasing cost  of major protein recent years. Given the tremendous challenge  [[Page S2547]]  posed by climate change to western water supply, we need a nimbler and  more responsive model.   Mike Connor, the Deputy Secretary of the Interior during the Obama  Administration and currently Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil  Works, testified in support of a new model during an October 8, 2015,  hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  Deputy Secretary Connor stated:         The traditional Reclamation business model, in which       feasibility studies, consistent with the 1983 Principles and       Guidelines for Water and Related Resources Development, are       first authorized, funded, and submitted to Congress, and then       construction is authorized and funded, does not always       address the needs of project sponsors at the state and local       levels. Moreover, given budget limitations and the       availability of other available financing mechanisms, the       historic federal role in financing water storage projects       through the Bureau of Reclamation must be revisited with a       greater emphasis on non-federal financing.    In response to the concerns articulated by then-Deputy Secretary  Connor and others, the bill we are introducing today, building on the  2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, makes five  significant changes to the traditional reclamation model. These changes  expedite project approvals and make more cost-effective use of  available federal funding.   No. 1, Congressional authorization no longer required for non-Federal  projects.   First, the bill eliminates the need for Congress to authorize  individual water recycling and desalination projects and non-Federal  storage projects with a Federal investment of less than $250 million.  It can take 3 to 5 years or longer for projects to get legislatively  approved. In fact, zero new water recycling projects were authorized  from 2009 to 2017 despite dozens of meritorious projects with approved  feasibility studies.   Federal storage projects, which are often more controversial,  continue to require congressional authorization, as do non-Federal  storage projects with a greater than $250 million Federal investment.  The bill shortens the timeline for congressional approval of these  projects through directing Reclamation to follow a process that the  Army Corps of Engineers uses to notify Congress of completed  feasibility studies each year to set up an orderly timeline to  authorize projects.   No. 2, non-Federal funding is required up front.   Second, the bill no longer requires 100 percent Federal funding up  front as was necessary under the traditional Reclamation model.  Instead, the bill allows a maximum of 50 percent Federal funding for  federally owned projects and a maximum of 25 percent Federal funding  for non-Federal projects that are built by States, water districts, or  Indian Tribes.   Federal dollars can be stretched further by the partnerships with  States and water districts that will be fostered under the bill. For  example, the proposed expansion of Los Vaqueros Reservoir in California  would be funded nearly 50 percent by the State of California, which has  already conditionally awarded funding, in addition to potentially 20 to  25 percent by the Federal Government and the remaining 25 to 30 percent  by water users.   Multipartner projects like the Los Vaqueros expansion frequently have  multiple benefits. For example, much of the State and Federal funding  for the Los Vaqueros expansion would go to augment the water supply of  wildlife refuges that provide essential water for migratory birds on  the Pacific flyway. These benefits would complement the project's water  supply benefits for many Bay Area water districts.   No. 3, the new loan program is cost-effective.   Third, the low-interest loan program created by the bill for water  supply projects is an exceptionally cost-effective program. This  program, known as the Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation  Act, RIFIA, would use existing criteria for loans under the successful  WIFIA Program, the Water Infrastructure. Finance and Innovation Act.   The Office of Management and the Budget, OMB, has approved loans of  $2.3 billion for WIFIA in fiscal year 2018 backed by appropriations of  just over 1 percent of that amount, or $25 million in budget authority.  OMB was able to approve loans backed by just l percent of the loan  amount because there is a virtually non existent default rate for water  projects. Only 4 in 1,000 water infrastructure projects default, based  on a study conducted by the Fitch credit rating agency.   Given OMB's experience that Federal outlays need only cover l percent  of the loan cost for water projects, the $125 million in authorized.  Federal spending in the draft bill likely could support $12.5 billion  in water project lending authority.   Federal funding of 1 percent of the loan amount will typically return  10 to 25 percent savings in the repayment cost of the loans for the  water districts funding the projects. The total savings can be about 10  percent for AAA-rated districts and 20 to 25 percent for AA-rated  districts.   For example, the water users who are supporting the proposed Sites  Reservoir in northern California have estimated that the loans  authorized by this bill would allow them to pay only $512/acre-foot for  water delivered by the project instead of $682/acre-foot, or a 25  percent reduction in their costs.   Thus, the Federal Government can provide a loan at 1 percent of the  loan amount and save the project sponsors 10 to 25 percent of the  project cost. That is an exceptionally cost-effective Federal  investment.   There are at least three significant reasons that the loans are so  beneficial for the project sponsors:   The sponsors pay a substantially lower interest rate on their loans  than they would under the alternative of municipal bond financing.   The districts would not need to start loan repayments until 5 years  after substantial completion of the project, a substantial cost saver.   Loans are for 35 rather than 30 years, lowering annual debt service  costs.   Significantly, the loans include all the taxpayer protections from  the successful WIFIA and TIFIA, Transportation Infrastructure Finance  and Innovation Act, programs. In particular, the RIFIA loans would be  limited to 49 percent of the project costs, and the Federal loans would  have senior status in the event of any default. These provisions ensure  the taxpayer won't be harmed in any default where the project retains  at least 50 percent of its value, which is extremely likely for  ratepayer backed water supply projects.   No. 4, Federal grants and loans work together.   Fourth, the combination of low-interest loans and Federal grants of  up to 25 percent of project costs for non-Federal projects can allow  water users to make up the difference where the Federal Government is  no longer funding l00 percent of project costs up front. Many rural  communities, and in particular agricultural communities, are not able  to pay 100 percent of the cost of new water supply projects.   Under the bill I am introducing today, these communities will still  have to provide a significant cost-share for improving their water  supplies, and new water projects will have to be cost-effective enough  to justify that investment. However, the Federal--Government can help  build the best and most effective projects in increasing drought  resiliency by providing assistance through both grants and loans.   Finally, the longer and more severe droughts coming with climate  change will adversely affect not just farms and cities but also the  natural environment. The bill includes provisions to improve species'  drought resiliency as well.   The significant funding authorization of $250 million for  environmental restoration can be used to benefit many different  species, including fish and migratory birds. Some authorized uses of  this funding include: improved habitat for salmon, Delta smelt and  other fish species adversely affected by the Bureau of Reclamation's  water projects; additional water for wildlife refuges hosting migratory  birds along the Pacific flyway; improved stream gauges, monitoring, and  science to better understand how to restore species and to operate  Reclamation water projects with reduced environmental impacts; ensuring  that when Sacramento Valley rice growers sell their water and idle  their crops, some water is left behind and applied to bare fields in  late summer and early fall to create shallow flooded habitat during a  critical  [[Page S2548]]  shorebird migration period; and assistance in implementing water- related settlements with State agencies and State water quality laws.   The bill would also authorize $50 million of the broader storage  funding for natural water retention and release projects.   These projects would help restore stream and river channels with  natural materials like wetlands. Like many other projects prioritized  by the bill, these projects could have multiple benefits, including  increased groundwater recharge, improved flood protection, and  increased floodplain habitat to benefit salmon and other species. I  look forward to receiving comments on ways to prioritize multibenefit  projects like natural water storage projects as we move forward with  the bill.   The bill also authorizes pay-for-performance environmental  restoration approaches that award grants contingent on the success of  the restoration effort. These approaches can expedite environmental  restoration and build public/private partnerships to increase the  number of acres restored.   In addition, the bill makes clear that it must be implemented  consistently with all Federal environmental laws, including the  Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the  Clean Water Act, and all other environmental laws. All applicable State  laws must also be followed.   California is home to more than 40 million people, but our major  statewide water infrastructure hasn't significantly changed in the past  50 years, when we had only 16 million people.   We must modernize the system or we risk becoming a desert State.  Critically, this means putting in place infrastructure to allow our  cities, our farmers, and our natural communities to withstand the  severe droughts that we are projected to face as a result of climate  change.   I hope my western colleagues will join my cosponsors and me on this  bill because drought is a serious threat for all of our States.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the STREAM  Act (Support to Rehydrate the Environment, Agriculture and  Municipalities Act), which I am introducing today alongside my  cosponsors Senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema.

To demonstrate why this bill is so desperately needed, let me  illustrate the extent and damage caused by the current drought in the  West.   A precursor of the even more prolonged dry spells coming with climate  change, California's 2020 to 2022 drought has had severe impacts on  farms, cities, and the environment.   In 2021, the drought caused the California agriculture industry to  shrink by an estimated 8,745 jobs and incur $1.2 billion in direct  costs, according to a report prepared for the California Department of  Food and Agriculture by researchers at the University of California at  Merced.

In both 2021 and 2022, homes in significant parts of the State have  been at risk of running dry. Last year, large parts of Marin and Sonoma  Counties and the Mendocino coast came very close to losing all water  supply. This year, much of Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Bernardino  Counties have been placed under emergency orders limiting them to once  a week landscape irrigation, with the possibility of a complete  irrigation shutoff by fall.  [[Page S2546]]    In California, one in eight acres statewide has burned from wildfires  in the last decade, with the past 2 years being the worst on record.  With 95 percent of the State experiencing drought as we enter into the  traditional wildfire season, we are poised for an even worse year this  year.   The drought has been devastating to the aquatic ecosystem as well as  our forests. As just one example, the endangered winter-run Chinook  salmon depend on sufficient cold water released by Shasta Dam to rear  juveniles in the Sacramento River.   With limited water available in 2021, NOAA Fisheries models predict  that approximately 75 percent of the winter run chinook salmon's eggs  died from elevated water temperatures. This is a species with three 1- year age classes, and a prolonged drought could threaten the survival  of the species.   In order to increase drought resiliency in California and other  Western States, the bill authorizes the following funding over the next  5 years: $750 million for surface and groundwater storage projects, and  supporting conveyance, including $50 million for natural water  retention and release projects; $300 million for water recycling  projects; $150 million for desalination projects; $250 million for  environmental restoration projects; $100 million for drinking water for  disadvantaged communities; and $150 million for low-interest loans for  water supply projects.   This funding builds on the bipartisan infrastructure law's funding of  $1.15 billion for storage projects, $550 million for water recycling  projects, and $250 million for desalination projects.   The STREAM Act, in combination with the bipartisan infrastructure  law, would provide California with the Federal cost-share for  approximately 1,042,000 acre-feet per year of additional water supply,  or enough water for over 6 million people. This comes from the  following:   Enough funding for California to finally build three major off-stream  storage projects providing 370,000 acre-feet of water on average each  year: Sites Reservoir, the Los Vaqueros Expansion, and the BF Sisk  raise. In addition, the storage funding could provide an additional  55,000 acre-feet per year from some combination of other smaller  surface and groundwater storage projects like the Sacramento Regional  Groundwater Bank or Del Puerto Canyon Reservoir. All of the projects  are non-Federal projects with a 25 percent Federal cost share, with the  exception of the Federal BF Sisk Raise with a 50 percent Federal cost- share.   Enough funding for 532,000 additional acre-feet from water recycling  projects, from the $300 million authorized in the bill plus $550  million in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, with a 25 percent  Federal cost-share for projects.   Enough funding for approximately 85,000 additional acre-feet from the  $150 million authorized in the bill for desalination projects, plus  $250 million in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, with a 25  percent Federal cost-share for projects.   While virtually everyone supports water recycling projects, surface  and groundwater storage projects are sometimes more controversial. I  want to point out a report just released today by the widely respected  Public Policy Institute of California, PPIC, which relates to the  benefits of additional surface and groundwater storage as California's  climate is changing.   Many climate forecasters emphasize that as climate change  intensifies, California will get more of its precipitation in a few  large to extraordinarily large storms fueled by atmospheric rivers, and  more of the precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow. In  between the bursts of atmospheric rivers, there will be longer and more  intense droughts. We have definitely seen a preview of this pattern  this year.   PPIC has studied these projections and estimated that there is  substantial water in wet years that is not needed to maintain healthy  Delta outflows but currently cannot be captured because California  lacks the infrastructure to store for future dry periods. PPIC suggests  that given this reality, cost-effective storage projects in appropriate  locations could help improve California's drought resiliency.   PPIC also argues that these storage projects should be managed for  environmental flow benefits as well as water supply benefits. This bill  would help with that because Federal funding for Sites Reservoir would  help provide cold water for salmon, and Federal funding for the  expansion of Los Vaqueros Reservoir would provide needed water for  wildlife refuges. Regarding cold water reserves for salmon in  particular, these reserves will be critical to prevent salmon runs from  being wiped out during the potential fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh  years of devastating droughts.   The bill's funding authorizations apply not just to California but  throughout the 17 Western States where the Bureau of Reclamation has a  presence. Many of these States have recently benefited from the Bureau  of Reclamation's storage, water recycling, and desalination programs  and/or have projects currently seeking funding from these programs,  including Arizona, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Nevada, and  New Mexico. I believe the Federal funding assistance authorized by this  bill will be particularly important for all seven Colorado River basin  States as the States negotiate the next painful round of water supply  cuts from the Colorado River between now and 2026 in order to meet the  challenge of an increasingly dry Colorado River basin.   In Arizona, the STREAM Act would significantly advance the Salt River  Project's proposal to raise Bartlett Dam on the Verde River to  counteract the loss of approximately one-third of the nearby Horseshoe  Dam's capacity from accumulating sediment. The Bartlett Dam raise would  provide an additional 60,000 to 115,000 acre-feet per year or enough  water for 360,000 to 690,000 people.   The bill uses financial incentives to encourage storage and  conveyance projects to include environmental benefits and other public  benefits such as drinking water for disadvantaged communities. This is  important to ensure that the environment and disadvantaged communities  are included in our drought resilience strategies.   The bill authorizes low-interest loans for sponsors of storage and  conveyance projects if those projects solely provide irrigation and  general municipal and industrial water supply benefits.   In contrast, the bill authorizes grants for storage and conveyance  projects that include environmental benefits, drinking water benefits  for disadvantaged communities, or other public benefits either as part  of the project design or as part of a watershed restoration plan  adopted together with the project.   This access to grants gives project sponsors a strong financial  incentive to design environmental and disadvantaged community benefits  into their projects. This approach builds on the experience of the  Proposition 1 water bond California's voters passed by a 2-to-1 margin  in 2014, which also incentivizes projects with environmental and other  public benefits.   If storage and conveyance projects take these steps, they can get  Federal grants both directly for the public benefits and for an equal  value investment in the water supply component of the project. Thus,  the Federal Government will provide $50 million for the general water  supply benefits of a project if the project also has $50 million in  fish and wildlife or water quality benefits either directly from the  project or from an associated watershed restoration plan.   The bill not only increases funding for drought resiliency projects,  it expedites their approvals and assists them more cost-effectively,  stretching taxpayer dollars further.   The traditional Bureau of Reclamation model for approving and funding  new water supply projects has involved the following:   No. 1, reclamation studies new projects in detail, which can take a  decade or more for major projects;   No. 2, once Reclamation's studies are complete, Congress authorizes  projects individually, which can take another 3-5 years or longer in  many cases; and   No. 3, the design and construction can take a decade or longer.   One can quickly see that this model can end up taking decades to  construct significant new water supply projects. This is especially the  case given the limitations of Federal budgets and the increasing cost  of major protein recent years. Given the tremendous challenge  [[Page S2547]]  posed by climate change to western water supply, we need a nimbler and  more responsive model.   Mike Connor, the Deputy Secretary of the Interior during the Obama  Administration and currently Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil  Works, testified in support of a new model during an October 8, 2015,  hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  Deputy Secretary Connor stated:         The traditional Reclamation business model, in which       feasibility studies, consistent with the 1983 Principles and       Guidelines for Water and Related Resources Development, are       first authorized, funded, and submitted to Congress, and then       construction is authorized and funded, does not always       address the needs of project sponsors at the state and local       levels. Moreover, given budget limitations and the       availability of other available financing mechanisms, the       historic federal role in financing water storage projects       through the Bureau of Reclamation must be revisited with a       greater emphasis on non-federal financing.    In response to the concerns articulated by then-Deputy Secretary  Connor and others, the bill we are introducing today, building on the  2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, makes five  significant changes to the traditional reclamation model. These changes  expedite project approvals and make more cost-effective use of  available federal funding.   No. 1, Congressional authorization no longer required for non-Federal  projects.   First, the bill eliminates the need for Congress to authorize  individual water recycling and desalination projects and non-Federal  storage projects with a Federal investment of less than $250 million.  It can take 3 to 5 years or longer for projects to get legislatively  approved. In fact, zero new water recycling projects were authorized  from 2009 to 2017 despite dozens of meritorious projects with approved  feasibility studies.   Federal storage projects, which are often more controversial,  continue to require congressional authorization, as do non-Federal  storage projects with a greater than $250 million Federal investment.  The bill shortens the timeline for congressional approval of these  projects through directing Reclamation to follow a process that the  Army Corps of Engineers uses to notify Congress of completed  feasibility studies each year to set up an orderly timeline to  authorize projects.   No. 2, non-Federal funding is required up front.   Second, the bill no longer requires 100 percent Federal funding up  front as was necessary under the traditional Reclamation model.  Instead, the bill allows a maximum of 50 percent Federal funding for  federally owned projects and a maximum of 25 percent Federal funding  for non-Federal projects that are built by States, water districts, or  Indian Tribes.   Federal dollars can be stretched further by the partnerships with  States and water districts that will be fostered under the bill. For  example, the proposed expansion of Los Vaqueros Reservoir in California  would be funded nearly 50 percent by the State of California, which has  already conditionally awarded funding, in addition to potentially 20 to  25 percent by the Federal Government and the remaining 25 to 30 percent  by water users.   Multipartner projects like the Los Vaqueros expansion frequently have  multiple benefits. For example, much of the State and Federal funding  for the Los Vaqueros expansion would go to augment the water supply of  wildlife refuges that provide essential water for migratory birds on  the Pacific flyway. These benefits would complement the project's water  supply benefits for many Bay Area water districts.   No. 3, the new loan program is cost-effective.   Third, the low-interest loan program created by the bill for water  supply projects is an exceptionally cost-effective program. This  program, known as the Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation  Act, RIFIA, would use existing criteria for loans under the successful  WIFIA Program, the Water Infrastructure. Finance and Innovation Act.   The Office of Management and the Budget, OMB, has approved loans of  $2.3 billion for WIFIA in fiscal year 2018 backed by appropriations of  just over 1 percent of that amount, or $25 million in budget authority.  OMB was able to approve loans backed by just l percent of the loan  amount because there is a virtually non existent default rate for water  projects. Only 4 in 1,000 water infrastructure projects default, based  on a study conducted by the Fitch credit rating agency.   Given OMB's experience that Federal outlays need only cover l percent  of the loan cost for water projects, the $125 million in authorized.  Federal spending in the draft bill likely could support $12.5 billion  in water project lending authority.   Federal funding of 1 percent of the loan amount will typically return  10 to 25 percent savings in the repayment cost of the loans for the  water districts funding the projects. The total savings can be about 10  percent for AAA-rated districts and 20 to 25 percent for AA-rated  districts.   For example, the water users who are supporting the proposed Sites  Reservoir in northern California have estimated that the loans  authorized by this bill would allow them to pay only $512/acre-foot for  water delivered by the project instead of $682/acre-foot, or a 25  percent reduction in their costs.   Thus, the Federal Government can provide a loan at 1 percent of the  loan amount and save the project sponsors 10 to 25 percent of the  project cost. That is an exceptionally cost-effective Federal  investment.   There are at least three significant reasons that the loans are so  beneficial for the project sponsors:   The sponsors pay a substantially lower interest rate on their loans  than they would under the alternative of municipal bond financing.   The districts would not need to start loan repayments until 5 years  after substantial completion of the project, a substantial cost saver.   Loans are for 35 rather than 30 years, lowering annual debt service  costs.   Significantly, the loans include all the taxpayer protections from  the successful WIFIA and TIFIA, Transportation Infrastructure Finance  and Innovation Act, programs. In particular, the RIFIA loans would be  limited to 49 percent of the project costs, and the Federal loans would  have senior status in the event of any default. These provisions ensure  the taxpayer won't be harmed in any default where the project retains  at least 50 percent of its value, which is extremely likely for  ratepayer backed water supply projects.   No. 4, Federal grants and loans work together.   Fourth, the combination of low-interest loans and Federal grants of  up to 25 percent of project costs for non-Federal projects can allow  water users to make up the difference where the Federal Government is  no longer funding l00 percent of project costs up front. Many rural  communities, and in particular agricultural communities, are not able  to pay 100 percent of the cost of new water supply projects.   Under the bill I am introducing today, these communities will still  have to provide a significant cost-share for improving their water  supplies, and new water projects will have to be cost-effective enough  to justify that investment. However, the Federal--Government can help  build the best and most effective projects in increasing drought  resiliency by providing assistance through both grants and loans.   Finally, the longer and more severe droughts coming with climate  change will adversely affect not just farms and cities but also the  natural environment. The bill includes provisions to improve species'  drought resiliency as well.   The significant funding authorization of $250 million for  environmental restoration can be used to benefit many different  species, including fish and migratory birds. Some authorized uses of  this funding include: improved habitat for salmon, Delta smelt and  other fish species adversely affected by the Bureau of Reclamation's  water projects; additional water for wildlife refuges hosting migratory  birds along the Pacific flyway; improved stream gauges, monitoring, and  science to better understand how to restore species and to operate  Reclamation water projects with reduced environmental impacts; ensuring  that when Sacramento Valley rice growers sell their water and idle  their crops, some water is left behind and applied to bare fields in  late summer and early fall to create shallow flooded habitat during a  critical  [[Page S2548]]  shorebird migration period; and assistance in implementing water- related settlements with State agencies and State water quality laws.   The bill would also authorize $50 million of the broader storage  funding for natural water retention and release projects.   These projects would help restore stream and river channels with  natural materials like wetlands. Like many other projects prioritized  by the bill, these projects could have multiple benefits, including  increased groundwater recharge, improved flood protection, and  increased floodplain habitat to benefit salmon and other species. I  look forward to receiving comments on ways to prioritize multibenefit  projects like natural water storage projects as we move forward with  the bill.   The bill also authorizes pay-for-performance environmental  restoration approaches that award grants contingent on the success of  the restoration effort. These approaches can expedite environmental  restoration and build public/private partnerships to increase the  number of acres restored.   In addition, the bill makes clear that it must be implemented  consistently with all Federal environmental laws, including the  Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the  Clean Water Act, and all other environmental laws. All applicable State  laws must also be followed.   California is home to more than 40 million people, but our major  statewide water infrastructure hasn't significantly changed in the past  50 years, when we had only 16 million people.   We must modernize the system or we risk becoming a desert State.  Critically, this means putting in place infrastructure to allow our  cities, our farmers, and our natural communities to withstand the  severe droughts that we are projected to face as a result of climate  change.   I hope my western colleagues will join my cosponsors and me on this  bill because drought is a serious threat for all of our States.                            ____________________
