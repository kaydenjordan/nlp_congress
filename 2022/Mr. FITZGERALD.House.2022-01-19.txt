 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1192, the  Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021.   In 2016, Puerto Rico was experiencing severe financial pressure from  significant debt and related obligations.   In response to Puerto Rico's financial distress, Congress enacted the  Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act of 2016.  That 2016 law created a bankruptcy process for Puerto Rico.   Like existing bankruptcy law in 2016, the law permitted certain  professionals working on Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, like lawyers and  accountants, to apply to get paid for their services pending judicial  approval.   But the 2016 law lacked certain disclosure requirements for these  professionals that would typically apply to restructuring professionals  in other bankruptcy cases.   The gap in the 2016 law created the potential for undisclosed  conflicts of interest for professionals involved in Puerto Rico's  bankruptcy.   This bill fills the gap by mandating the necessary disclosure  requirements. The bill also establishes a process for overseeing and  policing disclosures that bankruptcy professionals make.   H.R. 1192 passed the House unanimously in February of 2021. In  December, the Senate passed H.R. 1192 with a few minor amendments to  improve the bill's administrative abilities. The amendments also  enhanced the incentives for professionals to make significant efforts  to comply with the new disclosure requirements.   H.R. 1192 will serve important goals and interests, including the  interests of creditors and taxpayers and Puerto Rico itself.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the approval  in the House of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico  Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021.   I joined Representative Velazquez to promote this bipartisan and  commonsense bill to help ensure the restructuring process under PROMESA  serves Puerto Rico's interests. Actually, just  [[Page H232]]  this week, the plan was approved by the Federal Court, so this is  perfect timing to approve this bill today.    Though it required some technical corrections, it is satisfying to  see this bill has already achieved passage in both Chambers. I wish for  my colleague, Congresswoman Velazquez, to be fully recovered in time to  see it become law.   The intent of this legislation remains the same, and this bill will  require any person or firm hired as legal, financial or technical staff  or consultants for the Financial Oversight Board in the court cases for  the restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt, to submit verified disclosures  of all connections with debtors, creditors, or other interested parties  in the process, before being compensated.   Our intention is not to exclude people with experience in Puerto  Rico's financial transactions from being resources in the restructuring  process, but it is essential that their connection to any parties  interested in those transactions be known. Conflict of interest, or the  appearance of conflict of interest, can be best avoided if there is  accountability and transparency.   Anyone working to inform the Board's decisions, or representing it  before the court, needs to be committed to defending the interests of  the people of Puerto Rico first, in accordance with the law and  justice.   Lack of transparency creates a lack of trust, and this bill will work  toward avoiding that by making these disclosures a legal mandate rather  than the Board's own discretion.   Our goal is to reach the day we no longer need the provisions of  PROMESA and the Oversight Board, but until that happens, these  instruments must be accountable and transparent.   I ask my colleagues to support the passage of the Senate amendment to  H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of  2021.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I just reiterate that I think there is a  lot of support in the Chamber, and I support it as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, this has been a year of crisis under  the leadership of President Joe Biden. At the southern border, our  country was noticeably lacking leadership and solutions from the White  House. Instead, President Biden took regressive actions. He halted  construction on the border wall, brought back catch and release, and  got rid of the remain in Mexico policy.   Because of these decisions, over 1.7 million illegal immigrants have  been encountered at the southern border since President Biden took  office. The number of illegal crossings at the border has risen at a  rate faster under President Biden than at any other time in recent  history. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that fentanyl  seizures increased 134 percent in fiscal year 2021.    I saw this crisis firsthand when I visited the southern border with  my colleagues, and I have led and supported legislative solutions in  Congress to combat this crisis. It is disheartening and unacceptable  that President Biden has neither visited the border to witness the  crisis, nor has he proposed solutions to control the unmanageable  levels of border crossings and fentanyl trafficking. To say President  Biden has under-delivered to the American people is beyond an  understatement.   Madam Speaker, I say it again. This year has been a year of crisis  under the leadership of President Biden.
