 Madam Speaker, last week I shared a series of  historical facts for Virgin Islands History Month, which falls in the  month of March. Today, in celebration of International Women's Day, I  proudly recognize the indomitable spirit of women from the Virgin  Islands.   This year, the theme of International Women's Day is centered around  the bold hashtag ``Break the Bias.'' For decades, women have worked to  break the bias in communities, workplaces, schools, universities. We  learn about different historical figures in history, but often we  forget to give recognition to the lesser-known women whose stories and  contributions help to propel the historical narrative.   First on my list, I want to recognize the most influential and  enigmatic writer of Harlem Renaissance, Nellallitea, or as she was more  commonly known, Nella Larsen. With a father from the Danish West  Indies, what is now the Virgin Islands, while working as a nurse and  librarian, she wrote two instant success novels, Quicksand in 1928, and  Passing in 1929, which made its screen debut on Netflix in 2019. Nella  was the first African-American woman to receive the prestigious  Guggenheim fellowship award for creative writing.    Also on my list is an individual who has a series of firsts for  Virgin Islanders, Ruby Rouss. Ruby Rouss was a Crucian known for  breaking the bias throughout her short life journey. She broke the mold  for what was considered possible for women during her time and was the  first of many things:   She was the first female member of the drill team at Fort Dix in New  Jersey.   She was the first Black woman to be permanently assigned to the staff  of General Dwight D. Eisenhower.   Parole officer, probation officer, legislator, leader, Ruby Rouss was  a woman who advocated for those most in need, spoke out against  injustice, and was true to her belief that women belong in politics.   My very own chief of staff, Angeline Muckle-Jabbar, comes from a long  lineage of powerful women from the Virgin Islands. One such woman in  her family was Ann Marie Shrader from St. Croix, who was at the  forefront of pivotal changes that were taking place in the 1970s at the  FBI National Academy. She was one of only two women to graduate from  the academy in 1972.   And, of course, bringing it forward, I would be remiss if I did not  include the Virgin Islands' very own Aliyah Boston who, through her  excellence in the NCAA women's basketball league, continues to break  the bias. Aliyah posted a record-breaking 23 consecutive double-doubles  this season. Miss Boston's team, the South Carolina Gamecocks, are  currently the number one overall seed for the upcoming NCAA tournament.   All of these women faced deliberate or unconscious bias, and yet they  prevail. As a Black woman, I think about my own mother and all the  mothers who, every day even when it wasn't common to work, they  sacrificed, occupied spaces where they were underrated,  underappreciated, marginalized.  [[Page H1340]]    Women continue to face tremendous obstacles across a number of  spheres. For example, managerial and leadership positions continue to  be male dominated, with women holding approximately 27 percent of  managerial roles. In the business world, on average, women hold 19.7  percent of corporate board seats. Of that number, 6.7 percent are  chairs, and only 5 percent are CEOs.   The importance of representation for women in leadership, politics,  law enforcement, and across every sphere is evident. In politics alone,  evidence shows that more women in public decision-making and public  policy produce policies that benefit women, children, and families in  general. Loans given to women's businesses exponentially support  families and communities. We need women.   On this International Women's Day, I pay homage to the women who have  come before me and the ones who stand beside me, and I send special  prayers and strength on International Women's Day to the women of  Ukraine, those fighting on the front line, those bringing support and  comfort to children and elders and bringing them to safety, all of the  women in Ukraine, especially today.   Let us all continue the great work to break the bias and advance the  cause of women's rights in our communities, our government, and our  world.                            ____________________
