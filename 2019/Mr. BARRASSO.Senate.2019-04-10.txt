 Mr. President, you have heard the quote: ``In this  world, nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes.'' Of  course, that was from Benjamin Franklin back in 1789.   Well, just as Franklin predicted, the tax man cometh on Monday. This  year, tax day follows a very strong March jobs report. Our booming  economy remains an incredible boon for U.S. workers. Employers added  196,000 jobs last month. It beat all expectations. U.S. unemployment is  right now at historic lows. It has remained at or below 4 percent now  for over a year. Weekly jobless claims have fallen to a 50-year low--50  years. It has never been lower, and the unemployment rate for women is  now the lowest since 1953.   Wages have increased by more than 3 percent, the fastest growth in a  decade, and it is worth noting that in recent months, the biggest pay  increases have gone to lower income workers. Bigger paychecks mean a  higher standard of living. Bigger paychecks mean the median household  income continues to rise and is, today, at the highest level ever in  the United States.   There are currently 7.6 million jobs open. We actually have more open  jobs in America today than we have people to fill them. Small  businesses recently set hiring records, and 60 percent of small  businesses have additional plans to hire more people. You would have to  go back 20 years--two decades--to find as many new manufacturing jobs  as we have added last year.   So this solid jobs news reflects an American economic renaissance  brought about by Republican tax reform. Republicans reduced tax rates  across the board. We have done it for individuals and have done it for  businesses starting in 2018. We lowered tax rates for small businesses,  as well as for family farms and family ranches, which is certainly a  big thing for me in Wyoming. We nearly doubled the standard deduction.  We cut our excessively high corporate tax rate as well so U.S.  companies are able to compete better globally. We made it easier for  business owners to recoup the cost of their investments because we want  them to invest and hire more people in the process.   As a result of Republican leadership, American workers have abundant  opportunity. The Washington Post reports that due to the strong labor  market, economists, they say, now foresee ``almost no risk of an  imminent recession.'' According to the Post article, ``As long as  hiring remains strong and wages are climbing, the economy is likely to  continue growing, experts say, because people typically spend more when  they are not worried about losing their job.''   Our economy is strong. Our economy is healthy. Our economy is  growing. The U.S. GDP has risen 3 percent year over year. Lower tax  rates have freed job creators, giving companies the confidence to  invest, to grow, and to hire. Employers have created more than 3  million jobs since tax reform passed and 5.5 million new jobs since  President Trump took office. With faster job growth and better profits,  businesses can invest more in their workers.   Last year, a number of Wyoming employers boosted pay and benefits due  to tax reform. Darden Restaurants, with locations nationwide, including  in Cheyenne and in Casper, invested $20 million in its workforce.  Kroger grocery stores and convenience stores, with more than 1,400  employees in Wyoming, well, they invested $500 million to boost worker  pay. Kroger plans to add, actually, 11,000 more jobs.   Many companies in Wyoming have made similar investments. I hear about  them every weekend. Our utility company in Wyoming, Rocky Mountain  Power, has rewarded our customers as well. It decreased its electricity  rates last year by 3 percent, and, they say, as of course other  utilities have across the country, it is a direct result of tax reform.   Democrats, on the other hand, are threatening to reverse these gains  and dramatically increase taxes with their extreme socialist agenda.  Democrats want to take over all of healthcare in this country and  eliminate insurance from 180 million Americans. That bill was  introduced today by the Senator from Vermont and cosponsored by, I  assume, just about every Democrat who is running for President who is a  Member of the Senate.   Medicare for All, let's be clear, is government-run healthcare. It  has an  [[Page S2362]]  estimated 10-year price tag of over $32 trillion, meaning massive tax  hikes for American families.    Democrats also want to control our energy sector. It is called the  Green New Deal. Its estimated 10-year price tag is $93 trillion. This  unaffordable, unworkable plan would destroy our economy and  dramatically increase taxes.   Far-left Democrats are touting tax-the-rich plans that would punish  success. These include raising the top marginal tax rate to 70 percent,  imposing a 2-percent annual ``wealth tax,'' and raising the top estate  tax rate to 77 percent on farmers, ranchers, and business owners.   Republicans dramatically reduced the estate tax or the ``death tax''  as a result of tax reform. This tax is double-taxation. It taxes money  that has previously been taxed already. It hurts family-owned  businesses, and it hurts ranchers and farmers and should be fully  repealed.   Clearly, Democrats have taken a sharp left turn. Their policies will  send our strong, healthy, and growing economy careening over the  liberal cliff.   Republicans' pro-growth tax relief has produced a booming economy  with millions of new jobs and larger paychecks. We freed job creators  to hire again. We put Americans back to work. We raised the standard of  living. Thanks to Republican tax reform, America is back in business.   So I say, we must come together. We must do it now. We must embrace  commonsense policies that will continue our progress. Republicans have  provided successful solutions. Democrats are now promoting the failure  and the horrors of socialism.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session and be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the  Centennial of the Rotary Club of Casper, Wyoming, a club which holds  special importance for my wife, Bobbi and me.   On Saturday, May 4, 2019, the Rotary Club of Casper will recognize  their 100th anniversary at a special celebration. Rotary organized in  Casper, WY on March 12, 1919, just 14 years after the first Rotary club  was formed in Chicago, and 28 years after Wyoming's admission to the  Union.   At a luncheon on March 12, 1919, 15 businessmen, representing all  walks of Casper life, met and elected their leadership--President James  T. Gratiot, Directors Loui McMahon, Steve Starrett, George Nelson,  Billy Johnson, Carl Shumaker, and Otis Walker. With a shared mission  and sense of duty, these charter members laid the groundwork for a  century to come.   The Casper Daily Tribune noted Rotary's founding in an article the  following day, March 13, 1919, ``The purpose of the club is to  encourage business and social relations and its by-laws define the  policies of the club in a way that marks various departures from other  clubs or societies.'' With this in mind, the club hit the ground  running, impacting the Casper community in positive and distinct ways.   Within their first years of forming, Casper Rotary's commitment to  the community was proven and acknowledged. As early as 1920-21, with  memories of WWI fresh in their minds, they voted to support and donate  funds to the construction of an air base near Casper. This air base,  established in 1942, would come to fruition as the Casper Army Air  Field. Governor Bryant B. Brooks, who would join the club and become  president, noticed their initiative and addressed the club early on.  This began a pattern with the club hosting a great number of Wyoming  Governors, U.S. Senators and Congressmen, and local officials.   The Rotary Club of Casper always realized the importance of the youth  of their community. From the beginning, the club sponsored the Boy and  Girl Scouts. They established a student loan fund for students wishing  to further their education and engaged with high school students to  encourage their ambition. They were part of the effort to bring a  junior college to Casper, lobbying the State legislature in Cheyenne.  Their efforts were rewarded in 1945, when Casper College was  established as Wyoming's first junior college.   Countless dollars and volunteer hours were donated and continue to be  given to the creation of parks, camps, playgrounds, and swimming pools  for the community. The most well-known is Rotary Park on Casper  Mountain. Popular since the early 1940s, Rotary Park contains the  picturesque Garden Creek Falls and Bridle Trail. Additionally, each  August, Rotary helps host Casper's Riverfest and the Great Duck Derby.  Rubber ducks fill the North Platte River with the proceeds going to the  area's trail systems. The club's continuing engagement and investment  in future projects ensure these areas are enjoyed for generations to  come.   The history of Casper's Rotary Club is a microcosm of the history of  Casper. Professionals encompassing the  [[Page S2383]]  entire Casper community worked together throughout the years to promote  good will, service, and character.
