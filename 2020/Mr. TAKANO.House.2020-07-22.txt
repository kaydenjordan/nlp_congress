 Madam Speaker, I rise today because supplemental Federal  unemployment benefits expire next week, and Republicans in the Senate  refuse to extend these benefits for the American people.   Average daily expenses are weighing heavily on millions of families  as our economy struggles and unemployment is at a record high, with  over 17 million still unemployed.   Rent is due, bills are due, loan payments are due, but people are  still out of work. Americans are fighting against financial hardships  and the housing affordability crisis. Failure to extend unemployment  benefits in the midst of this pandemic would be cruel and inhumane. It  would cause financial ruin for millions who are already struggling.   Our communities need the additional $600 weekly unemployment  benefits. It could be the difference between getting evicted or making  rent for another month.   I urge the Senate to pass the HEROES Act to extend Federal  unemployment benefits. Millions of Americans are depending on it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the passion  of a dear friend, a colleague, a personal hero of mine, Congressman  John Lewis.   Mr. Lewis often spoke of building a beloved community, one that  required us to get into ``good trouble'' to achieve. His vision for  America and her world was one of justice, equality, and compassion for  one another.   During dark times, his strength and his optimism lit the way to a  path forward that brought us closer to justice.   During doubtful times, his words and his wisdom inspired confidence  that progress was still in reach.   And during this difficult time for our country, as we mourn his  death, may the life and the legacy he left behind inspire us to keep  building that beloved community.   John Lewis, you taught me that optimism is a moral duty, and now that  you are gone, sir, I will no longer have you around to remind me to  keep the faith. I will have to do that all by myself.                                time  2030
