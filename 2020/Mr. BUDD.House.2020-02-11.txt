 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose a truly radical piece  of legislation that was recently introduced in this Chamber.   The New Way Forward Act, as it is called, introduced with the support  of  [[Page H1021]]  more than three dozen Democratic cosponsors, decriminalizes illegal  immigration, makes it nearly impossible for border authorities to  detain and deport immigrants with criminal convictions, and forces  taxpayers to foot the bill to bring back previously deported criminal  illegal immigrants.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, if this bill were to become law, it would enable illegal  immigrants who have committed crimes abroad to be returned to the U.S.,  and it would allow them to gain a pathway to citizenship.   The bill eliminates the provision in current law that forbids an  immigrant from entering the United States if they have committed drug  crimes or any crimes involving moral turpitude. Examples of crimes  involving moral turpitude include child molestation, kidnapping, rape,  murder, and more. It is unthinkable that we would allow anyone who has  committed those crimes to freely enter our country.   To add to the egregiousness of this legislation, it calls on the  Department of Homeland Security to pay for the return of previously  deported illegal immigrants. Under the bill, any immigrant deported  since April 1996 would be allowed to return to the U.S. as long as they  met a stunningly lax set of criteria. It is ridiculous to require  American taxpayers to foot the bill to bring previously deported  individuals back onto U.S. soil.   The bill would make it more difficult for ICE to detain an immigrant  with a criminal record. Agents would be forced to prove that a suspect  poses a danger or a flight risk without using the immigrant's past  criminal history as a sole factor.   One of the Democratic cosponsors on this bill even proclaimed that it  would end deportation for people who had contact with the criminal  legal system. I would say it is common sense that a serious criminal  conviction should lead to deportation.   Worse yet, this prevents ICE from deporting immigrants who have been  convicted of crimes with an average sentence of less than 5 years. This  bill would allow an alien who committed crimes like auto theft, weapons  crimes, identity theft, and fraud to remain in the country.   Like many Americans, I want people to enter our country through the  legal process--we want them here--and then to stay on the right side of  the law. Legal immigration is what makes our country great. But we  cannot pass bills, like this one, that incentivize more people to come  here illegally or imposes no penalty on those who commit serious  crimes.   I think most Americans would agree that we should welcome those who  come to our land in a legal, merit-based way and that dangerous,  illegal immigrants should not be allowed to come into our country or  stay in our country.   Unfortunately, this bill makes a mockery of that principle and  replaces it with a set of radical, open-border policies that are  dangerous to our citizens and our communities. It is for that reason  that it should be soundly defeated.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, 60 years ago this month, four African  American students from North Carolina A&T performed a simple, yet  profound act. They sat at Woolworth's lunch counter in front of a  detestable ``Whites Only'' sign. They were called rabble-rousers,  troublemakers, and worse. They did not yield.   In the days that followed, more students joined them, including my  friend, Clarence Henderson. By continuing to sit, they were actually  standing up for their God-given constitutional rights as Americans.   They may not have known it at the time, but their act of courage lit  a fire of freedom that spread across our country, all the way to the  steps of the Lincoln Memorial where Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke to  us about his dream of a more just tomorrow.   Madam Speaker, this Black History Month, we remember the brave  sacrifices that were made by so many so that each and every American  would never again be judged, as Dr. King said, by the color of our skin  but, instead, ``by the content of their character.''                            ____________________
