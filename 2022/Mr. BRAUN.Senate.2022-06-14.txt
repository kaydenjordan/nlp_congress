 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this is one of the more enjoyable things of  being a Senator, especially when I have some friends in from Southern  Indiana up in the Gallery to see what we do here.   I rise today to offer a resolution expressing support for the Pledge  of Allegiance as an expression of patriotism and honoring the 245th  anniversary of the introduction of our United States flag.   Today we celebrate Flag Day, which was first established over 100  years ago by President Woodrow Wilson. As we pause to recognize all  that our flag represents, let us also honor those who have sacrificed  everything to defend it.   In 2002, Senator Tom Daschle raised a similar resolution with  unanimous support from the Senate. It passed on the floor uneventfully.  Today, I ask this body to reaffirm our support for the Pledge of  Allegiance.   I also rise to honor a fellow Hoosier who knew the innate value of  the Pledge of Allegiance to civic education. In 1969, Red Skelton, the  American entertainer who was well-known for the program ``The Red  Skelton Hour,'' wrote a speech on the importance of the pledge.  Reflecting on his time in Vincennes, IN, he spoke about the values  instilled by one of his high school teachers.   After the performance of the speech, CBS received 200,000 requests  for copies. The speech would go on to be sold as a single by Columbia  Records and performed at the White House for President Nixon. I think  it would honor Mr. Skelton's memory and the importance of the Pledge of  Allegiance if it were recited today on the Senate floor in the words of  Mr. Red Skelton. I have done this 2 prior years too. This should never  get old for anyone here or the American public in general.         When I was a small boy in Vincennes, [Indiana,] I heard, I       think, one of the most outstanding speeches I ever heard in       my life. I think it compares with the Sermon on the Mount,       Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and Socrates' Speech to the       Students.        We had just finished reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and       he [Mr. Lasswell, the Principal of Vincennes High School]       called us all together, and he says, ``Uh, boys and girls, I       have been listening to you recite the Pledge of Allegiance       all semester, and it seems that it has become monotonous to       you. Or, could it be, you do not understand the meaning of  [[Page S2932]]       each word? If I may, I would like to recite the pledge, and       give you a definition of each word:        I--Me, an individual; a committee of one.        Pledge--Dedicate all of my worldly good to give without       self-pity.        Allegiance--My love and my devotion.        To the Flag--Our standard. ``Old Glory''; a symbol of       courage. And wherever she waves, there is respect, because       your loyalty has given her a dignity that shouts ``Freedom is       everybody's job.''        Of the United--That means we have all come together.        States--Individual communities that have united into 48       great states    Remember the time when they didn't.         Forty-eight individual communities with pride and dignity       and purpose; all divided by imaginary boundaries, yet united       to a common cause, and that's love of country--        Of America.        And to the Republic--a Republic: A sovereign state in which       power is invested into the representatives chosen by the       people to govern; [us] and the government is the people; and       it's from the people to the leaders, not from the leaders to       the people.        For which it Stands.        One Nation--Meaning ``so blessed by God.''    [Under God]         Indivisible--Incapable of being divided.        With Liberty--Which is freedom; the right of power for one       to live his own life without fears, threats, or any sort of       retaliation.        And Justice--The principle and qualities of dealing fairly       with others.        For All--For All. That means, boys and girls, it's as much       your country as it is mine.    Afterward, Mr. Lasswell asked the students to recite the Pledge of  Allegiance together, with newfound appreciation for the words.         I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of       America, and to the Republic, for which it stands; one       nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.    Mr. Skelton concluded his speech by saying:         Since I was a small boy, two states have been added to our       country, and two words have been added to the Pledge of       Allegiance: ``Under God.'' Wouldn't it be a pity if someone       said, ``That is a prayer''--and that it be eliminated from       our schools, too?    Just as those students that day, Mr. Red Skelton included,  recommitted to the meaning of the words of the Pledge of Allegiance, I  call upon the U.S. Senate to recommit to these words as well.   There are times today that the words of the Pledge of Allegiance are  tossed around without care. Other times, they are altered to remove  what today is deemed offensive or antiquated. But Americans should not  misuse or abuse our Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge of Allegiance is  meant to remind Americans of our guiding principles and inspire  adherence to those ideas which make our country great: equality under  the law, recognized rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. This is why today, on National Flag Day, I am requesting  unanimous consent from my colleagues that my resolution expressing  support for the Pledge of Allegiance is passed.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 671, submitted earlier today; further, I ask  unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be  agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
