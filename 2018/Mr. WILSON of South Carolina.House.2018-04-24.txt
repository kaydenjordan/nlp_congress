 Mr. Speaker, as we begin this evening,  I want to begin in my service as co-chair of the French Caucus to  welcome Emmanuel Macron, President of France, to Washington.   South Carolina is especially appreciative of France, with our shared  heritage, particularly as we are very grateful for the Marquis de  Lafayette, who was so vital in the American Revolution and who actually  began his service landing in Georgetown, South Carolina.   It is very significant. I have colleagues from South Carolina, North  Carolina, and even Florida. We are very grateful to point out that,  here in the House Chamber, is an indication of the affection the  American people have for France.   There are only two portraits here in the House Chamber: President  George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette. So it is quite  revealing that, indeed, there is great love and affection for America's  first ally, and how exciting it is that he has arrived here in  Washington. We are looking forward to the joint session as he speaks to  Congress and the American people tomorrow morning.                                  Tax Reform     Last year, House Republicans made  history by passing the first meaningful tax cuts in 32 years. The last  time our Tax Code was updated, ``Top Gun'' was the top movie, ``The  Oprah Winfrey Show'' first aired across the Nation, and the Dow Jones  Industrial Average ended the year at 1,895.   For context, today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is over 24,000  points, which is an increase of nearly 8,000 points, which is a nearly  20 percent increase since the day that President Donald Trump was  elected. From that day, the stock market has had a remarkable increase  because of faith in his business ability, his acumen, and, I believe,  the success that Republicans would have to cut taxes, cut regulations,  and create jobs.   Despite how much our economy has changed, we were still operating on  a tax structure designed in 1986. But last year, House and Senate  Republicans came together, inspired by President Donald Trump, to make  the Tax Code more fair, more simple, and less burdensome for the middle  class, which then, of course, yields to the increase in the stock  market, which benefits all Americans.    I am grateful that families all across America today are already  seeing the direct benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with the  leadership of our chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Kevin  Brady; the extraordinary service of Speaker Paul Ryan; our leader,  Kevin McCarthy; our Conference chair, Cathy McMorris Rodgers; and also  our secretary of the Conference, Virginia Foxx of North Carolina.   The jobs have been created in such a remarkable way that African- American unemployment is at the lowest level since the Bureau of Labor  Statistics started tracking it in 1972. Hispanic unemployment is the  lowest it has ever been recorded. The level of unemployment for  American women is at the lowest rate in over 20 years. It was reported  today that 14 States also have record-low unemployment due to new jobs  by reducing regulations and taxes, a positive agenda.   We are here to highlight stories from across North Carolina and South  Carolina of everyday families and small-business owners getting to keep  more of their own hard-earned income.   I will first yield to my good friend Congressman Ralph Norman, who  represents the Fifth District of South Carolina. Congressman Norman was  just elected in a special election last year, but already he has been  here to make a difference on behalf of the people of South Carolina and  the United States. With his background as a real estate developer, he  and his wife, Elaine, have proven how to create jobs.   Congressman Ralph Norman.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman for his citation about UPS. I have had the same honor to put  on the brown uniform to deliver packages. I found out something: the  UPS employees--also FedEx, DHL, and others--are remarkable people  delivering American-made products to the American people. What  wonderful companies these are, and what wonderful employees they are.   Now I would like to go over some of the specific positive changes to  our Tax Code that occurred under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   An average middle class family in South Carolina will save $2,311  thanks to the tax cuts.   The child tax credit was doubled. I want to give a lot of credit  because the reason it was doubled was the great work of our U.S.  Senator Tim Scott, working with Ivanka Trump Kushner. This was their  effort to work to make this child friendly, family friendly, looking  out particularly for persons who are single-parent households. The  child tax credit was doubled, from $1,000 to $2,000, making it easier  for single mothers and new families to provide for their children.   The bill also removed the mandate that required you to buy healthcare  or pay a penalty. So now people aren't penalized by the government for  not being able to afford healthcare and health insurance.    The standard deduction doubled to $24,000 for married couples filing  jointly. This makes it simpler for couples to file their taxes because  they will use the standard deduction and won't have to itemize their  return.   Corporations that employ people create jobs. Their tax cuts dropped  from 35 percent to 21 percent. Time and time again, I have heard from  businessowners who plan to use their extra income to reinvest in the  company, create jobs, provide bonuses, and raise wages. When taxes are  low, businesses thrive and jobs are created in the Reagan tradition.   I am grateful for the leadership of Speaker Paul Ryan, House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman Brady, and I appreciate the opportunity of  working with them, in addition to President Donald Trump, for  delivering meaningful tax relief to the American people. They deserve  it.  [[Page H3500]]    Local success of the law was first heralded in the Second  Congressional District of South Carolina, the central part of South  Carolina, by Lou and Bill Kennedy of Nephron Pharmaceuticals in Cayce,  announcing 125 new jobs and a 5 percent pay increase. They said that  they made this decision as a direct result of the tax bill.   In fact, I am really grateful that Lou put together a barbecue where  I was present with Governor Henry McMaster and Attorney General Alan  Wilson. She made the announcement right there at the barbecue to the  extraordinary employees of Nephron Pharmaceuticals. They may have been  the first; they were certainly not the last. I was so grateful.   I was going through Walgreen's to pick up some pictures that I was  having developed and I ran into Bill Mooneyhan. Bill is the president  of the local Cayce-West Columbia Chamber of Commerce. He announced:  Hey, Joe, because of the tax savings, our business, our auto repair  shop, is going to add a new bay and create new jobs.   I said: Hey, Bill, because you announced this to me, you have just  volunteered for a press conference, which I am really grateful that we  were able to have with the National Federation of Independent Business,  NFIB, led by Ben Homeyer in South Carolina.                                time  2015    NFIB is the largest small business organization in America, and it is  bottom's up. The leadership really follows the directions of their  local members. So all of us truly appreciate NFIB.   In February, I visited with Norman Dunagan, owner of Whiskey Alley  restaurant and Dumpster Depot, which is a recycling facility in Aiken,  South Carolina. I took this opportunity to congratulate him on his  expansion resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He opened a third  business last year due to the confidence in President Donald Trump and  the House Republican leadership. All three of his small businesses are  thriving and providing much-needed new jobs.   That day I also met with Clancy Cipkala, president and CEO of Solara  Hospitality of West Columbia. Solara Hospitality is providing bonuses  for their hotel hourly associates due to the tax cuts passed by the  Republicans. In Orangeburg, South Carolina, South State Bank provided a  $1,000 bonus to their employees. In a rural area like Orangeburg, a  $1,000 bonus can make a huge difference for families. It can provide an  opportunity for families to buy extra school supplies, pay down debt,  make an investment in the future, start or add to an emergency fund, or  take a much-needed family vacation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished congressman from North  Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), who represents the beautiful Ninth District  of North Carolina, which includes substantially the extraordinary city  of Charlotte, which is such a center for job creation of the Carolinas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  the points he makes of where people can look at their paycheck and see  they are keeping more of their own money. This is not from the  government. This is their own money. How important this is, and how it  enables families to have a better life. And for the young people of our  country, how positive this is. I thank the gentleman for reiterating  that point.   The Business Roundtable, an association of America's largest  employers, is reporting that tax reform has already produced wage  increases, bonuses, increased matches for retirement savings, lower  prices for consumers, investment in facilities, and tens of thousands  of new American jobs as a direct result of tax reform.   As I indicated, we have the lowest unemployment among African  Americans ever. We have the lowest unemployment among Hispanics since  it has ever been determined. It is so exciting. Fourteen States have  the lowest level of unemployment in recorded history. Among women, we  have the lowest level of unemployment in 20 years. Everybody benefits  from the tax cuts. This is so positive.   The Business Roundtable members alone have provided over $545 million  in bonuses to their employees, with bonuses, wage increases, and a  range of other employee benefits to 1.6 million workers, along with  $1.2 billion in charitable contributions. According to the Tax  Foundation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will significantly lower marginal  tax rates and the cost of capital, which would lead to a 1.7 percent  increase in the gross domestic product over the long term, 1.5 percent  higher wages, and an additional 339,000 full-time equivalent jobs.    They also say it will spur an additional $1 trillion in Federal  revenue from economic growth, with approximately $600 billion coming  from the bill's permanent provisions and approximately $400 billion  from the bill's temporary provisions over the budget window.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the congresswoman from the Fifth District of  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx). Congresswoman Foxx is secretary of the  Republican Conference, she is a remarkably determined former community  college president, and she also is very much appreciated as the  chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Then she is  particularly fortunate; she lives and has a beautiful home in  Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina, some of the most beautiful  mountains in the world of western North Carolina.  [[Page H3501]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman  Virginia Foxx for her comments. And I thank her, as an educator, for  educating the American people and bringing to the attention of the  American people the real facts of the benefits of the tax cuts.   Congress today appreciates that Americans should keep their hard- earned tax dollars, and it is shocking to hear the other side of the  aisle say that they would repeal the tax cuts if they get a majority in  the House come November, resulting in tax increases on American  families, destroying jobs. Sadly, I suspect a lot of families and  businesses being highlighted today will be shocked--but maybe not so  shocked--to hear that Democrats are campaigning on raising taxes,  destroying jobs.   I sincerely hope that Americans across the country know that  Republicans will continue to do all that we can to our ability to  increase take-home pay to families, reduce the tax burdens on seniors,  and create more efficient and effective government that works for you  and provides opportunities for the young people of America.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of  this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________
