 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express strong  opposition to this resolution, which is nothing more than political  posturing. This nonbinding resolution does nothing to control increases  in healthcare premiums.    Republican actions have wreaked havoc in the healthcare market,  driving up healthcare costs for Americans, especially older Americans.  This nonbinding resolution does nothing to limit skyrocketing drug  prices after giving tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the drug  industry.   The Chicago Fire Department was in to see me this week, and they  talked about the high cost of drugs. For example, the cost of  nitroglycerin tripled over 4 years from $37 to $120. The cost of  naloxone more than doubled during this time period. If the Chicago Fire  Department is having trouble paying for pharmaceuticals, then you can  imagine what smaller entities would be experiencing.   This resolution does nothing to increase jobs, nothing to help  parents afford the high cost of childcare and college. It is indeed a  do-nothing resolution. That is exactly what it does. I will vote  against it.
