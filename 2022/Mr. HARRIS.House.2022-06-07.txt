 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the  time.   Madam Speaker, I rise with concern about H.R. 6087, Improving Access  to Workers' Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act. It was  mentioned that it is fine if healthcare practitioners are qualified to  deliver workmen's comp. Certainly, in some States, nurse practitioners  and physician assistants--nurse practitioners, specifically, can  practice without a physician oversight, but the question is whether  that is appropriate for workmen's compensation.   Remember, workmen's compensation includes people who have been  injured or claimed to have been injured on the job. These employees  deserve the highest level of care, the highest level of evaluation, of  diagnosis, certification, and treatment. And what this bill does is  turns over the qualifications for who is going to treat those injured  Federal workers to the State to make the decision. Because it says,  Well, if in a State they decide that a physician assistant practicing  independently is just fine, well, that Federal worker is not going to  have the benefit of having a physician involved in that care.                                time  1515    Madam Speaker, this is a serious policy debate. This debate should be  taking place, I believe, not on a suspension calendar but actually come  under a regular rule and be debated for whether or not this is the way  we want to treat Federal employees, that we want to subject them to a  State level of care as opposed to a level of care that we think is  appropriate, again, for an injured Federal worker.   So, Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Medical Association strongly opposing H.R. 6087.                                   American Medical Association,                                                       June 5, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the physician and medical student members of the American       Medical Association (AMA), I am writing in strong opposition       to H.R. 6087, the ``Improving Access to Workers' Compensation       for Injured Federal Workers Act.'' This legislation would       allow nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants       (PAs) to diagnose, prescribe, treat, and certify an injury       and extent of disability for purposes of compensating federal       workers under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA).        Current law prohibits non-physician health professionals       from making these determinations and reserves this function       to physicians who have the education, training, and expertise       to make these evaluations. The AMA remains steadfast in its       commitment to patients who have said repeatedly that they       want and expect physicians leading their health care team. In       a recent survey of U.S. voters, 68 percent say it is very       important for a physician to be involved in their  [[Page H5244]]       diagnosis and treatment decisions. However, H.R. 6087       effectively removes physicians from the care team and sets up       our federal workers for suboptimal health outcomes and       increased costs, without improving access to care. At a time       when inflation is at an all-time high and our economy is       still struggling to recover from the costs associated with       the COVID-19 pandemic, now is especially not the time for       Congress to enact this type of policy change.   EDUCATION MATTERS: PATIENTS WANT PHYSICIANS INVOLVED IN THEIR DIAGNOSIS                          AND TREATMENT DECISIONS         The AMA is concerned that H.R. 6087, while perhaps well-      intentioned for speedier workers' compensation       determinations, will actually jeopardize patient care. While       the bill purports to allow NPs and PAs to diagnose,       prescribe, treat, and certify an injury and extent of       disability within their state scope of practice laws, the       federal government dictating this scope expansion will have       the effect of setting the benchmark for the states. We have       seen this repeatedly with Medicare coverage determinations,       for example, setting the benchmark for private plan coverage       determinations. Moreover, while all health care professionals       play a critical role in providing care to patients, and NPs       and PAs are important members of the care team, their       skillsets are not interchangeable with that of fully educated       and trained physicians. This is fundamentally evident based       on the difference in education and training between the       distinct professions. Physicians complete four years of       medical school plus a three-to-seven-year residency program,       including 10,000-16,000 hours of clinical training. By       contrast, NPs, complete only two to three years of education,       have no residency requirement, and only 500-720 hours of       clinical training. The current PA education model is two       years in length with only 2,000 hours of clinical care and no       residency requirement. Patients expect the most qualified       person--physician experts with unmatched training, education,       and experience--to be diagnosing and treating injured federal       workers and making often complex clinical determinations on       the nature of an injury and extent of disability. NPs and PAs       do not have the education and training to make these       determinations and we should not be offering a lower standard       of care to our federal workers who are injured.        But it is more than just the vast difference in hours of       education and training; it is also the difference in rigor       and standardization between medical school/residency and NP       and PA programs that matter and must be assessed. During       medical school, students receive a comprehensive education in       the classroom and in laboratories, where they study the       biological, chemical, pharmacological, and behavioral aspects       of the human condition. This period of intense study is       supplemented by two years of patient care rotations through       different specialties, during which medical students assist       licensed physicians in the care of patients. During clinical       rotations, medical students continue to develop their       clinical judgment and medical decision-making skills through       direct experience managing patients in all aspects of       medicine. Following graduation, students must then pass a       series of examinations to assess a physician's readiness for       licensure. At this point, medical students ``match'' into a       three-to-seven-year residency program during which they       provide care in a select surgical or medical specialty under       the supervision of experienced physician faculty. As resident       physicians gain experience and demonstrate growth in their       ability to care for patients, they are given greater       responsibility and independence. NP programs do not have       similar time-tested standardizations. For example, between       2010-2017, the number of NP programs grew by more than 30       percent with well over half of these programs offered mostly       or completely online, meaning less in-person instruction and       hands-on clinical experience. In addition, many programs       require students to find their own preceptor to meet their       practice hours requirement, resulting in much variation among       students' clinical experiences. Our injured federal workers       deserve better--they deserve and have a right to have       physicians leading their health care team.      INCREASING SCOPE OF PRACTICE OF NPS AND PAs CAN LEAD TO INCREASED                             HEALTH CARE COSTS         There is strong evidence that increasing the scope of       practice of NPs and PAs has resulted in increased health care       costs due to overprescribing and overutilization of       diagnostic imaging and other services. For example, a 2020       study published in the Journal of Internal Medicine found 3.8       percent of physicians (MDs/DOs) compared to 8.0 percent of       NPs met at least one definition of overprescribing opioids       and 1.3 percent of physicians compared to 6.3 percent of NPs       prescribed an opioid to at least 50 percent of patients. The       study further found that, in states that allow independent       prescribing, NPs were 20 times more likely to overprescribe       opioids than those in prescription-restricted states.        Multiple studies have also shown that NPs order more       diagnostic imaging than physicians, which increases health       care costs and threatens patient safety by exposing patients       to unnecessary radiation. For example, a study in the Journal       of the American College of Radiology, which analyzed skeletal       x-ray utilization for Medicare beneficiaries from 2003 to       2015, found ordering increased substantially--more than 400       percent--by non-physicians, primarily NPs and PAs, during       this time frame. A separate study published in JAMA Internal       Medicine found NPs ordered more diagnostic imaging than       primary care physicians following an outpatient visit. The       study controlled for imaging claims that occurred after       a referral to a specialist. The authors opined this       increased utilization may have important ramifications on       costs, safety, and quality of care. They further found       greater coordination in health care teams may produce       better outcomes than merely expanding NP scope of practice       alone.        In addition, a recent study from the Hattiesburg Clinic in       Mississippi found that allowing NPs and PAs to function with       independent patient panels under physician supervision in the       primary care setting resulted in higher costs, higher       utilization of services, and lower quality of care compared       to panels of patients with a primary care physician.       Specifically, the study found that non-nursing home Medicare       ACO patient spend was $43 higher per member, per month for       patients on a NP/PA panel compared to those with a primary       care physician. Similarly, patients with an NP/PA as their       primary care provider were 1.8 percent more likely to visit       the ER and had an 8 percent higher referral rate to       specialists despite being younger and healthier than the       cohort of patients in the primary care physician panel. On       quality of care, the researchers examined 10 quality measures       and found that physicians performed better on 9 of the 10       measures compared to the non-physicians.        The findings are clear: NPs and PAs tend to prescribe more       opioids than physicians, order more diagnostic imaging than       physicians, and overprescribe antibiotics--all which increase       health care costs and threaten patient safety. The       Hattiesburg Clinic study further confirms these findings and       the need for physician-led team-based care. Before expanding       the scope of practice of all NPs and PAs and essentially       removing physicians from the care team, we encourage Congress       to carefully review these studies. We believe you will agree       that the results are startling and have significant impact on       the assessment of risk to the health and welfare of patients,       as well as the impact on the cost of health care in the       United States.        Finally, proponents of H.R. 6087 cite recognition of NPs       and PAs within the FECA as necessary in order to assist with       diagnosing and treating patients who contract COVID-19 in the       workplace. They claim that permitting NPs and PAs to diagnose       and treat individuals suffering from COVID-19 injuries is       believed to help patients get back to work faster so they can       continue to provide for their families. Yet, COVID-19, a       virus that is already responsible for the death of over one       million individuals just in the United States, is a complex       disease with varying impacts based on patient co-morbidities.       Furthermore, pre-existing conditions and other complicating       health factors have a tremendous impact on whether vaccines       and therapeutics are appropriate for patients who have       contracted COVID-19. These complexities highlight the fact       that physician experts are best suited to be assessing,       diagnosing, and treating patients in the FECA program.    SCOPE EXPANSIONS HAVE NOT PROVEN TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE IN RURAL                                   AREAS         Proponents of scope expansion have argued that legislation       like H.R. 6087 is necessary to expand access to care. This       promise has been made for years by NPs and PAs seeking scope       expansions at the state-level, but it has not proven true. In       reviewing the actual practice locations of primary care       physicians compared to NPs and PAs, it is clear that       physicians and non-physicians tend to practice in the same       areas of the state. This is true even in those states where,       for example, NPs can practice without physician involvement.       The Graduate Nurse Demonstration Project (the Project),       conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,       confirmed this as well. One goal of the Project was to       determine whether increased funding for Advanced Practice       Registered Nursing (APRNs) programs would increase the number       of APRNs practicing in rural areas. The results found that       this did not happen. In fact, only 9 percent of alumni from       the program went on to work in rural areas.        Moreover, workforce studies in various states have shown a       growing number of NPs are not entering primary care. For       example, the Oregon Center for Nursing found only 25 percent       of NPs practice primary care. Similarly, the Center for       Health Workforce Studies conducted a study on the NP       workforce in New York that found, ``[w]hile the vast majority       of NPs report a primary care specialty certification, about       one-third of active NPs are considered primary care NPs,       which is based on both NP specialty certification and       practice setting.'' In addition, the study found newly       graduated NPs were more likely to enter specialty or       subspecialty care rather than primary care. In short, the       evidence is clear that expanding scope for NPs and PAs will       not necessarily lead to better access to care in rural       America.        Rather than supporting an unproven path forward, Congress       should consider proven solutions to increase access to care,       including supporting physician-led team-based care. Evidence       shows that states that require physician-led team-based care       have seen a greater overall increase in the number of NPs       compared to states that allow independent practice. The       Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of this       legislation is zero  [[Page H5245]]       and includes in its assumptions that while some workers may       get services more quickly, increasing costs to the federal       government, that these workers might also return to work more       quickly saving the federal government money for a net cost of       zero. However, this analysis fails to take into account the       cost to the health care system when patients do not receive       the right care at the right time. Eliminating physicians from       workers' compensation determinations increases this       likelihood exponentially and is a gamble with the health of       our federal workers that Congress should not be willing to       take.        ENACTMENT UNDER SUSPENSION OF THE HOUSE RULES IS INAPPROPRIATE         The AMA is also concerned that the House of Representatives       is attempting to pass H.R. 6087 under ``suspension of the       rules,'' a procedural tactic that is often used to act       expeditiously on legislation that is typically non-      controversial. Bills considered ``under suspension'' receive       limited floor debate, all floor amendments are prohibited,       and a two-thirds vote of all members present is required for       final passage.        H.R. 6087 does not meet the definition of a ``non-      controversial'' bill and, therefore, should not be considered       under suspension of the rules. First and foremost, the strong       concerns we raise in this letter should be sufficient for       lawmakers to recognize that legislation that would be       detrimental to the health and welfare of federal workers       should not be considered under this fast-track parliamentary       procedure. While it passed out of the House Education and       Labor Committee in mid-March 2022, H.R. 6087 was formally       introduced two months ago and has only generated 18 total       cosponsors. Bills enacted under suspension of the rules       typically garner hundreds of cosponsors, thus indicating a       high level of bipartisan support. It is unclear whether a       strong collection of bipartisan members of the House of       Representatives support this legislation that inappropriately       expands non-physician practitioner scope of practice. While       the AMA opposes final passage of this legislation, we urge       the House of Representatives to reject enactment of this bill       under suspension of the rules.                                  CONCLUSION         For all the reasons above, we strongly encourage you to       protect the health and safety of our injured federal workers       and oppose passage of H.R. 6087.            Sincerely,                                               James L. Madara, MD.     Madam Speaker, they give reasons. They say, look,  education matters. Patients want physicians involved in their diagnosis  and treatment decisions. I think that is true.   They say that increasing the scope of practice of nurse practitioners  or physician assistants can lead to increased healthcare costs,  specifically mentioning the fact that there are studies now that show  that when a nurse practitioner is involved or a physician assistant----    Madam Speaker, they mention that, for instance, opioid  overprescribing occurs four times as much when a nurse practitioner is  involved. Obviously, in a workers' comp case where injury may be  determined, this could be significant. This is something we should deal  with.   Finally, even the AMA recognized that they are concerned that we are  attempting to pass this under suspension of the rules usually,  typically, reserved for noncontroversial bills.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
