 Mr. Chair, I would note to my  colleague from California that perhaps the members of their family are  supposed to decide on all their future medical care, because this  relates to their healthcare, and not just to the servicemembers'.  [[Page H5801]]    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the Hartzler amendment. No  one in the Pentagon has called for this. In fact, we know right now  Secretary of Defense Mattis is running a review of this issue. He does  not need to be micromanaged by Members of this body to advance their  own agenda.   Until last night, all of us had worked in good faith across the aisle  to keep this important Defense bill free from political booby traps and  land mines, but if you are feeling deja vu, well, don't worry, because  I am, too. You may remember that I stood here last year and fought  against a similar amendment, again to the Defense bill. That amendment  would have allowed Federal contractors to fire LGBT workers under the  pretense of religious observance.   I told you then that my dad was a disabled veteran, that he taught me  to support and honor the military, but also to speak the truth and know  the difference between right and wrong.   I told you that I had never voted against the Defense bill, and I  never imagined I would. And then, after a lot of twists and turns, 43  of our Republican colleagues joined with us to vote down that  discriminatory amendment, and I want to publicly thank them for their  courage.   Well, here we go again. The Hartzler amendment would single out and  rob a small group of military servicemembers and their families of  their healthcare merely because these folks or members of their family  experience gender a little differently.   Mr. Chair, it is that simple. We are talking about Americans who  right now are risking their lives to keep us safe, and we should not  undermine their military service.
