 Mr. Speaker, when I met with Admiral Harris of  Pacific Command last year, I asked him which nation's threats concerned  him the most. He quickly replied: North Korea.   Proving Admiral Harris correct, North Korea illegally launched yet  another menacing ballistic missile. This was a high-tech, pre-fueled  rocket that can be launched quickly. This type of rocket has a range of  about 1,800 miles--thus, making it an immediate threat to South Korea  and Japan as well as our troops that are stationed there.   North Korea has even bigger plans. Kim Jong-un reportedly plans to  develop submarines from which to launch the missiles, which could  threaten the United States. The last administration pursued an ignorant  strategy called strategic patience. That policy clearly failed. North  Korea's program is now stronger than ever. Kim Jong-un's threats  continue to grow bolder and bolder with no repercussions.   Once upon a time, the United States had North Korea on the State  Sponsors of Terrorism list. It is time to put little Kim back on that  list because he is a world terrorist and a threat to world peace, and  he has earned that distinction.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
