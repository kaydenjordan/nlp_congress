 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 526) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish in  the Department of Homeland Security a board to coordinate and integrate  departmental intelligence, activities, and policy related to  counterterrorism, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 16 years after September 11th, our country  continues to face the persistent threat of terrorism. From ISIS to al  Qaeda, radical groups continue to target the United States and our way  of life. Last year alone, we saw more than 131 plots by ISIS alone  against the West.   As terrorists continue to evolve, this body must ensure that the  security measures in place to protect the United States and its  citizens adapt to meet these threats.   Faced with the most dangerous threat environment since 9/11, the  Department of Homeland Security needs to continue to focus on its core  mission of protecting Americans from these threats in an increasingly  expeditious manner. I am proud that this body is working to continue to  strengthen our national security by debating the bill before us today.   H.R. 526, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2017, will help  integrate intelligence, operations, and policy decisions to ensure the  Department of Homeland Security remains adaptable, while eliminating  waste and duplication. This same bill was introduced last year and  passed the House by overwhelming majority.   Mr. Speaker, with open investigations in all 50 States and more than  119 arrests, this body must continue to take action to protect our  homeland. Further, these threats will likely expand as foreign fighters  flee places like Raqqa and Mosul.   Mr. Speaker, the world is witnessing the greatest convergence of  radical Islamic threats in its history. More than 40,000 jihadists  fighters, many of whom came from the West, have traveled to  [[Page H782]]  the battlefield in Syria and Iraq. With this threat environment in  mind, I have introduced H.R. 526.   Initially established at the end of 2010, the Counterterrorism  Advisory Board brings together the Department of Homeland Security's  top echelon counterterrorism decisionmakers to quickly respond to  threats.   While my colleagues and I were conducting the bipartisan Task Force  on Combating Terrorists and Foreign Fighter Travel, we found that the  Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB as it is referred to, had  neither been codified nor had its charter kept pace with evolving  terrorist threats.   That is why we need to pass this bill: to ensure that DHS is  effectively integrating intelligence, operations, and policy to better  compile and understand threat information to successfully fight  terrorism.   This legislation formally establishes the CTAB in law and makes it  the Department's central coordination body for counterterrorism  activities.                                time  1500    The bill also updates the Board's charter to effectively respond to  tomorrow's challenges and requires the Secretary to appoint a  coordinator for counterterrorism to oversee the Board's activities.   Additionally, this legislation requires the CTAB to advise the  Secretary of Homeland Security on the issuance of terrorism alerts,  ensuring that top counterterrorism intelligence officials play a key  role in developing these critical notices and providing them to the  public.   Finally, this bill ensures continued congressional oversight by  requiring DHS to report on the status and activities of the CTAB so  that they can be certain it is meeting its mandate.   I thank Chairman McCaul from the Homeland Security Committee for  appointing me to lead the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist  and Foreign Fighter Travel last year. This task force produced 32 key  findings and more than 50 recommendations, one of which serves as a  basis of the legislation before us today.   I am proud to say we have now acted legislatively on more than half  of the task force's findings, largely thanks to the hard work of the  members of the task force and their willingness to work across the  aisle in a bipartisan manner.   I also thank Mr. Thompson, my colleague in the minority, for working  in a bipartisan manner on this and many other bills that we have before  us today.   I will end by urging my colleagues to support this measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge  Members to support this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. McClintock). The question is on the  motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the  House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 526, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 665) to modernize and enhance airport perimeter and access  control security by requiring updated risk assessments and the  development of security strategies, and for other purposes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 665, the Airport  Perimeter and Access Control Security Act, sponsored by my good friend  and colleague, Congressman Keating.   Over the course of the last year, we have seen a disturbing number of  attacks against airports and aircrafts overseas and around the world.  And in every instance, the integrity of the airport security  infrastructure and the insider threat have been of serious concern.   It is critical that we scrutinize the security effectiveness of our  Nation's airports and ensure that the public can have confidence that  their travels will be safe and secure during the high-threat  environment.   This important piece of legislation requires that the TSA's  comprehensive risk assessment of perimeter and access control security  is more regularly updated and that TSA conducts a sector-wide  assessment of airport access control vulnerabilities and mitigation  efforts, something TSA has not done across the board since 2012,  despite multiple security breaches at airports across the country.   We cannot solely focus on the effectiveness of our passenger  screening checkpoints, while allowing lapses in security around the  airport perimeter and within the sterile area of airport. A dead bolt  on a front door does no good if the back door is left wide open.   As partners on the Transportation and Protective Security  Subcommittee, Congressman Keating and I have seen firsthand disturbing  vulnerabilities at airports across the United States. I commend his  efforts to help enhance security for the American people.   While there may be gridlock and partisan bickering at times in other  places here in Washington, on the Homeland Security Committee, we all  share an unshakable commitment to ensuring the security of the  traveling public because we know that the consequence of failure is too  great.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Keating for introducing this  important legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I close, I commend my colleague for  his unwavering dedication to this issue. His passion has shown through  in the committee hearings and throughout my time with him in Congress  and I commend him for it. I look forward to working on this and other  issues with him moving forward.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 665.   I yield back the balance of my time.
