Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 4900, the SBIR and STTR  Extension Act of 2022.   Let me begin by thanking Ranking Member Luetkemeyer and my colleagues  on the Senate Small Business Committee and the House Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology for their work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank Chairwoman Eddie Bernice  Johnson, who is retiring at the end of this Congress. Her knowledge and  expertise of the programs were pivotal to these negotiations.   Today's bill extends the SBIR and STTR programs and six related pilot  programs for 3 years. Reauthorizing them is vital to thousands of small  businesses and research institutions that partner with 11 agencies to  develop solutions to some of our country's most difficult challenges.   Since their founding 40 years ago, SBIR and STTR have launched some  of our Nation's most innovative enterprises and products that have  become household names. Companies like iRobot, Sonicare electric  toothbrushes, 23andMe, LASIK eye surgery, and Qualcomm wireless  communications all got their start through SBIR/STTR.  [[Page H8133]]    More innovative technology is on the way. In fiscal year 2021 alone,  Federal agencies leveraged nearly $4 billion in awards to back 4,000  small businesses and nearly 7,000 projects. Awardees are leading the  way in our efforts to fight climate change, modernize manufacturing,  and create breakthroughs in lifesaving medical technologies.   S. 4900 gives them the ability to continue their work and lead  America's innovation by providing stability to both the small  businesses and agencies for the next 3 years.   It builds on efforts to strengthen Federal research security through  due diligence reviews to prevent malign foreign countries from stealing  technologies developed through SBIR and STTR.   It also establishes higher benchmarks for more experienced firms to  commercialize their technologies and includes various studies and more  detailed reporting to increase oversight and inform future program  changes.   Unfortunately, S. 4900 does not include everything we wanted to  accomplish during this reauthorization, but I remain committed to  coming together again in the future to have those conversations.   Our monthslong bipartisan and bicameral negotiations will avoid a  devastating lapse and protect thousands of jobs. Today, we are here  considering a hard-fought compromise to reauthorize the SBIR and STTR  programs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens), the chairwoman of the Science, Space, and  Technology Subcommittee on Research and Technology.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H8135]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   The U.S. has the most dynamic small business ecosystem on the planet,  and this 3-year extension ensures that our country remains one of the  most innovative in the world.   The SBIR and STTR are essential components of that global  competitiveness. They give small businesses a role in developing  groundbreaking technologies that make our lives better in a variety of  ways.   This program boosts American security, innovation, and  entrepreneurship. That is why we must act today to extend them and  ensure our country continues to reap these benefits into the future.   Stakeholders, from individual small business owners to research  universities to the Department of Defense, have made it clear that even  a temporary shutdown would be disastrous.   Throughout these negotiations, we have not always seen eye to eye,  but I am thankful we all remain committed to keeping the programs open.   We have come up with a compromise that provides stability for small  businesses and the agencies they partner with, reduces the risk that  foreign adversaries can steal U.S. technologies developed through SBIR  and STTR, and preserves the competitive and merit-based strength of  these programs.   Mr. Speaker, this is not the end, and there will be more work to do  in the coming years. I pledge to continue to work to improve the  programs.   I, again, thank my colleagues involved with reauthorization for all  of their work leading up to today, including the members of the  Committee on Small Business who participated in many hearings and  briefings over the course of the past 2 years.  [[Page H8136]]    I also thank the staff on the House Committees on Small Business and  Science, Space, and Technology for their dedication and tireless work  to get us to this point: Dahlia Sokolov, Rebecca Callahan, Sara Barber,  Elizabeth Barczak, Catherine Johnson, Jenn Wickre, Giulia Leganski,  Robert Yavor, Delia Barr, Ellen Harrington, and Kevin Wheeler, who have  been living and breathing SBIR for most of their time on the Hill,  including this year as they worked around the clock, days, nights, and  weekends. I sincerely thank each of them.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the SBIR and STTR  Extension Act of 2022 to provide stability and certainty to small firms  and agencies alike, and I yield back the balance of my time.
