 Madam Speaker, I rise today to comment on one  portion of the rule, H.R. 8987, which is a bill that is incredibly  important to me and to those that I represent. As a matter of fact, I  drafted the legislation. On August 5, I had introduced the language as  part of H.R. 8667. We garnered bipartisan support for this very  important bill.   What the bill does is finally make whole so many of our families that  were affected by 9/11 because they lost loved ones, but they were not  compensated properly under the United States Victims of State Sponsored  Terrorist Fund.   So we are talking about 5,347 widows and children that were excluded  from this fund by this body; and it was an injustice that should have  never been allowed to happen. As a result of their initial exclusion,  widows and children missed the first two payments of the USVSST fund,  creating a massive disparity between their restorative justice payments  and others that were included.   This bill would catch up those widows and children to the other  victim groups and ensure that, moving forward, they are no longer left  out, forgotten, or excluded. So this bill is truly about fairness and  doing what is right for the wives and the children or the husbands and  the children of our first responders killed on September 11.   Twenty-one years later, this House is finally going to do the right  thing, and I am very happy to have played a part in helping them move  this forward.   In the gallery I have a special guest, Angela Mistrulli, who is the  head of the 9/11 Children for Justice. She is a tireless advocate who  has been affected personally, and I thank her for working with our  office over the last 6 months and the advocacy of all of her members in  seeing this through. I hope all my colleagues support this on the floor  when it comes up later today.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge that we amend  the rule to also include H.R. 7967, which is the Prosecutors Need to  Prosecute Act. My legislation would hold prosecutors accountable and  create transparency by letting the public know how many cases  prosecutors are declining to prosecute, the number of offenses  committed by career criminals, and the number of criminals released.    Over the past 2 years, we have seen a disturbing trend in progressive  district attorneys in cities across the country who are refusing to  prosecute violent criminal offenders. Look no further than my city of  New York, our city of New York, where Manhattan District Attorney Alvin  Bragg released a Day 1 memo initially directing his staff not to  prosecute certain crimes, including drug possession, trespassing, sex  trading, driving with a suspended license, resisting arrest, and public  obscenity. He even directed his staff to downgrade felony charges filed  by our police, including armed robbery, weapons charges, and drug  dealing.   Worst of all, his office will no longer seek sentences of life  without parole, which means that the most heinous murderers, including  terrorists, serial killers, cop killers, and perps who kill young  children in connection with sex crimes will be released back onto our  streets in 20 years or less.   These policies have sent a clear message to the criminals. It is, go  ahead, break the law because we will not enforce it. With prosecutors  that refuse to prosecute, violent career super-criminals are free to  wreak havoc on our streets.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question today so we can  hold woke prosecutors accountable for failing to do their jobs and  protect.   We want to be able to add this legislation to the rule because it is  incredibly important that the public knows which prosecutors are  refusing to do their job; and as we saw in San Francisco, they did  repeal one of their prosecutors. Many States, like ours, do not have a  recall law, but this would give them the information they need to make  informed decisions when it comes to selecting who is going to be the  prosecutors for their cities, because prosecutors should actually be  prosecuting crimes. They should not be acting like criminal defense  attorneys.                                time  0945     Madam Speaker, I understand that my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle don't believe in transparency, that they  believe this information should be kept from the public. But these  prosecutors work for us.   Quite frankly, crime has soared in my city. People are getting  killed. People are getting assaulted. Nearly every single category of  crime has risen in New York City, and our prosecutors are refusing to  put people behind bars.   If the Democrats feel that public safety and crime skyrocketing in  America's cities is not an issue, that explains why you support  defunding the police, bail reform, and all of these ridiculous  policies.    Mr. Speaker, although 21 years have passed, the pain  we experienced on September 11, 2001, when terrorists unleashed deadly  and calculated destruction across our country has not faded.   Those that have empty chairs at their dinner tables, the widows, the  widowers, the children of those that perished in that attack, they are  still fighting for their entitled compensation under the United States  Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.   Frankly, the exclusion of the 5,364 widows and children from this  fund was an injustice that Congress should have never allowed to  happen. As a result of their initial exclusion, widows and children  missed the first two payments from the terrorism fund, creating a  massive disparity between their restorative justice payments that  others, including people like Madeline Bergin and Jeanette Schardt from  my district, who lost their husbands, FDNY firefighters, on that  dreadful day.   This bill, which I drafted and introduced on August 5, would catch up  widows and children to our victims' groups and ensure that moving  forward they are no longer left out, forgotten, or excluded. This bill  rights a grave wrong that should have been corrected long ago.   Today with us earlier was Angela Mistrulli, the head of the 9/11  Children for Justice, someone who was also affected, a tireless  advocate for the widows and children and someone who has become a good  friend to me and my office.   For nearly 6 months we had been working together on this issue and  this legislation. Today, I am proud that the work we have done is being  brought to this floor and that the widows and children are one step  closer to their entitled compensation.   I thank Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Jordan, Chris Smith, and my  other colleague, Kathleen Rice, who made this a bipartisan bill, for  their support and their help in getting this done.   President Truman once said, ``It is amazing what you can accomplish  when you do not care who gets the credit.'' This case is no different.   So many people have come together from across the political spectrum  to correct a wrong that should have been done, as I said, years ago. I  am so proud and honored to have been a part of this process and  bringing these wonderful people, people who lost so much, some justice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member in this Chamber, on both sides of  the aisle, to vote in support of this legislation.
