 Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to talk about a  very special constituent from Florida's Seventh Congressional District.   Eugene Henleben was born in St. Louis 100 years ago on February 7. He  served our great Nation on a PT boat during the Second World War and on  an aircraft carrier in the Korean war.   After the war, Eugene moved to Chicago where he met his beautiful  wife. They married in 1950 and had three children they raised in  Glenview, Illinois.   He spent most of his civilian career working as an engineer, and in  1992, he moved to the great city of Longwood, Florida, where he has  lived ever since.  [[Page H746]]    Today, I am honored to recognize Eugene's service to our country and  celebrate an incredible milestone in his life.   Our Nation's veterans are the backbone of this country. To Eugene, I  say thank you for your incredible service and your sacrifice in the two  wars that you fought for this Nation.   I wish you many more years to come with your family, and I thank you  for your time and your dedication.                            ____________________
