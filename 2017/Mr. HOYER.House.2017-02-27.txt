 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Peoria. Well,  maybe not exactly Peoria, but Bradley University.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor one of the most decent, patriotic  Americans with whom I have ever served in any legislative body. I had  the great honor of being Bob Michel's friend, the great honor of being  his colleague, and the great honor of believing that what Bob Michel  represented in this Congress was the best of us, the most decent of us,  the most considerate of us, and deeply committed to his country and  [[Page H1344]]  respectful of those with whom he served, perhaps differing with them,  but, nevertheless, deeply respectful of his colleagues. He and Tip  O'Neill were good friends. They could argue their side and their  policies vigorously but be the best of friends after we adjourned that  day.   I thank my colleague from Illinois for leading this tribute, and I  rise to join in remembering this great man, a great American leader,  Bob Michel.   Mr. Speaker, Bob's entire life was given to service to his country.  From his time in the Army as an infantryman on the front lines of the  fight for democracy in the Second World War to his long career in  government, Leader Michel sought to make America and the world safer  and to protect the American Dream for all of our people.   Mr. Speaker, I did not want to lose the majority in 1994, but when we  lost, I lamented the fact that Bob Michel did not become the Speaker of  the House of Representatives. In my opinion, if he had, America would  be a more civil place today and this body would be a more collegial  body than it is.   I want to congratulate the gentleman who represents Bob Michel's  district now, succeeding in that office, his father, who is a very dear  and close friend of mine. All three of them represented the best of  that which America hopes would serve it well.   Bob Michel and I didn't always agree on policy, Mr. Speaker, but as  colleagues, we worked together to reach consensus and achieve results.  I remember in 1989 when Tony Coelho and I were working to pass the  House's version of what would become the landmark Americans with  Disabilities Act. It was Bob Michel who saw how important this  legislation would be and asked my friend, Steve Bartlett from Texas to  work with me, from the Republican side of the aisle, to achieve a  bipartisan version that could become law. That is how Bob Michel  operated.   This House would be a better House if we followed the example of Bob  Michel. He saw a problem and looked for a way we could come together  around a compromised solution, not focused first on confrontation. His  decency and friendliness were as evident as his seriousness as a  legislator.   As Republican whip and leader, he set an example of how to lead an  effective opposition based not on obstruction, but on identifying ways  to work together to achieve common goals. To that extent, and in so  many other ways, as I have said, Bob Michel represented the best of us.   Now, Bob, Mr. Speaker, could be tough. He could be really tough. He  knew how to defend his party's interests and advance its goals in the  minority. But Bob believed strongly that we who are sent here by our  constituents have, first and foremost, a responsibility to make policy,  not to play politics. And that is how Bob Michel served--by always,  always, always putting country first. Mr. Speaker, I hope his example  will be an inspiration to all who serve today.   I join in extending my condolences to Bob's children--Scott, Bruce,  Robin, and Laurie--and the entire Michel family. I join the people of  Illinois' 18th District in mourning the man who was their champion for  so many years. Illinois, this House, and our country lost a great  light, but one, I hope, that will continue to shine through its  reflection in those whom Bob Michel inspired. I was one of those. We  will miss him. There aren't enough Bob Michels.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Leader Hoyer for those warm  words and inspiring words and heartfelt words for Leader Michel. It  means so much for his family, for all of us in Peoria, and for all of  his colleagues.   I want to thank everybody here tonight from the Illinois delegation  that spoke so fondly about Mr. Michel. When we think about the traits  that he exemplified--integrity, sincerity, humility, genuineness, and  civility--that everybody talked about here tonight, I think it is also  important to remember where he came from in Illinois.   The congressional district that he represented, the 18th  Congressional District, was the same district that Congressman Abraham  Lincoln represented from 1847 to 1849. It is also the same  congressional district that Everett Dirksen represented and that Bob  Michel represented for 38 years, and you think about the values that  they all exemplified, those strong midwestern values they never forgot.   The other thing that is unique about all three is they were all  buried within 1 hour of each other. Oak Ridge Cemetery, President  Lincoln; Pekin Cemetery, Everett Dirksen; and this last weekend, Leader  Michel in Peoria, Illinois. Bob Michel could have been buried in  Arlington Cemetery in a beautiful grave, but he chose to be buried next  to the love of his life in Peoria, Illinois. That says a lot about the  person that he was. I think it is unique that, within an hour's drive,  you can go see all three of their graves, but I think it reflects the  midwestern values that he had and those traits.                                time  2015    The other thing that I just want to mention here in closing is that  he served his 14 years as the Republican leader, the longest of anyone  in this institution as a leader of the minority party. But he also had  a number of people that he mentored and tutored: from Jack Kemp, to  Trent Lott, to Dick Cheney, to Newt Gingrich; people that served under  him, and he mentored in their positions, and that should not be lost.   Bob Michel was a conservative Republican, but the way that he went  about the work that he did, his style of civility and treating friend  and foe alike, and being able to work across party lines when he needed  to made this institution a better place. We need more people like Bob  Michel in public service. He is a shining example of what public  service should be. I couldn't be prouder to serve in the same  congressional district that he represented for 38 years.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, he made us proud to be from Peoria, Illinois. He  made this institution a better place. He made this country a better  place by his service of over 50 years.   Tonight we say: Mr. Leader, rest in peace.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  former Congressman, respected mentor, and good friend Bob Michel.   Bob was a war hero earning two Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart, and  four battle stars. He was also one of the most respected members of  Congress of all time. His 38 years of service in the U.S. House of  Representatives and the incredible footprint he left on Central  Illinois and this country will never be forgotten.   Bob's ability to reach across the aisle to make a divided government  work for the people he represented was second to none, a trait we  should all strive to emulate each day. Bob taught me that  bipartisanship matters and working together to get things done is even  more important in the polarized environment we have today. That's where  Bob Michel excelled and that's the legacy I'm going to remember.   Finally, Bob taught me to be myself, to always do what I think is  right for my constituents, and to not be afraid to go home and explain  why I voted the way I did. I was honored to attend Bob's funeral this  past Saturday, along with many others who knew and loved him. My  thoughts and prayers are with his family. He will truly be missed.                            ____________________
