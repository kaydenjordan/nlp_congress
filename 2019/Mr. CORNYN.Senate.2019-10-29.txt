 Mr. President, this isn't part of the remarks I had  planned for, but let me just surprise the Senator from Ohio and say I  agree with him. We need to pass a transportation bill.   He mentioned some of the union workers he was talking to this  morning, and they want Congress to function as it should, which means  we should pass our appropriations bills, the Transportation, Housing  and Urban Development bill that the Senator from Maine is the bill  manager on. We ought to do all of our appropriations bills, including  keeping our commitment to our men and women in the military by passing  the Defense appropriations bill.   Unfortunately, we know that politics has overwhelmed our ability to  function here in Congress, and the Democrats, for some reason, decided  to filibuster the Defense appropriations bill just recently.   What I worry about is this obsession with politics and dividing the  Nation 12 months before the next general election, when everybody who  is a registered voter will have a chance to vote on the next President  of the United States. We are going to let that dominate our discussions  to the failure of our ability to actually pass appropriations bills,  fund the military, and fund a highway bill, which would provide much  needed infrastructure development all across our country, including the  fast-growing States like those the Presiding Officer and I happen to  come from.   So I hope that the growing sense I have that we are simply going to  quit functioning a year out before the election, because of the  obsession over politics and impeachment mania, does not prove to be  true. But the storm clouds are on the horizon, and I am becoming  increasingly convinced that, unfortunately, that is the only thing  Speaker Pelosi and the House Democrats care about, and our ability to  actually get our work done is going to be tragically squandered.                        Death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi    Mr. President, let me talk about some good news. Of course, this  weekend, the world celebrated as the hunt for the leader of ISIS--the  latest terrorist organization that has dominated the news--finally came  to an end, and President Trump announced the successful raid by U.S.  troops that led to the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world's No. 1  terrorist. This, of course, is reminiscent of that effort under the  Obama administration to take out Osama Bin Laden years after he led the  effort to kill 3,000 Americans on 9/11 in New York and here in  Washington at the Pentagon.   With the elimination of the ISIS caliphate earlier this year, it was  only a matter of time before al-Baghdadi would run out of places to  hide. I want to say how much I admire and appreciate the courage and  the dedication of the men and women who contributed to  [[Page S6217]]  this raid and who actually made it happen. This is an amazing  combination of talent, training, intelligence, and cooperation with our  partners in the Middle East that led to this incredible and successful  effort. I am grateful to our military leaders, our intelligence  professionals, our servicemembers, and our allies who have been  tirelessly working for this goal for years.   I applaud President Trump for making the difficult decision to put  American troops in harm's way. Fortunately, it did not result in any  loss of life or injuries, I am told, for the troops who actually  executed the raid, but let's give credit where credit is due. Just as  President Obama deserved credit for making the difficult decision to  take out Obama Bin Laden, President Trump should be entitled to credit  for making the difficult but important and correct decision to take out  ISIS's leader.   Because of the decisive action and flawless execution of troops on  the ground, it was a great day for freedom-loving people and for all  Americans that the world's No. 1 most wanted man was brought to  justice.   Coincidentally, yesterday, I was in Austin speaking to the Mortgage  Bankers Association, and Admiral McRaven came on right after me. It was  an amazing coincidence and a real treat for the mortgage bankers who,  after I got through talking to them, got to hear from the man who led  the raid that brought down Osama bin Laden in 2011. It was a remarkable  moment to reflect on our Nation's ongoing fight to eradicate terrorism  and the great leaders and the great professionals who have contributed  to our efforts to keep America safe.   It is important that we all remember that the fight is not yet won  and that it actually may never be finally concluded. We must remain  committed to working with our allies in the region and around the world  to continue to eliminate terrorism wherever we can and prevent its  resurgence.   As I indicated earlier, later this week, the Senate will begin voting  on spending bills to fund the Department of Defense so that they can  continue this fight, and it would be ironic, indeed, if our Democratic  colleagues thwarted our efforts to fund the Department of Defense once  again in the wake of this incredible accomplishment by those  professionals.   Last month, Democrats blocked us from even considering the defense  spending bill. They decided their seemingly never-ending disputes with  President Trump transcend national security.   I hope this weekend's announcement has brought this decision into  some perspective. We need to quickly pass the defense spending bill to  ensure that our military will not be impacted by these political games.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, on another matter, I continue to hear from my  constituents back home about the number of Texans who are struggling to  cover the cost of their prescription medication. We know that  deductibles, particularly under the Affordable Care Act, have gotten to  be very high.   As a matter of fact, it is not uncommon to hear people say that they  have a deductible of $5,000 or more. The copays they have to pay for  prescription drugs, strangely enough, in their deductible--the $5,000  you would have to pay under your Affordable Care Act policy--they get  none of the benefit of the negotiated discount or rebates that the drug  companies get with prescription pharmacy benefit managers. That does  not flow to the consumer. Actually, consumers are being treated much  worse than the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies are  and deriving virtually no benefit.    I have heard stories. We had one particularly profound story about a  woman whose son is diabetic. He became an adult, and she described how  purchasing his insulin affected many of his decisions, such as moving  out of the house, getting a job, whether or not to marry, basically  because he had to manage the high cost of the copay for the insulin  that was necessary to preserve his life.   Unfortunately, as in many cases, people end up self-rationing their  drugs to make them last longer, and that is at a great health risk to  them, to skip doses or to take less or to otherwise not follow their  doctor's orders.   People are frustrated and confused. They are increasingly worried  about how they and their loved ones are going to continue to cover  these rising costs, and they want to know what Congress intends to do  about it. I frequently tell the folks back home that the most  frustrating moments in Washington, DC, are when the White House and  Congress agree and when Republicans and Democrats agree that something  is a problem and needs to be done, but nothing gets done. That is a  hard one to explain. Everybody says yes, we need to deal with high  prescription drug costs, but we don't seem to be capable of getting  things done.   I am always happy to share updates about the progress we make within  our committees, such as the Finance and Judiciary Committees I serve  on. Unfortunately, when it comes to getting a bill across the floor of  the U.S. Senate, it has proved to be an insurmountable challenge.   We have spent a lot of time hearing from patients, healthcare  providers, drugmakers, and other experts about prescription drug costs,  and it is admittedly a very complex topic, but I think a lot of the  folks involved in the business sort of enjoy that black box they  operate in and they are afraid of the transparency that would actually  reveal who is getting the money and why it is that the savings don't  flow to consumers.   We have been looking at every stop a drug takes in route, from  research and development to the shelf of your medicine cabinet. We have  seen some things that are pretty alarming. There are pharmaceutical  CEOs earning big bonuses, of course, as sales go up. I am not opposed  to CEOs getting paid well for new lifesaving and innovative drugs, but  I am if they do it at the expense of consumers. We have seen pharmacy  benefit managers who negotiate backdoor rebates and drive up out-of- pocket costs. Of course, there are also pharmaceutical companies that  game the patent system to stave off competition as long as possible.   In one of our Finance Committee hearings, I was able to ask the CEO  of AbbVie about their product HUMIRA, which is the most commonly  prescribed drug in America today, I believe. It is the poster child for  the kind of gamesmanship that I think ought to infuriate all of us.   HUMIRA is a wonderful drug. It is used to treat arthritis and a  number of other conditions, and it has been available for about 15  years. One might think that would be sufficient time to cover the  patent period and that a more generic or biosimilar alternative might  be available, which would be cheaper, much to the benefit of consumers.  You would be wrong.   AbbVie currently has 136 patents and 247 applications on HUMIRA. In  fact, the maze of patents on HUMIRA is so complex that there is no  biosimilar available in America. This jumbled network of patents makes  it nearly impossible for a competitor to come into the market. To date,  there are five competitors to HUMIRA in Europe--five--but not in  America, not to the benefit of American consumers. All of these five  competitors that sell a biosimilar alternative to HUMIRA in Europe are  blocked from selling it in the United States until 2023. That is not an  accident.   Again, I don't begrudge companies that discover lifesaving and  innovative drugs getting the coverage of a patent for the appropriate  period of time because that is where they recoup their research and  development costs, and unfortunately not all of these drug discoveries  turn out with a good story. But this strikes me as gamesmanship and an  abuse of the system. Patents were intended to guard intellectual  property and encourage researchers to pour time and resources into  developing these new drugs. These drugmakers aren't just using the  patent system to protect their intellectual property; they are abusing  it, to the detriment of consumers, to increase their bottom line.   Earlier this year, I introduced a bill with our colleague from  Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, to take aim at this practice. The  Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act disarms the so-called patent  thickets to enable competitors to come to market sooner. This bill  streamlines the litigation  [[Page S6218]]  process by limiting the number of patents these companies can use so  companies can spend less time in the courtroom. Competitors would be  able to resolve patent issues faster and bring their drugs to market  sooner. Better competition, I am convinced, means better prices for  patients.   Our country is a leader in pharmaceutical innovation, partly because  we offer robust protection for intellectual property. And that is a  good thing, but we have to do more to stop the bad actors taking  advantage of those innovation protections in order to maintain their  monopoly at the expense of the American people. That is exactly what  the legislation I have introduced with Senator Blumenthal would do. By  the way, it passed unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.   The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act doesn't stifle  innovation, it doesn't limit patent rights, and it doesn't cost  taxpayers a dime. In fact, just the opposite is true. The Congressional  Budget Office released a cost estimate for this bill and found that it  would lower spending by more than half a billion dollars over 10 years.  And that is just savings to the Federal Government for Medicare and  Medicaid; there undoubtedly would be additional savings for consumers  in their private health insurance.    Despite the fact that this legislation received the unanimous support  of the Judiciary Committee in June, it has yet to make it to the Senate  floor for a vote. As it turns out, I am informed that the minority  leader, the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, is leading the charge  in blocking the Senate's ability to consider that bill.   Our colleague the minority leader loves to say that the Senate is a  legislative graveyard because we haven't voted on a number of  ultrapartisan bills passed by the House, but when it comes to passing  the bills that actually have bipartisan support--bills that could  actually pass both Chambers and become law--it looks as though the  minority leader has become the gravedigger-in-chief. Why he would  refuse to allow a vote on a bill cosponsored by one of his own Members  that would lower drug costs for patients across the country and save  more than half a billion dollars over 10 years for taxpayers is beyond  me. It seems like a no-brainer. Again, I am afraid that politics may  have once again interfered with our Democratic colleague's interest in  making sound public policy.   While our Democratic colleagues continue their crusade to remove the  President from office, the American people's lives aren't getting any  easier. Their lives aren't on hold such that they could just simply  wait out the politics that seems to crowd out good public policy in  Washington, DC. We know for sure that their prescription medications  aren't getting any cheaper. So I would urge our colleague, the Senate  minority leader, to quit blocking the bipartisan bill I have discussed  today so that our constituents--all of our constituents--in Texas, New  York, Maine, and all over the country can begin to enjoy some relief  from their mounting out-of-pocket drug costs.   I yield the floor.
