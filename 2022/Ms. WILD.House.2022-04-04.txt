 Madam Speaker, I rise today not just as the Representative  for Pennsylvania's Seventh District, but also as the Representative of  one of the largest Ukrainian-American communities in our entire  country.   Today, my constituents are gutted. These horrific images of Bucha are  seared into their hearts and minds forever. When they see these images,  they are thinking of their sons and daughters, brothers and sisters,  mothers and fathers, and aunts and uncles who have gone from living  peaceful lives to being martyrs in an unprovoked war of choice that had  absolutely no reason for occurring.   When we see these images, we need to think of an average suburban  neighborhood here in the United States and try to imagine what it would  be like to have our homes, our families, our neighbors destroyed  without provocation, without any cause whatsoever.   I look at this photo of a woman with freshly manicured nails, and as  any woman viewing this knows, when she had her nails done, perhaps in  anticipation of an evening out with friends, this victim of slaughter  wasn't imagining that her beautiful bright red nails were going to be  displayed around the world as evidence of carnage.   There is enormous grief in my community, and there is enormous  righteous anger and indignation. I am here to echo that anger and that  indignation and to say that we will not accept this. We will stand up  against it.   The United Nations Security Council must authorize an independent  investigation into the crimes that were committed in Bucha. Since  Russia will almost certainly veto, it is crucial that we immediately  find another path to move forward with such an investigation. This is  not up to Vladimir Putin. His crimes are now for the world to judge and  for history to record. Now is not the time for messaging resolutions by  the United Nations and others. It is time for action by every  democratic country in the world. We cannot stand back.   As the Nobel Laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel said,  ``Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when  human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become  irrelevant. Wherever  [[Page H4130]]  men or women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or  political views, that place must--at that moment--become the center of  the universe.''    Ukraine must be the center of the universe right now, for as long as  it takes. The Grammy Awards, the NCAA tournaments, and our favorite  television shows are a welcome diversion, but let that diversion be  short. Don't lose focus of the center of the universe, which right now  must be Ukraine.   The work of delivering justice can start here. Every democratic  country must investigate and ensure that implicated Russian officials,  oligarchs, and their families are barred from entering their borders.  Together, the international community must come together to send the  message that no country can commit war crimes and see them go  unpunished.   I urge President Biden to take the step I called on him to take back  in the first week of March. Work with our European allies to take all  Russian financial institutions, not just some, off the SWIFT system.  The cost of this invasion must be beyond unsustainable for Putin and  the oligarchs around him. It must become literally unbearable.   But we must do more. We must provide the Ukrainian people with the  full range of military aid that they need--drones, armored vehicles,  machine guns, planes, night vision devices, every single weapon of war  that they need for their defense. And time is of the essence.   It goes without saying that continued humanitarian assistance must be  provided on an ongoing basis. The fact that we have private American  citizens--and I know some of them--who are delivering medical supplies  and other necessities into Ukraine more quickly than we or our NATO  allies are is incomprehensible. But I also laud those citizens.   The extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people is a  challenge to us all. How much will they have to bear? How long will we  let these crimes continue? Enough is enough.   We will never forget. We will never lose sight of the fact that our  shared humanity is at stake in this barbaric invasion. The Ukrainian  people and justice and democracy will prevail. The Ukrainians will come  out as the heroes of this story when it is told in the history books.  But let us, too, come out as the helpers, the ones who did everything  we possibly could to help them achieve victory and restore their  country.                            ____________________
