 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris for his  leadership for many, many years. He is an extraordinary physician-- Johns Hopkins and so many other places where he has been an  anesthesiologist, and we are so grateful for the expertise and  precision that he brings. Doctors can focus in a way that makes it so  clear and so nonambiguous.   In defense of life, never has that message been more important than  now because there is so much fuzziness, so much distortion, and it is  about time clarity breaks out when it comes to the abortion issue. We  have never had that national debate.   In a way, we have had it in a minor way, in a micro way. Every time a  woman goes in and has an ultrasound, she walks away seeing her baby  still in utero. The first baby pictures today, as we all know, are not  newborns. On the refrigerators all across America, the first baby  pictures happen to be unborn babies, and we all are thrilled when we  see our children and grandchildren up on the refrigerator as an unborn  baby. That is the first thing they see as they begin to comprehend what  they are looking at: ``That is me while I was still in Mommy.''   As Dr. Harris pointed out in his opening, the Supreme Court does take  up this case next week, NIFLA v. Becerra, the California law that  requires medically licensed pregnancy centers to advertise for the  abortion industry by putting up notices. Telling clients where to get  free and low-cost abortions is an egregious--an egregious--violation of  the First Amendment Free Speech Clause.   The government should not compel, should not coerce an organization  or organizations and the people behind them to facilitate the  dismemberment and chemical poisoning of unborn children, which is  exactly what abortion is. The sophistry of choice cloaks the deed, and  the deed is all about taking that child apart through dismemberment or  through a chemical poison.    Dr. Harris spoke earlier about ultrasounds. We know that when  abortion is done, many types of abortions, they use an ultrasound.  Ultrasound-guided abortions make it easier for them to dismember the  child. And it was Abby Johnson who ran a clinic, was director of a  clinic in Texas for about 8 years, a Planned Parenthood  [[Page H1594]]  clinic, who quit when she finally saw on that screen an ultrasound- guided abortion and was repelled and repulsed by how that child was  being killed by a so-called physician. She was repulsed. She became a  very strong pro-lifer since then.   Let me say one thing about pregnancy care centers. There are about  2,752 in the country, according to Heartbeat International, and the  numbers are growing. There are many in my district, like Dr. Harris  said are in his as well.   A few years ago, my wife and I went to a pregnancy care banquet in  Middlesex County, New Jersey. Two women got up and spoke so eloquently  and with tears in their eyes about how they were scheduled and actually  en route to the abortion at the clinic, and there were these  compassionate women, selfless women who said: Please reconsider. Please  take a look at the alternatives. We will help you.   Both of those women turned around, two different times, and went back  and had their babies.   With tears in their eyes, two young girls got up a little later, and  at first we thought they were just going to talk about how committed  they were to life. They talked about school and sports and boys, but at  the end of their talk, they looked at the director of the pregnancy  care center and her volunteers and thanked them for being there outside  that abortion clinic that day, the day that their moms were scheduled  to abort them.   Mr. Speaker, in an amicus brief submitted by a head of the NIFLA v.  Becerra oral arguments, 13 women told their stories of the care and the  hope that they received from pregnancy care centers, and here, briefly,  is Angela's story.   Angela grew up in a very difficult household and turned to drugs when  she was 14 years old. Angela continued to wrestle with addiction and,  at 31, discovered she was pregnant. Although she made an appointment  for an abortion, she decided to keep the baby.   Because of her addiction and the circumstance of her pregnancy, she  felt she could not turn to her family for support, so she found a  pregnancy care center. This one was in New York.   At her first appointment, staff showed Angela her baby through an  ultrasound.                                time  1900    Mr. Speaker, let me remind you that Dr. Bernard Nathanson, the  cofounder of NARAL, who said, ``I have come to the agonizing conclusion  that I presided over 60,000 deaths,'' was one of leaders in the sixties  and seventies in promoting abortion throughout this country, and was  very effective at it. When he became pro-life, he said:         If wombs had windows, if every woman prior to an abortion       would see an ultrasound of her baby, she would run out of       that clinic.    Well, the pregnancy care center people in New York showed Angela the  ultrasound, and she was enamored, touched deeply by the baby--her  baby--that she saw on the screen.   They met with her weekly as the pregnancy progressed, always staying  by her side, and a staff member was with her in the hospital when she  delivered.   After Angela gave birth to her son, Cameryn, the staff helped her to  enroll in WIC and to reach out to New York's Department of Social  Services.   She continued to come to the pregnancy center--this is all in the  friend-of-the-court brief--for parenting courses and for support in  staying clean of those drugs that had so hurt her life.   She writes:         I always thought that people were fake, but they are       genuine, particularly at the center. This is who they really       are. They will help me. And they are helping to raise my son.    Looking forward to life now, she credits the center with giving her  support so that she doesn't turn back to drugs.   Women and children across our Nation share similar stories. I have  heard many, many of those stories over my time in the pro-life  movement. And every time you meet one of those women--because we argue,  Dr. Harris and I and all of those in the pro-life movement, that there  are two victims in every abortion. The obvious is the dead child, who  is dismembered or chemically poisoned; and the mother.   And pregnancy care centers are all about life affirmation, loving  them both. And to be told by California, ``You must advertise how to  kill that baby,'' when you are about loving them both, like I said at  the beginning, is an egregious violation of the First Amendment. And I  do believe, and I know Dr. Harris and others on our side of this issue  believe, that the Supreme Court will see that as such and render that  law moot.
