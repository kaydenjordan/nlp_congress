 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, should we do more? Of course, we should do more, but  fentanyl is pouring into our country not only at our ports of entry,  but across our borders. We did do more a week ago bolstering border  security.   Fentanyl is taking too many American lives, and I rise today in  support of the HALT Fentanyl Act. This bill will help to combat the  spread of fentanyl-related substances by permanently listing it as a  schedule I drug, recognizing its deadly effects, giving our communities  yet one more tool in a growing and necessary toolbox.   The smallest amounts of these drugs can kill even just one person,  and laced with other substances, they are taking countless lives.  Accessibility and lethality of these drugs have fueled countless  fatalities. Fentanyl poisoning is the number one cause of death among  adults 18 to 49 years of age, more than cancer, more than heart  disease, and more than car accidents.   In upstate New York, the opioid crisis is devastating our  communities, and it is being fueled by fentanyl. This is the public  health crisis of our lifetime. In my home State, my district in  Sullivan County, New York, has the highest opioid death rate in the  entire State. That is why we are also pushing for Sullivan County to be  designated a Federal High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.   The truth is, every community in America is a victim to the fentanyl  crisis, every family is on the front line of this opioid crisis, and we  must give law enforcement and communities every tool necessary. I am  proud to support this bill. I am proud to support law enforcement and  their efforts to intercede and give them the tools to keep fentanyl out  of our communities and off our streets.
