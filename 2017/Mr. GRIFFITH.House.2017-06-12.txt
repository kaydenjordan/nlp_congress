 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 446, which  would extend the construction commencement deadline for a hydroelectric  project at the Gathright Dam in Alleghany County.   Extensive coordination between the hydroelectric project developer  and the Army Corps and the current difficulties in obtaining a power  purchase agreement have necessitated this construction's start-date  extension.   This legislation has passed the House previously unanimously and was  included in last Congress's House comprehensive energy bill. It is my  hope that this legislation will once again receive overwhelming support  in this Chamber. I appreciate the support of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle.
