 Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to visit this  evening with my Senate colleagues.   This is a special week in Washington, DC, and a number of my  colleagues have paid tribute by attending the memorial or speaking of  those who died in service as fallen police officers. This is our fallen  officers' National Police Week.   In 1962, Congress and the then-President John F. Kennedy designated  May 15 of each year to be Peace Officers Memorial Day, and the week of  May 15 to be National Police Week. Each spring, we take time to recall  the men and women of law enforcement who were lost in the previous  year. Unfortunately, this list has become far, far too long.   Since our Nation's founding, more than 20,000 American law  enforcement officers have sacrificed their lives in service to others.  While I have paid many solemn visits to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial in Washington, DC, to honor, respect, and remember  fallen officers, my visit this year was especially somber. In 2016,  Kansas suffered the loss of three law enforcement officials.   On the Senate floor today, I wish to recognize and to honor these  fallen heroes: Detective Brad Lancaster of the Kansas City Police  Department, Captain Robert ``Dave'' Melton of the Kansas City Police  Department, and Master Deputy Sheriff Brandon Collins of the Johnson  County Sheriff's Office. Their untimely deaths shook their families,  the agencies where these men served, the neighborhoods they protected,  and the communities they lived in. Brandon, Robert, and Brad were not  only law enforcement officers, they were also sons and brothers,  fathers, neighbors, mentors, and friends.   Robert Melton, Brad Lancaster, and Brandon Collins and the 140 other  officers killed in the line of duty in 2016 are being honored this week  in our Nation's Capital. The names of these fallen heroes will be  physically inscribed into the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial, set in stone as an eternal reminder to the Nation of the  service of these men and the debt we owe for their sacrifice on our  behalf. That debt, of course, can never be repaid, but it is certainly  our duty to try.   As Americans honor these men during National Police Week, we must  also remember their families, friends, and fellow officers and the  loved ones they left behind. May God comfort them in their time of  grief and be a source of strength for them. May He also protect all  those who continue to serve and to stand today in harm's way to protect  our communities.   An inscription at the memorial reads: ``In valor there is hope.'' The  losses of Brad Lancaster, Robert Melton, and Brandon Collins have  imposed tremendous sorrow, but our memory of their service to others  and their acts of valor offer Americans hope and inspiration to carry  on their missions, to better our communities, to protect the  vulnerable, and to stand for what is right. As we remember, let us  tirelessly pursue those ends and do all we can to honor the fallen.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
