 Mr. Speaker, I sadly rise today to pay tribute to  Judge Bruce Mosier, who lost his life yesterday; to his lovely and  beautiful wife, Diane; beautiful daughter; and extended family.   The whole of Harris County in Texas loved and respected Judge Bruce  Mosier. Oh, he was a strong and vibrant Democrat, but he was a man  that, whenever you called upon him, he would serve. He loved the law,  practiced, and continued to represent individuals, many of whom could  not help themselves. And, of course, he stood by his wife's side,  championing every effort she made to empower people to vote. He was a  stalwart in the last Presidential election. He continued to encourage  and support all of us to do what is right and to ensure the rights of  all people to vote.   Judge Bruce Mosier served his neighborhood, served his county, served  his State, and served this Nation. I will miss Judge Mosier. I will  miss his friendly smile and his kindness, his willingness to help those  who were just starting in their political or legal career, his  willingness to lift up this country and to be the kind of American that  always had an open mind to anyone, no matter how different they might  be.   So today, my dear friend, Judge Bruce Mosier, may you rest in peace.   Diane, we will continue to love you and honor his legacy, work with  you to continue his dreams and aspirations, and encourage those in this  Nation, our county, and our State to be participatory participants in  the wonderment of democracy in this Nation that is, that was, Judge  Bruce Mosier.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado,  and I thank my good friend from Georgia. It is important to take note  of the value of democracy and the discourse on this floor, and my  friendship with the gentleman from Georgia, but absolute disagreement  with him on our purposes here.   Yes, regulation should be fair, and it should cede to the  administrative process and the administrative laws that dictate how  they should be formulated, and that fairness should be their  underpinnings. But I think my constituents, in terms of the regulatory  scheme, are far more interested in clean water and clean air. They are  far more interested in making sure that consumer products that impact  toddlers and babies are enforced. They are far more interested in  ensuring that there is competition to the FTC, and that there are fair  energy laws to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   Having said that, I am disappointed as well that we are moving  forward on H.R. 5, which is a bill that went through the Judiciary  Committee, and, as my colleague from Colorado said, with 56 new  Members, it did not go through regular order. We are recycling the same  bad bill again.   I rise today to express concern over the number of amendments that  were presented that were good amendments that did not get in. Before I  speak to the amendment I am concerned about, first, I want to speak to  the previous question. I support the gentleman from California (Mr.  Swalwell) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) on a very  important statement, and that is in the tragedy and the heinousness of  9/11, we formulated the 9/11 Commission.   Mr. Speaker, there is no more heinousness than a foreign nation  interfering with the just and fair voting of every American. There are  many who lost their life in the name of one vote, one person. For that  reason, I would make the argument that it is imperative that this bill  be amended to create the commission that will address the question of  foreign intrusion, particularly Russian intrusion and hacking in our  election.   I believe this election was skewed, in spite of the peaceful  democratic transfer of government, which we will all adhere to, but  there is no doubt. This does not compete to 2001 with President Bush in  Florida. It does not compete to 2004 with Mr. Kerry. It is beyond any  kind of comprehension of what happened in this election, a direct  intrusion and skewing of this election. But, more importantly,  protecting the systems of election and the voting rights, the  preciousness of the voting rights, is crucial to democracy.   This commission, independent of any of the committees that should be  working--and I agree, Congress should be working. Senator McCain has  already begun working--a Republican--but this commission would be a  vital asset. So I am certainly disappointed that the amendment I had  that was crucial as relates to cybersecurity to deal with the question  of cyber intrusion was not made in order. It would have been  appropriate for us to have an amendment that would have spoken directly  to the idea of identifying new tactics or techniques that a malicious  actor might deploy, or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion, in  addition to protecting the data that enables cybersecurity firms and  other network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian  intelligence services use.     I thank the gentleman.   This amendment would have been vital to have not only a vigorous  discussion on the floor but also to recognize that cybersecurity has  now become a potential weapon. I have worked on this issue for a decade  as the former chairwoman of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Subcommittee. It was under my subcommittee that we began to look at  electric grids and began to see the enormous power of the cyber world.  My amendment should have been included because we are now faced with  what the cyber world used as a weapon can do. I am disappointed that  that amendment was not made in order. I am disappointed that H.R. 5 is  again before us without regular order, and would hope that we have the  opportunity to vote for and support the previous question to find out  what happened and who conspired to alter our elections in 2016.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and the  underlying bill.   I strongly oppose this rule because it makes in order H.R. 5, the  Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017, which is a radical measure that  could make it impossible to promulgate safety regulations to protect  the public.   I oppose this rule because it would effectively shut down the entire  U.S. regulatory system, amending in one fell swoop every bedrock  existing regulatory statute.   My opposition to H. Res. 33 is amplified by the Rules Committee's  decision to decline to make in order the Jackson Lee Amendment, ``to  provide an exception for regulations that help prevent cyberattacks on  election processes or institutions.''   Apparently, House Republicans are still reluctant to debate the  subject--undisputed by our Intelligence community--of Russian  cyberattacks on American cyber networks and infrastructure.   Key Judgments in the Intelligence Community Assessment's declassified  version of a highly classified report entitled, ``Assessing Russian  Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections,'' have confirmed  that 2016 witnessed the first American presidential election that was  the subject of cyberattacks.   These and other subversive activities have been confirmed to have  been perpetrated by entities allied with the Government of Russia and  were undertaken for the express purpose of influencing the presidential  contest to secure the election of its preferred candidate, Donald  Trump, who made history by becoming the first presidential candidate to  invite a hostile foreign power to launch cyberattacks against his  political opponent.   All three agencies, CIA, FBI and NSA, agree with this judgment.   The so-called Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA), in addition to  this rule, demonstrates the deceptive design of the majority to make it  harder to establish regulations to protect the public by tilting the  entire regulatory system significantly toward special interests.   The bill allows Federal courts without expertise on technical issues  to substitute their judgment for those of the expert federal agencies.   These agencies are staffed with career subject matter experts that  are deeply knowledgeable of the background, context, and history of  agency actions and policy rationale.   For this reason, courts have long deferred to agency experts who are  in the best position to carry out the statutes.   The RAA would end this well-established practice and allow far less  experienced judges to second-guess expert opinion--essentially  sanctioning judicial activism.   The Jackson Lee Amendment, however, would have attuned this dangerous  legislation to provide an exception for regulation upon which Americans  so greatly rely on their government to help prevent cyberattacks on our  highly coveted and esteemed election processes and institutions.   The bill promoted by the majority, calling for accountability from  our Administrative Agencies--fails to answer in accountability to the  threat posed by foreign and domestic invaders on our national cyber  networks.  [[Page H255]]    As the new Congress commences in the People's House, obstructionist  Republicans are circumventing the very procedures by which elected  officials answer the cries of outrage and dismay of desperately  concerned constituents.   To the obstructionist majority perpetuating this restrictive rule,  let me stand firm in the American convictions laid bare by the Jackson  Lee amendment--the system of Checks and Balances established by the  Separation of Powers clause of the Constitution will not be thwarted.   The spirit of the H.R. 5 is clearly designed to stop all regulation  dead in its tracks--no matter the threat to cyber networks, national  security, economy, or the very health and safety of the American  people.   We know that Russia's cyber activities were intended to influence the  election, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about  the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the  institutions of the U.S. government. These actions are unacceptable and  will not be tolerated.   The mission of the Intelligence Community is to seek to reduce the  uncertainty surrounding foreign activities, capabilities, or leaders'  intentions.   On these issues of great importance to U.S. national security, the  goal of intelligence analysis is to provide assessments to decision  makers that are intellectually rigorous, objective, timely, and useful,  and that adhere to tradecraft standards.   Applying these standards helps ensure that the Intelligence Community  provides U.S. policymakers, warfighters, and operators with the best  and most accurate insight, warning, and context, as well as potential  opportunities to advance U.S. national security.   This objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand  complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to  hide or obfuscate their activities.   My amendment would have improved H.R. 5 by exempting only those  regulations critical to making cyber networks invulnerable to attack  from foreign and domestic agencies and individuals.   Specifically, the amendment that the Rules committee disallowed for  presentation on a vote here on the floor today would have provided the  American people an exemption to allow for the prevention of tampering,  alteration, or misappropriation of information by agents of foreign  countries with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining  election processes or institutions.   In particular, restrictions put forth in H.R. 5 could result in  further delay to agencies attempting to take action to help network  defenders better identify new tactics or techniques that a malicious  actor might deploy or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion, in  addition to protecting data that enables cybersecurity firms and other  network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian  intelligence services use.   The Regulatory Accountability Act provides no accountability to the  American public.   Instead, it allows polluting industries and special interests to game  the system and escape accountability for any harm they inflict.   It makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to secure new  public protections and arms industry with numerous tools to avoid their  legal obligations.   The increasing use of cyber-enabled means to undermine democratic  processes at home and abroad, as exemplified by Russia's recent  activities, has made clear that a tool explicitly targeting attempts to  interfere with elections is also warranted.   We cannot afford to let global terroristic threats, in the form of  cyber activities, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow  doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, influence  elections, or undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S.  government.   My amendment would have offered protections guarding the integrity of  our cyber networks, while at the same time allowing the bill to achieve  the proponents' major purposes.   The exceptional Americans we serve deserve a Congress that does its  job and keeps our time-honored institutions functioning.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this rule and the underlying  bill.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 321,  the INSPIRE Women, Act.   I support this legislation because Article 1 Section 8 of the United  States Constitution states our duty ``To promote the Progress of  Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and  Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and  Discoveries . . .''   This includes the education of our next generation of women  considering participation in the fields of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics and to pursue careers in aerospace.   Statistics show that women remain underrepresented in the science and  engineering workforce, although to a lesser degree than in the past,  with the greatest disparities occurring in engineering, computer  science, and the physical sciences (NSF, Science & Engineering  Indicators, 2014).   1. Female scientists and engineers are concentrated in different  occupations than are men, with relatively high shares of women in the  social sciences (58 percent)   2. biological and medical sciences (48 percent)   3. relatively low shares in engineering (13 percent)   4. computer and mathematical sciences (25 percent) (NSF, Science &  Engineering Indicators, 2014).   Women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. workforce, but are much  less represented in particular science and engineering occupations  (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Women in the  Labor Force: A Databook, 2014):   1. 39 percent of chemists and material scientists are women;   2. 27.9 percent of environmental scientists and geoscientists are  women;   3. 15.6 percent of chemical engineers are women;   4. 12.1 percent of civil engineers are women;   5. 8.3 percent of electrical and electronics engineers are women;  [[Page H273]]    6. 17.2 percent of industrial engineers are women; and   7. 7.2 percent of mechanical engineers are women.   These statistics show that measures need to be taken in order to  promote women participation in the fields of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics and to pursue careers in aerospace.   H.R. 321 will support NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS, virtual mentoring  programs using commercially available video chat programs, to pair  National Aeronautics and Space Administration mentors with young  students anywhere in the country.   NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS give young students the opportunity to  interact and learn from real engineers, scientists, and technologists.   H.R. 321 will also support the ``Aspire to Inspire'' Program (A2I),  which engages young girls to present science, technology, engineering,  and mathematics (STEM) career opportunities through the real lives and  jobs of early career women at NASA.   H.R. 321 also promotes the Summer Institute in Science, Technology,  Engineering, and Research (SISTER) program at the Goddard Space Flight  Center designed to increase awareness of, and provide an opportunity  for, female middle school students to be exposed to and explore  nontraditional career fields with Goddard Space Flight Center women  engineers, mathematicians, scientists, technicians, and researchers.   Let me close by urging all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R.  321.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 255 the  ``Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act.''  [[Page H275]]    As a Senior Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security who  sits on the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection,  and Security Technologies, I know well of the need to encourage and  train women to thrive in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and  Mathematics (STEM) fields.   Promoting diversity in the STEM professions is more than just an  idea; it requires an understanding that there is a need to have a  process that will ensure the inclusion of all minorities and women in  all areas of American life.   Studies have found that women make up almost 50 percent of the  workforce.   Studies note that 23 percent of STEM workers are women; however,  women make up 48 percent of workers in all occupations.   Only 26 percent of women who do attain degrees in STEM fields work in  STEM jobs.   According to the most recent available data women are less likely to  focus on the STEM disciplines in undergraduate and graduate studies.   In 1991, women received 29.6 percent of computer science B.A.'s,  compared to just 18.2 percent in 2010.   Jobs in computer systems design and related services, a field  dependent upon high-level math and problem-solving skills, are  projected to grow 45 percent between 2008 and 2018.   There are approximately 6 million women and minority owned businesses  in the United States, representing a significant aspect of our economy.   My home city of Houston, Texas, the energy capital of the world,  knows the importance of professionals in the STEM industries.   It has been reported that the highest-paying STEM occupations are  petroleum engineers with an annual salary of $147,520, architectural  and engineering managers with an annual salary of $138,720, natural  sciences managers with an annual salary of $136,450, computer and  information systems managers with an annual salary of $136,280, and  physicists with a reported annual salary of $117,300.   There is an increasing demand for individuals with STEM degrees to  extend their focus beyond the laboratory so they can be leaders in  discovery and commercialization.   Women deserve a fair shot in the STEM programs in this nation.   In addition, I believe that work needs to be done to modernize key  contracting developmental programs designed to increase opportunities  for women, minorities and low-income individuals who pursue STEM  degrees and STEM job training.   I support programs at the National Science Foundation that have  worked to reduce the current barriers and ensure women have the support  they need in the STEM fields.   Mr. Speaker, we should encourage women to pursue degrees and careers  in the STEM fields so we can continue to compete in the global economy.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 239, the  ``Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017,'' which amends the Homeland  Security Act of 2002 to provide for improved innovative research and  development.   I support this bill because it would extend the Department of  Homeland Security secretary's pilot program for research and  development projects and prototype projects through 2020.   This bill would require the secretary to report annually to the House  Homeland Security and Science committees and the Senate Homeland  Security Committee on the dynamics of the projects undertaken.   Specifically, H.R. 239 would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002  to include fundamental improvements to facilitate information,  analytics, and methodologies related to cybersecurity risks and  incidents, consistent with the current law.   In particular, it adds a new section to the Homeland Security Act,  directing the Department of Homeland Security to support--whether  within itself, other agencies, or in academia and private industry--the  research and development of cybersecurity-related technologies.   As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and Ranking  Member of the Judiciary Committee and Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations, I support this bill as it  directs the Under Secretary for Science and Technology to bolster  research and development, along with the testing and evaluation of  cybersecurity technology to improve the sharing of information,  analysis, and methodologies related to cybersecurity risks and  incidents.   The Rapid Innovation Act is a smart bill that will enable the  Department of Homeland Security to establish and improve technologies  for detecting attacks or intrusions.   The ``Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2017'' will equip the  Department of Homeland Security with vital tools and resources to  prevent and remove attacks and threats implemented by those who target  our nation.   Mr. Speaker, we face growing cybersecurity threats, which demands  that we increase research and development, along with the testing and  evaluation of cybersecurity technology to expand the sharing of  information, analysis, and methodologies related to cybersecurity risks  and incidents.   This is a comprehensive bill that will help protect all Americans in  every corner of this nation.   I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 239.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 240, the ``Leveraging  Emerging Technologies Act of 2017,'' which requires the Secretary of  Homeland Security to engage with innovative and emerging technology  developers, including technology-based small businesses and startup  ventures that can help tackle the rapidly expanding list of homeland  security technology needs.   H.R. 240 helps to protect America's computer and communications  networks, which security experts believe represent the nation's most  critical national security challenge, including Internet functions and  connected critical infrastructure such as air traffic control, the U.S.  electrical grid, and nuclear power plants.   H.R. 240 authorizes DHS to establish personnel and office space in  diverse geographic areas around the United States that have high  concentrations of technology developers and firms.   The bill also directs DHS, within 6 months, to develop and submit to  Congress a Department-wide strategy to engage with innovative and  emerging technology companies.   Importantly, the bill specifically requires the Secretary to include  in that strategy ways to effectively integrate technology-based small  businesses and startup ventures.   Importantly, the bill also requires the DHS Secretary to coordinate  with those in the venture capital industry to assist in the development  of technologies that are ready for commercialization and use in the  Homeland Security Enterprise.   Since its founding, the Department of Homeland Security has overcome  many challenges as an organization but much more  [[Page H279]]  progress must be made regarding effective inter-operable communication  between the federal, state, and local agencies.   Although not a panacea, H.R. 240 is a step in the right direction  because it will help improve DHS' overall functions so that it can more  effectively protect our people.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation.
