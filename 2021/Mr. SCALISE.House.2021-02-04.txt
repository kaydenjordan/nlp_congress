 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I have been clear for a long time that the comments  made by Mrs. Greene prior to being elected a Member of Congress are  completely inappropriate and, in fact, I have spoken directly to her to  express that. And we had a long conversation, frankly, similar to the  one that we just heard on the floor a few minutes ago, Madam Speaker,  where we heard Mrs. Greene herself come and give a full account of  things she has done in her past.   In fact, at the end, she said: Jesus died on the cross to forgive me  of my sins. She has actually held herself to account as many of us have  as well.   I wonder if that same new standard that is being talked about today  is anticipated to be applied equally by the majority's side to people  who have done things egregious and haven't given account and, in fact,  on those things, as sitting Members of Congress, not what happened in  2018, 2019, that we all decry.   But, Madam Speaker, if the things that happened in 2018 and 2019 were  so egregious that they warrant the unprecedented step of removing a  Member of Congress from all committees by the majority party against  someone in the minority party, if that was so egregious, why then did  not a single Democrat object to that last week when that issue came  before this Congress on this floor and she was added to those  committees?   This is the resolution that added her to the committees. Not a single  Democrat last week--not in 2018 or 2019--last week, not a single  Democrat objected. But now this new standard seems to be applied.   This morning, we continued a great tradition in this Congress, the  National Prayer Breakfast, where Republicans and Democrats come  together and leaders from the entire world come together to pray.  Today, things like forgiveness were freely discussed.   I want to read John 8:7.         So when they continued asking Him, He lifted up Himself,       and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him       first cast a stone at her.    Madam Speaker, we need to stop casting stones at each other and rise  to the level where we are going to start spending every day on this  House floor, not fighting battles of the past but fighting for the  hardworking families of this country who are counting on us to come  together.   I ask that the leadership withdraw this resolution and let's get back  to work for the American people.                                time  1315
