 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2480) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets  Act of 1968 to include an additional permissible use of amounts  provided as grants under the Byrne JAG program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2480         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering Law Enforcement       to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED USE OF BYRNE JAG FUNDS.         Section 501(a)(1) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3751(a)(1)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(I) Programs to combat human trafficking (including       programs to reduce the demand for trafficked persons).''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2480, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2480, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today, Mr. Speaker, we continue our battle against the scourge of  human trafficking with H.R. 2480, the Empowering Law Enforcement to  Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act. This bill, introduced by our  colleague, Congresswoman Hartzler of Missouri, adds antihuman  trafficking efforts as an allowable use for funds under the Byrne JAG  program, the Justice Department's flagship grant program for State and  local governments and law enforcement. It specifies that the JAG funds  may be used for demand reduction operations.   Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the fight against human  trafficking starts at the local level. It infects every community, and  our local officials and law enforcement are on the front lines in this  battle. They are in the best position to assess how to address this  issue in their communities and how to use these taxpayer dollars.   As part of any comprehensive approach in combating trafficking, local  government and law enforcement must address what many call the demand  issue; that is, going after those who are buying young victims off the  street and, very often, off the internet. This is simple economics  applied to a horrific crime.   Human trafficking is driven by the demand for commercial sex, and  this is costing victims their sense of worth and their dignity. By  deterring demand, traffickers will have fewer buyers and may abandon  their illegal and horrifyingly reprehensible activity.   These demand reduction operations and programs are most often carried  out at the local level, and it is important to ensure local governments  have the tools they need to prevent this destructive crime by deterring  people from buying victims.                                time  1530    We cannot tolerate sex trafficking and must be able to act swiftly to  combat this horrific crime. H.R. 2480 ensures our communities will be  able to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Hartzler for introducing  this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support her bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank the chairman and ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee for the work that we have done in a bipartisan  manner on human trafficking, sex trafficking. Let me thank the  gentlewoman, the sponsor, and the cosponsor, Mr. Clay, for their  leadership on this legislation and for recognizing that we must give  direction, as Members of the United States Congress, to how grants are  to be utilized. This is a very, very important initiative to be able to  help our law enforcement.   Let me give you the real life of some of those who have been sex- trafficked.   The life of Esperanza: She was waiting for a cousin outside her high  school in Mexico one day when a strange man drove up in a car and  forced her inside with him and sped way. At that moment, Esperanza had,  in effect, become a sex slave. ``He beat me; he raped me,'' she told  CNN.   A few times, she tried to escape and failed to escape. The gentleman,  the person, the perpetrator, the heinous man, Poncho, now 47, always  tracked her down and then beat her again.   Eventually, Esperanza realized she was pregnant. Three months later,  she said Poncho drove her across the Mexican/U.S. border and on to  Houston, Texas, where he forced her to work in a cantina called La  Costenita.   This is a story that reads inside Houston's sex trade. I am a  Representative of the congressional district in Houston where we have  recognized that it is one of the hot spots of the sex trade.   But I do want to acknowledge that law enforcement, a sheriff, the  police chief, the mayor, the head of the city, local government, and  county government have all come together, Members of Congress, faith  organizations, and recognized and made a resistant stance  [[Page H5489]]  to stand against this sex trade. In fact, I want to applaud them for  recognizing the plight of Esperanza.   I want to, with enthusiasm, support a bill that would amend the  omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include an  additional permissible use of amounts provided as grants under the  Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant, also known as the Byrne  JAG Program, to combat human trafficking, sex trafficking, including  programs to reduce the demand for trafficked persons.   The legislation was introduced by Mrs. Hartzler and joined by her  colleague, Mr. Clay. I am glad to be a cosponsor, as are members of the  Judiciary Committee and others.   Sadly, sex trafficking, like labor trafficking, is a modern-day form  of slavery. It is slavery. The epidemic of this abhorrent practice of  sex trafficking continues.   First, sex trafficking occurs nationwide, and the data from the  National Human Trafficking Hotline shows that reports of human  trafficking were almost doubled, from 372 reported cases in 2012 to 670  reported cases in 2016, with sex trafficking accounting for more than  75 percent of all human trafficking.   Let me be very clear that sex trafficking is easy. It is very  profitable because, unfortunately, you use the vulnerable victim over  and over again.   Take Esperanza. She was waiting to go to high school. She became  pregnant. You would think there would be some form of mercy, but she  was forced to be used again, to be sex-trafficked again, and to find  herself in a cantina in Houston, Texas, all the way from Mexico.   ``I really wanted to speak up, to ask the police for help,''  Esperanza said, but she got caught up by the threats he would make  against the little baby girl that she was now raising.   After waiting for this horrific nightmare to end, Esperanza  eventually was rescued in a raid of that cantina that I remember very  well, thanks to the bravery and steadfast approach of Houston's finest,  like Agent Steven Roskey, a native Houstonian, then, believe it or not,  with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission that was really going  after the cantina for liquor violations. But he was astute and he was  law enforcement. Esperanza's prayers were answered.   And so, thankfully, although traumatized, Esperanza survived the  horrors of sex trafficking, human trafficking. But not all victims are  as lucky as that. Esperanza, who fell victim to human trafficking,  should absolutely not be treated as a criminal for her involvement.   Mr. Speaker, I include the CNN article on Esperanza in the Record.                         [From CNN, Aug. 12, 2016]                      Inside Houston's Sex Slave Trade                            (By Thom Patterson)         (CNN) Esperanza was waiting for her cousins outside her       high school in Mexico one day, when a strange man drove up in       a car, forced her inside with him and sped away. At that       moment, Esperanza had in effect become a sex slave.        ``He beat and raped me,'' she told CNN's ``The Hunt with       John Walsh.''        She said the man--who called himself Poncho--brought her to       a madam who showed Esperanza how to charge clients and how to       use a condom.        A few times Esperanza tried--and failed--to escape, but she       said Poncho, now age 47, always tracked her down, and then       beat her.        Eventually, Esperanza realized she was pregnant. Three       months later, she said Poncho drove her across the Mexican-US       border and on to Houston, Texas, where he forced her to work       in a cantina called La Costenita.        She gave birth to a baby girl, but Poncho took the infant       away as insurance that Esperanza would keep working as a sex       slave and wouldn't escape.        ``I really wanted to speak up, to ask the police for       help,'' Esperanza said. ``But I got caught up by the threats       he would make towards my daughter. I didn't want anything to       happen to her.''        Esperanza--whose real name is being withheld for her       protection--had become just like the more than 19,000 sex       trafficking cases reported in the US since 2007, according to       the National Human Trafficking Resource Center.        The site says more than 2,600 sex trafficking cases have       been reported in the US this year alone, most of them in       California. Texas ranks as the nation's number-two sex       trafficking state, on the website.        For the uninitiated, it's hard to imagine that thousands of       young people--overwhelmingly women--have been kidnapped in       Mexico or elsewhere and taken against their will to the       United States, where they serve as sex slaves.        ``I thought human trafficking was just this crime that       happens in third world countries. Until I started to look       into my city,'' said Rachel Alvarez, a human trafficking case       worker for the Houston YMCA.        Texas authorities first met Esperanza when they raided La       Costenita in 2010.        ``Her initial demeanor was just kind of stoic,'' remembered       Steve Roskey, who took part in the raid when he was an agent       with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. ``But then, all       of a sudden, we noticed tears start running down her face.       She started telling us her story: how she got here, what she       was forced to do.''        When she told police that her pimp, a man named Alfonso       Diaz-Juarez who also went by ``Poncho,'' was holding her       daughter, authorities sprang into action.        ``We knocked on Poncho's family members' houses, we knocked       on his friends' houses,'' Roskey said. ``It irritated the       family and friends so much that (Diaz-Juarez) eventually       dropped off the child to a cousin, and at about 3 o'clock in       the morning, we got a phone call. The child was safe.''        But Diaz-Juarez was nowhere to be found.        Pimps will often lure women from Mexico across the border       to the US by promising them better lives, perhaps a better       job, Alvarez said. These pimps may get help from people the       women already know and trust, like a neighbor.        Once they're kidnapped, these women are no longer viewed as       people in the eyes of their handlers. They've been reduced to       a commodity that can be bought and sold repeatedly in an open       market. In the United States, Houston has become one of those       markets.        ``People see Houston as a hub for human trafficking because       of its proximity to the border,'' said FBI special agent       Suzanne Bradley. ``It also has access to the I-10 highway       corridor, which goes across the country, so if they're       smuggling people in and trying to get them into human       trafficking in other areas of the country, it's very easy to       get them on that I-10 route and disperse them throughout the       country.''        After the kidnapped women are brought into the US, the       beatings begin as a way to keep them from trying to escape.       Their captors threaten to hurt family members. Pimps use fear       to keep their sex slaves in bondage.        ``Poncho was one of the most violent pimps I've come across       in the 11 years I've worked human trafficking,'' said Edwin       Chapuseaux, a former investigator with the Harris County       Sheriffs Office. ``He did a lot of brutal things, bordering       into torture, to make the girls do what he wanted.''        A former sex slave we'll call ``Laura'' said Poncho knew       her ``mother's name, her address, everything. He would       threaten me, tell me if I talked to anyone that he would hurt       my family.''        A pimp would have a lot to lose if a girl walked out the       door.        ``If a pimp has, let's say, four or five girls, and each       one is making him, you know, $2,000, $3,000 a week, do the       math, tax-free,'' said Chapuseaux. That works out to a       maximum of $780,000 per year.        Laura recalls one night when she counted 70 women working.       ``The usual was 30 men. We each had to tend to 30 clients a       night.''        For years federal and local authorities had been gathering       evidence against a huge Houston-area sex trafficking network       led by Raquel Medeles Hortencia-Arguello.        The woman everyone knew as ``Tencha'' owned a brothel       called Las Palmas that offered minor-aged girls to customers       who would pay up to $500 an hour, according to the FBI.        Coincidentally, as a cautionary move, Tencha had distanced       herself from Las Palmas by leasing it to Diaz-Juarez.        When police found out, they arrested him on a previous       warrant.        Diaz-Juarez pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors that       led to his release several months later. Poncho was back on       the loose.        Authorities continued to gather evidence in the big sex       trafficking case.        ``We realized early on that we had potential financial       crimes, money laundering involved in the case, so we got the       [Internal Revenue Service] involved in it,'' said Bradley.       The IRS began following the money, reviewing bank statements,       locating assets.        ``We did an estimate on how much she made from the room       rental, entrance fee, and the condoms for the whole entire       period she was operating Las Palmas and that estimated to be       about $12.5 million,'' said IRS Special Agent Lucy Tan.        When it was time for police to move in and raid Las Palmas,       13 people were arrested. Diaz-Juarez wasn't among them. But       Tencha was.        Twelve pleaded guilty.        Prosecutors charged Tencha with one count of conspiracy to       commit sex trafficking, one count of conspiracy to harbor       aliens, three counts of money laundering and one count of       conspiracy to money launder.        Tencha pleaded not guilty.        When Tencha began crying in front of the judge, saying she       was innocent and she had no idea what was going on, it       stirred something inside the freed women who once worked for       her.        They began to get angry.        One by one they decided to take the stand and testify       against their former captor.        ``You didn't have to speak Spanish to see how much pain       they had over what had been done to them, and what they had       to do,'' remembered Bradley. ``You could just see it in their       face, hear it in their voice.''  [[Page H5490]]         Ultimately, the jury found Tencha guilty and the judge       sentenced her to life in prison.        Despite the legal victory against Tencha, authorities are       disturbed by the fact that Diaz-Juarez remains free.        ``It's very important to get Poncho arrested and       prosecuted, because he will not stop doing what he does until       he is arrested and put behind bars,'' said Chapuseaux.        Laura, who still fears Poncho, admits she'll ``feel safer       when he is captured. There aren't any words to describe what       a terrible person he is.''   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, second, we must provide our law  enforcement with the necessary tools to fight the epidemic.   I would like to thank Agent Roskey, our fervent Houston Police Chief  Art Acevedo, and chiefs before him for their entire effort and  collaboration. Houston law enforcement has been working diligently, but  they have limited funds.   To be able to use the Byrne grants in this effective way to save one  more life, to stop another little girl from detouring from high school  involuntarily and then be steered off, become pregnant, and no mercy  given, driven to another country to continue to be utilized, abused,  victimized, beaten, I think this legislation clearly speaks to the  millions of little girls and boys who are not in line but apt to be  victims from all over the world coming to the United States, finding  themselves in hot points, victimized, and maybe even tragically losing  their life.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 2480, the ``Empowering Law  Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act of 2017.''   This bill would amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act  of 1968 to include an additional permissible use of amounts provided as  grants under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant  Program, also known as the Byrne JAG Program, to combat human  trafficking (including programs to reduce the demand for trafficked  persons).   This legislation was introduced by Representative Vicky Hartzler (R- MO) on May 17, 2017 and I am proud to be a Co-Sponsor in this step  forward to addressing concerns about sex trafficking in our cities.   Sadly, Sex Trafficking, like labor trafficking, is a modern-day form  of slavery that includes U.S. citizens, foreign nationals, women, men  and children as victims equally.   The epidemic of this abhorrent practice of sex trafficking is  growing, which makes the need for consideration of all measures to help  law enforcement prevent these crimes from occurring even more  imperative.   First, sex trafficking occurs nationwide, and data from the National  Human Trafficking Hotline show that reports of human trafficking cases  have almost doubled in most states, including Texas, from 372 reported  cases in 2012 to 670 reported cases in 2016; with sex trafficking  accounting for more than 75% of all human trafficking cases reported.   Too often, thousands of young people--overwhelmingly women--have been  kidnapped around the world and taken against their will to the United  States, where they serve as sex slaves and become victims of these  horrendous crimes--especially children--whom are afraid to seek help  from law enforcement because of the risk that they will be treated as  criminals rather than the victims they undoubtedly are.   Take Esperanza for example. She was waiting for her cousins outside  of her high school in Mexico one day, when a strange man drove up in a  car, forced her inside with him and sped away. At that moment,  Esperanza had in effect become a sex slave.   Esperanza was an innocent child when she first became a victim of sex  trafficking. Her 47 year old trafficker brought her to a madam at a  Cantina, who taught her how to have sex with adult men for profit, and  the trafficker would beat and rape this young child whenever she tried  to escape.   Eventually Esperanza became pregnant and was driven across the  Mexico-U.S. border onto Houston, Texas my congressional district, where  her baby was taken by her perpetrator as insurance, in order to force  Esperanza into his world of sex slave trade.   Like so many children living the daily nightmare of human  trafficking, Esperanza was terrified to tell anyone what was occurring.  ``I really wanted to speak up, to ask the police for help,'' Esperanza  said. ``But I got caught up by the threats he would make towards my  daughter. I didn't want anything to happen to her.''   After waiting for this horrific nightmare to end, Esperanza  eventually was rescued in a raid of the Cantina, thanks to the bravery  and steadfast approach of Houston's finest, like Agent Steve Roskey, a  native Houstonian, then with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission in  Houston.   Esperanza's prayers were answered because once she started telling  Agent Roskey and the other Houston officers her story of how she got  here, what she was forced to do, the identification of her trafficker  and the taking of her baby, Houston's finest and Agent Roskey  immediately started knocking on the perpetrator's family members'  houses, knocked on his friends' houses, and after the family and  friends became irritated, they eventually dropped off the child to a  cousin. The child was safe.   Thankfully, although traumatized, Esperanza survived the horrors of  human trafficking but not all victims are as fortunate because there  are many sad stories laced in this practice, which is why these  unfortunate victims, like Esperanza, who fall prey to human  trafficking, should absolutely not be treated as criminals for their  involvement in these sex, and labor acts.   Second, we must provide our law enforcement with the necessary tools  to fight this epidemic. I would like to thank Agent Steve Roskey, our  fervent Houston Police Chief, Art Acevedo, his entire department, and  various other entities for all the hard work they are doing daily to  combat this epidemic in sex trafficking.   Houston's law enforcement are working diligently to take our city  back from the grips of those who seek to perpetuate this appalling  practice of sex trafficking.   Like Houston, law enforcement everywhere are fighting mightily  oftentimes, with limited funds to crush the glaring statistics reported  across this country by the National Human Trafficking Hotline.   Hence we must provide them with meaningful resources to make this  goal a reality, and ensure that victims are not penalized for the  illegal enterprise of the traffickers that exploit them.   This is why we must empower our law enforcements everywhere, through  the Byrne JAG Program, to fight the demand for sex trafficking by  supporting this bill.   Finally, we understand it is already possible for state and local  jurisdictions to use JAG Grant Program funding to combat human  trafficking, including demand reduction, under the current purpose  areas.   However, I support adding an additional purpose area for these grants  that emphasizes the need to fund initiatives that target and fight  human trafficking, as proposed under this bill.   H.R. 2480 will ensure that state and local law enforcement agencies  have the funds needed to implement more programs to combat human  trafficking such as that which occurred at the Cantina in Esperanza's  case and all the trafficked victims rescued there that day.   The addition of this purpose area would allow state and local  jurisdictions to target and penalize buyers who drive the demand for  sex acts, human trafficking, and sexual exploitation; including the  demand for sex trafficking involving children.   An example of a project that could be funded by the addition of this  purpose area is training for a multi-jurisdictional task force to  conduct proactive stings on buyers in an effort to combat human  trafficking, like the Cantina raid in my home district in Houston.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the chief sponsor of  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Clay), a colleague of the sponsor of the bill, Mrs.  Hartzler from Missouri. I thank him for his leadership on the issues of  sex trafficking and human trafficking.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me thank the sponsor of this bill for her leadership. I am  delighted to work with her as a cosponsor. And the speakers on the  outside who are cosponsors, I thank them for their important  contribution.    I simply want to take this time to close and to say to all of us:  Don't forget the Esperanzas--plural--and their little boys as well, who  are sex trafficked. Let us not forget them.   The addition of this purpose area added to the Byrne grants would  allow States and local jurisdictions to target and penalize buyers who  drive the demand for sex acts, human trafficking, and sexual  exploitation, including demand for sex trafficking involving children.  An example of a project that could be funded by the addition of this  purpose area is training for a multijurisdictional task force to  conduct proactive stings on buyers in an effort to combat human  trafficking, just like what was done at the cantina raid in my home  community in Houston.   The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission officer was one of those who  helped bring this cantina, this substitute for sex trafficking kingpin  down, and saved Esperanza.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  thank Members on both sides of the aisle for their hard work on this,  especially the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) for taking the  lead on this, also the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), as well as  the ranking member of the full Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers; and of  the subcommittee, Ms. Jackson Lee; and the subcommittee chair, Mr.  Sensenbrenner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this very  important legislation that will help direct important resources to  State and local governments to reduce demand for sex trafficking, and  help to maybe protect and save a few young people and other people from  this horrible crime.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2480.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
