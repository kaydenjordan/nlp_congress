 Mr. President, I have been consistently voting against  cloture motions to proceed to debate on judicial nominations, and I  would like to take this opportunity to explain why. The Senate has a  constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent on judicial  nominees, and I take this obligation very seriously.   The American people depend on the Senate to fully consider and vet  each judicial nominee because throughout the course of their lifetime  appointment, judges will issue rulings and opinions that touch each of  our lives. The process of nominating, considering, and confirming  judges should be a deliberate one. Its purpose should not be to confirm  as many judges as quickly as possible. Senators should be able to  provide input on who should sit on the Federal bench; Senators should  have an adequate opportunity to hear from third-party experts about the  records and qualifications of each nominee; and Senators should have  enough time to question and examine a nominee during a confirmation  hearing.   Insisting on a deliberate and comprehensive process is not, as some  of my Republican colleagues might argue, an effort to deny the  President his prerogative to nominate judges to lifetime appointments  to the Federal bench. Instead, this process is essential in determining  whether each nominee is qualified for the job and can separate their  personal ideology from the decisions he or she renders. For a lifetime  appointment to the Federal bench, this shouldn't be too much to ask.   Over the past year, we have observed a number of concerning issues in  the nomination and confirmation process for Federal judges that need to  be corrected. The President has essentially outsourced the judicial  selection process to two organizations with strong, ideologically  driven agendas--the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.   The Federalist Society, for example, describes itself as ``a group of  libertarians and conservatives dedicated to reforming the legal  order.'' This is a group that has supported legal efforts to undermine  environmental protection, erode the constitutional right to choose, and  blur the lines between church and State.   The Heritage Foundation describes its mission as one to ``promote  conservative public policies.'' Over the past few years alone, this  organization, this group, has fought to undermine the Affordable Care  Act, oppose LGBTQ rights, and erode the ability of Federal agencies to  issue lifesaving regulations. It is not unreasonable to assume that  these organizations, through their close association with the White  House, expect their ideologically driven agendas to be reflected in the  nominees they recommend.   While I concur with Justice Rehnquist's assertion that no judge joins  a court tabula rasa, or as a blank slate, we should have a baseline  expectation that lifetime appointees should be able to render justice  free from their own personal ideologies. At the same time as the Trump  administration relies more heavily on the Federalist Society and  Heritage Foundation to select its judicial nominees, it is devaluing  the work done by the American Bar Association. The ABA has reviewed and  vetted judicial nominees in a nonpartisan manner for over 60 years.  With the exception of George W. Bush and now Donald Trump, Presidents  in both parties have consulted with the ABA prior to officially  nominating to the bench.   President Obama, for example, provided a great demonstration for how  this process should work. Working closely with the ABA, President Obama  routinely submitted potential candidates for scrutiny prior to their  formal nomination. After conducting their independent, nonpartisan  reviews, the ABA issued ``not qualified'' ratings for 14 candidates who  had been proposed by President Obama. President Obama followed the  ABA's recommendation and did not formally nominate any candidates rated  ``not qualified.''   Under President Trump, on the other hand, we no longer wait for the  ABA to complete its assessment of nominees prior to a nomination  hearing itself, much less before the nomination. We no longer have an  opportunity to review the ABA's report and, in many cases, do not have  the chance to question an ABA representative at a nomination hearing  about its review of the nominee.   We have seen the serious consequences of this change in practice in  two high-profile nominations this year.   Despite having never tried a case, President Trump nominated Brett  Talley to serve the District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.  Mr. Talley was nominated, given a hearing, and listed for a Judiciary  Committee vote before the ABA could even finish its evaluation. Given  his complete lack of qualifications for the job, it wasn't  [[Page S162]]  surprising that the ABA unanimously rated him ``not qualified.''  Because he was rushed through the nomination process, we only learned  later that Mr. Talley failed to disclose that his wife works in the  White House Counsel's office. After two Republicans on the committee-- Senator Grassley and Senator Kennedy--expressed their opposition to Mr.  Talley, he, fortunately, withdrew from consideration.   We were not so lucky with Steven Grasz, who was recently confirmed to  the Eighth Circuit. Mr. Grasz was nominated and scheduled for a  Judiciary Committee hearing before the ABA could complete its review.  By the time the ABA finished its exhaustive evaluation, during which it  found him to be not qualified, Mr. Grasz was scheduled to appear before  the Judiciary Committee in less than 48 hours. This was not nearly  enough time to adequately address and assess the ABA's conclusion that  Mr. Grasz would not be able to serve as a judge without the undue  influence of his personal beliefs.   Courts are supposed to protect the rights of minorities, and it is  troubling to reflect on the ABA's conclusion that Mr. Grasz would be  unable to divorce his positions on issues like reproductive and LGBTQ  rights from the cases he will hear on the Eighth Circuit. Circuit court  judges are only one step away from the U.S. Supreme Court and deserve  to be scrutinized closely in the Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately,  last year, the Judiciary Committee overrode the objections of the  minority to hold four nomination hearings with more than one circuit  judge nominee considered simultaneously.   To put this in some historical context, the Judiciary Committee held  four such hearings in the entire 8 years Barack Obama was President,  and it held each of these hearings with the consent of the Republican  minority on the committee. During hearings on circuit and district  court nominees, each committee member generally has only 5 minutes to  question nominees--many of whom are highly controversial and deserve  maximum scrutiny. Five minutes, which includes the time the nominee  takes to respond, is not nearly enough time to engage in meaningful  dialogue about a nominee's judicial philosophy or to examine  controversial cases a nominee may have decided in the past.   The American people deserve much more as we consider lifetime  appointments to the Federal bench. I am also concerned about the  erosion of the blue-slip process, which has traditionally been a  collaborative mechanism to enable Senators to confer with the White  House on nominees from their States. Although there have been  exceptions over the years, Presidents and Senate majorities of both  parties have both respected the blue-slip process.   In 2009, the Democrats controlled the White House and had a  filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Every Senate Republican signed  a letter to President Obama urging him to respect the blue-slip  process. I would like to read a passage from that letter for emphasis.         Regretfully, if we are not consulted on, and approve of, a       nominee from our states, the Republican Conference will be       unable to support moving forward on that nominee.        Despite press reports that the Chairman of the Judiciary       Committee now may be considering changing the Committee's       practice of observing senatorial courtesy, we, as a       Conference, expect it to be observed even-handedly and       regardless of party affiliation. And we will act to preserve       this principle and the rights of our colleagues if it is not.        Because of the profound impact that life-tenured federal       judges can have in our society, the founders made their       appointment a shared constitutional responsibility.    This is the Republican conference asking the Democratic majority, the  Democratic President, and the chair of the Judiciary Committee to  observe the blue-slip process.   President Obama, and the Democratic majority at that time, upheld the  blue-slip process without exception. Last year, the Judiciary Committee  held a nomination hearing for David Stras to serve on the Eighth  Circuit despite his not receiving two positive blue-slips from his home  State Senators. This is the first time since the early years of the  George W. Bush administration that the Judiciary Committee has held a  hearing for a nominee when a home State Senator has not returned a blue  slip. If the Senate proceeds to vote on and confirm Mr. Stras, it will  be the first time since 1989 and only the third time in the last 100  years that a judicial nominee will be confirmed without having two  positive blue slips.    I, certainly, take the chairman at his word that this was a onetime  exception to the blue-slip process, but I will hold him and the  President to the same standard they demanded from President Obama in  2009.   I will continue to rigorously defend the Senate's constitutional  obligation to provide advice and consent on lifetime appointees to the  Federal bench. Until we return to a normal process through which we can  provide this kind of advice and consent, I will continue to oppose  invoking cloture on any judicial nominee, and I encourage my colleagues  to join me in this position.   I yield the floor.
