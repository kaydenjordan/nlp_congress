 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it has been more than a month since a  violent mob stormed this building and attempted to disrupt the  congressional certification of Presidential electors--the vote of those  electors. Rather than a peaceful transition of power, some of the mob  turned their grievances into violent action. But, again, that is the  problem with mobs. No matter what the intentions were of those who were  simply exercising their rights to free speech and free assembly, mobs  invariably degenerate into the lowest common denominator.   That element of the mob assaulted police officers, destroyed  property, and trespassed in the halls of the U.S. Capitol. Some roamed  these halls in search of Members of Congress against whom they actually  threatened harm. And if not for the heroism of the men and women of the  Capitol Police, the human cost would have likely been higher.   The criminal acts of the mob were disgraceful and indefensible.  Regardless of party or politics, there should be no disagreement on  that most basic point. The people making up this mob came to Washington  with the idea that the results of the 2020 election were not final.  President Trump fed that fantasy by repeatedly claiming the election  was stolen, even after he had exhausted all of his legal remedies in  dozens and dozens of lawsuits. The President's actions were reckless.  He should have known better than to stoke a flame he could not and did  not control.   But the events of January 6 are only part of the story, and it is the  congressional response, including impeachment, that I now want to talk  about. Simply put, this snap impeachment raises serious questions about  fundamental fairness, due process, or, more accurately, a lack thereof.  Unlike previous impeachments, there was no formal inquiry, no  investigation, no hearings, no witnesses, no cross-examination, no  nothing. We know impeachment is not like a traditional judicial  proceeding. It is not a court of law. But it does make common sense-- and I think this was the direction we gave the House during the last  impeachment trial--that it is the House's obligation to investigate,  develop the evidence, and then charge, not the other way around.   Historically, this has been true for impeachment proceedings. Each  time, the House has conducted a full-scale investigation before a vote  on the Articles of Impeachment. As I said, that was the case last year  when the House spent months deposing witnesses, holding hearings,  building a case against the President before ever announcing formal  charges.   But this time around, they took an entirely different approach. In  attempting to justify this unprecedented departure from a fair and  dignified proceeding, some of our Democratic friends claim that no  evidence needs to be presented, saying that we were all witnesses to  what happened on January 6 and that we can be jurors, witnesses, and,  in the words of at least one Democratic Senator, victims all at the  same time.   This week, President Trump's defense team will have the opportunity  to present its case, and I expect the lack of due process to be a major  area of focus and rightfully so.   Unfortunately, that is not the only problem with this impeachment  trial. The Constitution requires the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme  Court to preside over the impeachment trial of a President. But since  this is the trial of a former President, a private citizen, someone who  no longer holds office, Chief Justice Roberts will not be presiding. As  a result, the senior Senator from Vermont will now serve as both a  judge and a juror, in addition to being a witness, I presume, and, in  the words of another Senator, a victim.   I respect Senator Leahy, but the fact of the matter is, he cannot be  an impartial arbiter. He has a conflict of interest. Following the  House's impeachment vote, Senator Leahy called President Trump ``the  greatest threat to the Constitution and t American democracy in a  generation.'' He voted to convict Donald Trump during the last  impeachment trial and apparently has already decided to do it again in  this trial.  [[Page S567]]    The fact of the matter is, no American, let alone a former President,  should be tried before a juror who has already determined guilt or  innocence and who also serves as a judge. I want to be abundantly  clear, though, on one point. President Trump's words and actions  leading up to the attack were reckless and wrong, but as we all know,  the constitutional standard for impeachment isn't recklessness.   Treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors--those are  the offenses that the Constitution allows Congress to impeach and  remove a President from office for violating or from committing, which  brings us to one of the biggest concerns I have. Donald Trump is no  longer President of the United States. He is a private citizen. Our  Democratic colleagues moved so fast that they could impeach the  President while he was in office but failed to transmit the Articles to  the Senate until he became a private citizen.   Legal experts have debated not only the constitutionality of trying a  former President but also the wisdom of doing so, and I share concerns  on both those fronts. I think this ill-timed impeachment trial sets a  dangerous precedent for future former Presidents.   As politicized as impeachment has become, it could become a  reoccurring political exercise that would be toxic for our democracy.  Prominent Democrats have warned about the dangers of using impeachment  as a political weapon against an opposing party.   During the impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, Senator Leahy  himself counseled:         A partisan impeachment cannot command the respect of the       American people. It is no more valid than a stolen election.    I agree with him. The problem with one party using impeachment to  exact political retribution on an opposing party's President at the end  of his term or even after that President has left office seems quite  obvious to me. It is political retribution.   Depending on which party controls Congress and which occupies the  White House, this could turn into a regular blemish on our democracy.  Rather than focusing together on our future and a new administration,  seeking common ground and unity, as President Biden has called for,  such a precedent of trying a former President could create an endless  feedback loop of recrimination.   I think this is a dangerous and destructive path, and I would implore  my colleagues on both sides to consider the long-term implications of  this precedent. As Justice Story explained, the Framers saw the Senate  as a tribunal, in his words, ``removed from popular power and passions  . . . and from the more dangerous influence of mere party spirit,'' and  was guided by ``a deep responsibility to future times.''   So, as before, I don't take my role as a juror lightly, and I will  reserve final judgment until both the House impeachment managers and  President Trump's defense team have had the opportunity to present  their cases. But I do think, indeed, I fear, we are skating on very  thin ice and are in danger of inflicting great harm to our country by  this rushed, unfair, and partisan proceeding. May God help us.
