 Reserving the right to object. This bill is a perfect       example of the government taking a one-size-fits-all approach on every       workplace in America. It is the approach of those who think that the       only way to get people to do the right thing is to pass a law and       mandate it.        Let's just look at one industry: the motor coaches. Unlike other       commercial modes of transportation, motor coaches function with only       one employee on board, the driver, who is responsible for picking up       the passengers on time, getting them to their destinations safely.       Almost by definition, bus routes depend on schedules and sticking to       those schedules for customers in a safe and consistent way.        If you think the hammer of government is the only way to get people       to do the right thing, you probably would assume that the motor coach       operators just exploit their nursing employees and don't give them any       accommodations--but you would be wrong. Under the laws that exist       today, employers routinely offer alternative temporary duties to their       drivers who are nursing. This is what happens with the motor coaches.       They are accommodating and doing the right thing as most people in the       workplace are.        This bill would prohibit solutions like that. It would actually make       it more difficult for motor coaches to accommodate their workers by       allowing them to have alternative duties, even when they are mutually       agreed upon between employer and employee. There is already a national       driver shortage, so operators have a built-in incentive to keep the       drivers that they have making mutually beneficial arrangements.        There is also already a Federal law on the books that requires most       employers to offer reasonable break times and a private non-bathroom       area for their nonexempt nursing employees to use for a full year after       the birth of a child.        In addition, some 32 States, including my State of Kentucky, have       passed their own laws on this issue, and some have even extended how       long nursing mothers are covered by the law.        Since all of these accommodations already exist at the Federal and       the State levels, before we impose any new mandates on the whole       country, we ought to study whether there is actually a need for more       legislation in this area.        I have an amendment to strike these new mandates and instead ask the       Government Accountability Office to study this issue and report back       within a year. I would ask my colleagues to agree to this amendment so       we can determine if more laws are needed before we rush to put new       burdens on American businesses.        Mr. President, I would ask that the Senator modify his request so       that the Paul amendment, which would require a study to explore the       severity of the problem, at the desk be considered and agreed to.         I object.         Mr. President, I object.         I object.         Mr. President, reserving the right to object, our Federal       debt is now over $31 trillion, with no end in sight. The legislation       before us authorizes a billion dollars in new spending. This bill comes       just after, in the dead of night, at 1:30 in the morning, the       leadership of this body released a 4,000-page bill that spends $1.7       trillion and will add over a trillion dollars in new debt to the       country.        We have learned the hard way that profligate Federal spending comes       at a great cost. The trillions of supposedly free money that Congress       spent over the pandemic was not free at all. Inflation continues to eat       away at the purchasing power of every American family, regardless of       income. The least fortunate among us are worse off because of our       spending. The working class and those who live on a fixed income are       the ones who are hurt worst by inflation. Inflation comes from spending       money you don't have.        This is why I offer to modify the request. We should study this       issue. And before we add any dollars to it, we should study this issue       further.        So I have asked that the Comptroller General of the United States       conduct a study of crime and crime clearance rates by jurisdiction,       identify specific technological methods that improve clearance rates,       and determine whether one approach yields higher clearance rates than       others. This report should also discern whether efforts to defund the       police have adversely impacted those rates and explore fee-based       mechanisms to pay for Federal grants to reduce violent crime after the       completion of this study.        It is time we stopped forcing one-size-fits-all policies on States       and local law enforcement. Each jurisdiction is unique and deserves to       implement the most appropriate practices for their constituents and       community. Therefore, I encourage the passage of my amendment.        So, still reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent that       the Senator modify his request to include my amendment, which would       allow for this report, which is at the desk; that the amendment be       considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read       a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be       considered made and laid upon the table.         I object.         Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate       Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize       an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American       entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize       Cottingham Hardware of Alexandria, KY, as the Senate Small Business of       the Week.        All across the Nation are American small towns whose Main Street       businesses bring color and vibrancy to their community. These       businesses might be stores that occupy a specific niche or may be the       product of one entrepreneur's dreams turned reality. Many of these       businesses however, are simply shops that the community has come to       rely on, with a top-quality product or service that keeps their       customers coming back. Such is the case for Alexandria's Cottingham       Hardware, also referred to as Cottingham Ace, that was founded in 1957.       This hardware store has been faithfully serving its' customers for 65       years, easily cementing the business as community institution.        Sixty-five years ago, Tom and Betty Cottingham opened Cottingham       Hardware, a hardware store right in the heart of the little town of       Alexandria, KY. Since its' inception over six decades ago, the store       has been dutifully serving its customers, offering them whatever       hardware goods they might need, including but not limited to, specialty       chrome, electrical lighting, as well as lawn and garden tools. The       store also carries a large selection of firearms and ammunition, making       the shop especially popular during northern Kentucky's busy hunting       season. In addition to the wide array of products available for       purchase at Cottingham, the store has two mechanics who are always       available to meet the needs of customers, with both mechanics having       received the proper training and certification to handle practically       any job. They boast a selection that is appropriate for all types of       customers, whether they be a first-time homeowner or the owner of       multi-acre properties; they have the products and services to help with       any project.        Started by a married couple, Cottingham Hardware continues to be a       family business. Tom and Betty's three sons practically grew up in the       store, so it would only make sense that the three men choose to       perpetuate their parents' dream and run the store with the same       dedication and customer-friendly atmosphere that Tom and Betty created.       The three sons, Tom, Mike, and Joe, took over the business in the mid       90s, roughly a decade after Cottingham Hardware moved from their       original location right in Alexandria out to U.S. Highway 27. The three       brothers led the business through a vast array of modernizations,       opting for computerized systems in place of the original manual       inventory and registry systems. Today, Cottingham Hardware can easily       locate a necessary piece of machinery as it travels along the supply       chain before arriving at their store. The Cottingham men understood       that to lead their parents' business into the modern era requires these       types of technological advancements, and they make sure Cottingham       Hardware stays on the cutting edge of modern computer equipment.        In addition to their eye for key modernizations to the hardware       store, the Cottingham brothers understand that their parents' success       was due in large part to their dedication to family values. Tom, Mike,       and Joe maintain a strict policy that at least one of the Cottingham       brothers is in store at any given time during business hours, all 7       days a week. Friends and neighbors are constantly coming through their       doors to purchase tools or equipment and to visit with the familiar       faces of the Cottingham store. These days, even the brothers' children       occasionally work with them in store, entering in to a new generation       of Cottingham family leadership. Moreover, Cottingham Hardware       maintains their dedication to the Alexandria community, as they often       participate in donations for local schools and churches. Additionally,       Joe Cottingham is a member of the Northern Kentucky Area Development       District--NKADD--representing Campbell County. NKADD strives to achieve       sustainable economic growth and improve the overall quality of life for       the citizens of Kentucky. Clearly the Cottingham family is dedicated       not only to running a successful family business, but to championing       and supporting small businesses around the State as well. For that       reason, it gives me great pleasure to honor this multi-generation       family business as the Senate Small Business of the Week.        Congratulations to the Cottingham brothers and the entire team at       Cottingham Hardware. I look forward to seeing your continued growth and       success in Kentucky.                                      ____________________
