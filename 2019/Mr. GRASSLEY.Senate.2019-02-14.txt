 Mr. President, today I want my colleagues to listen to  some ideas that I have about tariffs, generally, and where we are on  tariffs and where we might be on tariffs in a couple of weeks,  depending on what the Secretary of Commerce says, because in a few  days, that Secretary is expected to provide the President a report.   This report will detail his Department's findings in the  investigation of whether imports of automobiles and auto parts pose a  national threat to the United States. Common sense tells me it doesn't.  Let me repeat that because I think it is important for us to understand  whether the cars that everyday Americans rely on to get to work, to  drive their children to schools, to visit their families--whether or  not the importation of those automobiles threatens national security.   Now, having said that, you might think that I disagree with the  President--and I don't--that we must have fair and enforceable trade  agreements that benefit Americans. Sometimes we have to make hard  decisions in order to get and have fair and enforceable agreements. I  do not agree that we should alienate our allies or jeopardize the  health of our economy to achieve the good outcomes of fair and  enforceable agreements.   The Tax Foundation has found that a 25-percent tariff on auto imports  would amount to roughly a $73.1 billion tax increase. According to the  Center for Automotive Research, a 25-percent tariff on auto imports  would also result in the loss of 700,000 jobs and raise the price of an  average car by nearly $7,000.   Dealers would see a decline in annual sales by as many as 2 million  vehicles. Consumers would face up to a 10-percent increase in the cost  of repairs and replacement parts. In short, raising tariffs on cars and  parts would be a huge tax on consumers who buy or service their cars,  whether those cars are imported or domestically produced. Make no  mistake, Americans will be paying those taxes.   Tariffs are a tax paid at the time of import. Historically, they have  been a protectionist tool intended to prop up domestically produced  goods by making foreign goods more expensive. Tariffs are not a long- term solution, and nobody wins with the producing of tariffs.   While they may provide short-term protection for domestic industries,  they do so at the expense of ordinary consumers and industries  increasingly dependent on a complex global supply chain. On the whole,  I think this all adds up to damaging the economy. For an  administration, including this Senator and most Republicans on this  side of the aisle, who have been crowing about the benefits of the tax  bill of late 2017 and the jobs it has created and the good it has done  for workers, why would you want to put on a $73 billion tax increase  through tariffs that would undo a lot of good that we say and the  President says the tax bill has done. Let me repeat it again. On a  whole, this is going to be damaging to the economy.   A 2018 study by the International Monetary Fund reviewed tariff  changes across 151 countries between the decades of the 1960s to 2014.  The International Monetary Fund found that tariff increases led to less  output and less productivity, and, then, you know what happens. There  is more unemployment, and when you have more unemployment, you get  greater inequality.   The recent U.S. tariff increases have invited tariff retaliation from  our trading partners. I know because Iowans are bearing the brunt of  this retaliation. Imposing tariffs on auto parts will inevitably invite  more retaliation, and we simply can't afford more of that.   The United States must continue to lead the world on trade and  economic issues, as we have for at least the period of time since World  War II. We have benefitted from one of the most open markets in the  world, and we must continue to lead the world by providing a good  example. We have led to a better world since World War II, and the  results have been these. Several decades ago, 50 percent of the world's  population was in poverty. Today, it is less than 10 percent. Recently,  in two or three references I have seen, the fact is that right now or  next year, as for major middle class status in the various countries  around the world and in different ways around the world, half of the  world is middle class. President Trump is right to hold our trading  partners accountable. So I don't find fault with him there.   We can't take benefits we have received from international trade for  granted. International trade has been a tremendous benefit to farmers  and businesses in my State of Iowa and across the country. We are  better off because we can sell our products around the world.   Our farmers say they don't want aid from the Federal Treasury. They  want markets. They want to trade. You develop those markets and you  keep those markets. Tariffs and retaliation send a signal to other  countries that you might not be a reliable supplier, and they go  elsewhere to create relationships that they can depend on. America  ought to be able to be depended upon any place in the world from the  standpoint of trade.   When you talk about America and Iowa exporting products, these are  some of the best products in the world. In this vein, then, I hope the  President will heed my call to forego the auto tariffs and instead  focus on opening up new markets.   The U.S. auto industry is a major driver of our economy, supporting  nearly 10 million American jobs and accounting for 3 percent of the  gross domestic product. Without question, any tariffs that are imposed  will have a negative effect on the U.S. auto industry and our economy.   Our focus, instead, should be on strengthening our relationships with  our allies, while targeting China's harmful trade practices and  policies. Tariffs on autos and auto parts will not help us achieve  these critical priorities.                            ____________________     On another subject, I would like to, as I did  yesterday, remind my colleagues about some of the benefits of tax  policy. This is speaking about tax policy that I thought would be  adopted as part of the upcoming appropriation bill to make sure we  don't shut down government.   For several months now, we have been working to extend a set of tax  provisions that expired at the end of 2017. Around here we commonly  refer to these as ``tax extenders.'' We have also been working to enact  bipartisan disaster tax relief to help families and businesses that  continue to recover from the disasters that occurred across the country  in 2018, and I thought that, too, would be in the bill we are going to  vote on later today.   The best and most timely option to advance these provisions is with  the government funding deal being worked on this week, but that isn't  going to happen. There have been press reports stating that if the  extenders aren't part of the funding bill, they are dead, and I reject  that conclusion.   Regardless of what happens on the bill to keep the government open, I  will continue to fight to get the extenders enacted and to work toward  a longer term resolution. Since the House has failed to send us a  government funding bill that includes the tax extenders and disaster  tax relief provisions, look for me to introduce a bill addressing these  tax matters here in the Senate, and I would ask my colleagues on the  Finance Committee to join me in that effort.   When these provisions were extended early last year, the tax  extenders had been expired for more than a year already. Now we are  back in the very same place, with these tax incentives now expired for  more than a year, again.   It seems to me that the right thing to do now is to extend these  provisions for 2018 and 2019. Some people are saying you ought to do it  longer. Why 2 years?   First, we need to provide clarity for taxpayers trying to file their  2018 returns, which are due in just over eight weeks. Even though the  year has obviously ended, a repeated extension of many of these  provisions has led individuals and businesses to assume that we will do  so again.  [[Page S1359]]    These business people relied on last year to make business decisions.  In other words, people did what we wanted them to do when these  provisions were created. We shouldn't retroactively punish them now for  making those decisions that we wanted them to make.    Second, we should provide certainty for this year to give room to  take a long-term view on all of the tax extenders. I want to stress  that I want to find a long-term resolution of these provisions so that  we can stop repeated extensions of temporary tax policy, but while we  work on that, these extenders are intended to be incentives, and, to be  successful, they need to be in effect when individuals and businesses  are considering whether to make the investments required to take  advantage of these particular tax extenders.   I want to go into more detail on what the tax extenders are. The  numbers have changed over time, but there are now currently around 26  temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2017. At one time  we were dealing with 50 to 55 such tax extenders, so we have reduced  the number considerably. What we are dealing with now include  provisions incentivizing alternative fuels, electric vehicles, and the  construction of energy-efficient homes. These are provisions that  incentivize the production of coal on Indian lands, provide an  exclusion from income of the discharge of indebtedness on a principal  residence, and provide a deduction for tuition and related expenses.  Within these 26 provisions there is probably something that is very  important to all 100 Senators, whether you are Republican or Democrat.   I want to focus on two of them in particular. The first is the  railroad track maintenance credit, otherwise known as the short line  credit. This provision provides short line railroads a credit equal to  a percentage of the capital they invest to maintain and improve their  tracks.   Short line railroads are small business railroads that are vital to  keeping rural and small town America connected to the national economy.  They are a particularly important part of our transportation system for  getting agricultural and other products to market across the country  and, hopefully, abroad.   For example, the Iowa Interstate Railroad, which operates between  Council Bluffs and Chicago, connects Iowa companies such as the Elite  Octane ethanol plant in Atlantic, IA, to the world market.   According to the American Short Line and Regional Rail Association,  short line railroads operate more than 47,500 miles of track and make  up 29 percent of the freight rail network of our Nation.   In a report prepared by PWC last year, it was noted that the short  line industry directly provided more than 17,000 jobs in the United  States in 2016 and supported more than 61,000 jobs overall. This credit  has been extended many times since it was first enacted on a temporary  basis in 2004. Legislation introduced in the last Congress would have  made the short line credit permanent, and the bill had 56 cosponsors in  the Senate. The bill is led by Senators Crapo and Wyden and has already  been reintroduced for this Congress.   Another tax extender that is very important, particularly for Iowa,  is the biodiesel tax credit. Generally, this provision provides a tax  credit of $1 per gallon for biodiesel and renewable diesel. This credit  helps provide for a more sustainable future by reducing our dependency  on fossil fuels and promoting a renewable domestic resource.   Plans for promoting environmental efficiency have been in the news  lately, and an extension of the biodiesel tax credit is needed to keep  more people working at their jobs in this industry. For example, I have  learned that Western Iowa Energy in Wall Lake, IA, has reduced runtime  forecasts by 60 percent, consequently running at 40 percent capacity.  They are also putting capital improvement projects on hold.   In Wall Lake, this reduction in runtimes means that there are 26  trucks per day that are not operating, and potential layoffs are on the  horizon if the tax credit is not extended as soon as possible.   According to the National Biodiesel Board, the U.S. biodiesel  industry supports more than 60,000 jobs and generates more than 11  billion in economic impact.   A group of renewable energy stakeholders wrote to congressional  leaders last week. Their letter reads in part: ``Allowing these tax  incentives to lapse has created uncertainty for investors and the  industry--``    ``jeopardizing the long-term investments necessary for  the development of these biofuels.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  letters to Congress regarding tax extenders from biofuel and biodiesel  businesses and associations across the United States.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   February 5, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, House Committee on Ways & Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Grassley,      Chairman, Senate Finance Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Republican Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways & Means, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader McCarthy, Majority       Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, Chairman Neal,       Ranking Member McCarthy, Chairman Grassley, and Ranking       Member Wyden: As you continue your negotiations on the final       Continuing Resolution Fiscal Year 2019, the advanced and       cellulosic biofuels industry urges you to extend a suite of       critical advanced biofuels tax incentives--the Second       Generation Biofuel Producer Tax Credit, the Special       Depreciation Allowance for Second Generation Biofuel Plant       Property, the Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel Fuels Credit,       and the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property.        These tax extenders expired at the end of 2017 after having       been extended retroactively in the Bipartisan Budget Act of       2018. Allowing these tax incentives to lapse has created       uncertainty for investors and the industry about the       availability of these credits; jeopardizing the long-term       investments necessary for the development of these biofuels.       Availability of these credits are critical as our companies       make significant investments to create new agricultural       supply chains, build infrastructure for liquid biofuels, and       develop innovative new technologies. These credits have       enabled our industry to create new jobs, contribute to rural       prosperity, and diversify our nation's energy supply.       However, the continued delays in extending these credits puts       these investments and benefits at risk.        In the interest of job creation, infrastructure       development, innovation, and energy security, we respectfully       ask Congress to immediately pass a seamless multi-year       extension, which includes 2018 retroactively, to ensure       companies will be able to account for these credits in this       year's tax filings.        We look forward to working with you to achieve this       important goal.            Sincerely,      Advanced Biofuels Business Council,      Algae Biomass Organization,      Biotechnology Innovation Organization,      Growth Energy,      National Biodiesel Board,      Renewable Fuels Association.  [[Page S1360]]                                          ____                                                  February 5, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Grassley,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer and       Leader McCarthy, and Chairmen Grassley and Neal: On behalf of       the entire biodiesel supply chain--including biodiesel       producers, feedstock providers, blenders, fuel marketers and       consumers--we urge you to maintain and extend the biodiesel       blenders' tax credit as soon as possible. In light of       Congress's past practice of retroactively extending the tax       credit after it lapses, our industry has been compelled since       January 1, 2018 to operate on the assumption that the credit       would be extended, effectively pricing the credit's value       into our costs of doing business. It is essential that the       businesses that have priced product artificially low are made       whole. In addition, we urge Congress to extend the credit       prospectively, thereby augmenting consumer benefits and       encouraging additional investment in clean-burning biofuels.        The blenders' credit has worked successfully to build a       robust biodiesel and renewable diesel industry in the United       States. As a result, the U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel       market has grown from roughly 100 million gallons in 2005 to       nearly 2.6 billion gallons in 2017. The tax credit is an       important demand stimulus, which improves plant efficiencies,       encourages investment in U.S. distribution infrastructure,       and supports high-paying jobs throughout the country, all       while incentivizing consumption of fuels that significantly       reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The biodiesel tax credit       lowers the price that truck drivers pay for fuel, and lowers       the price that heating oil customers pay to heat their homes.        Extending the biodiesel blenders credit will allow us to       continue to provide these economic and environmental       benefits.        Unfortunately, the uncertainty caused by the ``on-again,       off-again'' tempo of legislative extensions, including the       Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 which retroactively extended       the biodiesel tax incentives through the end of 2017, has       somewhat frustrated our sector's ability to anticipate the       availability of the incentives and make the necessary       investments. This severely disrupts access to capital, as       well as the ability to hire and expand.        Since the credit's inception, the market responded as       Congress intended. The undersigned trade associations are       united in urging Congress to act on a multiyear extension of       this successful program and provide our industry long-term       certainty as expeditiously as possible.            Sincerely,          Advanced Biofuels Association, American Farm Bureau             Federation, American Trucking Associations, National             Association of Convenience Stores, National Biodiesel             Board, National Renderers Association, NATSO,             Representing America's Travel Centers and Truckstops,             New England Fuels Institute, Petroleum Marketers             Association of America, Society of Independent Gasoline             Marketers of America.                                   ____                                                  February 11, 2019.      Hon. Charles Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways & Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Grassley and Neal, and Ranking Members Wyden       and Brady: The undersigned organizations represent users,       retailers, customers, fleet managers, utilities, and       producers of clean alternative transportation fuels.        We ask your support for including a reinstatement of the       $0.50/gallon alternative fuels tax credit (AFTC) (26 USC       6426(d) and 6427(e)) in a fiscal year 2019 government       spending package. The AFTC is a credit of $0.50 per gasoline       gallon equivalent (GGE) of certain transportation fuels,       including natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, P Series       Fuels, liquefied hydrogen and others. Extending the AFTC       retroactively for 2018 and prospectively for 2019 will allow       businesses and customers to continue to deploy cleaner       alternative fuel technologies. A full five-year extension of       the AFTC would provide business certainty along with a       significant contribution to our nation's economic growth.       Unfortunately, the credit has currently lapsed as of December       31, 2017 and many fleets, businesses, and manufacturers are       unable to plan future investments as they manage current       uncertainty. Immediately reinstating the AFTC for 2018 and       2019 is necessary to encouraging further deployment of new,       clean transportation technology.        Extending the AFTC will bring significant environmental       benefits, improved air quality, and enhance our energy       independence by lowering our dependence on foreign oil.       Renewal of the AFTC also promotes increased private-sector       investment in infrastructure and equipment, which leads to       more jobs and economic output.        Thank you for your continued support for the AFTC and for       the use of cleaner-burning alternative transportation fuels.       We appreciate your consideration of this request.
