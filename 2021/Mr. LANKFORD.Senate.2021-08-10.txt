 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3792 and ask  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, this amendment would add language to  prohibit funding for abortions consistent with the longstanding Hyde  amendment, which has been the law of the land since 1976.   The Hyde amendment has enjoyed decades of bipartisan support,  including from then-Senator Joe Biden, and it has been signed into law  by Democratic and Republican Presidents alike.   The Hyde amendment reflects a decades-long consensus that millions of  Americans who are profoundly opposed to abortion should not be forced  to pay for the taking of human lives of children or incentivize it with  their taxpayer dollars. A 2020 Marist poll found that 60 percent of  Americans, including 37 percent of people who identify as pro-choice,  oppose the use of their taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions.   Similarly, the Weldon amendment has been in law since 2004. It  protects individuals from being forced to participate in abortion if it  would violate their conscience.   Millions of Americans of faith and of no faith know that the only  difference between a child in the womb and outside the womb is time.  Just because they are smaller people doesn't mean they should be any  less protected by law.    Mr. President, I would ask for the yeas and nays and  remind everyone these amendments have been in place since 1976 and  2004. It doesn't expand anything.
