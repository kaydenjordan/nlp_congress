 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion to instruct  conferees to not include Representative Ronny Jackson's amendment in  the fiscal year 2024 NDAA.   This policy is a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars to circumvent State  laws and violates the decades-old, bipartisan Hyde amendment.   It is clear that Joe Biden and Lloyd Austin's Department of Defense  is more focused on appeasing the woke mob of pink-hat-wearing feminists  than focusing on keeping our Nation safe.   This is the same DOD that surrendered to the Taliban, costing the  lives of 13 brave servicemembers. This is the same DOD treating our  military like a woke social experiment. This is the same DOD the House  will vote to fund later this week.   The Department of Defense should be focused on readiness and  lethality, not spending taxpayer dollars to kill the lives of innocent,  unborn babies.   We are not going to give up on this cause that is righteous, and we  are not going to stop fighting to give voice to the voiceless.   Since Roe v. Wade in 1973, over 63 million lives have been lost to  abortion. I personally have held a newborn baby born at 23 weeks old, 1  pound, 8 ounces. I know that her life has just the same worth and value  as any one of us standing here today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Ronny  Jackson, for his leadership in restoring our military focus and  protecting these precious unborn lives.   I am proud to stand with my colleagues in defense of these children,  as well as with millions of Americans across our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to instruct.
