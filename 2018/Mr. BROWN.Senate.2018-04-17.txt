 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion. This is  my second day in a row being on the opposite side of my friend Senator  Moran and Senator Crapo, too, for that matter, but you have to do what  you have to do.   Over the last year and a half, as we have seen time after time after  time, Republicans in this Congress have made it pretty clear to the  American people whose side they are on. They have used the  Congressional Review Act--something nobody at home really knows about  and something most of us didn't know anything about until we began to  see at the White House these executive retreats every weekend for Wall  Street executives. They have used the Congressional Review Act more  than any other Congress in history to give handouts to big corporations  at the expense of ordinary Americans.   It is not enough for Republican legislators to go to Senator  McConnell's office down the hall and cut deals giving tax cuts to the  richest people in the country and giving tax breaks to General Motors,  which promised that if tax cuts were given to the largest corporations  in America, they were going to raise wages and hire more people.   Well, GM just announced--to its everlasting discredit--hundreds of  layoffs at its Lordstown plant near Youngstown, OH. Hundreds and  hundreds of people were laid off, perhaps permanently. We don't know,  but the signs  [[Page S2205]]  aren't good. At the same time, General Motors in Toledo, because they  make the transmissions for the Chevy Cruze in Youngstown, are laying  people off. And then the Ohio Turnpike from Toledo to Youngstown, this  long Ohio turnpike--one of the centers of the American auto industry-- we will probably see layoffs in the supply chain. Even though they got  a huge tax cut, written in the office down the hall, in Majority Leader  McConnell's office--they got a huge tax cut and lots of money in their  pockets. What do they do? They mostly do corporate buybacks and stock  buybacks. They share this money with their biggest stockholders.    So that is what happened with the tax cut. Now they are giving  another handout to a big corporation at the expense of Americans. It is  bad enough that we are considering this Congressional Review Act piece  of legislation. We are considering a bill that would tell Wall Street  banks and shady lenders that it is OK to discriminate against  borrowers.   Somebody who looks like me can go to a car dealership and get a loan  when they decide they are going to buy a Chevy Cruze. My wife and I  have each bought a Chevy Cruze. I am going to go finance a Chevy Cruze,  and I get a certain interest rate. We have seen data that shows that if  somebody looks a little different from me--if they are African  American, Latina, Asian American, or Pacific Islanders--they pay a  higher interest rate. We know that is what the data says. But this  body--from the last vote, it is pretty clear--they say that is all  right, that if the dealer wants to charge higher interest rates to  people of color, that is OK.   So it is bad enough that we are saying today and this body is giving  its stamp of approval saying that it is OK to discriminate and to  charge higher interest rates to people of color. I have said this in  the Banking Committee before, and Senator Crapo has heard me say this  many times: The ZIP Code where my wife and I live in Cleveland, OH, had  more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of America.  There are reasons for that. Part of the reasons for that is who lives  in my ZIP Code, mostly.   But it is not just that which today's legislation would do. It  threatens thousands more protections for workers and families that are  vulnerable to repeal by Congress.   Republicans have used the Congressional Review Act to repeal  important rules that would have given low-wage workers access to  retirement plans. So here in the Senate, we talk about caring about  workers, we talk about the dignity of work, and we talk about helping  people save for the future, but one of the provisions of the  Congressional Review Act would have given low-wage workers access to  retirement plans, and this legislation takes it away.   One of the other rules that were rolled back ensured that Federal  contract employers had protections for their workers regardless of  race, regardless of gender, regardless of sexual orientation. It  ensured that women had the right to choose their own healthcare  provider regardless of their form of insurance.   The Congressional Review Act repeals all of those rules.   They repealed the rule that would have guaranteed customers the right  to a day in court when they were ripped off by a bank like Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo has a whole rap sheet of ripping off their customers. But  we in this body said: Well, you shouldn't have done that, Mr. and Mrs.  Wells Fargo, but we are going to let you do that on individual  contracts.   So if you are wronged by Wells Fargo or any of these other big  financial institutions, you don't get a day in court, sorry. That is  what this body did.   It is the same with Equifax. We know what Equifax did. Equifax  violated the privacy of pretty much half the people in North Dakota or  Idaho or Ohio or in this whole country, but we said: That is OK,  Equifax; just try not to do it again; and we let them off the hook.   Fortunately, too much time has passed for Congress to use the  Congressional Review Act to roll back other protections the last  administration put in place, but they now want to open up a whole new  idea. They want to use a legal loophole to interfere with potentially  thousands more Federal decisions, potentially going back as far as 20  years.   In order to clarify how laws work, Federal agencies--this is really  in the weeds, but you know we have some pretty smart people here who  figure out how to go in the weeds and find loopholes and exploit people  and, frankly, hurt the little guy. Whether she works in construction or  punches a time clock or works as a waitress in a diner in Garfield  Heights, they find ways to screw the little guy.   So here is how it works. Federal agencies issue guidance to help  people understand how the law protects them and to help businesses  understand how to follow the law. Just last week, some of these smart  people--my Republican colleagues--at a hearing decried the practice of  enforcing the law without providing guidance in advance. This week,  though--this week--some of those same smart Republicans want to start  nullifying agency guidance, which would completely up-end the Federal  programs that families depend on. And this is an anti-business  decision, too, on their part. The businesses want the predictability,  they want the certainty so they can follow the rules.    Under this crazy new plan, some of these very smart Republicans--and  at least one of them is on the Banking Committee--under this new plan,  they can ban Federal agencies from explaining how States administer  Federal health insurance programs, programs like the Children's Health  Insurance Program. They can undermine requirements to make sure that  federally funded projects pay the local prevailing wages.   Today I went to breakfast with a number of iron workers and glaziers  and laborers and electricians and pipe fitters and others who work with  their hands and make a damn good living, with good benefits and good  retirement for their families. You know what. They can use this  newfound rule that these very smart Republican legislators figured out  how to exploit to undermine pay and beat back local prevailing wage  laws.   Republicans have used the Congressional Review Act to attack access  to healthcare and worker and environmental protections. So it is no  stretch. They have done it before. It is no stretch that they would do  it again, only now there would be no limits on the types of agency  actions they can target because they found this loophole and they can  go back 20 years. The one we are working on today was handed down--this  agency guidance was handed down in 2013.   So one of the first things Republicans want to do with this--they are  just so excited with this new loophole--they found that they can go  after people who don't have good lobbyists in Washington. They can go  after people who won't contribute to their campaign. They can go after  people who, frankly, struggle every day just to make a living in this  country.   What is the first thing they do? They make car loans--it is clear  what happens. They make car loans more expensive for women and for  people of color. The bill sends a message to lenders across the country  that if you are legally discriminating, go ahead, we are not going to  stop you.   We created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to police Wall  Street banks and other shady lenders who ripped off working families.  Under its last Director, the Bureau returned $12 billion to 29 million  Americans who had been ripped off by payday lenders and credit card  companies and for-profit colleges.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau used to be a cop on the beat  to protect consumers. We want a consumer bureau because we have the  banks--$1 trillion, $2 trillion; Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells  Fargo--these banks are trillion-dollar banks, some of them $2 trillion.  So we have the banks here, and we have a lot of consumers who don't  have a union or any protection, and they sign these contracts for a  loan or something, and they don't really know what the fine print says.  So that is why we have a consumer bureau--to protect those people.   Twenty-nine million Americans have benefited from it just since its  creation less than a decade ago, and they have saved $12 billion. It  used to be a cop on the beat. It used to issue reports warning  consumers about industries that weren't following the law. It brought  [[Page S2206]]  tough enforcement actions. It identified discriminatory lending  practices in auto loans and home mortgages.   We know discrimination is still a major problem for people of color  who make the biggest investment of their lives: their house and their  car--their house and their car, their two biggest investments, and you  can legally discriminate in this country because of the way somebody  looks. You can discriminate against them because of race, and now we  are saying it is OK.   Look at what has happened in this country because they said that.  Just a few months ago, the Center for Investigative Reporting released  a report showing that redlining is still a problem in big American  cities to this day. The National Fair Housing Alliance conducted tests  and demonstrated that people of color were systematically offered worse  loan terms for cars than White borrowers with the exact same credit  seeking to purchase the exact same vehicle. But instead of working to  root out this discrimination--you would think that is what we would all  do, Republicans and Democrats alike. Instead, we are making it easier  for banks to turn customers away or to take advantage of them based on  the color of their skin. This is 2018, for gosh sakes. Why would we  still be doing that?   This repeal could permanently weaken Federal anti-discrimination  laws. These laws have been the law of the land for decades. These are  the laws that brave Americans fought for during the civil rights  movement. Do you remember when Congress passed the fair housing bill?  The fair housing bill was passed a week after Dr. King's assassination,  50 years ago last week. You would think we would want to strengthen it,  not weaken it.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from  the scores of civil rights and consumer and environmental and other  organizations that vehemently oppose this legislation.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                     April 16, 2018.        The undersigned organizations are strongly united in       opposition to S.J. Resolution 57, sponsored by Sen. Moran (R-      KS), which attempts to use the Congressional Review Act (CRA)       to target regulatory actions by federal agencies that were       issued well in the past and have been in effect for years or       potentially even decades. We vigorously oppose any attempt by       the Senate to subject the ``Bulletin on Indirect Auto Lending       and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act''--      issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in       2013--to a vote under the CRA. Many of us oppose repealing       this important guidance on substantive grounds, but we join       together today to focus instead on the procedural issue of       using the CRA against a guidance that has been in place for       years.        We oppose such a vote, as it would contravene the clear       intent of the CRA to allow Congress to review and challenge       recently finalized agency actions. This would set a dangerous       precedent that would open the door for Congress to stretch       the CRA to challenge a wide variety of settled agency actions       that have been in effect for years or decades, particularly       ``guidance documents'' that are not only crucial to       protecting workers, consumers, minorities, the environment,       and the economy but also to providing regulatory certainty       for businesses and the public. Using the CRA, rather than       regular legislative order, to attack years-old established       guidance would be an extraordinary and egregious abuse of       normal process--exactly the kind of rigged action on behalf       of narrow corporate insiders that so infuriates Americans of       all political stripes.        This Congress has already used the CRA in unprecedented       fashion to repeal fourteen common-sense, carefully developed       regulations that protect the public, including measures to       protect internet privacy, women's health, retirement       security, workplace safety, fair pay in the workplace, the       environment and clean water, anti-corruption safeguards, and       sensible gun control. Unlike the normal legislative process,       the CRA is already problematic legislation which gives       Congress the ability to strike down regulations that protect       the public on behalf of narrow special interests without any       congressional hearings and virtually no floor debate. The       appropriate response would be for Congress to revisit this       flawed process rather than expand it to undermine policies       that were finalized long ago.        Applying the CRA to settled agency actions from the past       would violate the clear intent and spirit of the law. The       legislative history of the CRA makes plain its purpose:       ``this legislation establishes a government wide       congressional review mechanism for most new rules.'' As a       procedural matter, Congress could have, and more       appropriately should have, reviewed the guidance at issue       here back in 2013 when it was issued by the CFPB, requested a       GAO opinion at that time to determine its eligibility under       the CRA and potentially used the CRA to challenge such       guidance shortly after its issuance in 2013. Indeed, Congress       has made multiple GAO requests regarding the applicability of       the CRA to guidance documents when the guidance was       originally issued or shortly thereafter. Subjecting these       actions to the CRA now would fly in the face of congressional       intent and stretch the law in ways that were neither       anticipated nor expected by those who voted for it.        Moreover, it raises suspicions that this CRA challenge is       being undertaken now, rather than following the issuance of       the guidance in 2013, because there is a higher chance of       success given the makeup of this Congress.        Moreover, applying the CRA to long-established guidance       would be, simply put, wrongheaded. Guidance documents are       often specifically requested by regulated entities and       industry stakeholders in order to resolve uncertainties in       the application of regulations to stakeholder business       practices, including in the form of so-called ``No Action       Letters''. Using the CRA to repeal guidance documents would       imperil numerous past guidance documents that were not       submitted to Congress under the CRA, including many that were       specifically requested by regulated entities or stakeholders.       Congress should act with caution, if at all, in using the CRA       on guidance documents, but applying the CRA to longstanding       guidance would be misguided.        Long-established guidance is not locked into place; when       appropriate, it is a relatively simple matter for agencies to       revise or repeal longstanding guidance. In fact, agencies       have already begun the process of revising or repealing       another guidance document that was the subject of a recent       GAO opinion, the so-called ``leveraged lending'' guidance       which ensures that big banks do not engage in risky lending       practices that threaten the financial system, without any       need for a CRA vote.        Given the long and growing list of legislative issues that       need to be addressed by the Senate on an urgent and expedited       basis, it is difficult to fathom why the Senate would choose       to spend valuable floor time to repeal guidance under the CRA       when such guidance could be effectively revisited, and if       appropriate, repealed by the agency that issued it in short       order and with limited procedural requirements. By bringing       this vote to the Senate floor, it sends a message to the       public that Congress is more interested in giving narrow       handouts to special interests rather than addressing the real       issues that impact hard-working Americans and their families.        We, the under-signed groups, strongly urge Senators to       reject abusing the CRA to attack guidance documents that were       issued years ago, and get back to solving real problems on       behalf of the American public. We strongly urge you to reject       S.J. Resolution 57.

Majority Leader McConnell,      Russell Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.      Minority Leader Schumer,      Hart Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       We, the undersigned civil rights and consumer advocacy  [[Page S2207]]       organizations, ask you to oppose S.J. Res. 57, the       Congressional Review Act (CRA), introduced by Senator Jerry       Moran (R-KS), intended to undo the Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau's (CFPB or Consumer Bureau) Indirect Auto       Lending Guidance, published over five years ago. This       resolution is the latest in a series of attempts to chill       federal efforts to end widespread unlawful discrimination.       Discrimination in the auto lending market is well-documented       and results in people of color paying more for years to       finance a car purchase. This CRA would also set the dangerous       precedent of undoing long-standing federal agency guidance--      an expansion of the use of the Congressional Review Act, and       certainly beyond its original purpose of narrowly reviewing       regulations soon after they were enacted.        The Consumer Bureau's 2013 indirect auto lending guidance       put auto lenders on clear notice that the Equal Credit       Opportunity Act (ECOA) makes them liable for discriminatory       pricing on auto loans they acquire from auto dealers. ECOA       makes it illegal for a creditor to discriminate in any aspect       of a credit transaction on the basis of race or other       protected bases; indirect auto lenders are creditors under       ECOA.        Discrimination in auto lending has long been widespread,       and a significant culprit is the discretionary dealer mark-      up. Three-fourths of all consumers use a loan to purchase a       car, and 80% of auto loans are financed through the auto       dealer. The auto dealer may provide that financing directly       or it may facilitate indirect financing by an indirect third-      party lender. In indirect auto financing, the dealer usually       collects basic information regarding the applicant and uses       an automated system to forward that information to several       prospective indirect auto lenders. The indirect auto lender       establishes a ``buy rate'' for the customer. The dealer can       then add as much as 2-2.5% to the buy rate and keep some or       all of the difference. These mark-ups have been found to add       over $25 billion to the total loan cost of auto loans made       over the course of one year.        The discriminatory impact of this discretionary practice       has been researched and documented, time and again. In the       mid-1990s, a series of lawsuits were filed against the       largest auto finance companies based on data showing that       that borrowers of color were twice as likely to have their       loans marked up and paid markups twice as large as similarly       situated white borrowers with similar credit ratings. The       CFPB's own investigations found that borrowers who identified       as African American, Latino, and Asian/Pacific Islander paid       between 20 and 36 basis points more for their loans than       similarly situated white borrowers, adding between $150 and       $300 in additional interest over the life of those consumers'       loans.        We have seen the evidence that enforcement against auto       lending discrimination has resulted in real benefits to       wronged borrowers of color. As a result of its       investigations, the Consumer Bureau, jointly with the       Department of Justice, took enforcement action against Ally       Financial, Honda, Fifth Third Bank, and Toyota, which       resulted in restitution to wronged borrowers of over $140       million. These lenders also agreed to adjust their pricing       models by limiting the amount of their dealer mark-ups--real       evidence of progress in the fight against a discriminatory       lending practice. Of note, the 2013 guidance also explains       that lenders can address fair lending risk by paying       compensation to dealers in ways other than allowing them to       mark up the interest rate.        Discrimination in auto lending continues to be a very real       problem. In early 2018, a study conducted by the National       Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) paired white and non-white       testers to visit auto dealerships and shop for the same car       within 24 hours of each other. The study found that, more       often than not, the better qualified non-white applicant was       offered higher cost pricing options than the less qualified       white applicant, resulting in those non-white borrowers       paying on average $2,662 more than the white borrowers over       the life of the loan. Additionally, NFHA found that 75% of       the time, white testers were offered more financing options       than non-white testers. These statistics further prove the       need for continued vigilant enforcement against violations of       ECOA, as well as clear expectations for industry like the       2013 guidance provides.        Auto loans are the third most prevalent form of debt among       U.S. residents after home and student loans. Discrimination       in auto lending contributes to credit access disparities and       to the racial and ethnic wealth gap. This CRA would send the       wrong message to the auto industry and to the American       people.        In addition, CRA has never been used to undo longstanding       guidance, and it was not intended to be used this way.       Permitting CRAs to undo longstanding guidance opens the door       to regulatory uncertainty across the federal regulatory       environment and across a range of U.S. markets as a result.        We urge you to oppose S.J. Res. 57 and keep the federal       government's commitment to rooting out racial discrimination       clear.        Thank you for your consideration. If you have any questions       please do not hesitate to contact Cheye-Ann Corona, Senior       Policy Associate with the Center for Responsible Lending,            Sincerely,        Allied Progress, American Federation of State, County, and       Municipal Employees, Americans for Financial Reform,       Arkansans Against Abusive Payday Lenders, California       Reinvestment Coalition, Center for Responsible Lending, Color       of Change, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union,       Impact Fund, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law,       NAACP, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.

Mr. President, Americans for Financial Reform called this  resolution ``a deeply troubling piece of legislation that will leave  millions of people of color at the mercy of auto-dealers and lenders  with a long history of racial discrimination.''   I know a lot of auto dealers, and I am sure my friend from Idaho,  Senator Crapo, does as well. We all do. Most of them don't do this, but  some of them do, and why are we allowing the some of them who do to  continue to do this?   If Republicans are willing to use this loophole that a few very smart  Republicans uncovered--this loophole that they went down in the weeds  and figured out how to exploit--if they are willing to use this  loophole to attack our basic right to equality, there may be no end to  the other consumer protections they can repeal. Big corporations could  be free to take advantage of customers with little to rein them in,  with fewer consumer protections and with fewer environmental  protections.   Think of the progress we have made in this country because of  consumer protection, because of strong safe drinking water laws, and  because of strong clean air laws. I live 10 miles from Lake Erie. I  know about the progress, in part because we passed strong laws for  environmental protection. I know what we have done to clean up Lake  Erie.   The Great Lakes are 20 percent of all the ground and surface  freshwater in the world. I look at what we have done as a society. Do  we want to go back on this as the President cuts funding to clean up  the Great Lakes? The EPA issues guidelines today to ensure that  corporate polluters aren't putting communities in danger by  contaminating the air they breathe or the water they drink. States rely  on Federal guidance--the key word--so they can work with the Federal  Government to provide healthcare to families and children. Workers rely  on guidance from the Department of Labor to make sure they are getting  fair pay in a safe workplace. But under the legislation before us  today, those protections could be stripped away in the future, one by  one by one.   Every time somebody here wants to do a favor for their favorite  special interest group, they can go down to Senator McConnell's office,  probably pick up a ticket--because there is probably going to be a  line, with all the lobbyists going in and out--they will pick up a  ticket to say, which special interest group can I do a favor for today,  and they will find another one.   For the millions who lost their jobs, for the millions who lost their  homes in the financial crisis a decade ago, for the millions who are  struggling to build their retirement with wages that haven't been  growing for more than 20 years, it is already hard enough to get ahead.  We should be making it easier for them, not harder.   I ask for a ``no'' vote.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
