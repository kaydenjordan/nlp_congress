 Mr. President, I voted against the motions to proceed  and invoke cloture on overriding the President's veto of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 because, at this time of  national crisis, the Senate's first order of business should be getting  more relief to struggling American families. That means the Senate  should have held a clean up-or-down vote on the House-passed measure to  increase the amount of the individual stimulus payments from $600 to  $2,000. The Senate could have easily passed both the additional  payments and completed the business of the NDAA veto override this week  had Senator McConnell and the GOP majority been willing to do so. Given  the President's purported support of this relief, it could have been  signed into law this week. But instead of delivering this additional  help to struggling American families, the Republican majority  repeatedly blocked requests to pass the additional relief by unanimous  consent and refused to schedule an up-or-down vote.   That said, I support the underlying National Defense Authorization  Act. The President's veto of this legislation put at risk a number of  important measures, including a pay raise for our troops; critical  investments for Maryland's military installations; a process to rename  those military facilities that bear the names of individuals who fought  with the Confederacy to preserve slavery; limits on the transfer of  military equipment to local police forces; and support for key national  security priorities. While the NDAA bill is not perfect and includes a  number of provisions I oppose, on balance it is an important measure  for our country. That is why I voted for it in the first place and why  I voted in favor of overriding the President's veto.                            ____________________
