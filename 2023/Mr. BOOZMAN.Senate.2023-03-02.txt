 Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the  40th anniversary of ``Arkansas Week,'' the flagship public affairs  program of Arkansas PBS.   Since its first broadcast in 1983, ``Arkansas Week'' has delivered  consistent and reliable in-depth news and analysis of events in Little  Rock and throughout our State to the Nation's Capital and beyond, as  well as robust coverage of policies that impact all Arkansans.  [[Page S633]]    In a recent column recognizing this milestone, long-time host Steve  Barnes explained the focus of the program has always been the matters  that matter. There is no doubt the discussions featured on this program  have encouraged Arkansans to advocate for change, influenced policies  and procedures at all levels of government and brought attention to  undercovered issues.   Arkansans have had a front-row seat to the evolving political climate  of the last four decades as a result of ``Arkansas Week.'' We have seen  a lot of changes and the voices on this show have provided valuable  insight. The ``Arkansas Week'' roundtable panel is a signature segment  of the show that has brought together the best and brightest  journalists and experts in the State to deliver unique perspectives in  a manner that expands on the stories covered in print and allows for a  broader discussion beyond the headlines. I have been honored to join  this mainstay numerous times and talk with Steve as well as other hosts  and guests to contribute to Arkansans' awareness of the issues and  events that directly affect them.   Throughout the years, ``Arkansas Week'' has brought together people  from across the political spectrum to share their thoughts. The program  has always fostered an atmosphere where its acceptable to disagree  without being disagreeable, a feature truly appreciated by the viewers  and guests alike. It is even more important at a time when polarization  is too common.   As we celebrate its storied history of delivering information to  citizens in all corners of our State, I applaud the dedication of Steve  Barnes and the men and women who work tirelessly each week to create  ``Arkansas Week.'' Our State is grateful to all those who have been  part of this program over the past four decades on being a reliable,  informative source for news.                            ____________________
