 Mr. President, on April 2, we recognize the life  and leadership of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, a global spiritual  leader known universally as the Rebbe and head of the Chabad-Lubavitch  movement.   The Rebbe was born in 1902 and lived through the darkest periods of  history, the evils of Russian communism and the horrors of Nazi  Germany. In 1941, the Rebbe and his wife Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka arrived  safely on the shores of the United States. He volunteered at the  Brooklyn Navy Yard using his engineering skills to assist our Nation  during World War II and worked tirelessly to rebuild and guide after  the Holocaust.   During those difficult years, the Rebbe established a program that  arranged for rabbinical students to travel across the country to visit  Jewish farmers, U.S. servicemembers, and others isolated from their  families or communities. This included locations such as the 335th Army  Air Force Base Unit in Sioux Falls, Ellsworth Air Force Base, and  communities across South Dakota. This program still exists today, and  these rabbinical students sent by the Rebbe are often the only  connection many local Jews have with their faith.   Under the Rebbe's leadership, the Chabad-Lubavitch movement has  become the world's largest Jewish educational organization with more  than 3,500 permanent centers in all 50 States, including in my home  State of South Dakota, and in 109 countries around the world. It is  thanks to the Rebbe's vision that our State has its first rabbi in  almost 40 years with the establishment of the Chabad Jewish Center of  South Dakota.   The Rebbe extolled America's unique role as a superpower and had  meaningful relationships with several of our Nation's leaders who saw  him as the moral guide of so many. For the Rebbe, America was a beacon  of light of historic proportions to be utilized in influencing the  moral betterment of all humanity. He urged us all to become ambassadors  for goodness and kindness and explained that education must not be  limited to the tools needed for making a good living, but rather focus  on the ethics, morals, and values that have always been the basis of  any decent society.   For more than four decades, every U.S. President has declared the  annual observance of Education and Sharing Day in honor of the  anniversary of the Rebbe's birth, in recognition of his contributions  to the betterment of education for all people. In 1995, he was awarded  the Congressional Gold Medal for his contributions toward education,  morality, and acts of charity.   Education and Sharing Day represents an excellent opportunity for us  to reflect on the Rebbe's vision and leadership and to embrace his  teachings that starting with moral education, we each do our part to  increase in goodness and kindness.                            ____________________
