 Mr. Speaker, the American people are fed up with  the United States being involved in endless military conflicts around  the world.   For far too long, Presidents of both parties have overstepped their  constitutional authority by engaging in dubious legal gymnastics to  continue involving U.S. troops in endless wars and conflicts without  congressional authorization.   Article I of the Constitution is clear. Congress has the sole  authority to authorize military involvements in overseas conflict. Once  authorized by Congress, Article II of the Constitution allows the  President to direct the military as Commander in Chief.   Congress must reassert its sole authority and not allow the executive  branch to sidestep us.   As the largest and most diverse group in the Federal Government  responsible for representing the American people and their interests,  Congress should engage in debate before the executive branch can  involve U.S. troops in wars overseas.   Tens of thousands of U.S. troops have been put in harm's way and  trillions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on overseas military  ventures around the world without proper debate or oversight from  Congress.   Enough is enough. That is why I support the Syria War Powers  Resolution that the House voted on earlier this week.                            ____________________
