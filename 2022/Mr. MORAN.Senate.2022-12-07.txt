 Mr. President, today I want to recognize and pay  tribute to a remarkable Kansan: retired U.S. Army COL Paul Taylor of  Overland Park. Paul was recently awarded ZERO's 2022 Prostate Cancer  Veterans Advocacy Award for his leadership in improving prostate cancer  outcomes for veterans impacted by this disease.   Paul was first diagnosed with stage IV prostate cancer in 2012 at the  age of 41 while preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. As is too  often the case, he did not experience any notable symptoms warning of  the disease. It was a routine predeployment medical screening that  saved his life.   Unfortunately, Paul's story is not rare. With nearly 489,000 patients  suffering from prostate cancer, this is one of the most common cancer  diagnoses among American veterans. In fact, one in five veterans will  develop prostate cancer in his lifetime.   With the support and encouragement of his superiors, Paul retained  his command of 700 soldiers throughout his medical treatment consisting  of hormone therapy, chemotherapy and surgery. He later retired from the  Army and continued to serve his country in emergency management roles  throughout regional and national crises.   Paul's cancer is now under control with treatment and is closely  monitored. He credits his family and patient support groups for their  care and encouragement throughout his cancer journey. They have been  meaningful sources of emotional support and mentorship as he underwent  treatment for the disease.   For those facing similar health challenges, he encourages them to  find a community to offer support and hope throughout the journey. He  embodied this principle himself by choosing to sacrifice his own time  and talents to help those facing prostate cancer.   Even as Paul battled this terrible disease himself, he dedicated his  life to fighting prostate cancer through volunteer leadership to help  all who suffer from this disease--but especially veterans.   Today, Paul lives in Overland Park, KS, with his wife Amy and three  daughters. He is an active and dedicated advocate for veterans who  suffer from prostate cancer.   His efforts have been instrumental in the progress of S. 2720, the  Veterans' Prostate Cancer Treatment and Research Act. This legislation  creates a clinical pathway for prostate cancer in the Department of  Veterans Affairs and helps thousands of veterans manage their prostate  cancer treatment process.   On behalf of the U.S. Senate, it is my honor to recognize Paul Taylor  for his courage, sacrifice, and determination as he now offers hope and  support to the nearly 3.1 million men living with prostate cancer in  the United States.                            ____________________
