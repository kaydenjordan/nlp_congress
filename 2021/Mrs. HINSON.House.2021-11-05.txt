 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for  yielding today.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this massive tax- and-spend plan that was only posted late last night.   This entire process has been a sham. It has been full of nothing but  partisanship, disrespect for taxpayers and late-night and all-day  antics. No wonder my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are in  disarray.   Late last night, the 2,100-page bill was finally posted. We certainly  have not had adequate time to fully read or digest what is in it, let  alone figure out how much it is going to cost my constituents.   Iowans deserve to know how much of their hard-earned paychecks are  going to be wasted on frivolous, misguided priorities, like funding for  butterflies or desert fish when my constituents are busy trying to put  food on their tables, provide for their kids, and keep their family  farms operating.   But no, we can't even get the most basic information. We don't have  an official cost estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office. Instead, we have nonsense numbers, totally made-up numbers,  handed down from the White House in the middle of the night. That is  not how we govern responsibly in this body.   Madam Speaker, I came to Washington, D.C., to be an advocate for  taxpayers, to make sure that Iowans' voices are heard and to bring a  little bit of that Iowa commonsense to the Capitol. This place clearly  needs it.   Working families in Iowa sit around their kitchen tables, they talk  about what is important to them, they build a budget that fits within  their means and they stick to it.   I know what that is like. Moms across the country know what that is  like. It is not easy. We have to make hard choices. And frankly, it is  disrespectful and embarrassing that we are even having this debate  right now.   How can we spend taxpayers' money without knowing how much we are  spending?   In the Speaker's own words, we shouldn't vote without a CBO score. I  agree. Americans deserve to know the impact legislation will have on  their lives. The best estimates that we have, which don't even include  all of the provisions that Speaker Pelosi stuffed in there last night,  ring up in the trillions.   We are spending approximately trillions of dollars on nonsense  priorities when Iowans are dealing with real challenges, and we can't  even give them the respect of waiting for a proper cost estimate. This  bill bankrupts the economy, it benefits the wealthy, and it builds  bureaucracy. It is a bust. Vote ``no.''  [[Page H6215]]                                     time  1530
