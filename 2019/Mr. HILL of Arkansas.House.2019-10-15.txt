 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New Jersey  very much for allowing me to speak on the subject of Hong Kong today.   I rise in support of all these bills before us today, particularly  the bill from my friend from New Jersey, the Hong Kong Human Rights and  Democracy Act, and I stand in solidarity with all freedom-loving people  in Hong Kong.   For more than 4 months, we have witnessed Hong Kong citizens  peacefully protest for the right to live in a free and fair political  system.   Over my years, I have traveled to Hong Kong and witnessed their  innovative spirit and work ethic. In fact, Hong Kong was the model for  the post-World War II growth of the Asian Tigers in their prosperity  and innovation.                                time  1545    In the 1980s, when a proponent of welfare statism queried pro-growth  economist Melvyn B. Krauss:   ``But how many Hong Kongs can the world have?''   Dr. Krauss replied, ``As many as the world will allow itself.''   Freedom lovers should rally to that wisdom.   This summer, I had the opportunity to hear directly from leaders in  Hong Kong dedicated to religious tolerance and democracy as promised in  the one country, two systems agreement.   The people of Hong Kong continue to wave American flags during their  protests as a symbol for the freedoms that they desire.   Rather than receiving support from all over our great land here in  this country, they have had to witness the blatant hypocrisy that we  have seen from U.S. companies, including the National Basketball  Association, more worried about the bottom line and retribution from  the PRC, rather than standing up for the basic human rights that we are  so blessed with in this country and that we advocate for as a part of  our foreign policy all over this globe.   The free world is looking to us for leadership, and that is why I  thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), Mr. McGovern, and Mr.  Sherman for supporting these legislative efforts on a bipartisan basis,  but more importantly, supporting the people in Hong Kong that they have  the right to freedom of expression and democratic governance guaranteed  under that 50-year arrangement agreed to in 1997 by both--by both, Mr.  Speaker--the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support these measures  today, and I thank their sponsors.
