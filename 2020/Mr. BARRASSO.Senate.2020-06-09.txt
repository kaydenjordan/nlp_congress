 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today at a time that  you and I have heard the Democrats' latest rallying cry. Astonishingly,  the rallying cry is: Defund the police. Defund the police. That is what  I am hearing from Democrats all across America. This comes on the heels  of a previous battle cry: Abolish ICE. That is what the Democrats are  calling for today.   Leading Democrats--radical leftwing lawmakers like Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez--are pushing these very dangerous ideas. Let me say it again.  Liberal Democrats all across the country are asking all of us to defund  law enforcement in America. If we did that--if we did that--crime would  go through the roof, school safety would cease to exist, and the most  vulnerable in our society would have no one to turn to or call in case  of an emergency. Yet Democratic mayors across the country seem to be on  board.   Last week, the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles said that he plans to  slash the LA Police Department's budget. New York City Mayor de Blasio  has vowed to cut funding for the New York Police Department. The  Minneapolis City Council announced Sunday that it would vote to  disband--disband--the city's police department and said they had a  veto-proof majority.   House Democrats have now just released a new bill that supposedly  seeks police reform. This is from a party that just last month pushed a  trillion dollar--the total bill was $3 trillion for the Heroes fund to  support the police. Well, now funding for police has purposely been  left out of the bill.  [[Page S2791]]    As our economy begins to recover--and I will tell you the jobs  numbers are very promising--we need to make sure that our communities  are safe. This starts at the local level with Governors and mayors in  cities like Minneapolis and New York and Los Angeles.   Last week, the Wall Street Journal had an editorial that was titled  ``Liberal Cities, Radical Mayhem.'' Democratic mayors and Governors  seem unable to stop the lawlessness. It included a warning. It said:         This isn't merely about damage to property. It's about       destroying the order required for city life.    They went on to say:         Non-criminals are afraid to go into these cities in order       to make a living.    Now you have seen New York Governor Cuomo blaming Mayor de Blasio, as  well as the New York Police Department, for failing to stop the  violence in New York City. The Manhattan Institute says that the riots  likely caused New York businesses tens of millions of dollars last week  alone. This is in damages.   Nationwide, at least 12 people have been killed in the riots last  week, including police officers. The rioters have committed many acts  of violence against police officers, as well as against innocent  bystanders. In New York City alone, 292 officers have been injured last  week. One New York police officer was stabbed in the neck, and two  others were shot last Wednesday night in Brooklyn. In Los Angeles, 27  officers were injured during just one night of rioting. One officer  suffered a fractured skull and another a broken knee.   On Thursday, Attorney General Bill Barr gave a briefing on the  administration's efforts to end the violence. The Attorney General also  said that President Trump has directed him to spare no effort in  seeking justice in the George Floyd case.   The State has filed criminal charges against the four officers, and  Federal authorities are investigating civil rights violations. The  Attorney General is claiming and now has said that there is clear  evidence that extremist groups like antifa were inciting the riots. The  lawlessness, he said, must and will stop.   Our free society depends on the rule of law, and the Attorney General  has said that the rule of law will prevail. We need to continue to  focus on social, economic, educational, and police reforms. Still, no  sensible reform involves defunding the police. Police are civil  servants. Their job is difficult, and their job is dangerous.   They may need more resources, not fewer, as Democrats across the  country are calling for defunding. I am saying they may need more. They  may need more training. They may need more resources for body cameras.  They may need more resources to help recruit officers who match their  communities.   There is much more that needs to be done, and defunding is not part  of it. We can never abandon those who protect us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
