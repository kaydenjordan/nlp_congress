 Mr. Speaker, as we recover from the chaos emanating  from the White House and the tweeter-in-chief last week, it is  important to recognize children are not invaders. Children must not be  used as political pawns for reckless immigration enforcement policy.   I thank Justin Amash for being a lonely, but principled Republican  voice, reminding your colleagues, even if Donald Trump doesn't  recognize the Fifth Amendment, that under the Constitution, nobody is  denied of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.   There are over 300 other Republicans in the House and Senate, and I  hope America hears from them. And Democrats should welcome a contest of  ideas and a contest at the ballot box, not shouting at restaurants.   It is important that we don't lose sight of the bigger picture. There  is a reason that tens of thousands of people have come to the southern  border: the chaos and violence in parts of Mexico, especially Central  America, and the violence especially strong in the triangle of  Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.   The United States is not an entirely innocent bystander there. We  have supported repressive dictators in those countries in the 1980s,  and we have been meddling in their affairs for generations.   It is the lucrative American drug market that has fueled the drug  trade and gang activity. Part of our failed drug policies have  destabilized the lives of millions. The immense profits from the  American drug trade drives that activity to the borders, corrupts  governments, and has created a situation where we cannot even keep  drugs and cell phones out of American prisons.   What is the answer? I would suggest that it is not to deny people  fearing for their lives a right to prove their case as refugees seeking  asylum. The answer is not to hold children hostages in a macabre,  hateful drama that is a shame on all Americans.   The answer is not to forcibly take children out of the arms of their  mother, and then lose them in the system. I mean, wait a minute. If the  Postal Service and UPS can tell you where the sweat socks and the  razors that you ordered a week ago are in the system, why can't we tell  parents where their most precious possession, their children, are--and  the notion that some are walking away from detention facilities.   The Trump administration is talking about reorganizing essential  government departments. Maybe if they want to do that, they ought to  start with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They ought to start  with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health  and Human Services, all of the agencies that are a part of this  embarrassing spectacle, to figure out how to do it right, how to do it  humanely, in an open and transparent fashion, and stop the notion that  somehow there will be zero tolerance; that we will separate children  from their families at the borders; and we will criminalize people who  are seeking asylum.   Let's stop this malignant policy. Let's get children back to their  parents. Let's elevate the discourse respectfully, but forcefully  battle ideas and support the vulnerable.   It is not merely a question of justice for immigrant children, but of  justice and integrity of all Americans.                            ____________________
