 Madam Speaker, I had intended to stand up here and speak  about my provision preventing bump stocks being added to guns but,  after sitting here and listening for several hours, my colleagues  across the aisle, they have been misrepresenting the Second Amendment.  They have been pretending to care about children, and they have been  blubbering about their need for big guns to protect themselves.   I have just got to say one thing. America is listening, and it will  remember who allowed this plague to continue to kill our loved ones and  spread disaster around our country. They are listening, and they will  remember who it was.
