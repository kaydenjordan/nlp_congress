 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we raise this point today, not just  because of what has happened to Donald Trump's nominees over the last 2  years, but we reached this point because 16 years ago the Senator from  New York started this Senate down a path that was unprecedented in 200  years. For 200 years, any President's nominees got an up-or-down vote.  That was the custom, the unwritten rule, if you will.   Starting in 2003, specifically geared toward a brilliant young lawyer  named Miguel Estrada, the Senator from New York warped those unwritten  rules and customs. That has brought us to where we are today. So today  Senator Schumer will reap what he sowed. I will call it Miguel  Estrada's revenge.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
