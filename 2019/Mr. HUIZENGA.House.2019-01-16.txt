 Madam Speaker, it is an honor today to represent  hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children who will be marching  this week in Washington, D.C., and around the country through the cold,  through the wet, and, frankly, through the ridicule.   We don't march for the recognition or for the headlines. We march on  behalf of the millions of children who have had their opportunity to  make an impact on this world stolen from them.   We don't march because it is merely a political statement. We march  because it is right. We march for life.   We must continue to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to end  the lives of innocent children here in the United States and around the  globe.   When an organization prioritizes abortion over adoption and creating  a culture of life, we must question why our government funds them at  all.   Now more than ever, Madam Speaker, we are called to speak up for  those who cannot for themselves. We must all stand firm to defend the  sanctity of life, for the challenge is great and the cause is noble.   Together, we will march in solidarity for those who have never had  the opportunity to walk on their own, and, in coming days, our voices  will be heard louder than ever.                            ____________________
