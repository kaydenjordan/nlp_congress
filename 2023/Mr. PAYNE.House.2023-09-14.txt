 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Jeremias  Castillo, this year's $25,000 National Honor Society Scholarship  winner.   Castillo, a senior at Technology High School in Newark, was chosen  from a pool of 13,000 applicants. He won because his commitment to  enacting positive change in the country's healthcare system is what he  is all about.   When his father passed away, Jeremias witnessed the health  disparities that affect underrepresented groups, so he decided to do  something about it.   He volunteered weekly at a local medical center, he collected medical  supplies from the Newark Department of Health and Welfare, and he spoke  about his passion to improve healthcare at a symposium that reached  more than 3.6 million people.   Jeremias will use this scholarship to study neuroscience and  political science at Harvard University, and he will continue to help  create more equitable healthcare systems in America.   Again, I congratulate Jeremias for his dedication to his family, his  community, and his country.                            ____________________
