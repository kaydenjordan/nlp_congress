 Mr. President, as career opportunities and the requisite  skills  [[Page S4779]]  for success adapt to the demands of the 2lst century, so too must the  instruction and preparation educators receive. Educators are tasked  with designing educational experiences that rise to the rigorous State  academic standards and reflect the needs and interests of our Nation's  diverse student population. This past school year with the pandemic was  even more demanding our Nation's educators as they were faced with new  teaching challenges and adapting to virtual or hybrid learning  environments. Prior to the pandemic, school districts were faced with  widespread teacher shortages, with nearly every State reporting  shortages of teachers in high-need subjects like math, science, ahd  special education. Data from the U.S. Department of Education shows  COVID-19 has only exacerbated those needs with 43 States reporting  shortages in math teachers, 42 in science teachers, and 44 in special  education for the 2020-21 school year.   We must find ways to strengthen the educator talent pipeline to  ensure our students have access to high-quality educators and school  leaders. We also must address the fact that schools in high-need  communities are often staffed by a revolving door of underprepared and  inexperienced teachers who unable to meet students' needs. According to  the U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection, in  2016, schools with high enrollments of students of color were four  times as likely to hire uncertified teachers as were schools with low  enrollments of students of color. This in part due to State teacher  shortages.   This is why I am pleased to introduce today with my colleague,  Senator Collins, the Preparing and Retaining Education Professionals  Act, or PREP Act. As schools across our Nation continue to face growing  class sizes, many are struggling with a shortage of qualified teachers.  Rural communities in particular are experiencing a dearth of teachers  equipped to meet their growing needs. The PREP Act aims to create high- quality teacher residency programs to develop a diverse workforce that  is well prepared to provide the educational opportunities students need  to be successful in the 21st century.   More specifically, this legislation would expand the definition of  ``high need'' districts under the Every Student Succeeds Act, ESSA, to  include those experiencing teacher shortages in rural communities and  in areas such as special education, English language, science,  technology, engineering, math, and CTE, to allow for access to  additional support and improvement. It would also encourage school  districts to establish partnerships with local community colleges and  universities to ensure their education programs are developing future  teachers in content areas where there is currently a shortage of  educators. It would increase access to teacher and school leader  residency programs and preparation training while requiring States to  identify areas of teacher or leader shortages by subject across public  schools and use that data to target their efforts. Additionally, the  PREP Act bolsters support for teacher preparation programs at minority  serving institutions, MSIs, or historically Black colleges and  universities, HBCUs, to invest in a diverse and well-prepared educator  workforce.   Improving our Nation's educational system is contingent on our  ability to prepare, support, and retain quality educators. Research  shows that better prepared teachers stay longer in the profession and  are more likely to remain in their roles and positively impact young  people and their communities. As we continue to focus on recovering  from the pandemic, I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  see the PREP Act as a commonsense opportunity to help ensure that  students in every ZIP Code across the country have the well-prepared  teachers and school leaders they deserve.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BROWN:   S. 2255.
