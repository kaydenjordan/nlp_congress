 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kilmer for leading off  on this particular issue and all the work that he has been doing on  this particular concept. It is important.   I am very happy that this bill has 300 cosponsors now here in the  House. That is the largest number of cosponsors who have ever supported  a bill coming from the Natural Resources Committee. I think there are  only 10 other bills that have more cosponsors in the House. It passed  our committee on a 36-2 vote and is now awaiting the chance of being  heard here on the House floor.   There is a companion bill in the Senate, not quite as good as our  ours, that already has one-third of the Senate as cosponsors of that.   This is an idea whose time has actually come. We talk about the  maintenance backlog of our national parks and all of our public lands,  including fish and wildlife land, BLM land, and also our national  forests.   Especially as we now enter August, when there will be the largest  participation of Americans going out to visit these parks and public  lands, it is important that their experience be a positive one and not  be stopped by broken roads, lack of sewers, lack of facilities, or lack  of any kind of access that they may need. That is why it is so  significant.    We have almost around $17 billion of maintenance backlog only in our  parks. If you add up the maintenance backlog we have on all other  public lands, including our national forests, it is $30 billion that we  would need to spend just to get them to standard--not to do any kind of  really human moving it forward, but just to get them to where they are  workable, livable, and enjoyable.   That kind of backlog did not take place overnight. There are a lot of  people who are simply looking at saying: Well, let's just try and use  the same old stuff we have been using for a long time. We will  appropriate more money.   That doesn't work. We have developed a significant problem that needs  a significant new solution. This solution is one that was coming out  of, actually, the administration that has the support of over two- thirds of the House and that has the support of one-third of the  Senate. This is one of those things which, all of a sudden, this is a  cool idea to solve an existing problem that we have ignored for a  number of years.   The goal of this is to take excess--and that is the key word-- royalties that are coming from energy production on all Federal lands,  all kinds of energy production, whether it is traditional, renewable,  onshore, or offshore, any kind of royalties coming into the Federal  Government from those. If there is an excess, which means we take the  commitments we have already to things like GOMESA and LWCF, and after  those are funded, then if there is excess, that excess now goes into a  fund to start working at these kinds of problems, to solve our problems  with public lands. The restoration fund only receives the amounts after  all these other programs have received that.   If there is no excess in the royalties--I clearly doubt that will  happen, but if there is no excess in the royalties, then there is no  money that goes into this program.   Some people have said this is mandatory spending. No, it is not.   Mandatory spending, by definition, means you have to spend the money  whether it appears or not; you have to find it from somewhere else.  This is one of those programs that said, if there is excess, then the  first billion of this money will go to fund our national  [[Page H7389]]  parks, our public lands. If there is no excess, then you don't have to  find it anywhere else because there will be no money that goes to that.   This is not mandatory in any way.   Also, some people are saying, well, maybe there should be an offset  for this new program. This is really not a new program. The parks and  public lands exist. The responsibility to make sure that they are  viable, they are paid, and they are sustainable already exists. This is  an existing program.   We are not taking anything from any other program for this. We are  simply basing it on what is already our existing responsibility.   If you were to try and go through a traditional approach of trying to  appropriate more money through our budgeting process, that wouldn't  have to have an offset. What we are talking about here is existing  programs, existing needs, and existing responsibilities.   We have spent a whole lot of time buying up land. The Federal  Government owns one-third of America already. It is easy to buy up more  property. It is easy to establish a park because that sounds really  cool. You get your name on it, and it gives you a legacy. The hard part  is maintaining that land.   And for heaven's sake, if we are going to take the responsibility and  build a legacy, to actually buy something and create something, we have  to take the responsibility of maintaining it, and this is exactly what  we are talking about.   I am so proud that there are so many Republicans and so many  Democrats who have realized this is our obligation, this is our  responsibility, and we have to do it.   This bill is extremely important because it is a proper approach to  solving an existing problem. I encourage the leaders of this House to  bring it to the floor soon so it can be debated and heard.                            ____________________
