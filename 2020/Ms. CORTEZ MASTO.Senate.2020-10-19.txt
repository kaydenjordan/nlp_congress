 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the life and service of Norman Harry, wise leader of the  Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, fierce advocate for the environment and a  friend to all Nevadans. On the morning of August 11, 2020, Mr. Harry  passed peacefully at his home in Nixon, NV, his family surrounding him  in love. He was 65 years old.   Mr. Harry was born to Floyd and Charlotte Harry on October 20, 1954,  and was raised on the Pyramid Lake Paiute Reservation in addition to  spending time with family on the Walker River Paiute Reservation. At  Fernley High School, he played basketball and was a member of the rodeo  club, going on to gain recognition as a competitive team roper and  talented rodeo photographer as a young man.   On December 21, 1990, he married Beverly, and together, they have a  son, Jared, and a daughter, Autumn. He was dedicated to his family and  to his people and was recognized as a national leader in the  environmental justice movement as he was a tireless advocate for his  people, the lands, the water, and the bounty our natural world  provides.   Mr. Harry's legacy includes his historic work protecting Northern  Nevada's Pyramid Lake. Under his leadership, the Truckee River  Operating Agreement was completed and settled decades of litigation  over water rights and preserving the flow of water to Pyramid Lake and  securing it for future generations.   Over the years, Mr. Harry served in many roles for the Pyramid Lake  Paiute Tribe, including as Tribal chair for three terms and vice chair.  He fought many battles to protect water quality in northern Nevada and  waged a multiyear battle that ended the open burning of munitions at  the Sierra Army Depot in Herlong, CA, a practice that sent toxic clouds  eastward over the nearby Pyramid Lake Paiute tribal lands and northern  Nevada. In 2005, he fought for the removal of 13 tons of rockets,  shells, and ammunition from Pyramid Lake left by the military going  back to World War II. He served as chairman of the board for Great  Basin Mine Watch and, through his life, urged other Tribal leaders to  get involved in protecting groundwater and environmental resources for  the people. He mentored and taught countless other activists and  organizers to champion issues of environmental protection.   Today, I celebrate the life and many contributions of Mr. Norman  Harry, and I offer my sincere condolences to his family and Pyramid  Lake Paiute Tribe. The State of Nevada is a better place because we  were lucky enough to call Norman Harry one of our own. His activism,  leadership, knowledge, and voice will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
