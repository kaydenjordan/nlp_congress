 Mr. President, I appreciate that and thank the Senator.   Look, we are at the end of the year. Oftentimes in this body, things  happen at the end of the year that we are not too proud of, but we have  an opportunity to do something we could be very, very proud of, and  that is, pass the public lands bill.   This public lands bill would permanently reauthorize the Land and  Water Conservation Fund. This is the most effective conservation tool  we have in this country right now. Whether it is establishing a park in  one of your cities or towns or setting land aside so we can get better  access to our public lands, this is a critically important fund that I  hope we can get done as part of this lands package that is moving  forward and hopefully will move forward before this Congress ends.   LWCF--the Land and Water Conservation Fund--has invested over half a  billion dollars in Montana alone.   There is another component of this bill that I am particularly fond  of. It is a bill that will protect Yellowstone Park and the headwaters  of the Yellowstone River. It is called the Yellowstone Gateway  Protection Act. It is a simple bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a  bill that will help support the hundreds of small businesses in  Paradise Valley. And it is called Paradise Valley for a good reason-- because it is paradise, and we need to keep it a paradise by preventing  large-scale mining in that region.   I am just asking Congress to act. I am asking my fellow Members, my  fellow Senators to add some commonsense to the negotiations that are  moving on here and pass this lands bill because it is critically  important for our kids and our grandkids.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
