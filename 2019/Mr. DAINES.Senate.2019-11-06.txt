 Mr. President, for generations, America has been a beacon  of hope and freedom around the world. When confronted with tyranny and  evil, America has always overcome. In every generation, patriots have  answered the call to service in defense of our country and in defense  of freedom and democracy. Their bravery and willingness to serve is a  testament to the American and Montanan spirit.   It is my highest honor to serve as a voice for Montana's veterans in  the Halls of Congress. You see, Montana has one of the highest veteran  populations per capita in the United States. Montana's veterans are  what make living in Big Sky Country all the more special.   I know I speak for most Montanans when I say, while growing up, we  learned very early on about the importance of service to our country.  For me, that lesson was taught by my father. My dad is a marine who  served in the 58th Rifle Company out of Billings, MT. He instilled in  me the values of hard work, of sacrifice, of service to others, and of  humility. I am grateful for his service to our country, and I am proud  to live every day with the values that he taught me when I was so  young. Those same values that my dad taught me are held by veterans all  across Montana.   I am grateful for Montana's veterans. I am grateful to have several  veterans serve on my staff both in Montana and in Washington, DC. I  thank Denny in Helena, Robin in Great Falls, Jim in Bozeman, and  Christy in Washington, DC. They are all Montanans who are also veterans  who serve on my team and serve the people of Montana.   We have an extraordinary legacy of service in Montana. We are home to  heroes like Medal of Honor recipient Army SSG Travis Atkins, who was  honored by President Trump at the White House this year for his  ultimate sacrifice in defense of our country. Right now, in Congress, I  am working to rename the Bozeman VA healthcare  [[Page S6427]]  facility after this great, fallen, Montana hero. Travis and I attended  the same high school in Bozeman.   I make it my top priority to hear from all of our veterans across all  corners of our State and to learn about the issues they face, such as  access to rural healthcare, or to ensure they receive the recognition  they deserve. In fact, just last month, I was in Great Falls to help  honor veteran Alfred E. Shryer with the Bronze Star Medal for his  service in Vietnam. It was recognition that was long overdue--nearly 50  years in the making.   After all our veterans and their families have given to our Nation,  it is due time that our country gives them the care, the treatment, and  the recognition they have earned. That is why I am taking action. I  have introduced a number of bipartisan solutions to help resolve issues  that plague our vets, like my bipartisan bill to protect veterans'  pensions from scam artists. I have also led a bipartisan effort to  ensure that our Blue Water veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange  while they served in Vietnam receive the healthcare they deserve. Those  who risk it all--those who put their lives on the line in defense of  our freedom--deserve the utmost honor, thanks, and care.   To all of our veterans, thank you for your service. Our country is  freer and our country is safer because of you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Edna Boyce of Dawson County for her impact on the Glendive  community.   When young schoolchildren begin their day in Glendive, Edna is the  first face they see because, for 41 years, Edna has been driving the  school bus for the Glendive School District!   In April of 1978, Edna decided she wanted a change in her career from  working at the Glendive Bakery. That April, she marched into the school  district supervisor's office for an interview. When the district  supervisor asked if she had any experience, Edna said she had  experience driving sugarbeet trucks. The supervisor gave her the job as  bus driver, and Edna has been happily serving the Glendive School  District ever since.   It is my honor to recognize Edna Boyce for her commitment to the  Glendive community. She has been a committed bus driver, and her bright  smile and cheerful attitude has brightened the morning for so many  young Montanans. She has made a tremendous impact on Glendive and the  State of Montana, and I thank her for all of her years of hard  work.                            ____________________
