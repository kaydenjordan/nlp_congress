 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  chairwoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this very important resolution.   For too long, criminals and terrorists have used our financial system  to launder their dirty money and to hide all of their assets.   This issue is incredibly important to me because I have been working  on legislation to crack down on anonymous shell companies for about 10  years, and Chairwoman Waters has always been a strong supporter and is,  in fact, an original cosponsor of my legislation.    So I want to highlight one particular passage from this resolution  which talks about the pilot program that FinCEN conducted in 2016 where  they collected beneficial ownership information in certain real estate  transactions in Manhattan and Miami.   The findings from the pilot program were shocking. They found that  about 30 percent of the transactions involved a beneficial owner that  had previously been the subject of a suspicious activity report from a  bank, which strongly suggests that criminals and other bad actors are  using anonymous shell companies to launder or hide money.   Requiring companies to disclose their beneficial owners would provide  transparency to law enforcement. It would also protect Americans from  terrorism financing by cracking down on the ability of terrorists to  get financing in our country. And it would also help financial  institutions keep the bad actors out of the financial system.   That is why I have been working so hard to pass my beneficial  ownership bill, and I look forward to continuing to work in a  bipartisan way with Ranking Member McHenry and others to address this  important issue.   I must say that this issue was brought to me by law enforcement, and  they told me they will be tracking money that they think is terrorism  financing. They hit an LLC; they cannot get any more information about  who owns this real estate or company in our country. We have to stop  that.   So I strongly urge support for the chairwoman's resolution, and I  urge my colleagues to support it as well and to support the bipartisan  beneficial ownership bill which will shortly be on the floor.                                time  1330
