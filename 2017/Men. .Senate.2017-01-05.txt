We must stand for  these ideals. Health care is critical to liberty, our freedom from  fear, our freedom from illness, our freedom from deprivation. We must  stand for these principles. Health care is critical to the happiness,  the joy, the greatness of America. To secure these rights, governments  are instituted, and we were elected to stand for the American people,  by the American people, to fight to defend our brothers and sisters.  This government and actors must put our ideals first, not partisanship  and not theater. Do not attack these ideals through a rash and reckless  repeal. Be thoughtful. Be kind. Be magnanimous. The well-being of our  Nation is in the balance.   May God bless us in this time of crisis. May wisdom prevail over  politics.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
