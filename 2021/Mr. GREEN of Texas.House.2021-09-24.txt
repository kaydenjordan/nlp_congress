 Madam Speaker, the Constitution recognizes that  there are limits that can be placed on the long arm of the law. The  long arm of the law has limitations when it comes to speech. The long  arm of the law has limitations when it comes to religion. And the long  arm of the law has limitations in terms of how far it can extend into a  women's womb.   This bill checks the long arm of the law so that it does not extend  too far into a women's womb.
