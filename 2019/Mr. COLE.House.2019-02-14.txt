 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Colorado (Mr.  Perlmutter) for yielding, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to pass an appropriations package  that should complete our work and fully fund the government for fiscal  year 2019.   As Members of this body know, this has been a long road, perhaps much  longer than we expected at the beginning.   As we saw at the start of this Congress, the difficulties this body  can sometimes face in coming to an agreement can translate into  difficulty and hardship for the American people. I think I can speak  for all of us here in this body when I say that government shutdowns  are bad for the American people, bad for government, and bad policy,  and we should all strive to never let them happen again.   Now, of course, we have a little bit different view of how that  shutdown came about. It is worth noting for the record that the House  actually did vote to fund the government and produced a bill in  December that the President said he would sign and a majority of the  United States Senate actually favored.   But the Senate gets to set its own rules. They could reach a number  of 60, but the Democratic minority chose not to do that. So, given  that, that is what shut down the government, and we have all been  dealing with the consequences of it ever since.   But today we are poised to finish our work, and though the road may  have been difficult, I think Members should look back on this process  and commend themselves for what they have accomplished.   Last September, we finalized and passed into law 5 of the 12 funding  bills, an accomplishment we had not matched in over 20 years. Those  five, which included the two largest bills--Defense and Labor, Health  and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies--covered  approximately 75 percent of all Federal discretionary spending.    Prior to the end of the FY 2018 year, the House also passed four  additional spending bills, which we then moved to conference with the  Senate.   Indeed, of the seven outstanding spending bills, six of them were  negotiated with the Senate and have been ready to be moved for final  passage for quite some time. The sticking point has been the final bill  on that for Homeland Security, which vexed Members for some time. But  though we did not reach a deal on Homeland Security quickly, we did  eventually reach a deal.   Today, I am pleased to be standing with my colleagues to bring up  seven bipartisan, bicameral, fully negotiated and conferenced spending  bills that are ready to be passed and sent to the President's desk for  signature.   As we finish the work for fiscal year 2019 and move into our efforts  for fiscal year 2020, I want to commend my fellow members of the  Appropriations Committee for their hard work.  [[Page H2010]]    Thanks to the leadership of people like Ranking Member Kay Granger,  Chairwoman Nita Lowey, and Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, and thanks to  the hard work of dozens of Members, we are at last ready to send these  bills to the President.   I congratulate my friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle  and, indeed, offer those same congratulations to the entire House.   I look forward to working together on fiscal year 2020 in the weeks  and months ahead. Perhaps, working together, we can get all the bills  passed, conferenced with the Senate, and sent to the President by the  end of the fiscal year.   That will certainly be my goal and the goal of every appropriator on  both sides of this Chamber and on both sides of the rotunda in the  Capitol Building.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of H.R. 1239, the  Protecting Women Act of 2019.   This bill provides a straight extension of the Violence Against Women  Act, or VAWA, as is it commonly known, through the end of the fiscal  year.   Beginning in 1994, VAWA has provided grants to State, local, and  Tribal law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute violent  crimes against women, including domestic violence, sexual assault,  dating violence, and stalking.   Unfortunately, VAWA is scheduled to expire, literally, tomorrow, and  my friends on the other side, frankly, are just standing by and  watching it happen, even though they control this Chamber.   Republicans fought to include an extension of VAWA in the underlying  conference report as we had done in previous continuing resolutions,  but we were rebuffed by our other friends on the other side of the  aisle, and they have not made any move to schedule a separate vote on  this floor to avoid a lapse in this critical program, so Republicans  will.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous  question.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my good friend and fellow member  of the Rules Committee, to discuss her bill and this previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, frankly, for his response  on the VAWA issue. And I don't pretend to speak for all Republicans. I  will point out to my friend, actually the last time we did a  reauthorization, I voted against the Republican bill to bring the  Senate Democratic bill to the floor because I thought it was a better  bill. It was a stronger bill.   It had Tribal provisions and it had areas we had not addressed  previously. I thought those were good changes. It is pretty unusual for  me to break with my own team and bring down the Republican bill and  pass the Democratic bill, but I was proud to do it because it was a  better bill.   I don't think simply having money in place is the same as having the  authorizations in place. This is an opportunity, in my view, to just  have continuity while we do exactly what my friend suggests. Let's find  a way, and come together. I think we will. That has traditionally been  a bipartisan bill. I hope we do it. But I don't see a reason why we  should have a lapse in authority.   This is something we tried to put, actually, in conference in the  base bill, and it would not have prevented my friends from going on and  offering a new authorization. It was just simply, let's keep this  going.   So to me, the previous question that we will offer should the rule be  defeated, will have that opportunity, and I hope my friends avail  themselves of that.   In addition to that, I want to thank my friends genuinely for the  cooperation in this process on the appropriations bills themselves. As  I said, six of these bills were essentially agreed to in December in a  bipartisan way between both the House and the Senate.   So we will hear the argument or could hear the argument tonight. All  of this is new, and there is a 1,000-plus page bill, and what have you.  The reality is, there are probably about 75 pages, I am told from the  conferees, of new text here. Most of this is actually something that  this House has voted on and passed in December.   Not reopening old issues and settling them where we could and then  moving forward is something my friends ought to be proud of. I think it  was absolutely the right thing to do. It let us get on to the important  business of fiscal year 2020 more quickly and more expeditiously.   And my friends are in the majority, and if they want to make changes  there, additions or subtractions, they will be in a position to do  that. But I think closing the book here is a good one.   I hope all of us, honestly, as Republicans and Democrats--I have been  around here long enough to be in the minority, in the majority, and in  the minority again. It tends to move back and forth.   But as my friends have pointed out, these are important funding bills  that provide for the continuity of government. And in these  negotiations nobody ever gets everything they want. It is not possible,  even when one side or the other controls both Chambers and the White  House. I have been here when that has happened on our side and on my  friend's side. You still never get everything you want in  appropriations.   But I think there is going to be a premium placed on cooperation and  negotiations going forward. There is no question. We have a Democratic  House, we have a Republican Senate, and we have a Republican President.   Everything that we are going to accomplish in the next 18 months for  the American people will have to be a compromise where we work  together. I actually think this is a good first step in starting that  process. I think my friends are to be commended in doing that.   We won't get every vote for this underlying legislation on our side.  I doubt my friends will get every vote on their side, but we will have  a pretty substantial bipartisan majority in favor of moving forward,  fully funding the government and, hopefully, that sets the example for  what we do in fiscal year 2020.                                time  1900    Again, I look forward to working with my friends going forward. I  look forward to beginning that process here tonight by working together  to pass a bill the Senate has already passed in an overwhelmingly  bipartisan fashion and that the President has said he will sign, and I  assume that he certainly will.   As difficult as this road has been, Madam Speaker, I think this is  actually a hopeful moment for this Chamber and maybe the beginning of  good habits of negotiation, compromise, and cooperation, because we are  certainly going to need those habits going forward.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, and, again, I thank him quite  sincerely for his work. We have had the opportunity to work together  now in the Rules Committee for a little while. We hadn't had that  opportunity previously. He is always a thoughtful and an interesting  voice in that body and certainly here on the floor.   While we will disagree over the rule and might well disagree over the  previous question, on the underlying legislation, I suspect my friend  and I will be voting on the same side tonight.   That is something I hope that the American people take note of. We  will have lots of Democrats and lots of Republicans voting on the same  side. Yes, we have our differences about how we got here or what we  would have liked. But at the end of the day, we have come together and  given the American people what they deserve, and that is a fully  funded, operational government, and we have resolved our differences in  conference.   I, too, want to join my friends in congratulating the chair of the  conference committee, Chair Lowey; congratulating our ranking member,  Kay Granger; and congratulating their counterparts, Senator Shelby and  Senator Leahy for the work they did in working through these knotty  issues and bringing us together.   Yes, I wish it happened more quickly, but they are not the only  players. I think all four of them worked in good faith and served our  Chambers well in their deliberations.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge support for the underlying measure.  While the process of finalizing full-year funding for fiscal year 2019  may have taken longer than we expected, today's measure will complete  the process. I expect the House will pass these seven bills today, and  I expect that the President will sign them in the very near future.   I applaud and commend my colleagues for their hard work and hope that  we will carry this spirit of bipartisanship with us as we move forward  into the fiscal year 2020 appropriations process.  [[Page H2015]]    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962, the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and I ask for its  immediate consideration in the House so we can defend life.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for immediate consideration.    Mr. Speaker, we have had a bill that has been tied up in  Judiciary for a long time. It is about defending life. It is about  making sure that we do not take away life from people that are unborn.  I just ask for its immediate consideration.
