 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Joe  Bonamassa. He is one of the most gifted, talented, and accomplished  singers, songwriters, and guitarists in modern-day blues music.   Joe works incredibly hard to give back. Joe has founded the Keeping  the Blues Alive Foundation. This foundation fuels a passion for music  by funding projects and scholarships to allow students and teachers the  resources and tools that they need to further music education.   Joe also gives back in other ways. He is an aficionado of guitars and  has a vast collection that he uses to extend music history. And he  allows people to come and visit his collection of guitars and  amplifiers in a place he calls Nerdville, California.   Joe has done an incredible amount for music, for music history, and  to advance the cause of music having an impact in an increasing number  of people's lives.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring Joe  Bonamassa for his contributions to the world of music.                            ____________________
