 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 110 and ask  that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment by  number.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Marshall] proposes an       amendment numbered 110.    (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of  Amendments.'')    Madam President, I rise in support of Marshall  amendment No. 110 to put an end to the culture of lawlessness at our  southern border embraced by our President.   I cannot in good conscience support this debt limit deal and saddle  my grandchildren with this $4 trillion in additional debt.   This bill misses the mark, and, perhaps, what is more frustrating is  that it does not give a single cent to securing our border--zero  dollars to addressing the greatest, most immediate national security  threat to our Nation.   This past weekend alone, the Border Patrol made over 13,000  apprehensions. There were over 4,000 ``got-aways''; and they seized 118  pounds of meth, 14 pounds of fentanyl, and apprehended 6 sex offenders  and 5 gang members.   We have a crisis unfolding at our southern border, and it is  happening right now in plain sight. It is impacting every community  across the country. I will not sit here, form committees, and pray  about it. We need action today.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time is expired.    I am proud to introduce my amendment today and hope you  will vote yes and support it.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.
