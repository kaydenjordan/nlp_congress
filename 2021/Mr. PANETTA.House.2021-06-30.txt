 Madam Speaker, the child tax credit is a tax cut for  working-class families.   By passing the American Rescue Plan, we enhanced, and we advanced  this tax cut, so that if you are a parent that works or a parent that  cares for children, you will get a tax cut.   We enhanced this tax cut so that per year working-class families will  receive up to $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each child  under 18.   We advanced this tax cut so that working class families will get this  benefit starting July 15.   Now, in my district on the central coast of California, the tax cut  will benefit over 150,000 children and lift 15,000 children out of  poverty.   Working-class parents from the central coast to the center of America  can use this support to provide healthcare, childcare, and daycare for  their kids so that those same parents can continue to work, or better  yet, get right back into the workforce.   Madam Speaker, the child tax credit will not only help us recover  from the economic shutdowns of the pandemic, it is a tax cut that will  lift parents out of poverty, reward working-class families, and really  represents what we stand for as a Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to the  INVEST in America Act that would save our Nation's pollinators.   In my district, on the Central Coast, we grow over 100 different  specialty crops that greatly contribute to our Nation's food security.  But what many people don't realize is that our agriculture, from the  Central Coast, or to the center of America, would not be possible  without our pollinators.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, those pollinators and their habitats on  are the verge of extinction. That is why the robust investment, as  provided in my amendment, is needed now more than ever. The amendment  sets up grant programs that State transportation departments can use to  grow more flora and fauna, from grasses to wildflowers to milkweed, so  that pollinators can thrive.   I want to thank Representative Carbajal, my Central Coast neighbor,  for his partnership on this amendment, and our work together on bills  and amendments like this to revive our pollinators habitats and regrow  their population.   By passing this amendment, we not only can save the pollinators, but  we can also secure the food supply of our Nation.
