 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which would restrict funds at Federal agencies, such as the Department  of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and other related  agencies, from being used to finalize any rule or regulation that has  an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.   Since President Biden took office over 2 years ago, his  administration has added several billion with a b of dollars in new  regulatory costs to the economy. Agencies like OSHA, the CDC, and EBSA  often impose compliance costs and regulatory hurdles that create mass  confusion for businesses and the healthcare industry.   My amendment seeks to prevent these agencies from finalizing new  major rules and regulations, which often involve major policy decisions  that should be decided by Congress, not nameless, faceless,  bureaucrats.   By including my amendment in this bill, we restore Congress' Article  I authority by bringing major policy questions back to the elected  representatives of the people. We commit ourselves, once again, to open  governance rather than allowing the regulatory regime to make decisions  behind closed doors.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen where OSHA was issuing  burdensome health rules under questionable legal authority. Fifteen  months into the pandemic, OSHA issued a mandatory workplace safety rule  that required healthcare facilities to develop COVID-19 plans, install  barriers between workplaces, and impose mask mandates.   Once OSHA failed to finalize this rule, they sought to impose another  rule covering assisted living facilities and other healthcare workers  in March of 2022. This rule created even more confusion among the  healthcare industry leaders, who then saw overlapping guidance and  conflicting guidance within OSHA and the CDC, as well as CMS, the  Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.                                time  1915    Outside the burden of compliance with these rules, violating these  murky OSHA measures could land a business with financial penalties of  up to $15,000 per violation, and up to over $150,000 for repeated  violations. These penalties, in other words, could completely drown a  business in costs.   Furthermore, we have seen where the Department of Labor finalized a  rule directing the Federal Government to treat climate change as a  threat to workers' retirement savings. Now, sponsors of investment- based employee plans are directed to take ESG factors, like carbon  emissions, into their investment decisions instead of strictly applying  the fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.   This shift to an ESG standard, as it turns out, is not a prudent  investing plan at all. According to the Harvard Business Review, assets  under management at global exchange-traded sustainability funds have  not fared well financially. Even worse, researchers found that U.S.  companies and ESG portfolios have had worse compliance records for both  environmental and labor rules than companies in non-ESG portfolios. The  evidence, however inconvenient for my colleagues on the other side, is  overwhelming that hardworking Americans' retirement plans should not be  subject to a radical climate agenda at the Department of Labor.   It is simple, Congress should make these major policy decisions here  in  [[Page H5818]]  the people's House rather than the regulatory regime.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I don't know how else to quite say this, so  I am just going to lay it out bluntly. That is a lie what was just  spelled out.   The notion that CMS will cease to operate because they do not have  the capability to just issue regulations at random or at will is  nonsense.   It is absolutely absurd that the Representatives of the people's  House do not have a final say in major economic implications for people  who utilize Medicare.   It is ridiculous that if you are a physician you have to go through  your Member of Congress to get in touch with CMS. When we talk about  nameless, faceless bureaucrats, we are talking about this amendment  which would fix not only the financial burden that people have to bear  as a result of an overactive regulatory regime but restoring the open  accountability process here in Congress.   This is the people's House. We should be absolutely responsible for  the impacts that every single one of our constituents has to bear as a  result of the work that is being done here on Capitol Hill.   If you pick up the phone and call CMS, you can't find a single person  who will answer that phone. You cannot call up OSHA and ask for  answers. You cannot get answers out of the Federal Government, which is  why half of the team that we employ in Congress is based back home in  our districts in order to liaison with these Federal agencies.   We have got to restore accountability and restore Article I  authority.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
