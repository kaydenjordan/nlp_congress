 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of the  bipartisan Transatlantic Telecommunications Security Act that  Congressman Kinzinger and I have introduced.   Central and Eastern European nations are working to develop the  modern telecommunications infrastructure necessary to facilitate global  connectivity in the 21st century. At the same time, China, through its  Belt and Road Initiative, is strategically inducing dependence on its  financing and technology to construct these projects, endangering  liberty and security.   5G technology represents the future of global communications. We must  not allow those who are hostile to freedom and democracy to dominate  this technological space and undermine stability.   Our allies need American financing and partnership. Through the  Transatlantic Telecommunications Security Act, let us construct and  deploy the state-of-the-art networks that will spur economic prosperity  and connect people and communities.   Mr. Speaker, I invite all my colleagues to join us in this bill. We  must stand with our European allies against the threats posed by  foreign adversaries. And please, help us pass the Transatlantic  Telecommunications Security Act without delay.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to urge passage of the  Lend-Lease Act for Ukraine. I think Madeleine Albright would like this  very much.   Putin's unprovoked war on the sovereign nation of Ukraine is an  attack on freedom-loving people around our globe. Not since the costly  tragic wars of the 20th century has the world seen such a test of  liberty's survival.   The Lend-Lease is an uncommon tool for uncommon times. These are  uncommon times.   Justice Franklin Roosevelt marshaled U.S. arms for the aid of our  allies in World War II. We must now marshal those same resources to  defeat a tyrant seeking to rebuild his fallen, tyrannical empire.   Ukraine is the scrimmage line for liberty on the European Continent.  If the world allows Putin to claw Ukraine under his command, our  Central and Eastern European allies may very well be next.   The time to act is now. Pass the Lend-Lease Act. Arm Ukraine. Defeat  the Russian war machine. The fate of liberty rests in the balance. This  is our watch in freedom's defense. Let us meet this test.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for yielding time.
