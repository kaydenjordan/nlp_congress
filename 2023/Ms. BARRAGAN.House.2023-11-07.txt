 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of an  environmental justice champion, fighter for workers' rights, and former  southern California assemblymember, Cynthia Montanez.   Cindy's activism started at UCLA, where she participated in a 14-day  hunger strike to help establish the Chicano Studies Department.   At 25, she became the youngest councilmember of her hometown of San  Fernando.   At 27, she became mayor.   At 28, she was the youngest woman elected to the State legislature.   Cindy used her talents to create immediate change for our  communities. As an assistant general manager of the L.A. Department of  Water and Power, she helped transition the Nation's largest publicly  owned utility to cleaner energy. As CEO of TreePeople, she transformed  the organization into the fastest-growing environmental nonprofit in  southern California.   Madam Speaker, I thank Cindy for her tireless advocacy for Latino  communities in California. She is gone way too soon. Rest in power.                            ____________________
