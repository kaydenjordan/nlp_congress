 Mr. President. Senator Baldwin and I are pleased to  introduce a resolution that acknowledges and apologizes for the  mistreatment of and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and  transgender (LBGT) individuals who have served our nation as civil  servants or members of the Armed Forces and Foreign Service. This  systemic mistreatment and discrimination of members of the LGBT  community began as early as the 1940s and continued well into the 1990s  and is often termed as the Lavender Scare by historians. During this  time, it is estimated that 100,000 service members were forced out of  the Armed Forces between World War II and 2011. In addition, more than  1,000 State Department employees were dismissed due to their alleged  sexual orientation, and many more were prevented from serving due to  discriminatory hiring practices.   Policies such as the 1949 decree by the Department of Defense  mandating that ``homosexual personnel, irrespective of sex, should not  be permitted to serve in any branch of the Armed Forces'' led to the  mass discharge and systemic screening of gay, lesbian, and bisexual  military service members. Similar policies within the State Department  followed led to mass dismissals and terminations of Foreign Service and  civil service employees. Subsequently, policies were enacted across the  Federal government targeting members of the LGBT community. To this  day, historians do not know the exact number of people impacted.  However, despite these harmful and discriminatory policies, LGBT people  continued to faithfully serve and make significant contributions to the  United States, many of whom became clerks and lawyers, surgeons and  nurses, Purple Heart recipients and Navy Seals, translators and air  traffic controllers, engineers and astronomers, teachers and diplomats,  and rangers and postal workers.   It is time to acknowledge the harm caused to these Americans, their  families, and our country by depriving LGBT people of the right to  serve as federal civil servants, diplomats, or in the Armed Services.  This Senate resolution takes a stand on the side of respect for LBGT  Americans who have served our nation and reaffirms our commitment to  treat all public servants with fairness and equality, regardless of  their sexual orientation or gender identity. I'm proud to introduce  this Senate resolution during Pride Month to reaffirm our nation's  commitment to treat everyone, including LGBT Americans, with equal  respect and fairness. I will continue working toward advancing equality  for all LGBT people in Virginia and across our nation.   Thank you, Mr. President.

Res. 278         Whereas, in 1946, a group of returning veterans from World       War II in New York, New York, formed the organization now       known as United Spinal Association to address the needs of       paralyzed veterans;        Whereas, in 1948, members of this organization advocated       for and secured the first accessible housing bill in the       United States (the Act of June 19, 1948 (62 Stat. 500; Public       Law 80-702)), which provided Federal funds for the building       of accessible homes for paralyzed veterans;        Whereas, in 1968, members of this organization advocated       for the passage of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42       U.S.C. 4151 et seq.), which guarantees equal access to       federally-funded buildings and facilities for wheelchair       users and all people of the United States with disabilities;        Whereas, in 1970, James J. Peters, who would later lead       United Spinal Association, exposed the deplorable conditions       that paralyzed Vietnam veterans faced at the Bronx Veterans       Administration Hospital with an article in LIFE magazine,       leading the Veterans Administration to establish a national       spinal cord injury service office to address the needs of       paralyzed veterans and the renovation of the Bronx Veterans       Administration Hospital, which was later named for Peters;        Whereas, in 1985, New York City settled a lawsuit initiated       by United Spinal Association, agreeing to make all city       buses, key subway stations and commuter rail stations, and       all new transit stations accessible to wheelchair users, and       New York City established a paratransit system for people       unable to use mass transit, leading to a model that would be       incorporated as part of the transportation provisions of the       landmark Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 et       seq.);        Whereas, regardless of a person's level of abilities,       United Spinal Association seeks to build an inclusive world       that--        (1) removes barriers, particularly for wheelchair users;        (2) embraces the talents of all people with disabilities to       achieve their full potential; and        (3) provides people with disabilities equal opportunities       to pursue their interests and dreams;        Whereas United Spinal Association continues to support and       advocate on behalf of more than 2,000,000 people in the       United States living with spinal cord injuries or       neurological disorders, as well as veterans, through--        (1) proven programs and services, and nurturing innovative       self-reliance, advocacy, and leadership;        (2) empowering its members, their loved ones, care       providers, and stakeholders with resources, one-on-one       assistance, and peer support;        (3) promoting independence through employment opportunities       and inclusion into mainstream society; and        (4) advocating for greater disability rights, including       access to health care, rehabilitation, mobility equipment,       transportation, community services, and the built       environment; and        Whereas the legacy of James J. Peters, who once described       the straightforward strategy in advocating for people in the       United States with disabilities as simply refusing to accept       no for an answer, is alive and well throughout United Spinal       Association: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate--        (1) recognizes that throughout 75 years of service, United       Spinal Association has made significant contributions to the       lives of people in the United States with disabilities,       including veterans;        (2) honors United Spinal Association for its continued role       in supporting and advocating for people with spinal cord       injuries and neurological disorders, as well as all veterans;       and        (3) commemorates 2021 as the 75th anniversary of the       founding of United Spinal Association.                                  F_____                                    SENATE RESOLUTION 279--DESIGNATING JUNE 21, 2021 THROUGH JUNE 25, 2021,                AS ``NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION WEEK''    Ms. ROSEN (for herself and Mr. Cassidy) submitted the following  resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.:                                S. Res. 279         Whereas, according to a 2017 projection, the United States       will face a shortage of 1,800,000 cybersecurity workers by       2022;        Whereas recent cyberattacks on the United States have       highlighted the cybersecurity workforce shortage in the       United States that--        (1) poses a threat to the national security of the United       States;        (2) jeopardizes the economy of the United States;        (3) puts the digital privacy of the United States at risk;       and        (4) threatens the critical infrastructure of the United       States;         Whereas expanding cybersecurity education opportunities is       important to address the cybersecurity workforce shortage and       prepare the United States for ongoing and future national       security threats;        Whereas cybersecurity education can provide learning and       career opportunities for kindergarten through grade 12       students across the United States, as well as bolster the       capacity of the domestic workforce to defend the United Sates       and secure the economy of the United States;        Whereas, in 2020, introduced as part of the Providing       Resources for Ongoing Training and Education in Cyber       Technologies Act of 2020 and enacted as part of the William       M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-283), Congress authorized       the Cybersecurity Education Training Assistance Program, a       Department of Homeland Security initiative to provide       cybersecurity career awareness, curricular resources, and       professional development to elementary and secondary schools;       and        Whereas ensuring access to cybersecurity education for all       students in the United States regardless of race, ethnicity,       socioeconomic status, or geographic location will expand       opportunities for good-paying jobs in high-demand fields:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate--        (1) designates June 21, 2021 through June 25, 2021, as       ``National Cybersecurity Education Week'';        (2) encourages the people of the United States to       acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity education;        (3) encourages educational and training institutions to       increase the understanding and awareness of cybersecurity       education at such institutions; and        (4) commits to--        (A) raising awareness about cybersecurity education; and        (B) taking legislative actions to address cybersecurity       education expansion and address the cybersecurity workforce       shortage.                            ____________________
