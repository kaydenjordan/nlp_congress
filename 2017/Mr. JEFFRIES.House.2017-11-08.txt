 Mr. Speaker, last night all throughout our great  country, hatred lost in America; fear-mongering lost in America, race- baiting lost in America, xenophobia lost in America, homophobia lost in  America, Confederate monuments lost in America, the war on Medicaid  lost in America, voter suppression lost in America, the Trump playbook  lost in America, and the make America hate again agenda lost in  America.   Democrats will continue to focus on the economic well-being of the  American people, will continue to fight for better jobs, better wages,  and a better future for the American people.   Democrats will continue to fight to deliver a better deal.                            ____________________
