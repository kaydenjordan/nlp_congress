 Mr. Speaker, Arizonans I have spoken with are  stressed and anxious as they watch politicians in Washington threaten  to take away their health coverage.   While the Senate's misguided repeal and replace proposal has been  defeated, we cannot rest. The newest repeal plan is irresponsible and  will endanger the health and well-being of my constituents. It will  send premiums and coverage costs skyrocketing and slash funding for  rural and Tribal health clinics, forcing them to close.   There are 1.9 million Arizonans who rely on Medicaid and could be at  risk of losing their coverage. Of those, more than 45,000 are Arizona  veterans. More than 1 million Arizonans with preexisting conditions  would lose vital protections that ensure they have access to affordable  coverage.   Mr. Speaker, these are our children, our loved ones, our families,  and our friends. We cannot stand here and play politics with their  health. We must work together to stabilize the insurance markets and  develop a long-term solution that improves our healthcare system. We  need to include the public in this discussion. We owe them a better  plan.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fix it, not nix  it.                            ____________________
