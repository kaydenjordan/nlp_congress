 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share the most important  news of the past few days, which was not Oprah's interview with the  Duke and Duchess. In fact, it was Pope Francis' historic trip to Iraq  and his extraordinary meeting with Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani.   Greeted by a release of white doves, Pope Francis, age 84, and the  Grand Ayatollah, age 90, met for nearly an hour at the Grand  Ayatollah's simple home in the city of Najaf. Together, they reinforced  the Pope's and Islamic leaders' renewed formal and joint commitment to  human fraternity.   The Grand Ayatollah reinforced his belief that ``Christian citizens  should live, like all Iraqis, in peace and security and with their full  constitutional rights.''   In the aftermath of the undisputed victory by the Iraqi, United  States, and allied forces over the murderous caliphate of ISIS, the  Pope's visit gives validation to the future of Iraq and its historic  cultural and geographic roots of the three Abrahamic religions.   To the people of Iraq, we American citizens pray for safety,  prosperity, and peace for you and your families.                            ____________________
