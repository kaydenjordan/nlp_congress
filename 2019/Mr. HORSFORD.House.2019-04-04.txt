 Madam Speaker, every 16 hours, a woman in this country  is shot and killed by a current or former partner.  [[Page H3072]]    Just last week, an 18-year-old woman in Las Vegas was shot dead by  her boyfriend while they sat in their car outside of a neighborhood  barbecue.   This country has an epidemic of violence against women, which is why  I stand here today to ask this body to reauthorize and expand the  Violence Against Women Act.   This bill will provide crucial resources to survivors of domestic  violence and sexual abuse. It will invest in education programs that  teach young men to stop the cycle of violence. It will provide Tribes  with new mechanisms to hold non-Indian predators accountable for  preying on Native women. And it will close the boyfriend loophole that  allows physically abusive ex-boyfriends and convicted stalkers access  to guns.   Madam Speaker, this legislation will save lives, and I urge every  Member of this body to support its passage.                            ____________________
