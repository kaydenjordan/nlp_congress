 Mr. Speaker, inflation is at the highest level we have seen  since Jimmy Carter was in the White House.   I have spoken many times about rising prices being fueled by out-of- control spending. Today, I rise with even more proof that this has been  the case.   President Biden's 2021 COVID stimulus bill overheated the economy,  just as I, and many other Republican Members of Congress, along with  numerous economists from both sides of the political divide, predicted.   Now a report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office shows  that spending did, in fact, create a worker shortage which strained  supply chains and contributed to the economic crisis in which we find  ourselves today.   One year ago, companies across middle Tennessee were struggling to  find workers. More than 160,000 Tennesseans were unemployed; yet  218,000 jobs were  [[Page H5491]]  available. Folks were earning $15.75 an hour to stay home because of  the unnecessary $2 trillion bill pushed through by congressional  Democrats on a party line vote.   Employers became desperate. Many were forced to offer massive sign-on  bonuses and other incentives just to find enough workers to continue  operating as normal. Unfortunately, some had to close their doors.   Tennessee's Governor Bill Lee, a businessowner himself, recognized  the damage enhanced Federal unemployment benefits were causing on  restaurants and retail stores. He noticed many couldn't compete with  $300 a week from the Federal Government on top of State unemployment  benefits.   Fortunately, he put a stop to the flow of Federal unemployment  dollars in Tennessee, and he was right. At last check, there were about  13,000 unemployment claims in Tennessee, compared to roughly 60,000  claims this time last year.   Still, the cost of living has increased every month under the Biden  administration, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  projects it will continue to impact Americans at least into 2023.   This is what happens when you do what is politically expedient. This  is the direct result of runaway deficit spending.   The Federal Reserve is now having to be the adult in the room and  raise interest rates to lower inflation. Raising interest rates is a  harsh step, but one made necessary by the Biden administration's  reckless handling of the economy.   It will make it harder and more expensive to borrow money for your  first home or to buy a new car. Raising interest rates will also cause  our economy to slow down. This means people will lose their jobs, their  savings, and in many cases, even their small businesses.   Our economy already got 1.5 percent smaller in the first quarter of  the year. It is why many economists are predicting a recession or worse  in the next 12 months.   It didn't have to be this way. The President and congressional  Democrats didn't have to borrow and spend so much money. This  administration inherited one of the strongest economies in my life. It  took fewer than 2 years for them to completely destroy it. President  Biden must do better.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the United States is a nation of laws, not mob  rule. Whoever leaked a draft opinion of Dobbs v. Jackson broke the law  and did great damage to the integrity of our judicial institutions.   In the 5 weeks following the leak, protesters have taken to the  streets of Justices' homes to intimidate and harass them for fulfilling  their constitutional duty to interpret the law, and even one deranged  individual plotted to assassinate Justice Kavanaugh.   Because of this, I am dumbfounded by the Speaker's refusal on three  separate occasions to allow a vote to provide protections for the  Justices and their families.   Finally, more than 1 month after the Senate passed the bill by  unanimous consent, we were able to hold a vote today. It took way too  long, but, thankfully, it wasn't too late.
