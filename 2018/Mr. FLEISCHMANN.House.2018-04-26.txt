 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  the House FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018.   I wish to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr.  Shuster, and the ranking member, Mr. DeFazio, for the opportunity to  offer this amendment.   My amendment supports our Nation's more than 5,000 general aviation  airports by providing a commonsense solution to reduce the cost and  construction time for critical pavement projects, while maintaining the  highest level of safety and quality.   Our general aviation airports provide critical access, vital  emergency and medical services, economic activity, and many other  important services, as vital lifelines, especially in rural areas.   However, the cost of building and maintaining runways at general  aviation airports has become unnecessarily burdensome and costly, due  to outdated pavement specification requirements that the FAA recognizes  can and should be updated. As such, in consultation with key industry  groups and agencies, I have introduced this amendment to address this  issue.   Among many other things, this reform will better equip our dedicated  network of State aviation officials, airports, and other good  personnel, working on the front lines in maintaining and improving our  Nation's airports. This amendment will allow them to undertake more  projects efficiently and safely, with commonsense savings that frees up  additional funding for other critical projects.   More specifically, after extensive field testing that has provided  concrete evidence that States can and have utilized alternative  pavement mixes, procured more conveniently and cost-effectively from  local businesses on critical runway projects to safely maintain our  Nation's runway systems of general aviation airports.   Mr. Chairman, I respectfully urge adoption of this amendment.
