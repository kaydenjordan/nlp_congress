 Mr. Speaker, the first Jews arrived in New York in  1654. This month, we honor the innumerable contributions and storied  history of Jewish Americans.   I rise today in support of H. Res. 382, honoring Jewish American  Heritage Month. I thank my colleagues--my dear friend Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, Brian Fitzpatrick, Leader Hakeem Jeffries,   David Kustoff,  Jerry Nadler, and so many others--who join in making this resolution  possible.   Back before we had even gained our independence from England, Jewish  Americans like Haym Salomon were financing our American Revolution and  saving our young Nation from economic collapse. American heroes like  Hyman Rickover gave birth to America's nuclear Navy.   Jews are active in every aspect of American life, with contributions  in the military, STEM, law, medicine, and entertainment. Jews are fully  part of the American story, and the American story is fully interwoven  into our identities as Jews.   For more than 350 years, Jews have found refuge and welcome in  America. Sadly, we have also seen periods of anti-Semitism, and, today,  at this moment, anti-Semitism is on the rise across the country. From  verbal assaults to physical attacks, Jews are facing scary and  difficult moments. Even in communities without Jews, anti-Semitism is  raising its head.   That is why I am so grateful and proud that this month President  Biden's White House put out the whole-of-society strategy to fight  anti-Semitism.   Standing up to the rising tide of hate is one essential step to  putting America back together again. Together, I know we can stamp out  anti-Semitism, and together this month, I am proud that we are  celebrating Jewish-American heritage.
