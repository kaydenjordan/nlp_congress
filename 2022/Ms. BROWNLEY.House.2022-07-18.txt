 Madam Speaker, last month, the extreme and radical wing  of the Republican Party and the Supreme Court took a dangerous and  detrimental strike against women's reproductive rights by overturning  Roe v. Wade and dismantling decades of healthcare and privacy  protections, and they are not stopping there.   In his opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas threatened American women  that the Supreme Court will no longer protect the right to birth  control.   Nearly all women in the United States use contraceptives at least  once during their lifetime and an estimated 65 percent of women use a  form of birth control every single day.   This is but another egregious component of the radical Republican  agenda to restrict women's rights and the fundamental right to her  bodily autonomy.   This is why I am supporting the Right to Contraception Act, and I  urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to protect access to birth  control.   House Democrats will not be deterred in the fight for the health,  safety, and reproductive freedom of women and every American.                            ____________________
