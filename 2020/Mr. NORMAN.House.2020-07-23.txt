 Mr. Speaker, I will quote from the great Alexander  Fraser, who wrote about the decline of democracy. The nations have  progressed through this sequence. Very few have existed past 200 years,  but they all come to an end.   They go ``from bondage to spiritual faith; from spiritual faith to  great courage; from courage to liberty; from liberty to abundance; from  abundance to selfishness; from selfishness to . . . apathy; from apathy  to dependence; from dependence back into bondage.''   I think now we are at a point in time in history where we have got to  fight for our freedom, we have got to fight for our country.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that people now get involved who have never been  involved before.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for having  this Special Order. It couldn't come at a more unique time. The  history, defining America's values, our culture, and our heritage, now  more than ever, need to be spotlighted.   The gentleman summed it up well. It boils down to three things,  faith, family, and country; faith, family, and country.   America finds herself in an hour of peril. In the recent weeks and  months,  [[Page H3831]]  we have seen the unhinging of civil order and the near collapse of the  rule of law in certain cities.   This Chamber should serve as the shining example for the rest of our  great country. Sadly, we are failing to live up to that expectation.  Instead of open and honest debate, we are allowing the ``cancel  culture'' to creep inside these hallowed Halls that have stood for  centuries.   We hear calls for a ``national conversion,'' a ``wider debate,'' or a  ``public reckoning,'' and every day, we are denied it. A new regime of  liberal gatekeepers is intent on enforcing this new dogma, even in  institutions previously sworn to uphold the importance of the free  exchange of ideas.   Instead of opportunities for many in America to grow and evolve  through discourse, Americans are now losing their livelihood and loved  ones over newly invented apostasies. I invite my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to join me in denouncing this uncivil and, to  be honest with you, un-American way of disagreeing. We must remind the  American people of our beautiful land what it looks like to agreeably  disagree.   From the exchange of ideas, we can achieve the negotiations and  compromises that make up the foundation and the fabric of this great  Nation and are the stepping-stones to a more perfect Union.   The Federal Government has an obligation to make sure that any  institution it supports upholds the Bill of Rights, including the right  of freedom of speech.   It does not give you, however, the right to tear down this great  Nation. It does not give you the right to tear down people's dreams,  money that was put in, dollars that were put in to building a lifelong  business, to destroy.   You do not build America up by tearing down America. We cannot do  this in the current state of cancelation.   Until we can once again welcome disagreement, debate, and a healthy  exchange of ideas, I fear for our future; I fear for our children; and  I fear for our grandchildren.   In the words of Winston Churchill, who had the fantastic quote when  Great Britain was under siege by Germany, he said:         There will be a time when doing your best is not good       enough. We must do what is required.    And I will call on all Americans and, really, on both sides of the  aisle, to do what is required to keep America great; to make it even  greater; and to go for what made this country great, to uphold our  Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and our God-given freedoms that can  only come from God.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Arrington for having this Special  Order.
