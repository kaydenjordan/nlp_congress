 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  resolution to overrule the stream protection rule, just as I would  oppose any measure that threatened the quality of our drinking water.   Clean drinking water is a fundamental health need, and meeting that  need is one of our most basic responsibilities in this Congress. We  must not put special interests ahead of the health of our constituents.   The stream protection rule is very simple:   It strengthens and clarifies existing water quality protections with  respect to mining.   It requires that affected streams be restored when mining is  finished.   It gives communities accurate information about water quality so they  can best protect themselves from pollution.   Mr. Speaker, these protections are not onerous, but their benefits  are vast.   We have seen in Flint, Michigan, and elsewhere the painful  consequences when people lack access to safe drinking water. We must do  more to prevent that kind of suffering and damage. Nixing this rule  would, instead, mean that we are doing less.   The stream protection rule is the product of a careful year's-long  process. Countless stakeholders participated at two dozen public  meetings, and regulators received tens of thousands of public comments.   Mr. Speaker, this rule was crafted in the sunshine, but we are about  to overrule it in the dead of night. After all of that work, this  resolution of disapproval did not even receive a committee hearing.   Mr. Speaker, if this body is seriously going to weaken vital drinking  water protections, the American people deserve ample opportunities to  inform themselves and to make their voices heard. This rushed-through  proposal denies them that opportunity.   I find this measure to be very disturbing, and I find the process  concerning. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not  to go down this path.
