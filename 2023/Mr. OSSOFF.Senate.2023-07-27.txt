 Mr. President, last week, I voted to advance the Supreme  Courts Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act out of the Judiciary  Committee, as I believe that strong judicial ethics are critical to  maintaining public trust in our judiciary. I rejected amendments  unrelated to ethics reform to maximize prospects for successful passage  of this measure, but I am willing to consider the nongermane amendments  offered if put forward as standalone measures or as amendments to  germane legislation.                            ____________________
