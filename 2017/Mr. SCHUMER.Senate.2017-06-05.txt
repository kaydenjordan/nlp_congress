 Mr. President, let me first express the profound sadness  that we all felt this past week about the terrorist attacks in London.  My heart is with the people of that great city and with the victims of  this string of attacks and their families. They are all in our prayers.   The morning after the attack, I was walking down the street in New  York, and I saw a husband and wife--they looked like out-of-towners-- with three beautiful little girls, and the girls were skipping along  happily. When they are with their parents when they are little, they  get so happy. I thought: God, what if a bomb blew up and killed them.  It just got to me.   So we really feel for these people who were just taken from us much  too soon by vicious, almost inexplicable viciousness.   In this moment of trial for one of our fiercest friends and allies,  the United States also stands shoulder to shoulder with the citizens of  the UK in our joint fight against terrorists and those who support  them.   We wish a swift recovery to the injured and comfort to the victims  and  [[Page S3236]]  their families. We certainly hope the perpetrators are swiftly brought  to justice.                                Infrastructure    Mr. President, on infrastructure--another matter--we know President  Trump will spend this week unveiling his infrastructure proposal in  several phases. We will have to wait and see what the full details of  the plan are before we judge it, but we Democrats welcome a discussion  on infrastructure.   We believe the Federal Government ought to invest more, not less, in  rebuilding our roads, bridges and highways, our schools, electric  grids, and our water and sewer systems. We should be investing in  expanding broadband, which is so vital for our rural areas and a number  of urban areas that are still underserved.   So we have several concerns about the President's upcoming proposal,  considering the President actually cut infrastructure investment  significantly in his budget proposal to Congress. How can you be for  infrastructure and then cut all of these proposals in your budget? That  is what he did.   Now, unfortunately based on recent reports, the entire focus of the  President's infrastructure proposal this week is on privatization,  which sounds like a nice word. But when you scratch beneath the  surface, it means much less construction and far fewer jobs,  particularly in our rural areas. It also means Trump tolls from one end  of America to the other.   If President Trump wants the private sector to finance the  construction of infrastructure, it is going to demand a price. That is  how the private sector works. The financiers will look to turn a  profit. Let's remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch. If  the financiers put in money, they are going to want to take it back.   How are they going to turn a profit on infrastructure? Tolls, tolls,  and more tolls--tolls paid by American workers, salesmen, truckdrivers,  vacationers, and commuters; tolls paid by working families, middle- class families, and consumers of all stripes. A private-sector-driven  infrastructure plan means tolls, tolls, tolls paid by average working  Americans.   It also means that infrastructure that can't be built with tolls-- like repairing our crumbling schools, for instance--will get left  behind. Moreover, a scheme that relies on private investment will leave  rural areas of America behind. My friend the Republican Senator from  Wyoming, a member of the Republican leadership, Mr. Barrasso, who  understands the needs of his very rural State said: ``Funding solutions  that involve public-private partnerships do not work for rural areas.''  That is not Chuck Schumer speaking, although New York has the third  largest rural population in America. That is Senator Barrasso speaking.   Let me repeat what he said: ``Funding solutions that involve public- private partnerships do not work for rural areas.''   That is the Republican Senator from Wyoming, saying an infrastructure  proposal that involves privatization ignores a huge portion of the  United States--rural areas--where infrastructure investment is greatly  needed. When a Republican Senator says that, we all ought to pay  attention at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.   Privatization also ignores the ongoing maintenance needs of many of  our Nation's more populated areas. Sure, maybe if the toll is high  enough, a private company could build a shiny new bridge, but they  won't do anything to fix the crumbling railroad switches, potholes, and  water main breaks that are plaguing so many of our cities, particularly  in the older areas--the Northeast, the Midwest.   One aspect the President highlighted today is privatizing our air  traffic control systems. This would put the same airline companies that  have added baggage fees and change fees and shrunk leg room in charge  of the air traffic control system. Worse still, it would let the  airlines charge consumers even more than they charge now.    If air traffic control is privatized, where are the protections for  consumers? What will prevent costs of flying from going way up? Under a  private system, what stops airlines from raising fees and taxes on  consumers?   So privatization, whether it is for the construction of roads and  bridges or in aviation, often leaves the average American with the  short end of the stick and gives big corporations way too much power.   So, again, we will wait and see what the President proposes. We want  to discuss infrastructure. We want to work with him on infrastructure.  But if it is all or mostly privatization with minimal public  investment, it will not be an effective way to rebuild our Nation's  infrastructure. It will cost middle-class families more, and it will  not create the kind of jobs our economy needs.   Let's not forget that the President proposed a trillion-dollar  infrastructure bill in the campaign. We Democrats were encouraged to  hear this. It is one of the first things I talked with President-Elect  Trump about on the phone, but so far we have been disappointed.   Senate Democrats put forward a real, trillion-dollar infrastructure  plan that would create millions of jobs and actually fix our crumbling  roads and bridges while investing in every corner of America. We stand  ready and willing to work with the President on a real plan that  actually achieves what he promised on the campaign trail. But,  unfortunately, if this week, on infrastructure, is all about  privatization, it is going to be another broken promise that President  Trump made to the working people of America.                            James Comey Testimony    Mr. President, later this week, former FBI Director James Comey will  be testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee. I am glad he is  doing so in the open and on the record. I hope he is as forthcoming as  possible. Transparency and openness is absolutely vital if we are to  get to the bottom of the events of the past few months. Knowing James  Comey a little bit, transparency and openness have always been his way.   I would expect that Mr. Comey's appearance before the Senate  Intelligence Committee will not be his last appearance before Congress.  I know the Senate Judiciary Committee has made a similar request of Mr.  Comey. I support their request, and I hope he will go before them as  well.                               Paris Agreement    Finally, Mr. President, a few words about the Paris climate accord. I  was deeply disappointed by President Trump's decision last week to  start the process for withdrawing the United States from the Paris  Agreement, an agreement signed by every sovereign nation, except Syria  and Nicaragua--Nicaragua, by the way, because they thought the  agreement didn't go far enough.   The decision will ultimately be viewed--the decision by Trump to pull  out of the Paris climate accord--as one of the worst decisions of the  21st century because of the huge damage it will do to our economy, our  environment, and our geopolitical standing.   Pulling out of the Paris Agreement doesn't put America first. It puts  America alone and last. It puts America last in recognizing science, in  being a world leader in protecting our own communities and working in  concert with the family of nations in safeguarding the planet we all  inhabit for future generations.   Climate change is an issue where time unfortunately is not on our  side. Every year that we don't work toward lowering our carbon emission  standards is another year of irrevocable damage to the environment.  Future generations will look back on this decision as a failure of  historic proportions.   President Trump's decision to withdraw is also a sucker punch to  American workers, who should be building the next generation of wind  turbines and solar panels. Now other countries, including China, our  economic rival, will seize the mantel of innovation and clean energy  away from America.   Listen to this. This astounded me. Just last month, Ernest & Young  published the latest edition of a report ranking nations by how  attractive they are for renewable energy investment. For the first  time, China and India both outrank the United States. So on one of the  newer technologies that will ultimately be cheaper than the existing  technologies, we are already falling behind and will fall further  behind. Imagine that China and India are now ranked by Ernst & Young as  being better places for renewable energy investment. That is not going  to help American jobs next year and certainly over the next decade.  [[Page S3237]]    It is a devastating loss to our economy, and the workers who would  have benefited greatly from America's leading the way forward in a new  industry will lose out.   Moreover, if the United States doesn't have a seat at the table with  the nations in the Paris Agreement, other nations could agree on  policies that hurt American businesses and American workers, even more  than this self-inflicted wound by President Trump.   Now, I am glad that States like my State of New York and cities and  businesses across the country are already stepping up, reaffirming  their commitment to the goals set in Paris and pledging to continue to  make progress in the fight against climate change. Our economy and our  communities will be better for it.   I seriously hope that the President reconsiders his decision for the  sake of our planet, for the future of the American economy, and for the  future of American jobs, which thrive on the kind of innovation  President Trump has just turned his back on.   Thank you, and I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader
