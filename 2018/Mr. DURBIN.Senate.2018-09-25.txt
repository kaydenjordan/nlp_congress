 Madam President, what is the business before the Senate?    Thank you.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning  business.    Madam President, plow through this nomination. That is  what the Republican majority leader said over the weekend, that we are  going to plow through this nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the  Supreme Court. It doesn't sound to me like a recipe for fairness, and  it certainly doesn't sound like a recipe for getting to the truth. Plow  through. That was what the Republican majority leader said the  Republican majority would do.   When this all started, I was surprised when a spokesperson for  President Trump--Kellyanne Conway, who is not noted for her  moderation--made what I thought was a very moderate and thoughtful  statement at the beginning of the consideration of Dr. Ford's charges.  She said that we are neither going to ignore nor insult Dr. Ford. I  thought that was a good standard. Unfortunately, since she has said  that, neither the President nor many Republican leaders have lived up  to it.   I really come to this as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  who is trying to think about the gravity of the situation and what is  fair. In this situation, we have Dr. Ford's coming forward. I have  thought long and hard and have talked to many of my staffers  [[Page S6285]]  and friends back home about her motivation. What in the world does she  have to gain by putting herself and her family through this? What is at  the end of it for her?   I can't see any positives other than the satisfaction that she is  pursuing what she believes to be true. She is exposing herself to  ridicule, harassment, and attack even by the President of the United  States in his tweets. Her family is in danger, and they have had to  move out of their home. Her computers have been hacked, and she has had  to engage attorneys and get into lengthy negotiations with Republicans  in the Senate just for a chance to come and tell her story. This woman  had a family and a life and was well respected by her colleagues and  the people in her community. It has been turned upside down.   Why? What is in this for Dr. Ford? What is she trying to achieve  here?   The more I have thought about it, the more I have concluded that she  just believes it is so critically important for the American people to  hear her story and understand what she believes to be true about this  nominee. So I come to this, certainly, with an open mind in terms of  her presentation.   When I hear the Republican leader come to the floor and talk about  her situation, he zigs and zags. In one moment, he sounds like he is  sympathetic to Dr. Ford and to what she has been through and calls for  fairness. Then, before he catches a breath, he calls her charges an  unsubstantiated smear.   I would say to my colleague from Kentucky that he can't have it both  ways. He can't be respectful of Dr. Ford and of the reason she comes to  Washington and then dismiss and discredit everything she has said as a  smear. He just can't have it both ways, but he has tried for 2 straight  days.   He argues that this situation that we face has been carefully  choreographed by the Democrats.   There is the old cliche by Will Rogers: ``I don't belong to any  organized political party--I am a Democrat.'' It, certainly, applies to  this situation because this has been an unusual development.   Senator Dianne Feinstein receives a letter from Dr. Ford through a  Member of Congress, Anna Eshoo. When she receives the letter, it reads  at the top ``confidential,'' that she doesn't want her identity to be  disclosed.   Senator Feinstein told me and others over and over again that she  felt duty bound not to victimize Dr. Ford, who claimed to have been  victimized already. She tried to find a way to get to the bottom of  this--to establish whether Dr. Ford's charges were accurate. After  weeks of trying, she came to the conclusion that she couldn't do it  through the U.S. Senate and through the resources available to her. She  spoke to Dr. Ford. She took the charges seriously. She was in  communication with her attorneys. She tried her best to find a way to  establish the credibility of these charges before moving forward and  was always constrained by Dr. Ford's admonition: Don't let my identity  become public. That is why it took longer than it should have.    Now Senator McConnell has come to the floor for 2 straight days and  has somehow suggested that the Democrats leaked this letter to the  press. Well, I don't have any knowledge of that whatsoever. I do know,  as far as Senator Feinstein was concerned, she was scrupulous in making  certain that Dr. Ford's identity was protected as long as she wanted it  protected. So I don't know what he is saying or whether he has  information to back up these charges that he has made for 2 straight  days on the floor.   I take a look at this situation, and I understand where we are today.  The bottom line is that Dr. Ford had nothing to gain by doing this-- nothing--and still has nothing to gain. Yet then there is one  overriding fact here that Senator McConnell continues to ignore. Let me  take you back in history.   Twenty-seven years ago was the Clarence Thomas hearing. I was in the  House at the time, but I read about it and followed it as most  Americans did. On the very day that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman  Joe Biden received the letter from Anita Hill, which charged sexual  misconduct against Clarence Thomas, Chairman Biden sent the letter to  the President George H.W. Bush White House--to the White House Counsel,  C. Boyden Gray. Then on that very day, C. Boyden Gray, the White House  Counsel, ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the  charges by Anita Hill.   There has been a lot of comment on whether that investigation had  been adequate or preemptory. There has been a lot more comment on  whether the following hearing had been fair, adequate, and not  preemptory. Yet the fact is that the instinct of Joe Biden and the  instinct of the George H.W. Bush White House was the same: Investigate  it. Don't assume it is true, and don't assume it is false.   Now look at this case. Look at where we are today despite repeated  requests to the White House and the Republicans for the Federal Bureau  of Investigation to look into this matter. Despite repeated requests  for them to ask the FBI to do this, they have refused. The Republicans  have refused an investigation of the charges by Dr. Ford. Dr. Ford has  called for the FBI to investigate her own charges. They have refused.   If they truly believed that there was no evidence, no witness to back  up Dr. Ford's charges, wouldn't they, obviously, have called the FBI  and said, ``Do your job, and find what you can. We are confident, at  the end, that Judge Kavanaugh will be exonerated''? Yet they have not.  Despite all of the calls for fairness over and over again by Senator  McConnell, fairness would dictate a nonpartisan investigative group  like the FBI to look into this matter and come to conclusions, whatever  they may be.   I listened as Senator McConnell said this morning that justice  matters. Evidence matters, he said. Facts matter, he said. I might add  that an FBI investigation matters, too, because it would get to the  bottom of all three of those things. Yet, the White House, the  President, Senator McConnell, and the Republicans have resisted this  FBI investigation despite Dr. Ford's asking for it.   As far as the presumption of innocence, I listened to Senator  McConnell say that someone suggested that Judge Kavanaugh is not  entitled to that. I disagree with whoever said that. Both Dr. Ford and  Judge Kavanaugh are entitled to the presumption of innocence. The case  has to be proven; the facts have to be shown as best they can.   I want to add something else too. I am troubled by what President  Trump said over the weekend about Dr. Ford's charges--the suggestion  that it has been so long that her charges are not credible, the  suggestion that if they were truly credible, she would have told her  parents what had happened that night in the bedroom and that her  parents would have reported it to law enforcement, and we could have  read the police reports.   That is not the real world when it comes to this kind of sexual  harassment and sexual violence--not at all. It is the reason it took 40  years for altar boys in the Catholic Church to come forward and finally  tell their stories. It is the reason many women who have been victims  never come forward. It is hard. It is difficult. It is painful. It is  divisive. Many of them step away from it and carry those memories for  their lifetimes without ever telling anyone.   If you want to be fair to Dr. Ford, and if you want to be fair to the  victims of sexual violence, harassment, and assault, then you have to  acknowledge the obvious. This is something no one wishes on any member  of their family, friend, or person they have met. In fairness, if it  occurs, we should be sensitive to the fact that many don't want to come  forward at all, and some only do it reluctantly much later.   I want a fair and open hearing this Thursday when both Dr. Ford and  Judge Kavanaugh come before us. This is not a smear campaign, as far as  I am concerned.   Dr. Ford, with nothing to gain, has stepped forward and told her  story. She has subjected her family and her name to the kind of  publicity no one would wish on their family, and she has done it  because she believes the truth is important.   By the same token, Judge Kavanaugh is entitled to tell his story, and  I hope he will. He will have to explain to this committee why he didn't  call for a Federal Bureau of Investigation effort on his own behalf to  establish the facts,  [[Page S6286]]  the evidence, and the witnesses, if there were any. He didn't, and that  is a fact.   We also know this charge Senator McConnell made that Senator Schumer  made up his mind on the Kavanaugh nomination early in some respects is  true. Senator Schumer announced his position on this nomination early,  but if you have been listening to the speeches given by Senator  McConnell on the floor from the start, you certainly know where his  vote has been. He says he is looking forward to hearing the testimony  on Thursday. Well, clearly, he has made up his mind before he hears  that testimony. So to fault Senator Schumer for taking a position on  this nomination early, that he is ignoring the obvious--so did Senator  McConnell.   At this point, I will say we face an awesome responsibility. A nation  divided politically, a nation where people have strong feelings on both  sides in an effort to find the truth--I don't know what the legal  standard is for this hearing. When it comes to criminal law, we  certainly know the matter of probable cause, which leads to  investigation and prosecution, and beyond a reasonable doubt to prove  the guilt of someone. We know on the civil side there are different  standards. No one has quite spelled out what our standard of proof is,  but this much I know. No one--not any single American--is entitled to a  seat on the Supreme Court. They have to come before the American people  first and certainly the Senate, under the Constitution, and make their  case for the advice and consent of the Senate to that nomination.   It is a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land. The  person who fills that seat can make decisions which swing history one  way or the other, decisions which affect justice and privacy and  fairness in American life. For that reason, all of us--all the Members  of the Senate, certainly the Senate Judiciary Committee--have to take  it seriously. I am going to take this very seriously, and I hope  Members on both sides of the aisle will.   I also will say this. Senator McConnell followed up with his ``plow  through this matter'' comment and told us: We will stay through the  weekend, if necessary, to get this done. We have to get it behind us.  We have to move on. Where was Senator McConnell's sense of urgency when  the vacancy was created by the death of Antonin Scalia? For almost a  year, Senator McConnell left that seat vacant in the hopes that a  Republican would be elected President. The idea now of giving a few  days to go through the evidence, to go through an investigation, to  have a reasonable review of the record of Judge Kavanaugh is now pushed  away. This has to be done, it has to be done this weekend, and that is  it--why? Why the urgency, Senator McConnell? Shouldn't we value  fairness over urgency?   I ask Senator McConnell: Set your ``plow'' aside for a few minutes,  would you? Take a look at the Senate, this deliberative body, and make  sure that in fairness to both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, we don't  push this through, and we don't rush to judgment. Let us use our  opportunity in the Senate and our responsibility in the Senate to treat  our constitutional requirement seriously.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today I would like to bring attention to  the southernmost city in my State, Cairo, IL.   Sitting at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, Cairo  was once a booming port town and was home to Fort Defiance during the  Civil War. In the 1960s, Civil Rights icon Representative John Lewis  even spent a summer there to help integrate a number of businesses and  public spaces.   However, in recent years, this southern city has faced a new  challenge, as uninhabitable living conditions have force hundreds of  public housing residents to relocate from their homes--and in many  cases from their beloved community. Public housing in the city suffered  years of neglect at the hands of local officials who are now accused of  misusing Federal funds to bankroll lavish personal expenses, including  multiple trips to Las Vegas and steak dinners.   And how was life for residents? By the time residents were forced to  relocate, 185 families--including roughly 200 children--were living in  housing overrun with rodents, bedbugs, roaches, crime, mold, asbestos,  and lead. I am talking about rats in the couch, maggots in the freeze,  and plumbing and heating that simply refused to work.   It was local officials who failed to provide its residents with safe  and healthy housing; yet these families were the ones whose lives were  uprooted as a result. Today, all 185 families have relocated, and the  vacant housing complexes are set to be demolished. While the strength  and resilience of these residents and their community in the face of  this situation is inspiring, there is no question they deserved far  more from their government.   It has been more than 2 years since the HUD Inspector General's  Office began investigating alleged misuse of Federal funds by local  officials, and it is beyond time for that investigation to be finalized  and for the results to be made public.   Today I am calling--once again--for the HUD inspector general to do  just that, but more remains to be done to restore the faith and  confidence of public housing residents in our government. Transparent  accountability must be had at all levels of government where  mismanagement played a role in creating this crisis.   This is why, in May of last year, Senator Duckworth and I called for  the HUD inspector general to also look into HUD's oversight of  Alexander County Housing Authority. This July, the IG released its  report that found that despite having early knowledge of bad conditions  at Alexander County, HUD hesitated to intervene, while residents  suffered.   This is unacceptable, and it cannot be repeated. HUD is responsible  for ensuring public housing authorities meet their responsibility to  provide safe and affordable housing, and it must be capable of  performing this vital oversight. Senator Duckworth and I have urged HUD  to quickly implement the recommendations included in the report to more  effectively oversee public housing authorities, to which HUD has  agreed.  [[Page S6299]]    I look forward to continuing to work with HUD to improve its  oversight of public housing authorities. We cannot allow the local and  Federal mismanagement that jeopardized living conditions in Cairo to be  repeated in any other community.                            ____________________
