 Madam President, reserving the right to object.   I appreciate the Senator's interest in trying to make sure that  American energy resources don't go to benefit communist China. And it  is interesting because I don't think a lot of Americans know that prior  to 2015, the United States didn't allow for the export of American oil.  We saw it prior to 2015 as a strategic asset, all of the oil produced  in the United States.   Prior to 2015, we decided that the oil produced in the United States  would stay in the United States; that it should benefit U.S. consumers.   And I have heard my Republican colleagues come down to the floor over  and over again calling the Biden administration to do more drilling, to  do more exploration, to authorize more permits under the belief that  drilling in the United States will produce results for American  consumers.   But the reality is we have done more drilling in the United States,  but much of that drilling and exploration has benefited--you guessed  it--China. Prior to 2015, the United States didn't export oil to China.  In 2013, we exported .3 million barrels, the next year .4 million  barrels, the next year 8 million barrels, the next year 80 million,  then 84 million, dipped down to 50, then back up to 176. In 2021, 91  million barrels of oil shipped from the United States to China.   And so if we are sincere about trying to make sure that American- produced oil benefits American consumers, rather than the Chinese  Communist Party, well, then let's make that our policy. Let's not limit  the policy to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; let's just make the  decision that American oil is going to benefit American consumers.   Now, that change was made in 2013 as part of a compromise.  Republicans wanted the ban on oil exports lifted. Democrats wanted the  extension of some tax incentives for renewables. It was a bipartisan  compromise. But now that we seem to have greater consensus around  stopping American exports of fuel benefiting China, then let's not just  do this halfway; let's make it a clear policy.   And so I just learned of the Senator's unanimous consent request this  morning, and I will commit to him to learn more about the more targeted  approach that he is making, but I am going to plan to object to it  today unless we can modify it to make this policy universal.   Senator Markey has a piece of legislation that would reimpose that  ban on the export of oil. It seems like a pretty important time to do  that. If we have oil in the United States, why don't we keep it here to  benefit the people of the United States instead of shipping it to  China? Senator Markey's bill has language in it that would allow for  national interest exemptions so that if we needed to get oil to  Ukraine, for instance, we could still do that. But 91 million barrels  of oil, that is a lot of oil to be sending to China every year.   And so I am going to ask that the Senator modify his request to pass  Senator Markey's legislation instead, which would, frankly, get at the  concern that Senator Cruz is articulating but do it in a much more  comprehensive way. I expect he may object to that modification, and if  he does, I will object to his original request but commit to him to  spend some time looking at his more targeted approach given a little  bit more of a window.   So I am going to make this request right now, which is that the  Senator modify his request and instead that the Committee on Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from further consideration of  S. 1415 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further,  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, here is  what the Senator from Texas is saying: It is fine to sell to China so  long as you are a big American oil company and profiting off of it.   That is the bottom line.   The Senator had the chance to endorse the policy that would have  stopped all American exports to China. If the priority is to not enrich  the Chinese Government, then let's enact that policy.   What Senator Cruz is essentially saying is that if the end result is  massive profits for the oil company, then we are just going to look the  other way. Then we are just going to look the other way.   The strategic petroleum reserve? No, we are going to keep that oil  here. That can't go to China. That would be an immoral abomination if  the Chinese got their hands on that oil.   But if the end result is that oil companies get to pad their profits  by selling oil to the Chinese, well, then that is fine. Well, then,  that is fine.   So let's be 100 percent clear in what is happening here. If your  priority is not selling oil to China, then let's make that the policy.  Let's make that the policy.   But that is not the priority. The priority is to make sure the oil  companies can make as much money as possible.   ExxonMobil expects to make $10 billion in profit--not revenue, in  profit--in the second quarter of this year. So I don't apologize for a  second for making my priority the people of this country, not the  profits of the oil companies.   Yes, I want to keep American oil here because I want it to benefit  American consumers, not the oil companies' bottom line.   And spare me the rewrite of history on Nord Stream 2. Those sanctions  that we passed were ready to go for Donald Trump. What I objected to  was the Senator being silent when Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and  refused to implement those sanctions, and then taking a hard line when  a Democrat was in the White House.   Senator Cruz held up every State Department nominee that President  Biden offered, as hostage in order to get a change on Nord Stream 2  policy. The Senator did not do that when Donald Trump was in office,  during a period of time in which the pipeline was being built.   By the time that Donald Trump left office, that pipeline was 95  percent built, and had Senator Cruz taken the same policy during the  Trump administration, arguably, we could have been in a different place  by the end of 2019.   So I don't apologize for saying: You know what. The oil companies are  making too much money. Our prices, our constituents, our consumers  should come first. And if we are serious about not exporting oil to  China, then let's be serious about it and make the policy universal.   And so for that reason, I would object.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  memory of a dear friend, Thomas Tresselt, who passed away on July 12 in  Hartford.   Tom was an American classic. He grew up in Indiana where he was the  star of his high school's basketball team before taking his talents to  Yale University. In his first year, he scored 16 points on future NBA  player, U.S. Senator, and Presidential candidate Bill Bradley's  Princeton team. While he was not destined for the NBA, he never lost  his love of basketball. In the early 80s--before computers were  commonplace--he and a friend started their law firm's March Madness  pool, providing comprehensive round-by-round standings, calculated  manually using brackets drawn by hand.   Tom went on to the University of Michigan Law School where he married  the love of his life, Sally. Sally and Tom would be married for 57  years. Following law school, Tom was commissioned an officer in the  U.S. Navy, where he served in Beachmaster Unit 2 from 1969 to 1971.  After the Navy, Tom and Sally moved to San Francisco where Tom worked  as a litigator for Orrick, Herrington, Rowley, and Sutcliffe.   ``Tired of always arguing for a living,'' Tom moved back to  Connecticut, the place he and his family would call home for the next  nearly 50 years. From 1974 to 1977, he was assistant dean of Yale Law  School before joining Shipman and Goodman, where he practiced corporate  law until 2008.   A leader in every sense of the word, Tom was an extremely active  member of his community. At Asylum Hill Congregation Church, he served  as moderator, was cochair of the capital campaign, served on the board  of Christian service, was a deacon, and performed in the Boar's Head  Festival as a king, log carrier, Beefeater, and other roles for nearly  20 years. He also served on the board of Loaves and Fishes, the  American School for the Deaf, and Leadership Greater Hartford--3rd Age  Initiative.   I knew Tom as a great friend and coworker of my father who, like Tom,  made Shipman and Goodwin his work home for five decades. To me, Tom was  a legend. Thoughtful and kind, with this big, booming, smiling  personality that drew people to him. That person in your life that  everyone just wants to be around. He was a man of action who led by  example and was committed to his country, his family, and his  community.   Tom battled Alzheimer's at the end of his life, but never lost his  sense of humor, compassion, and love for his family and friends.   I only wish I could have known him better. But I knew him well enough  to  [[Page S3742]]  know how great he was. Tom Tresselt will be missed by all.                            ____________________
