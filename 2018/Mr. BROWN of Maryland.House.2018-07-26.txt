 Mr. Speaker, today is the deadline for the  Trump administration to reunite more than 2,500 children with their  families. It is clear to me that they are not going to make this  deadline.   Hundreds of parents have been deported without their children. HHS  has not been able to identify the parents of nearly 100 children.   Even when the administration reunites children and parents, there is  only chaos and confusion:   Reunifications are occurring in parking lots in the middle of the  night;   Parents are not being informed of their rights and are desperately  giving up their chance to stay in this country. They don't have access  to lawyers;   After reunification, there is no rationale in deciding which families  are released and which are sent to detention centers.   This entire process is unacceptable and abhorrent. That is why I am  introducing legislation to immediately appoint a single authority to  oversee reunification across the government. We need someone to  effectively manage this process.   No more excuses. No more delays. Mr. Speaker, we have to reunite  every child immediately.

This fiscal year 2019  Defense Authorization Act takes the crucial next steps to rebuild our  military by making greater investments in training,  [[Page H7697]]  equipping, and providing for our forces. This bipartisan bill is  essential to helping our troops prepare and respond to the complex  security challenges we are facing around the world.   But as we authorize the largest budget for defense since World War  II, it is imperative that President Trump lead responsibly so we can  ably defend ourselves and the values we stand for around the world.   That includes: Enhancing U.S. defense posture in Europe and  confronting Russian aggression.   We provide record funding for the European Deterrence Initiative that  deepens our commitment to our NATO allies.   We strengthen our ability to combat ongoing Russian cyber campaigns  that seek to undermine our democracy.   And we prevent the administration from recognizing Putin's illegal  annexation of Crimea.   It requires the President to spend our defense dollars wisely.   We should be focusing on increasing readiness and extending our  warfighting edge, which is why the NDAA increases funding for training  in each service, modernizes range and test facilities and boosts  spending on maintenance and spare parts.   And we in invest in modern equipment that have the capabilities to  confront Russia and China and other emerging threats.   We must also support the men and women who choose to wear the  uniform. That is why we are providing our servicemembers with the  largest pay raise in nearly a decade.   And we are overhauling the Transition Assistance Program to provide  servicemembers better-tailored resources as they prepare to enter  civilian life.   But we must do more to ensure that we extend and preserve the ability  to honorably serve to every person in our armed forces, such as:   The men and women deserving a harassment-free workplace.   The Dreamer promised citizenship.   Or the transgender American who wants to continue serving.   The array of national security threats facing the United States is  more complex and diverse and the strategic environment has never been  more competitive. The Defense Authorization Act gives our military  service components the tools and resources for the United States to  maintain its military advantage, counter adversaries, and defend the  international order that has created a safer and more prosperous world.   Congress has done its job. Now the President must make the tough  choices to implement the national defense strategy and truly safeguard  our national security.
