 Mr. Speaker, the White House's proposed list  of new tariffs includes headwear, hats, and headgear. If a 25 percent  tariff on these products were imposed, New Era Cap, the largest  headwear company in the United States and based in my district, would  be hurt.   Based in Buffalo, New Era employs 800 people in 19 States. New Era  supplies official headwear for the National Football League, the  National Basketball Association, and Major League Baseball.   Mr. President, you can't tariff your way to economic growth. A tariff  is a tax levied by a government on imported goods by placing taxes on  foreign component parts. These products become more expensive for  American consumers. The imposition of these tariffs are a race to the  bottom and will result in higher product costs for all Americans.                            ____________________
