 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on  this issue and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of a bill that I introduced,  H.R. 4100, which, put simply, helps support those Federal attorneys who  prosecute major drug traffickers, white collar criminals, and other  Federal crimes, and the judges who preside over those cases in our  Federal courts.   The Federal Bar Association was founded back in 1920 and charted by  Congress in 1954. However, in the nearly 64 years of its existence, its  charter has never been amended.   As a former educator, attorney, and current senior member of the  Judiciary Committee, I would note the important work that the Federal  Bar Association does to bring civics education to classrooms in my  State of Ohio, and they bring that same expertise to other areas all  across the country.   Without legislation like H.R. 4100, it takes an act of Congress to  even allow the Federal Bar Association to make simple changes to their  bylaws. More specifically, this legislation gives the association the  authority to choose the location of its principal office, restricts its  officers from engaging in political activity, and makes other technical  changes to conform to commonly used language and other things.   This legislation provides the Federal Bar Association the continued  ability to support legal research, pro bono, and community projects;  continue to educate grade schoolchildren on the Federal judiciary  system; and improve the practice of Federal law in our Federal  courtrooms all across America.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the chairman, Chairman Goodlatte,  for his leadership in helping to bring this very important legislation  to the floor for consideration, and I urge my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to support it.
