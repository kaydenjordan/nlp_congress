 Madam Speaker, due to a committee hearing  with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, I was unable to make rollcall  Vote 171 on the Motion to Recommit offered by Mr. McCaul of Texas. I  would like the record to note that I would have supported the Motion to  Recommit and have a long history of supporting our ally, Israel.       members recorded pursuant to house resolution 8, 117th congress       Cardenas (Gomez)      Cicilline (Pingree)      Cleaver (Davids (KS))      DeSaulnier (Thompson (CA))      Frankel, Lois (Clark (MA))      Gimenez (Waltz)      Gonzalez, Vicente (Gomez)      Granger (Arrington)      Grijalva (Garcia (IL))      Himes (Courtney)      Hoyer (Brown)      Johnson (TX) (Jeffries)      Kahele (Mrvan)      Kim (NJ) (Pallone)      Kirkpatrick (Stanton)      Langevin (Courtney)      Lawson (FL) (Evans)      Lieu (Raskin)      Lowenthal (Beyer)      Meng (Clark (MA))  [[Page H2910]]        Mullin (Lucas)      Nadler (Jeffries)      Napolitano (Correa)      Nehls (Fallon)      Payne (Pallone)      Porter (Levin (CA))      Roybal-Allard (Escobar)      Ruiz (Aguilar)      Rush (Underwood)      Sewell (DelBene)      Sherrill (Pallone)      Sires (Pallone)      Speier (Scanlon)      Strickland (Kilmer)      Swalwell (Gallego)      Trahan (Lynch)      Wagner (Walorski)      Wexton (Connolly)      Wilson (FL) (Hayes)
