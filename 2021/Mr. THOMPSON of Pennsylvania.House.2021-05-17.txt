 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  May as Mental Health Awareness Month. The focus of this campaign is to  break down the stigma surrounding mental health.   Each year, millions of Americans face the reality of living with a  mental illness. By breaking the stigma and talking about depression,  anxiety, and other conditions, we can help those affected to seek the  quality care that they deserve.   After spending the past year locked down and secluded from society,  it is more important than ever to check in on your loved ones. If you  are suffering or feel alone, please reach out for help. It is important  to remember that you are not alone.   Mr. Speaker, by bringing attention to mental health, we can elevate  the conversations surrounding mental health. We are focusing on  prioritizing mental health and acknowledging it is okay to not be okay.   This month, reach out to your loved ones and check in. By starting  the conversation, we are one step closer to ending the stigma  surrounding mental health.                            ____________________
