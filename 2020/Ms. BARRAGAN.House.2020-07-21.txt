 Mr. Speaker, California's 44th Congressional District  lost a longtime South Gate champion and my friend, Henry Gonzalez.   Besides being a confidant and adviser to me on many occasions, he  spent decades serving the city of South Gate as a council member,  mayor, and community leader.   Henry became the first Latino elected to the city council and served  as mayor of South Gate for six different 1-year terms.   ``Hammerin Hank,'' as he was called by many, championed the  priorities of hardworking families. He was a labor leader with the  United Auto Workers, and his entire family was involved in the union's  fight for workers' rights.   Henry was a dedicated public servant who demonstrated honesty,  integrity, and commitment to our community during the most challenging  times. He even survived an assassination attempt on his life.   Henry left an imprint on our community and inspired me. His legacy  will be remembered for years to come.                            ____________________
