 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (S. 578) to amend title II of the Social Security Act  to eliminate the five-month waiting period for disability insurance  benefits under such title for individuals with amyotrophic lateral  sclerosis.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 578         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``ALS Disability Insurance       Access Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF WAITING PERIOD FOR SOCIAL SECURITY                     DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR DISABLED                     INDIVIDUALS WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS                     (ALS).         (a) In General.--Section 223(a)(1) of the Social Security       Act (42 U.S.C. 423(a)(1)) is amended in the matter following       subparagraph (E) by striking ``or (ii)'' and inserting ``(ii)       in the case of an individual who has been medically       determined to have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, for each       month beginning with the first month during all of which the       individual is under a disability and in which the individual       becomes entitled to such insurance benefits, or (iii)''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section       shall apply with respect to applications for disability       insurance benefits filed after the date of the enactment of       this Act.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I might consume.   ALS is a devastating and cruel disease. There is no cure for ALS, and  ALS always leads to a premature death. On average, people live only 2  to 5 years after getting a diagnosis of ALS.   Earlier this year, I lost my dear friend and former Chief of Staff,  Elliot Ginsberg to ALS, and previously lost a near and dear friend,  Danny Jones, who I went to grammar school with and played basketball  with, who later led Central Connecticut in his collegiate years.   Every year, approximately 5,000 Americans are diagnosed with ALS.   Over time, people with ALS lose their ability to speak, to eat, to  move, and even to breathe. They are unable to work due to their severe  disabilities, and they lose their jobs and their employer-based health  insurance. I have witnessed this happen to both them and, as  importantly, their family members, and to see the agony and the  suffering and yet the dedication and love that they go through.   Recognizing the devastating nature of ALS, in 2000, Congress passed  bipartisan legislation that waived the 24-month waiting period for  Medicare for people with ALS.   Today, we consider the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act of 2019.  This bipartisan legislation will end the 5-month waiting period for  Social Security Disability Insurance benefits for people with ALS.   Madam Speaker, I want to give special thanks to Representative Seth  Moulton, who has been a champion on this issue, along with the 305  Members of the House of Representatives who have cosponsored  Representative Moulton's bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the ALS  Disability Insurance Access Act of 2019. Our actions today will provide  people with ALS quicker access to the Social Security and Medicare  benefits they have earned.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to commend my colleague on the House  Ways and Means Committee, Bill Pascrell, for his passionate leadership  and untiring advocacy on behalf of those suffering with Huntington's  disease, a terrible disease which affects children as well as adults.   Today, we are passing this bill for many with ALS, but we also know  there are many devastating diseases, such as Huntington's and  metastatic breast cancer, which also deserve the same benefits and to  have bills in Congress that will provide just that.   We need a solution for everyone.   People with the kinds of severe disease and disabilities that qualify  them for Social Security really need the benefits they have earned as  soon as possible. I hope that in the next Congress we can try to help  everyone, by doing what Bernie Sanders and Lloyd Doggett and others  have proposed, to eliminate these waiting periods across the board.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the distinguished gentleman  who has championed this bill.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), a distinguished gentleman  who has been a lifelong fighter on behalf of people with disabilities.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), a gracious and  distinguished lady on the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, at this time, it is my  privilege to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny  K. Davis), who I say is the voice of God. When you hear him speak, I  think you will agree with me.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley), considered the greatest hockey  player in the Congress.    Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield 1  minute to the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I have great gratitude for  my distinguished colleague from New York (Mr. Reed), and I thank Seth  Moulton for his outstanding work on this bill.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 578, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 1375) to amend title XVIII of the Social  Security Act to provide for transparency of Medicare secondary payer  reporting information, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1375         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Provide Accurate Information       Directly Act'' or ``PAID Act''.       SEC. 2. TRANSPARENCY OF MEDICARE SECONDARY PAYER REPORTING                     INFORMATION.         (a) In General.--Section 1862(b)(8)(G) of the Social       Security Act (42 U.S.C. 395y(b)(8)(G)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``information.--The Secretary'' and       inserting ``information.--        ``(i) In general.--The Secretary''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new clause:        ``(ii) Specified information.--In responding to any query       from an applicable plan related to a determination described       in subparagraph (A)(i), the Secretary, notwithstanding any       other provision of law, shall provide to such applicable       plan--         ``(I) whether a claimant subject to the query is, or during       the preceding 3-year period has been, entitled to benefits       under the program under this title on any basis; and        ``(II) to the extent applicable, the plan name and address       of any Medicare Advantage plan under part C and any       prescription drug plan under part D in which the claimant is       enrolled or has been enrolled during such period.''.         (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to queries from plans made on or       after the date that is one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. DEPOSIT OF SAVINGS INTO MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT FUND.         Section 1898(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1395iii(b)(1)) is amended by striking ``$0'' and inserting       ``$30,000,000''.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that  [[Page H6992]]       such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on       passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1375, the Provide Accurate Information Directly  Act of 2019, as amended, or the PAID Act, improves financial  accountability by strengthening reporting regarding Medicare Advantage  enrollees between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS,  and liability and other nongroup health plans.   Similar measures are already in place for traditional Medicare. With  one in three Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare Advantage  plan, it is time that we enact this measure to bring parity for the  program. At its core, this is a good governance program, which will  improve integrity overall, and that is always welcome.   I would like to especially thank our fellow Ways and Means Committee  member Ron Kind, who has worked tirelessly at this to make sure that we  corrected this anomaly in the legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Richard Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: I write concerning H.R. 1375, the PAID       Act, which was additionally referred to the Committee on       Energy and Commerce (Committee).        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 1375, the Committee agrees to waive formal consideration       of the bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee. The Committee takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I also request that       you support my request to name members of the Committee to       any conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.       1375.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                   Washington, DC, December 8, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing concerning H.R. 1375,       the PAID Act, which as you are aware was referred to the       Committee on Ways and Means and additionally to the Committee       on Energy and Commerce.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation and I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy       and Commerce under House Rule X. I acknowledge that your       Committee will not consider H.R. 1375 and agree that the       inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does not       waive any further jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in the bill that fall within your Committee's Rule       X jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on Energy and Commerce conferees during any House-      Senate conference on this legislation.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, I would like to  thank our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, with a special thanks  to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes) for his continued work on  this.   Ron Kind from Wisconsin has been fighting for practical, commonsense  legislation like this almost every day that he has been in Congress  since I have known him. A true sign of a Harvard quarterback is that he  continues to be persistent. I want to thank him again for his hard  work.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1375, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 2477) to amend title XVIII of the Social  Security Act to establish a system to notify individuals approaching  Medicare eligibility, to simplify and modernize the eligibility  enrollment process, and for other purposes, as amended.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2477, the Beneficiary Enrollment Notification and  Eligibility Simplification Act of 2020, as amended, includes four  policies that improve Medicare enrollment, access, and quality of care.   First, the BENES Act, as I shall continue to call it, introduced by  my colleague, Representative Raul Ruiz, fills a longstanding gap in  education for older adults and people with disabilities, eliminating  needless multimonth coverage gaps in Medicare by mandating that part B  insurance begin the first month following an individual's enrollment  during both the later months of the beneficiary's initial enrollment  period and during the general enrollment period.   The BENES Act also provides increased notification to better inform  older adults and people with disabilities about Medicare eligibility  enrollment.   The BENES Act also allows the Federal Government to create a part B  special enrollment period for exceptional circumstances, like natural  disasters.   Complex Medicare enrollment rules and inadequate notification cause  tens of thousands of older adults and people with disabilities to face  lifetime fines, coverage gaps, and other harmful consequences.  Individuals who miss their initial Medicare enrollment window may pay  lifetime late enrollment penalties, experience lengthy gaps in  outpatient health coverage, or face unaffordable and unexpected out-of- pocket healthcare costs.   The bill under consideration today also includes two provisions based  on legislation again championed by Ron Kind from Wisconsin. The first  will provide access to immunosuppressive therapy to individuals after a  kidney transplant.   I have heard from the Hartford Hospital kidney transplant group and  National Kidney Foundation how vitally important this legislation is,  and I am pleased that it is included.   The second provision will make improvements to reporting regarding  Medicare Advantage enrollees between the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services and liability and non-group health plans to improve  financial accountability.   Finally, H.R. 2477 includes language from H.R. 5821, the bipartisan  Helping Our Senior Population in Comfort Environments Act, or the  HOSPICE Act, introduced by my Ways and Means colleagues,  Representatives   Jimmy Panetta and   Tom Reed.   This policy addresses vital program integrity concerns identified by  the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector  General in 2019 through a series of much-needed reforms that provide  additional oversight and transparency of Medicare hospice providers.   The changes in this bill align the HHS Secretary's oversight tools  with those of other Medicare providers, including skilled nursing  facilities and home health providers. These reforms are vital to  improving the quality of care delivered to some of the most vulnerable  patients in the healthcare system.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Ways and Means.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Speaker, before I close, throughout the day, I am sure people  observing have viewed us taking off and putting on our masks, et  cetera. I would like to acknowledge a very special person from Mayberry  Village in East Hartford, Connecticut, who made this mask and several  like these and has distributed them out of the kindness of her heart  and concern and care. Her name is Margaret Grady Ramsey from Mayberry  Village in East Hartford, Connecticut. I thank Peg for all her hard  work.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I know that Dr. Ruiz has worked tirelessly  on the BENES Act for many years. I thank him for his efforts. I also  thank the Medicare beneficiary advocates, including the Medicare Rights  Center and the Center for Medicare Advocacy, for their tireless work  and support to find a solution to this longstanding problem.   The gentlewoman from Indiana has also played a key role in this as  well, and I want to make sure we acknowledge her as well.   H.R. 2477, the BENES Act, provides significant long-term improvements  to Medicare for millions of beneficiaries. I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
