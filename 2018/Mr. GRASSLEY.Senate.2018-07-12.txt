 Madam President, as we all know, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation is a component of the Department of Justice. It is  frequently described as the premier law enforcement agency in the  country. The FBI's investigative authority has only grown--and grown  tremendously--since its creation almost 100 years ago.   The Bureau now covers everything from kidnapping to  counterintelligence, public corruption to bank robbery, and maybe a lot  of things in between. Its power is very substantial, and its  jurisdiction is far-reaching. It is a very important agency. Because of  that, the FBI is subject to a lot of scrutiny.   Lately, we have had a lot of folks around here who seem to be  mistaking the word ``scrutiny'' of the Bureau with the word ``attacks''  on the Bureau. Oversight of the FBI is not new, and it is a  constitutional responsibility of the Congress at least to do oversight  of every agency, and the FBI can't be an exception.   Far from being out of bounds, it is essential for the people's  elected representatives in the Congress to put the FBI under a  microscope. That is doubly true when the FBI gets involved in election  controversies. The more power and the more secrecy the FBI claims in  order to carry out its responsibilities, the more closely it ought to  be watched.   Under our government, where the public's business ought to be public,  that statement I just made ought to be common sense to everybody.   In its criminal work, the FBI is held accountable primarily by the  court system. When the FBI secretly gathers information for  intelligence purposes, the risk of impropriety skyrockets. If the  information is never going to be presented in the courts, as in a  criminal matter, who is going to be watching to make sure that the  power to gather and use it is not being abused?   That is why we need vigorous congressional oversight and strong  inspector general scrutiny. Lots of people say that the FBI should be  independent. I disagree. The FBI needs to be objective and nonpartisan.  It should be insulated from undue political pressure.   If you want to call that independence, then I will use that word. It  cannot be independent of accountability to the people's elected  leaders. Civilian control of the military has always been a key  safeguard to liberty for the same reason.   Freedom is at risk if the FBI can become a domestic intelligence  service with free rein to weaponize information in secret. We have seen  the risks of that in the text messages of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.  Their contempt for both the people of this country and, particularly,  their elected leaders should disturb everyone.   Abuses of power at the FBI are why we have a term limit for the  Director of the FBI. That term limit is not there to protect the FBI's  independence; it is there to protect the people from the abuses that J.  Edgar Hoover committed because he became too independent. He was  accountable to no one. J. Edgar Hoover was feared by Presidents,  Senators, and Congressmen. While the Director originally was selected  by the Attorney General, in 1968, Congress made the position subject to  Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. In 1976, the Congress  established a nonrenewable 10-year term limit for the Director. The  Senate Judiciary Committee published a committee report on that bill  that limited the 10-year term in 1974. It took a couple of years for  the bill to pass the House.    In quoting from that report:         The purpose of the bill is to achieve two complementary       objectives. The first is to insulate the Director of the       Federal Bureau of Investigation from undue pressure being       exerted upon him from superiors in the Executive Branch. The       second is to protect against an FBI Director becoming too       independent and unresponsive.    At the time, Congress was grappling with the fallout of Watergate and  the decades of corruption and civil liberties abuses by that first  Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover--hence, the legislation. Congress  knew the FBI had to be able to operate free of partisan interference  but still be accountable to the duly elected leadership of the country,  including all Members of Congress in their constitutional roles of  oversight.   Certainly, the FBI Director can't be a politician's stooge, but  history tells us that the bigger risk is in the other direction. Hoover  abused his power to intimidate politicians and other political leaders.  In a democracy, all of our leaders are ultimately accountable to the  people. Access to information about what agencies like the FBI are  doing is essential to holding them accountable. Transparency brings  accountability. Abuses multiply in secret. That is why congressional  oversight--Congress's responsibility under the Constitution--is key.  The recent report by the Department of Justice's inspector general is a  very good example. It describes behavior having taken place in secret  at the FBI that simply cannot be defended when having been brought to  light.   First, the inspector general's report identified unacceptable  messages that were sent on FBI mobile devices and computer systems by 5  of the 15 FBI employees on the Clinton email investigation. Those  messages reeked with political bias. The report found that through such  messages, these employees ``brought discredit to themselves, sowed  doubt about the FBI's handling of the Midyear investigation, and  impacted the reputation of the FBI.'' One message explicitly suggested  a willingness to take official investigative steps for partisan reasons  where there should be no partisanship. That message vowed to stop the  election of Donald Trump.   Can you imagine an FBI employee in an official capacity, on official  devices, taking that approach and then claiming not to be biased?   Because of that message, the IG was unable to conclude that the FBI's  inaction on the Clinton email matter, for nearly a month prior to the  election, was free from partisan bias.   The IG referred to the Bureau all five employees who had expressed  partisan bias in order for the FBI to consider potential disciplinary  action. Those messages showed a bureau plagued by arrogance, disrespect  for policy and norms, and disgust of democratic accountability.   The report found that Director Comey's actions usurped the  Department's authority. It called his decision of publicly announcing  that Secretary Clinton would not be prosecuted as ``extraordinary'' and  ``insubordinate.'' Director Comey acted as if he were accountable to no  one except himself.   His subordinates also appeared content to ignore Bureau and  Department policy and guidance--some, apparently, for their own  personal interests.   The inspector general also recently concluded that the FBI's former  Deputy, Andrew McCabe, authorized the disclosure of information to a  reporter. That information confirmed the existence of an ongoing  investigation. The IG report faulted McCabe for violating longstanding  Department and Bureau policy. There is a public interest exception to  that policy, but the inspector general found that McCabe authorized the  disclosure of the information to make himself, McCabe, look good. Now  McCabe claims Comey knew about it, but the FBI will not release  information that supposedly supports that claim.   The FBI did little to nothing to address what now appears to be a  culture of unauthorized contact with the media. Yet, somehow, every  day, you read in the newspapers of the FBI's stiff-arming congressional  oversight at every turn. Going to the newspapers is OK. When Congress  wants the same information, no.  [[Page S4930]]    On the one hand, for example, the FBI stonewalls legitimate requests  from the people's elected representatives, whom they ``hate,'' in the  words of Agent Strzok. On the other hand, FBI employees are accepting  meals, sports tickets, and golf outings from reporters.   Now the Department and the FBI are refusing to comply with  congressional subpoenas while lecturing Congress about the need to  control access to sensitive information. While FBI agents are breaking  the rules by talking to reporters left and right, the Bureau goes after  legitimate whistleblowers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse, according  to law.   The level of hypocrisy is staggering. The Bureau was investigating  Secretary Clinton for her use of private communications to transact  public business, but the employees in the Bureau who were handling that  very investigation, including the Director, did exactly the same thing.  Of course, these employees were not exclusively using a private server  that was highly vulnerable to outside attacks. There truly is a  difference in the order of magnitude, but the FBI's employees' behavior  could help explain their apparent lack of enthusiasm for investigating  Clinton's clear alienation of the Federal records. After all, how could  they accuse her of violating the Federal Records Act when it appears  they may also have been violating the very same law?   These are only some of the examples in the inspector general's latest  report that we had a hearing on before my Judiciary Committee a couple  of weeks ago.   Former Director Comey said his people ``didn't give a rip about  politics.'' We can see clearly now that that is just not true, at least  not for five top individuals involved in this very high-profile, very  important investigation. They now need to be held accountable for their  actions. There is no place in the FBI for the kind of arrogance  displayed in those text messages.   There is no place in the FBI for the kind of political timing and  calculations made by the former Director. His subordinates openly  discussed the enormous pressure they were under to close the Clinton  email investigation before the political conventions. That was  completely improper. Decisions at the FBI need to be made on merit, not  on a political calendar.   The FBI needs to stay out of politics. It needs to submit to  oversight. It needs to focus on doing its job to regain its reputation  for objectivity. No one in this country is above the law. No one should  be independent of accountability, especially not the FBI.
