 Mr. Speaker, on January 2, what started out as an  exciting game for our beloved Buffalo Bills turned into a tragedy that  captured the attention of the Nation.   It became instantly clear that Damar Hamlin's collapse on the field  would be seared into our memories as a moment where you remember  exactly where you were and who you were with.   But for millions of Americans across every political spectrum, every  background, every race and ethnicity, it was a moment of unity that  reminded our Nation of the power of prayer.   It reminded us that our faith matters above all else. In our dire  moment of need, our Nation turned to God, just as Damar Hamlin would  have wanted.   He is a man of unwavering faith who has spent his gift of life  honoring God and spreading love. I am happy to report today that Damar  Hamlin was released from the hospital. His recovery is a miracle.   May Damar's adversity serve as an inspiration to remind us all that  despite any differences we may have, we are one Nation under God and  indivisible.   Go Bills.                            ____________________
