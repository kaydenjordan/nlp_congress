 Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility to the people we  serve, and the moment is now to mitigate the damage to our people and  our economy.   For those who question the price tag, for those who question certain  features in the bill, think of the images we have all seen that are  unprecedented in our lifetimes: the senior citizen only able to see  family members through a window; worse yet, Americans dying alone; the  frontline medical professionals fighting an invisible disease, risking  their very lives to bring hope to a frightened public; the businessman  fighting to stay solvent, to keep a workforce, and to live to see  another day; the scientists and engineers desperately searching for an  answer.   Who among us can question the crisis we are in and the needs of the  people we serve?   By midday today, Mr. Speaker, let us be remembered for taking the  actions necessary to put aside our politics and deliver to the American  people.
