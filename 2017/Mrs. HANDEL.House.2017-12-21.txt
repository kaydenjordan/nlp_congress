 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1766) to reauthorize the SAFER Act of 2013, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1766         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Sexual Assault Forensic       Evidence Reporting Act of 2017'' or the ``SAFER Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. PEDIATRIC SEXUAL ASSAULT NURSE EXAMINERS.         Section 304(c)(2) of the DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of       2004 (34 U.S.C. 40723(c)(2)) is amended--        (1) by inserting ``, both adult and pediatric,'' after       ``role of forensic nurses''; and        (2) by striking ``and elder abuse'' and inserting ``elder       abuse, and, in particular, the need for pediatric sexual       assault nurse examiners, including such nurse examiners       working in the multidisciplinary setting, in responding to       abuse of both children and adolescents''.       SEC. 3. REDUCING THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG.         (a) Reauthorization.--Section 2(c)(4) of the DNA Analysis       Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (34 U.S.C. 40701(c)(4)) is       amended by striking ``2017'' and inserting ``2022''.        (b) Sunset.--Section 1006 of the SAFER Act of 2013 (34       U.S.C. 40701 note) is amended by striking ``2018'' and       inserting ``2023''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 1766, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   S. 1766, the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2017,  also known as the SAFER Act, will strengthen State and local law  enforcement's ability to reduce the number of untested rape kits and  help take more offenders off our streets.   Congress provides significant resources annually to the Department of  Justice to help reduce backlogs of untested forensic evidence. This  legislation will reauthorize the Attorney General's authority to  allocate 5 to 7 percent of funds made available to carry out the Debbie  Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program to help communities audit their  backlogs, which is an important first step in any effort to eliminate a  backlog.   Despite the cases analyzed and improvements made with our Federal  resources, backlogs persist due to the ever-increasing demand for  evidence testing. According to the National Institute of Justice, as  the value of DNA evidence is increasingly recognized, more evidence  gets collected and submitted to laboratories for analysis.   Delays in analysis of forensic evidence often result in delays of  justice: serial offenders can continue victimizing, and innocent  individuals may be incarcerated. The SAFER Act helps address this  common impediment to the response to rape and sexual assault at the  State, local, and Tribal levels.   Importantly, the SAFER Act also would clarify that pediatric forensic  nurses are eligible for training and employment grants. This provision  underscores the critical role that pediatric sexual assault nurse  examiners can play in a community's response to children who are  victims of abuse.   S. 1766 can help ensure that resources provided for DNA analysis are  focused on grant recipients making a good faith effort to estimate and  manage their backlog of untested samples and improve efforts to get sex  offenders off of our streets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Poe), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by recognizing the tremendous leadership of  my colleague, Representative Ted Poe from Texas. I thank him for giving  me the honor of being his wing woman in presenting this important piece  of legislation today.   And, indeed, the SAFER Act is an important piece of legislation to  reinforce the efforts of our local and State law enforcement in their  work to reduce the number of untested rape kits and help take these  sexual assault predators off the streets.   At the same time, this legislation underscores the critical role that  the pediatric sexual assault examiners play in this process and makes  them eligible for key training.   So, again, I ask my colleagues to pass this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
