 Madam President, with each passing day, we get another  round of news underscoring how costly this pandemic has been.  Yesterday, over 3,000 Americans--3,000--died from COVID-19, the highest  single-day death toll to date.   If you were making a list of some of the deadliest days in American  history, your mind would jump to Gettysburg, Antietam, Pearl Harbor, or  9/11. You can now add to that somber list last Thursday, Wednesday,  last Tuesday, last Friday, and yesterday. Each day, nearly 2,500  Americans or more lost their lives to COVID in the course of a single  day.   Now time is running out for Congress to finish our most pressing  priority: passing an emergency COVID relief bill to help American  families in need.   Right now, there is one clear path to getting an outcome: a  bipartisan group of Senators and House Members who have reached an  initial agreement on another emergency relief bill. In the spirit of  compromise and for the sake of getting something done for the American  people, Speaker Pelosi and I have endorsed those efforts as a framework  for a final bill.   Everyone knows that this bipartisan proposal is the only real game in  town at the moment, the only proposal with enough bipartisan support  to, hopefully, pass both Houses of Congress before the end of the year.  Everyone knows that, it seems, except Leader McConnell, who continues  to stand in the way of bipartisan progress and who seems to wake up  each morning with a new round of outlandish reasons why Democrats are  somehow to blame for all the world's ills.   As the bipartisan group of Senators continue to work toward a final  agreement, I want to address an incredibly false equivalency that has  been drawn between two provisions: providing aid to State and local  services--essential State and local services--and granting sweeping  immunity to corporations that put their workers in harm's way during  the pandemic.   You will hear voices say: Democrats want to fund State and local  services while Republicans--that is, Leader McConnell--want a corporate  liability shield. Each side wants something that the other side doesn't  want to accept. But as I said, this is a false equivalency, incredibly  false, for two reasons.   First, State and local aid has broad bipartisan support, totally  unlike the Republican leader's liability provision, which is expressly  partisan. Let me say that again because it is important. There is  strong bipartisan support for State and local aid. There is not the  same broad bipartisan support for sweeping corporate immunity.   Second, the two policies are not remotely equivalent in terms of  importance or relevance to what is going on in our country right now.  When we talk about providing Federal aid so the States don't have to  cut essential services, we are talking about saving lives, and we are  talking about saving jobs. We are talking about boosting the economy.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, money for State and local  government creates the best bang for the buck for the economy from any  spending Congress is considering.   State and local aid is a policy with a nationwide reach. It would  solve a real, immediate problem. On the other hand, when Republicans  talk about giving corporate indemnity, they are talking about a  solution in search of a problem. To date, there have been 20--only 20- some-odd personal injury lawsuits filed in the entire country.   The bottom line is, one provision solves a real problem in our  country; the other does not. The two sides are not remotely equivalent,  and it is not a trade that makes any sense in terms of the well-being  of the American people.   Now, I know the Republican leader and Senate Republicans want to help  small businesses and re-up the popular PPP to help prevent businesses  from folding and American workers from being laid off. So do I. So do  Democrats. Well, guess what. State and local relief is also about  American workers  [[Page S7382]]  getting laid off too. If you want PPP so small businesses don't lay off  people, why wouldn't you want State and local aid so governments don't  lay off people? They are the same people who need to feed their  families, pay their rent, pay their mortgage, and get on with life.   State and local relief is about American workers getting laid off. It  is about firefighters getting laid off. It is about first responders  getting laid off. It is about teachers getting laid off, busdrivers,  sanitation workers, essential employees--men and women who have been  working since the pandemic began and risking their lives to keep our  country moving. It is impossible to imagine any community in this  country functioning without them.   And this morning we learned that an additional 1.4 million Americans  filed new unemployment claims--a huge spike from the previous week. If  you want to save jobs, if you want to make sure those numbers don't go  up, we need PPP for small businesses, and we need State and local aid  for our governments because both aid those entities and prevent people  from being laid off and unemployment from going up.   The liability provisions of the leader have nothing to do with that  and in fact only affect a very small number of lawsuits.   So if we are going to be here on the floor and talking about saving  jobs, we have to talk about saving the jobs of essential public  employees. They deserve our help too. They are no different than anyone  else, whether they are in a red State or a blue State.    Make no mistake, right now there is one person--just one person-- standing in the way, and that is Leader McConnell.                            Presidential Election    Madam President, now on another matter, despite the fact that the  Presidential election ended well over a month ago and that, by now,  every single State in the country and the District of Columbia has  certified results, there are still many on the political right who  refuse to accept reality.   Today, amazingly enough, 17 Republican attorneys general will meet  with President Trump to discuss their desperate and wildly  irresponsible lawsuit, which aims to literally overturn the will of the  people on the grounds they didn't like the results.   This has gone beyond ridiculous. No court in this country has found  any of President Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud credible. No  serious State election official, Democrat or Republican, has found them  credible. Even the Trump administration's Justice Department, so  browbeaten into political activities over the past 4 years, has not  found a scrap of evidence that would affect the final result.   Yet, rather than accept the simple truth that Joe Biden will be the  next President of the United States, there are actually sitting  Senators and Congress Members who prefer to undermine our democracy by  indulging President Trump's wild conspiracy theories about a stolen  election.   Here in the Senate, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee  announced yesterday that next week he will convene a hearing on  ``election irregularities.'' When is this nonsense, detrimental to our  democracy, going to end? When?   It is already deeply irresponsible for my Republican colleagues, many  of them, to stay silent about President Trump's deliberate attempts to  poison Americans' faith in our elections. It is deeply irresponsible  that there hasn't been a full-throated defense of the validity of our  elections by Republican Senators and the Republican leader, who still  refuse to call Joe Biden ``President-Elect.'' But to go one step  further and use a Senate committee as a platform to spread  misinformation about our own elections is beyond the pale.   So, in conclusion, Chairman Johnson should call off this ridiculous  charade of a Senate hearing immediately. If he won't, Leader McConnell  should intervene to ensure that the committee does not indulge such  quackery and conspiracy theories, and he should acknowledge the results  of the election and make clear it is time to move on, just as he was  happy to do so when the shoe was on the other foot. Doing otherwise  would add fuel to the fire that is undermining faith in our wonderful  democracy.                            Tribute to Pat Roberts    Madam President, finally, just a note: I, too, want to bid a fond,  fond farewell to the Senator from Kansas, a wonderful guy and a great  guy.   I learned how good he was when we met on the basketball courts in the  House. He set the best picks of anybody. He would quietly sneak up on  you, you would be dribbling or moving, and boom. He knows.   But as good as he was at picks, he was very fine at legislating, and  he is just a fine human being whom I think just about every Member on  this side of the aisle will very much miss.   So, Patty, we wish you and your family the very, very best.   I yield the floor.
