 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an important  athletic achievement in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District.  The North Hunterdon High School women's cross country team won the  State Meet of  [[Page H9572]]  Champions. The North Hunterdon Lions are an historic and distinguished  program, winning seven State cross country championships over the  years.   I commend these young women on their athletic achievement. I can only  imagine how proud their parents and families must be.   It is encouraging that the hard work of these young women has been  rewarded with success. Their perseverance and commitment should be  commended.   I also express my heartfelt congratulations to their coach, Sean  Walsh. With Coach Walsh's steadfast leadership, the North Hunterdon  women's cross country team was able to realize its full athletic  potential. And these young women are distinguished academically as  well.   Congratulations to all who were involved.                            ____________________
