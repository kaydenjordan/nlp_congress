 Madam Speaker, under the failed leadership of Joe Biden  and Kamala Harris, our Nation faces challenges unlike any we have seen  since the administration of former President Jimmy Carter.   Hardworking Americans are facing an inflation crisis that is driving  up the price of almost everything we purchase. We are facing a supply  chain crisis where people are unable to buy the goods and services they  need to live productive lives.   We are facing a border crisis where our border agents are so  overwhelmed  [[Page H5956]]  that we cannot account for the drugs being smuggled into our country or  stop potential terrorists from entering our Nation. We are facing an  energy crisis where the price of gas has reached a 7-year high and  heating costs are projected to rise over 50 percent as winter nears.   Every one of these crises are the result of policies this  administration and progressive Members of this Congress have pursued  instead of working to help the American people get back on their feet.   It is time to reverse course, cut spending, promote good-paying jobs,  and secure our border.                            ____________________
