 Mr. Speaker, June is Gun Violence Awareness Month,  and I am so tired of watching innocent children being lowered into the  ground.   A week ago, there was another mass shooting in Virginia Beach. The  shooter had a sound suppressor and a large capacity magazine. And it  struck me: these things which gave him an advantage are banned in my  home State of New Jersey. We have one of the lowest rates of gun  violence of any State in America.   Why is that? We have poverty, we have crime, we have mental illness  just like other States, but we also have sensible gun laws.   It has been just over 100 days since the House passed a sensible gun  bill that the vast majority of Americans support. Universal background  checks will save lives. The Senate could pass this bill today, but the  Senate majority leader refuses to hold a vote.   Mr. Speaker, this is what the voters who sent us here are most tired  of: special interests blocking action on what most of us agree must be  done.   It is time for the Senate to give the American people the safety and  common sense that they voted for and, at long last, pass universal  background checks.                            ____________________
