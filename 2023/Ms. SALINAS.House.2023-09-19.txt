 Mr. Speaker, as a proud Latina and the daughter of a  Mexican immigrant, I rise in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month.   September 15 kicked off a month of recognition, celebration, and  reflection. We recognize the struggles and contributions of our  community. We celebrate our ancestry and rich cultures, and we reflect  on the sacrifices Latinos have made throughout history.   Oregon's Sixth District is home to a thriving Latino community. Each  year, more Latinos are starting businesses, raising families, and  putting down roots in our State, however, as our community grows, so  does our need for representation. I am honored to be one of the first  Latinas to represent Oregon in Congress, but that is just the start.   We must break down barriers and hold the doors of opportunity open  for future generations of Latino leaders because we deserve to have our  voices heard wherever decisions are made--not just today, not just this  month, but every single day of the year.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from New Mexico  for her leadership and for yielding me some time.   Mr. Speaker, each year, hundreds of Oregonians die after overdosing  on fentanyl. This drug has torn communities apart, from Salem to  Sheridan and everywhere in between. It is not just our State. It is all  across the U.S.   Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids account for more than 85 percent  of all opioid-involved deaths in the U.S. This is an issue that harms  all of us, and I think Members of both parties can agree that stemming  the flow of these drugs into our communities is a bipartisan  imperative.   The appropriations process is one of our best opportunities to  deliver critical funding to the organizations and agencies on the front  lines of this fentanyl fight.   Yet sadly, this process has been needlessly politicized by far-right  politicians who would rather notch political victories than policy  ones--and this shameful Defense appropriations bill is a prime example  of that.   By attaching anti-LGBTQ2SIA+ and anti-choice riders to this bill,  extremists in this body have turned what should be a straightforward  funding package into a political wedge issue.   That needless politicization is especially concerning, given that  this piece  [[Page H4396]]  of legislation contains critical funding to stop the flow of fentanyl  into our country.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to let politics stand in the way of our  fight against the fentanyl epidemic. As a new Member of this esteemed  body, I did not come here for political gamesmanship. We should all be  prioritizing people over partisanship.   This is an all-hands-on-deck emergency, and I urge my colleagues to  dispense with their partisan antics and focus on passing government  funding legislation that meets the moment and delivers for all of our  communities.
