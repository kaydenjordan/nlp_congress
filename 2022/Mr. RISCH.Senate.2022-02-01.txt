 Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Redox Bio-Nutrients as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for February 2022.   Redox Bio-Nutrients is a world-renowned fertilizer producer based in  the heart of Burley, ID. CEO Darin Moon spent his childhood on a family  farm in Heyburn, ID, before starting a career in soil science. After  several years managing a farm in California, Darin returned to Idaho in  1993 and founded Redox Bio-Nutrients, and in doing so, he achieved his  lifelong goal of using science to produce more nutritious food.   Darin's business acumen and innovative approach have been the  cornerstones of the business' growth. Over the years, Darin's focus on  innovation has earned him seven patents and provided Redox's customers  with high-quality fertilizer that improves their crop yields. Today,  the company supplies agricultural products in over 40 States and 32  countries, serving as a global testament to Idaho's industrious  entrepreneurial spirit.   In addition to employing 19 Idahoans and 14 employees across multiple  States, Darin's commitment to the Burley community is evident in his  service on the Cassia County School District's school board. In 2018,  he helped launch Connect, a district-wide program dedicated to  connecting students in need with mental health resources and free  therapy.   Congratulations to Darin, his family, and all the employees of Redox  Bio-Nutrients, LLC on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the  Month for February 2022. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
