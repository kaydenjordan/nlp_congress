 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for her leadership  and her expertise on the Appropriations Committee. I also thank my  fellow Texan, Ms. Granger, for her work and her leadership on this. And  I thank both of them for working in a bipartisan way because, again, in  support of this continuing resolution, we are here to build consensus,  find common ground, and keep government working for our people.   We need to set aside partisanship and bias, and think about and vote  for what is best for our country. This measure allows us to continue  the conversation while we keep government open and functioning.   This bill will extend several programs that are expected to expire at  the end of the month. For example, it permits USDA to access the full  $30 billion under the Commodity Credit Corporation to assist our  hardworking agricultural producers across the U.S.   It supports our farmers and ranchers through the Market Facilitation  Program.   It extends funding for local community mental and substance use  disorder treatment, which is so important to our communities.   It allows the Census Bureau to continue with the 2020 Census  preparation, which is so important for all parts of the country.   It supports small businesses by ensuring the continuing operation and  funding of SBA loan programs.   It maintains critical disaster and emergency funding.   It supports rural communities by maintaining funding for water and  waste loan programs.   It also supports public health initiatives by extending funding for  community health centers and graduate medical education.   We need to continue working together as Democrats and Republicans,  and working with our Senate folks, to make sure that we get this done.   Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to support the continuing resolution and  continue bipartisanship, and for that, I thank them.
