 Mr. Speaker, this morning I walked by an elementary  school, and I saw parents dropping off their kids. I thought of parents  around the country sending their kids back to school after months of  virtual learning. They want their children to be safe.   But it has been 8 years after Sandy Hook and 3 years after the  shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in my district, we  should be ashamed that we have waited so long and wasted so much time  when we could be saving lives.   We cannot have safe communities until we fix the crumbling foundation  of our gun laws. That is the background check system. Universal  background checks will help keep guns out of dangerous hands. They will  save lives in our schools, they will save lives in our homes, and they  will save lives on our streets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with survivors, with gun  owners, and with Americans of both Democratic and Republican Parties  who support universal background checks by voting to pass H.R. 8.
