 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate is approaching the end of the  debate on a significant piece of spending legislation that includes  funding for the Internal Revenue Service. That is why I have come to  the floor this morning to discuss one of my amendments to this  legislation, which is based on a bill that I have authored, entitled  the Presidential Tax Transparency Act.   It is long past time for the President's tax returns to be released  to the American people. This President has, in effect, thrown in the  trash can a bipartisan, 40-year, pro-transparency tradition in his  having refused to release his tax returns in the course of the 2016  election. This had been a tradition accepted by all liberals and  conservatives across the political spectrum that had dated back to the  post-Watergate era. The President has ended it for reasons as flimsy as  you can get--a made-up story about the President's claim that you can't  release your returns in the course of an audit.   Yet now it is not just a matter of the President's destroying a four- decades', good-government campaign tradition. Week after week, month  after month, there are more questions that swirl about with respect to  financial ties that might skew the President's decision-making about  new foreign deals The Trump Organization continues to strike that  violate the promises the President made to the American people--about  foreign cash coming into his properties here in the United States;  about the astronomical amount of cash taxpayers spend to fund the  President's many visits to Trump-branded properties, essentially  forcing the American people to finance Trump resort ad campaigns.   The episode that left more jaws on the floor than perhaps any other  came a few weeks ago. That is when the President traveled through  Europe for what should have been routine meetings with our longstanding  allies. Instead, the President attacked our closest allies and put on a  performance, while standing next to Vladimir Putin, that few will soon  forget. With a hostile dictator at his side, the President said that  the United States was ``foolish,'' and he threw our intelligence  officials under the bus and refused once again to accept the conclusion  that Russia interfered with our 2016 election. The cleanup he tried to  do a few days later, in my view, was laughable at best.   Following that meeting in Helsinki, people across the Nation were  left to wonder: Does Vladimir Putin have something on the President?  Does the President simply prefer dictators and strongmen to  democratically elected leaders, or does Putin have information or  financial influence that he is exploiting?   There was also the mystery of why this administration, which seems to  stumble from decision to decision, sprang into action to save ZTE--a  company that is a Chinese serial sanctions violator and a tech company  that the experts will tell you is a threat to our national security. In  an open hearing of the Intelligence Committee and in response to my  question, Mr. Evanina--the new point person for the whole question of  counterintelligence and counterterror--said that he still regarded ZTE  as an espionage threat.   For all of the President's tough talk about enforcing sanctions on  countries that pose a threat to Americans, letting ZTE off the hook  after it violated sanctions against Iran and North Korea is just  baffling. It certainly shows signs of weakness. The timing also raised  eyebrows, as the ZTE deal came right after the Trump family secured  valuable trademarks, and a Trump project in Indonesia got a $500  million loan from a Chinese state-owned company.   These looming questions are yet another reason the American people  should not be asked to wait any longer for a chance to see what every  other President has offered in the last four decades--his tax returns.  The American people deserve to see those returns and see if some of the  ``almost impossible to explain'' Presidential judgments over the last  few weeks have been due to what may be in those returns.   So let's be clear. The financial ties between the President, The  Trump Organization, and Russia could be well hidden deep within the  Trump web of business entities. Releasing the tax returns, at least, is  a start with respect to accountability and transparency in the long- held tradition Presidents have followed.   Unfortunately, for the interests of the American people, debate on  the legislation before us has now been cut off. That means that my  amendment, which would call for the disclosure of these tax returns and  transparency and accountability, just as we have seen decade after  decade, will not get a vote, but I intend to keep calling up this  legislation for a full debate. I simply believe this issue is too  important to ignore.   There is a reason we have had this tradition for four decades. This  is the lowest ethical bar for a President. It is not a high one. It is  the lowest ethical bar, and it is not being followed. Members on both  sides ought to be interested in protecting good-government, pro- transparency traditions that stretch back decades.   What a lot of people have wondered is, why is legislation necessary  here? I had held off for months in 2016 even talking about requiring  this by legislation. I had just hoped that then-Candidate Trump would  have done voluntarily what everybody else had done for four decades.  When it was clear he wouldn't, I had said I didn't know of any other  path to get the transparency and accountability the American people  deserve other than through legislation like this.   Nobody in Congress ought to be in favor of keeping the American  people in the dark about what is motivating the President's decision,  and certainly all of us ought to be concerned about protecting against  corruption. Helping Russia undermine NATO and letting sanctions  violators--repeat sanctions violators--off the hook puts American  interests in danger.   The public has a right to know the truth of what is behind those  decisions. Certainly, a part of being able to make those judgments is  having the chance--the opportunity--as we have seen for four decades,  to see the President's tax returns.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I want to  commend our colleague from Maryland and the Presiding Officer for the  good work they have done on this issue.   As a Member of the Intelligence Committee, I have seen firsthand what  this has meant. I had a chance, as my colleague the Presiding Officer  knows, to question Mr. Ervin Nina, who has been chosen Vice President  for a key job in the intelligence field, and I asked him pointblank if  he considered ZTE an espionage threat to this day, and the answer was  yes.   We are now going to spend the next hour talking about Medicare and  Medicaid. This is the 53rd anniversary. But before he leaves the floor,  I wanted to commend my colleague from Maryland and the Presiding  Officer on the Intelligence Committee for their good work.                  53rd Anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid    Mr. President, this week marks the 53rd anniversary of Medicare and  Medicaid, our bedrock Federal healthcare programs.   I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues. I see Senators Cardin and  Whitehouse wanting to participate and know of Senator Coons' support  for these programs. Our colleagues will be talking today about why  these programs are so vitally important to tens of millions of  Americans--literally generations of our people.   Medicare and Medicaid have stood the test of time because the  American people have long understood the value of a healthcare  guarantee, particularly for seniors and the most vulnerable among us.  Medicare--and my colleagues on the Finance Committee talk a fair amount  about it--isn't a piece of paper, and it isn't a voucher. It is a  guarantee, and Americans have always understood that was the case.   It wasn't that long ago when there wasn't a guarantee. Getting older  or falling on hardship meant healthcare was one of the first of life's  necessities to go out of reach. It wasn't that long  [[Page S5485]]  ago when there were poor farms--literally, poor farms--to try to meet  the needs of older people. People, before these programs, often fell  through the cracks and into destitution. Their family wasn't there.  Seniors ended up in the streets or on those poor farms.   These healthcare promises--the pledges behind Medicare and Medicaid-- have lasted for more than half a century because Americans understand  that when they get a paycheck, part of that pay goes to supporting the  health care guarantees.   Families around the country, however, are beginning to wonder, given  the events of the last 1\1/2\ years, whether that guarantee will be  there when they need it. They aren't wrong for worrying. Every major  Republican legislation that has had a pulse in this Congress has  increased the risk that Medicare and Medicaid will not be there when it  counts. Most recently, Trump's tax law stole billions of dollars and  years of security from Medicare's future, all to rain down tax benefits  on the largest corporations and wealthy individuals in the country. As  a result of this reckless tax legislation, shareholders are now  swimming in a sea of tax buybacks and executives have pocketed huge  windfalls while Medicare faces a crisis years ahead of the earlier  projections.   In addition to leaving a gaping hole on Federal balance sheets after  this law passed--I am not sure many Americans know this--the Trump  administration released a budget that outlines in black and white just  how they plan to make up the difference.   You don't have to take it from me. Here are some examples out of the  President's budget document.   On page 52, the President proposes revising the Graham-Cassidy  proposal Americans rejected last year, which would repeal the  Affordable Care Act, including its ironclad preexisting conditions  protection.    On page 53, the President seeks to slash Medicaid by more than $1  trillion over the next 10 years by eliminating the Medicaid expansion  and placing harsh caps on the rest of the program that squeeze out  critical care.   On page 54, the President calls for close to $500 billion in reduced  Medicare spending without an explicit guarantee that seniors will not  be worse off.   On pages 24, 53, and 64, the President calls in his budget for  burdensome paperwork requirements for SNAP--a vital program to help  hungry Americans--affordable housing, and healthcare that really create  more bureaucracy without making people better off.   So, as we begin this, this isn't some sort of message or something.  Those are the pages in the President's budget document--specific  numbers on a specific page in a specific report embraced by the  President that harm Medicare and Medicaid.   I am just going to spend a minute now because I am looking forward to  my seatmates in the Finance Committee coming up on Medicaid.   Medicaid has endured the single most concentrated attack on its  future that I have seen since the days when I was codirector of the  Oregon Gray Panthers. In spite of Republican attempts to slash  Medicaid, people power stopped that effort. Republicans would have  block-granted Medicaid, choking off funding for the program--couldn't  keep up with the needs of our people. Without Medicaid's guarantee, two  of three seniors who count on Medicaid to help pay for their nursing  costs would increasingly have nowhere to turn. People with disabilities  who have been able to live and thrive in their homes and communities  rather than institutions might not have that same kind of opportunity.  Without Medicaid--the promise of affordable care--families and parents  working two or three jobs would face yet another unnecessary obstacle  to the well-being of their kids and families.   Even without the partisan attacks on Medicare and Medicaid, there are  challenges that need to be addressed to keep these programs secure.  Drug prices are out of control while the drug industry pockets billions  every quarter, with consumers and taxpayers footing the bill. A recent  study by the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general  found that while the number of brand-name prescriptions in Medicare  Part D has decreased in the last 5 years, spending on those drugs has  increased by 77 percent during that time. The number of seniors paying  more than $2,000 out of pocket for medicine has nearly doubled. That is  unacceptable. Americans are up in arms at the fact that our seniors  still get clobbered at the pharmacy window.   In the face of these challenges, there are still opportunities to  improve Medicare and Medicaid so that the guarantee is strong for years  to come. Earlier this year, on a bipartisan basis, Congress passed one  of the most significant updates to the Medicare guarantee in a  generation--one that is going to begin the effort to keep up with the  rising tide of seniors managing multiple chronic illnesses, such as  heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.   Chronic illness is going to drive American healthcare, and this bill  begins the effort to improve Medicare so that no matter how seniors get  their care, there will be more opportunities for them to thrive in  later years.   Finally, when it comes to Medicaid, the country is witnessing a  groundswell of Americans who are fed up with partisan gridlock holding  up State decisions to expand Medicaid to help more people walking on an  economic tightrope. One look makes it clear that this is a winning  proposition for any State. When States expand the program, the  uninsured rate goes down. The number of opioid-related hospitalizations  is lowered in expansion States, medical debt is down, and people have  more access to preventive care.   While legislators sit on their hands, people are pushing ballot  initiatives to force the issue. In Maine, where a Medicaid expansion  initiative easily passed, incredibly, the conservative Governor says:  Who cares? He is going to stand in its way.   Healthcare in America is too hard to access for too many. The  Affordable Care Act was a significant step forward. There were ironclad  protections. I am very proud of the fact that it really came from a  bipartisan bill I was part of--air tight, loophole-free protection from  discrimination for Americans, from sea to shining sea, if they had a  preexisting condition. It created a baseline for Medicaid so that fewer  Americans fell through the cracks of patchwork health systems. But for  too many, premiums increase at a far faster rate than their paychecks,  and the price of prescription medicine is still spiking.   We are going to talk more over the next hour about these crucial  issues. I am really pleased that two very thoughtful members of the  Finance Committee are here to start us off. They have long been part of  the effort to stand as a bulwark protecting Americans with debilitating  sickness from financial ruin, supporting the Medicare and Medicaid  guarantees. I am pleased to be able to yield to the Senator from  Maryland who has been involved in these programs and has championed the  cause of the vulnerable for years and years.    Mr. President, before she leaves the floor, I want to  thank my seatmate on the Finance Committee--a strong advocate for the  concept that Medicare and Medicaid are guarantees. They are lifelines  for working families.   It is a pleasure to have you here on this special occasion, and I  look forward to many more partnerships as we start thinking down the  road, as Senator Cardin said, about how we are going to strengthen  these programs, not just play defense against Congress.   I thank you.    Another outstanding member of the Finance Committee,  Senator Whitehouse.    I thank my colleague.   Mr. President, I particularly appreciate the fact that more than  anyone else I know in this body, he keeps coming back to the  proposition of building the healthcare system around paying for value.  My colleague went through some examples in his State and around the  country that are doing just that. That is a big part of what we are  going to have to do to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid in the years  ahead. So I thank my colleague.   We are also so pleased that he has joined the Finance Committee.  Particularly, this argument about paying for values has to be right in  the center of strengthening Medicare and Medicaid. I thank him for it.   Our colleague from Nevada is its former attorney general and is a  champion of the rights of seniors. I am very pleased that she is here  tonight.   I will tell my colleagues that we are all trying to play catchup ball  as we have started running behind.   I really welcome my colleague Senator Cortez Masto from Nevada, and I  look forward to her remarks.    I thank my colleague.   Mr. President, suffice it to say, the Senator is someone who gets  right to the point. She succinctly got to the central question of  ensuring that we build on the guarantee that has been Medicare and  Medicaid. She has been a terrific advocate for seniors. I followed her  work in the State government and have followed it here. We are so  pleased that she is here to be a passionate healthcare advocate for  millions of Americans. I thank her.   To my colleagues, we have three Senators who have arrived on time.  Unfortunately, the Senate is in its usual position of being a little  bit late. We have Senator King, Senator Hirono, and Senator Hassan, if  my colleagues can accept that.   I thank Senator King and look forward to his remarks.    Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I wish to thank  my colleague, particularly, for noting some of the progress over the  years as he makes the case for the future.   I remember years ago, when I was director of the Oregon Gray  Panthers, it was common for a senior to have 15 or even 20 private  health insurance policies that were supposed to supplement their  Medicare. Most of them weren't worth the paper they were written on,  and finally we passed a law to end that incredible outrage.   So my colleague has really said it well about some of the things  that, fortunately, from yesteryear have been changed, but it has  highlighted what we have to do in the future. I thank my colleague so  much.   We have another advocate for our seniors here, the Senator from  Hawaii, Ms. Hirono. I have been with her in her home State and have  seen the bond she has with older people. We very much welcome her for  her remarks.    Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I want  to thank my colleague for an excellent statement. I thank her, in  particular, for her last point, highlighting the proposition that the  administration seems to be considering--after all the boondoggles that  the fortunate few have already gotten, they seem to be considering the  idea of administratively and unilaterally cutting the capital gains tax  to provide another windfall, while, as my colleague said--and I went  sort of page by page in the President's budget--they seek to clobber  Medicare and Medicaid.   The Senator from Hawaii has given us the starkest example of what the  priorities ought to be and what they shouldn't be, and I thank her for  her excellent presentation. I look forward to working with her.   Our last Senator slated to speak this evening is Senator Hassan, a  Governor who knows inside out how these programs work, understands the  federalism aspect of this--the Federal-State partnership, for example-- in terms of Medicaid. She has been working with families in her State  and with families around the country for years and years as an advocate  of these programs. I really appreciate her joining us tonight.    Mr. President, before my colleague leaves the floor, I  want to thank her for her thoughtful remarks in recognizing that as we  talk about the future of Medicare and Medicaid, what we see is a  constant need to update these terrific programs for the times. When I  was director of the Gray Panthers, opioids were not an issue. Today, it  is a dominant force in American life. My colleague is a leader in the  effort to find smart, passionate, cost-effective programs to deal with  those challenges, and I thank her for her thoughtful comments.    I thank my colleague.   Mr. President, I have one brief comment to wrap up. I see my  colleague from Florida here. My colleagues have essentially spent close  to an hour talking about these programs that are literally a lifeline  to millions of Americans, Medicare and Medicaid. As highlighted  tonight, it has always been that we have had to play a lot of defense  to prevent big attacks on these programs--we even saw them in the  President's budget as I went page by page--when what we really would  like to do is play offense and think about the future.   My colleague from Florida is here. He has a very large elderly  population, as many Senators do.   When I was director of the Gray Panthers, Medicare had two parts.  There was Part A for hospitals and Part B for doctors. That was it. If  you had a broken ankle and you went to the hospital, that was Part A.  If you had a horrible case of the flu, you went to the doctor, and you  were taken care of in an outpatient fashion. That is not Medicare  today. Medicare today is chronic illnesses--diabetes, heart disease,  chronic pulmonary diseases. Eighty percent of the Medicare Program is  going to be consumed by chronic illnesses in the days ahead.   Congress has just begun the effort to update the Medicare guarantee  to incorporate those hugely important challenges--cancer, diabetes,  heart disease. Those are chronic illnesses. I close by way of saying  that this update means, again, that the guarantee reaches into every  nook and cranny of our community. That means seniors in traditional  Medicare, seniors who secure their healthcare through Medicare  Advantage, and seniors in accountable care organizations. All of them,  wherever they get their healthcare, ought to be able to secure an  updated Medicare guarantee that addresses the upcoming challenge of our  times, the great challenge of our times dealing with chronic illnesses.   My colleagues have laid out what our job is all about, which is  preventing the effort to go backward, when we like to think about going  forward into the future in a fashion that updates the Medicare  guarantee for all older people and those who look forward to those  years, and protecting the great safety net of our time--Medicaid.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  individuals be granted floor privileges for the remainder of the  Congress: Shae McCulloch and Melissa Dickerson.
