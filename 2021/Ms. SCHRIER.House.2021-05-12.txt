 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Demings for  yielding.   Today, I am honored to pay tribute to law enforcement officers and  their families. Every day, law enforcement officers put their lives at  risk in order to keep us and our communities safe. Most of the time,  they return safely home to their families. But that is not always the  case, and we should never lose sight of that.   In that spirit, I want to express profound gratitude to Deputy Ryan  Thompson from Kittitas County, Washington, who tragically lost his life  in the line of duty in 2019.   Ryan has since been recognized for this sacrifice on the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund for honoring and  remembering Deputy Thompson's service.   I also express my appreciation for the families of law enforcement  officers who live with an undercurrent of worry every day while their  loved one is on duty.   And a very special thank-you to our very own Capitol Police, who  stood up to a violent mob in order to protect us from danger. Several  Capitol Police officers have lost their lives. Please know that we  mourn with their families.
