 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Budget  Committee, my friend, Congressman Jason Smith, for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, COVID relief, here we go again. The left continues to  manipulate the English language however it suits their fancy, lying to  the American people about what is really happening in the swamp.   American Rescue Plan? Please. President Biden is dropping bombs  before anybody is getting checks.   Relief? Where is the relief for moms and dads trying to return their  children to school?   This legislation has more funding for Democrat pet projects than it  does for getting our kids out from behind the screens and back into the  classrooms.   Democrats say this money that hasn't been and won't be spent any time  soon is urgently needed to safely reopen schools. Bull. Many States  have had their schools open for months now. By one estimate, State  departments of education have between $53 and $63 billion in Federal  funds to reopen that is unspent. This bill has another $130 billion,  but only 5 percent would be spent this school year.   Democrats should stop using kids' schooling as a bargaining chip for  more money for teachers' unions. Stop holding our children's education  hostage for your pet projects and your lobbyist friends.   What about our seniors? Where is the relief for those who have  suffered under the draconian leadership of Cuomo, Whitmer, and Newsom?   This legislation uses COVID like cheap drugstore concealer, masking  the nasty truth about Democrat spending. This is nothing more than a  trashy spending spree while doing nothing for those who have suffered  the most from this China virus.   With $1 trillion left unspent from previous COVID bills, only 9  percent of this bill is going to address COVID-related issues. About 45  percent of it won't be spent until 2022 and beyond.   It begs the question: Why would Democrats push such a partisan,  divisive, and, frankly, unhelpful bill?   Mr. Speaker, the answer can be found on K Street, where lobbyists  close to Pelosi, Schumer, and Biden are already chilling the bubbly.                                time  1130    Mr. Speaker, America can see why this legislation will be the first  COVID bill to receive zero bipartisan support. Americans know this bill  will benefit States and unions that have been poorly mismanaged; but on  Main Street, the small businesses will continue to suffer, $90 billion  to bail out private pension plans, $500 billion to States and  localities to keep their economies locked down.   Less than 9 percent of this $1.9 trillion goes to something COVID- related. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood gets funding, pensions get  bailed out, and San Francisco's balance sheets go from red to black. I  have said it before, and I will say it again: Planned Parenthood can go  fund themselves.   If conservatives were in charge, Mr. Speaker, you would see a limited  and targeted relief plan, while enabling businesses and schools to  remain open and reigniting our economy. Look at Florida and Texas, that  have led the way. Never forget, these jobs are essential, and the best  stimulus package is to reopen.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member,   Jim Jordan,  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I was raised in a Democrat home, so I understand how  these policies are deceiving. I understand that we are told guns are  scary. That is what we were told, and that is what we believed, because  we trusted the people who we voted for. But just as with most things in  life, I grew up and learned that there is a better way to live. I was  ignorant to firearms and the proper use of them.    Mr. Speaker, when I became a business owner, I needed to protect  myself. There was an altercation outside of my restaurant, where a man  was physically beat to death. There were no weapons involved. He was  beaten to death by another man's hands.   I have a lot of young girls who work in my restaurant, and we needed  an equalizer. I am 5 feet tall. I weigh barely 100 pounds. I need  something against a stronger potential aggressor to defend myself with.   Talk about women's rights. Don't take my right away to protect  myself.   I mean, seriously, what are we doing here? I ask the supporters of  this legislation, who do you think you are to disarm Americans and  leave them vulnerable without help?   You want to defund our police and yet leave us without a way to  protect ourselves.   Our Founding Fathers gave us a list of items. They said don't touch  these things. And I am telling you, keep your hands off of our Second  Amendment.
