 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, as noted by Secretary of Defense Mattis:         Space is a contested domain by our strategic competitors       just like air, land, and sea.    This dangerous amendment would place our country at a disadvantage  with our strategic competitors by limiting the work that can be done to  continue our efforts in protecting our dominance in space, and,  further, from protecting our homeland from intercontinental ballistic  missiles.   With the significant advances being made today by our adversaries in  key areas, such as hypersonic weapons and expanding nuclear weapon  proliferation, we must not restrict the Defense Department from  pursuing options to deploy directed energy in space or any other  capability that would result in the possibility of boost-phase  capability that could be deployed from space.   This amendment, Mr. Chairman, is against even the possibility of  investigating and going down this road. House authorizers and  appropriators understand the importance of employing a layered missile  defense capability, and this dangerous amendment would significantly  constrain options for developing critical defensive capabilities in a  gap of our current ballistic missile defense system.   A proponent of boost-phase missile defense, General Hyten, the  commander of Strategic Command testified this year that:         The day you can actually shoot a missile down over       somebody's head and have that thing drop back down on their       heads, that will be a good day. Because as soon as you drop       it back on their heads, that is the last one they are going       to launch, especially if there is something nasty on top of       it. I think directed energy brings that to bear, although       such weapons do not yet exist in the U.S. arsenal.    Finally, I would also point out that the issue of space-based  intercept was debated at length last year, passed with bipartisan  support in the House Armed Services Committee, and that the National  Defense Authorization Act last year passed with broad bipartisan  support on the House floor.   This year, the Senate Armed Services Committee has also provided  broad bipartisan support on this critical, technological development  area. Now, is not the time to curtail this emerging potential  capability.    Mr. Chair, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, well, let me just conclude by saying in  opposition, if it hasn't been developed yet, you don't know that it  doesn't work. We have hundreds or even thousands of bright minds. I  appreciate my colleague's credentials, but we have hundreds of  scientists and engineers working in the Missile Defense Agency and at  the government-sponsored laboratories and in other parts of the defense  community in the private sector, and at the Department of Defense in  the government sector, and there are possibilities here that are being  pursued that have great promise, have great potential.   I think it would just be the height of foolishness to cut it off all  right now when there is not even any money being appropriated for this.  It is just even the possibility that the gentleman is trying to cut  off, when we have potential for something that would be helpful to  saving our homeland, and making those who want to rain missiles on us  have to suffer the consequences of those missiles coming back down on  themselves. So we shouldn't foreclose the possibility and shut the  door.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
