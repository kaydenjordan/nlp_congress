 Mr. Speaker, as a third-generation farmer from  California's San Joaquin Valley, I wish everyone a happy National  Agriculture Day, something that we do throughout our country.   I am proud, obviously, to represent the heart of California's San  Joaquin Valley. But our agricultural productiveness throughout the  country, beginning with the very origins of the history of the United  States, has truly been one of the tremendous assets that we have had.   We are home to the most productive agricultural land in the world,  not only throughout the country, but in California. Our farmers, our  dairymen and -women, our ranchers, and our livestock folks feed the  country. I have often said that our food security, that dinner that we  have on our dinner table every night, is a part of America's national  food security.   As a senior member of the House Agriculture Committee, I am proud  that we delivered a comprehensive farm bill last year. Now it is part  of our job to ensure that we implement that farm bill as a safety net  for agriculture throughout the country. But it is also a safety net for  those who are working poor, those who are, unfortunately, recipients of  food assistance programs and the school lunch and the school breakfast  programs. So the farm bill does a great deal to help all Americans.   This year, the Agriculture Committee will work to ensure that those  promises we made in the farm bill will be implemented in the way we  intended. The subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Livestock  and Foreign Agriculture, will be at the vanguard of that effort.   Today, on National Agriculture Day, let us thank those who grow  America's food and fiber and put it on America's dinner table every  night. I am talking about the farmers, the dairymen and -women, and the  farmworkers, who, through their hard work and the fruits of their  labor, make this all come together.                        Visas for Citizens of Portugal     Mr. Speaker, soon, the Portuguese Caucus will be  reintroducing legislation that is important for not only the United  States, but for our ally Portugal. We will be introducing bipartisan  legislation that will allow citizens of Portugal to be eligible for  what is called the E-1 treaty trader visa and the E-2 treaty investors  visa.   Portugal is one of the United States' oldest allies and a close  economic partner. The United States became Portugal's largest trading  partner outside the European Union in 2015. Bilateral trade reached  $4.2 billion in 2015, a 30 percent increase from 5 years ago.   However, because Portugal did not have a bilateral investor treaty  with the United States before joining the European Union, they are one  of only five European Union countries whose citizens are not eligible  for the E-1 and E-2 visas.   This is long overdue. It is good for the United States; it is good  for Portugal; and it is good for increased economic activity between  both countries. It is bipartisan. Hopefully, this year, we will be  successful in implementing these E-1 and E-2 treaty investor visas.            70th Anniversary of North Atlantic Treaty Organization     Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 70th anniversary of the  founding of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   We helped create NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, not  only to protect our European allies, but to protect our interests. For  70 years, it has done just that, a remarkable success.   Next month, in April, we have invited the Secretary General of NATO  to come address a bipartisan joint session of Congress to take  assessment of and to commend our NATO partners, along with the United  States, for a job well done.   How do you say a job well done? Well, after World War II, over the  last 70 years, this is the longest peacetime period in Europe in 1,000  years. Think about that. The last 70 years has been the longest  peacetime period in Europe in more than 1,000 years.   NATO has been one of the cornerstones that has created that peace  dividend, being an absolute and critical barrier against the aggression  of the Soviet Union and other totalitarian states, being there for the  fall of the Iron Curtain. NATO's relevance today is just as important  as it was then.                            ____________________
