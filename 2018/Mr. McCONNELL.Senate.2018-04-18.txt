 Mr. President, the Senate pays tribute this morning to  a beloved American who passed away yesterday.   To our 41st President, her lucky husband, Barbara Pierce Bush was a  beloved wife and partner for more than seven decades. To the American  people, whom she lovingly served as an exemplary First Lady, she was  one of the most respected and well-liked public figures of her  generation. And to the 5 children, 17 grandchildren, great- grandchildren, and all the family Barbara Bush leaves behind at the age  of 92, she was a beloved matriarch. By all accounts, she was equally  capable of building up those she loved most and poking fun at them when  they deserved it. Put simply, Barbara was a founding partner of the  most influential political family of our era.   The epic love story of George Bush and Barbara Pierce began at a  Christmas dance in 1941. The intimacy of wartime love letters beat back  the vastness of oceans, and they married just weeks after George  returned from the Pacific.   George once wrote that his beloved wife has ``given me joy that few  men know.'' Barbara put it this way just a few weeks before her  passing: ``I am still old, and still in love.'' The love story grew and  grew. Eventually, it incorporated the entire Nation.   Barbara embraced the mantle of ``America's grandmother.'' The self- deprecating humor in that title was classic Barbara, but her  plainspoken humility concealed formidable strengths and talents. Even  under all the bright lights and the pressures of public scrutiny, she  always combined wit with warmth, smarts with common sense, and great  toughness with greater compassion. The beneficiaries of these qualities  were many. The cause of literacy, in particular, bids farewell to a  devoted champion, but above all, Barbara's life was defined by love.  She loved her husband and her family. She loved her country, and  America loved her back.   Today, the Senate stands united, as does the Nation, with the Bush  family and their great many friends. We join them in mourning their  loss and in prayer.                     Congressional Review Act Resolution    Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on rolling back  another piece of Obama-era overreach. Just like the historic 15 times  we have already used the Congressional Review Act, the goal here is  simple: We want to protect consumers and job creators from needless  interference by the Federal bureaucracy. Today, thanks to Senators  Moran and Toomey, we can make it 16. We can nullify a particularly  egregious overstep by President Obama's Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau and notch another victory in this Congress's record of rolling  back overregulation.                          Nomination of Carlos Muniz    Mr. President, we will also vote to confirm President Trump's choice  to serve as general counsel at the Department of Education, Carlos  Muniz. This qualified nominee has been waiting for his confirmation  vote since October. I would urge everyone to join me in voting to  confirm him.  [[Page S2228]]                             Coast Guard Authorization Bill    Mr. President, we will also vote today to advance the Coast Guard  Authorization Act. This is an important step for brave men and women  whose work often flies under the radar. Today, as ever, the United  States calls on our Coast Guard to carry out critical safety and  security missions with little room for error. Just last year, Coast  Guard personnel stopped over $7 billion in illegal drugs and contraband  from crossing our borders. They guarded and maintained shipping lanes,  and they risked their lives to lead heroic rescues after Hurricanes  Harvey and Irma.   In addition to authorizing funding for the Coast Guard, this  legislation includes a bipartisan measure that is particularly  important to States with navigable inland waterways, such as Kentucky,  Mississippi, Alaska, and others. I am very proud to have worked with  Senators Wicker, Sullivan, Thune, and Rubio to make sure this provision  was included. In Kentucky, 1,900 miles of navigable waterways are used  to ship everything from agriculture to coal. They support 13,000  maritime jobs, and those jobs support countless others throughout  America--moving food from the fields, energy to homes and businesses,  and exports to market.   Our vessel owners and operators have been saddled with uncertainty.  They have faced a patchwork of overlapping, duplicative regulations  enforced by the Coast Guard, the EPA, and the States. This inefficient  regulatory regime unnecessarily raises costs and jeopardizes jobs.   Our provision, the Commercial Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, would  clean up that mess and make life easier for American mariners and  vessel operators, while still protecting our environment. It would give  them regulatory certainty and a single, uniform, cost-effective  standard enforced by the Coast Guard. This predictable structure will  protect our natural resources, while ensuring that commerce can flow  freely to market.   This provision commands broad bipartisan support. It has been  reported favorably out of the Commerce Committee six times during the  last three Congresses, including when my Democratic colleagues  controlled the committee.   I am glad that this year we have the opportunity to reauthorize  funding for our Coast Guard and deliver this key victory at the same  time.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, on another matter, I noticed that a number of my  Democratic colleagues attended a small protest rally yesterday. It was  right here on the Capitol grounds. Apparently, it was put out by a  number of leftwing pressure groups, including moveon.org, Planned  Parenthood, and Big Labor.   What were they protesting out there? What outrage brought leading  Democrats to join this protest on the east front of the Capitol? It  turns out it was the fact that Republicans let middle-class families  and American small businesses keep more of their own money. That is  right. The Democrats are rallying to repeal the tax cuts. Never mind  that our own pro-growth tax reform has led to thousand-dollar bonuses,  pay raises, educational opportunities, or other new benefits for  literally millions of Americans. Democrats still want to repeal it.  Never mind the new estimate that says tax reform will yield more than 1  million new jobs in the next decade or the fact that jobless claims are  at their lowest levels since--listen to this--1973.   No amount of good news will shake Democrats' confidence that they  know how to spend the American people's money better than the American  people themselves. My friend the Democratic leader said so right here  on the floor a few weeks ago. This is exactly what he said: ``There are  much better uses for the money.'' Really? On average, a family of four  earning a median income will save about $2,000 on their taxes. I don't  think a middle-class family will have difficulty finding good ways to  use $2,000. They certainly don't need a bureaucrat to do it for them.  Maybe they need a new washer and dryer or a new refrigerator. Maybe it  will help them make the downpayment on a second car. Maybe they will  use it to keep up with rising health costs since ObamaCare has utterly  failed to keep costs down for American families. Whatever they choose,  I am glad Republican tax reform is letting hard-working parents keep  more of their own money.   But my Democratic colleagues obviously disagree. They are rallying to  take back--to take back--that family's money so they can spend it  themselves. They are so out of touch that they scoff at $2,000 tax  cuts, thousand-dollar bonuses, and permanent wages increases for hourly  workers. They call them ``crumbs''--``crumbs.'' To be fair, in the  wealthiest parts of San Francisco or New York, maybe $1,000 does look  like a rounding error. We know those are the places our Democratic  colleagues are literally focused on. When President Obama was in power,  Democratic policies fueled an incredibly uneven economic recovery. By  one estimate, the biggest, richest urban areas captured 73 percent of  all job gains.    Meanwhile, millions of Americans in smaller cities, small towns, and  rural areas saw little or no progress. Believe me, after years of being  left behind by Democratic policies, the middle-class Kentuckians I  represent and hard-working Americans all over the country do not see a  $1,000 bonus or a $2,000 tax cut as ``crumbs.''   Democrats protest America's tax cuts, bonuses, and new jobs. They can  protest it all they want to, but Republicans will keep defending  middle-class families.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there is  no objection to the Senate considering an amendment to strike the VIDA  language. We have offered our colleagues the opportunity to vote on  this amendment all week, and if the Senate needs to speak on the  question of whether to include the VIDA language in the Coast Guard  bill, I would welcome that debate and a fair up-or-down vote. There are  many supporters of this language from both sides of the aisle, and I am  confident the amendment would be defeated.   I would ask the Senator to revise his request: That the Senate resume  consideration of the Coast Guard legislation; that the amendment to  strike the VIDA provision be made pending and the Senate vote on the  amendment prior to a vote on the motion to concur with further  amendment.   So would the Senator be willing to modify?    I object.    Mr. President, today Senate Democrats have  filibustered legislation to reauthorize funding for our Coast Guard.   In a dangerous world, the brave men and women of the Coast Guard are  always ready for the call, whether it be to interdict drugs, to secure  our ports, or to conduct daring maritime rescues. They deserve our  support. They don't deserve a filibuster for the sake of political  posturing. So let's have a little plain talk about why the bill failed.    Democrats filibustered this legislation because it contains an  eminently sensible, bipartisan provision to streamline regulations for  the mariners and vessel operators who drive America's maritime economy.  It would cut back on duplicative rules and overlapping enforcement and  provide a uniform standard that protects the environment and commerce  alike.   If this sounds like a commonsense, bipartisan measure, that is  because that is exactly what it is. This legislation has been favorably  reported by the Commerce Committee six times--six  [[Page S2250]]  times--during the last three Congresses, including when our Democratic  friends controlled the committee.   You might think that would be enough around here to get a bill  passed. But earlier today, a number of the very same Democrats who  cosponsored this very legislation, in this very Congress, flip-flopped  under partisan pressure and voted against it. In fact, if all of the  Senate Democrats who are currently cosponsors of this provision had  voted for the bill, the cloture motion would have passed. Let me say  that again. If the cosponsors of this measure in this Congress had  voted for the bill, the cloture motion would have passed. If only those  Democrats who had put their name on this provision would have actually  followed through and voted for it, the filibuster would be over.   Look, our constituents sent us here to stand for their interests. In  landlocked States like Kentucky and Missouri, thousands and thousands  of jobs depend on our inland waterways. In coastal States like  Delaware, Washington, and Florida, major ports enable hundreds of  billions of dollars of U.S. commerce. Of course, the people of Hawaii  rely on shipping for everything from groceries to gasoline.   In all of these States, and elsewhere, I know workers and job  creators were excited about the prospect of reform in this area. How do  I know that? Because, in several cases, they successfully persuaded  their own Democratic Senators to support it--or so it had seemed, until  today.   You know, Americans might be forgiven for thinking that persuading  their Senator to go out of their way and cosponsor a bill would be the  same thing as persuading them to actually vote for it. Apparently,  where several of my Democratic colleagues are concerned, that is simply  not the case because when party leaders came calling and asked my  colleagues to put party-line obstruction politics ahead of their  constituents' best interests, they folded. This is what people don't  like about this town.   Well, my Democratic friends' political priorities may have shifted-- away from the people they are elected to fight for and toward leftwing  pressure groups. But the merits of the issue have not changed, so the  Senate will consider this issue further and will vote on this  legislation again.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today the Democratic leader and I are  proud to reestablish the Senate NATO Observer Group. The group was  originally established in 1997 to provide a focal point for addressing  NATO issues that cut across committee jurisdictions and to help educate  Senators on the issues involved in any decision to enlarge NATO and to  permit close interaction between the executive branch and the Senate  during negotiations on NATO enlargement. Following the Senate's  ratification of the protocols of accession in April 1998, the group  ceased to function until it was reestablished on June 17, 2002. Senate  Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Minority Leader Trent  Lott of Mississippi announced the formation of a new Senate NATO  Observer Group to follow NATO's decision to formally invite additional  new countries to join the Alliance at the Prague Summit. In his floor  announcement, Senator Daschle said the bipartisan Senate NATO Observer  Group would ``advise the full Senate'' on NATO and the next round of  NATO enlargement. The Senate NATO Observer Group remained active  through 2007, but was ultimately disbanded due to a lack of NATO  enlargement rounds.   In arguing for reestablishment of the group, Senators Tillis and  Shaheen wrote to Senator Schumer and I that: ``Exactly 10 years ago  Estonia was one of the first countries to come under attack from  Russia's modern form of hybrid warfare. In 2007, Russia conducted  massive cyber-attacks on Estonia in response to Estonia's decision to  relocate a Soviet Red Army memorial in Tallinn. One year later, as  talks of eventual NATO membership for Georgia were debated, Russia  activated its famed little green men in Georgia, invaded, and  eventually occupied the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  These regions are under Russian occupation to this day.''   In 2014, Ukraine befell a similar fate as Russia instigated a  conflict, resulting in the occupation of Crimea and continued bloodshed  in Ukraine's Donbass or eastern region. Since April 2014, when war  erupted in eastern Ukraine, more than 10,000 people have died, a number  which is steadily rising. Despite successive attempts at international  negotiations and peace, the Kremlin grew more aggressive in its stance  and, in 2016, expanded its malign efforts into Western Europe and the  United States.   During the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections, U.S. intelligence  agencies were able to conclude that Russia interfered in the U.S.  elections using a combination of hybrid tools. A similar pattern soon  emerged across NATO states, where the Kremlin used both cyber attacks  and disinformation to sow chaos and mistrust in Western democracies.  Given these newfound challenges, increased engagement and assistance  for transatlantic security was elevated as a critical priority for the  Senate, as well as successive administrations.   The 2018 Senate NATO Observer Group will mirror the structure and  make-up of previous Senate NATO Observer Groups with eight Members  serving ex officio, the two leaders plus the chairman and ranking  member of the Appropriations, Armed Services, and Foreign Relations  Committees. In addition, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate  Intelligence Committee would also be invited to serve as ex-officio  members. Senators Shaheen and Tillis, both Members of the Senate Armed  Services Committee, would be named the cochairs, and a small group of  Senators active on NATO issues would be named to the group jointly by  the leaders and cochairs.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 361, S. Res. 426.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  amendment to the preamble be agreed to and the preamble, as amended, be  agreed to.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Rules and Administration be discharged from further  consideration of S. Res. 463 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 474, S. Res.  475, and S. Res. 476.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, April 19; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Bridenstine nomination. I further ask that all  postcloture time on the Bridenstine nomination expire at 1:45 p.m.  tomorrow and the Senate vote on confirmation of the Bridenstine  nomination with no intervening action or debate; finally, that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the provisions of S. Res. 474, and do so as a further mark of  respect for the late John Melcher, former Senator from Montana,  following the remarks of Senators Durbin, Inhofe, and Portman.
