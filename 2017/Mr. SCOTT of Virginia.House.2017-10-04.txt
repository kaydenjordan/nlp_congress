 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  Republican budget resolution and its intent to fast-track tax cuts to  the wealthiest Americans and corporations. This resolution, first of  all, is not serious. It assumes $800 billion in savings from the repeal  of the Affordable Care Act, which we know will not happen. We have the  Treasury Secretary being quoted as saying that ``massive tax cuts will  actually reduce the deficit. . . .''   Well, we know how that works. You cut taxes for the wealthy and say  they are going to pay for themselves. When that doesn't work and the  deficit explodes, you come back and demand massive tax and massive cuts  in Medicare, Social Security, and education.   Anyway, the Republican budget resolution, even if it did add up,  makes the wrong choices for America. By calling for trillions of  dollars in spending reductions, the Republican budget undermines  America's investments in infrastructure, the environment, scientific  research, and much more.   I wanted to use my limited time to focus on its harmful impacts on  the jurisdiction of the Education and the Workforce Committee, where I  serve as the Democratic ranking member. Under the Republican budget  resolution, children in need of a healthy school meal, students in  pursuit of an affordable college education, and workers in search of  skills and training to get a better job all take the back seat to tax  cuts to the wealthiest Americans and corporations.    In education, the budget harms students and families by undermining  our Nation's education system, and instructs the House Education and  the Workforce Committee to eliminate $20 billion in investments in  higher education by providing less funding for Pell grants and student  loans.   In terms of other instructions, it instructs the Department of Labor  to reduce funding designed to provide job training, protect workers  from wage theft, and ensure that there is a sufficient number of  inspectors to make sure that workers can come home safely from their  jobs.   The budget also threatens child nutrition programs. In fact, during  the Budget Committee's hearings, it was made clear that child nutrition  programs are a target for savings to pay for tax cuts.   Today, almost 10 million children and 20,000 schools have access to  universal, healthy school meals, where children are served nutritious  meals without the stigma or need for paperwork. Cutting investments in  programs to ensure that children have healthy school meals to partially  fund tax cuts shouldn't be our Nation's goal.   Mr. Chairman, the Federal budget is a statement of our values. Unlike  other Democratic substitutes that responsibly strengthen our economy  and expand opportunity for all Americans, the Republican budget  undermines priorities in which students, workers, and their families  take a hit, and lays the groundwork for a return to a regressive  framework benefiting a wealthy few.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting the  Republican budget resolution.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as  follows:         Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1.

Pursuant to House Resolution 553, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott) and a Member opposed each will control 15  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Congressional Black Caucus  budget, which is a more credible and responsible alternative than the  underlying Republican budget.   The Nation's budget reflects its priorities, but the Republican  budget continues to highlight the wrong priorities. It fast-tracks tax  cuts for the wealthiest Americans and claims that unrealistic economic  growth will pay for these cuts when, in reality, those tax cuts will  ultimately be paid for by children, seniors, and those in need.   It cuts $1.5 trillion from Medicaid and Medicare and also cuts  programs that support basic living standards, including nutritional  assistance, and undermines national security by cutting diplomatic  programs and foreign aid.   The Republican budget also cuts education, job training, research and  development, and infrastructure. Their budget leaves hardworking  American families out in the cold and would devastate our economic  recovery after years of consistent job growth.   The Congressional Black Caucus budget is in stark contrast to the  Republican budget. It is compassionate. The numbers add up. It  addresses the needs of the most vulnerable and improves our economy.  Unlike the Republican budget, the CBC budget uses real numbers, not  overly optimistic growth projections and assumptions of things that  won't happen.   The CBC budget proposes $3.9 trillion in revenue enhancements, and  unlike the Republican budget, we show exactly how Congress can  realistically reach this revenue target by outlining almost $11  trillion in revenue options from which Congress could pick and choose  $3.9 trillion.   With the additional revenue, the CBC budget protects and strengthens  the social safety net and commits the Federal Government to eradicating  poverty in America.   Our budget includes a comprehensive infrastructure and jobs program,  totaling over $1 trillion over 5 years, and according to the Economic  Policy Institute, it will create 2 million jobs next year.   In addition, the CBC budget eliminates any further threat of  sequestration, eliminating the arbitrary budget caps and across-the- board budget cuts that are scheduled for next year.   It allocates $200 billion for hurricane relief, $100 billion to  address the looming pension crisis, and additional funding for our  veterans.   Even with the elimination of the sequestration and strong investment  in programs that we know will create jobs and economic opportunity, the  CBC budget is still estimated to reduce the deficit, when compared to  the baseline, by approximately $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), who is the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), who is the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), who is a member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), the co-chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus' Budget Task Force.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong  support of the CBC alternative budget, and I commend Representative  Scott and his staff for the tremendous work that they have done.   The CBC budget provides for all of the essentials, including defense  and infrastructure, but what I like most about it is that it is focused  on job creation, rebuilding our veterans' hospitals, rebuilding  infrastructure in our communities, and putting people to work.   Mr. Chairman, my constituents need jobs and opportunities to work.  The CBC budget focuses on jobs. I strongly support it, and I urge all  of my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chairman, can you advise how much time is  remaining on both sides?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 7\1/2\ minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Georgia has 5 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds just  to point out that the healthcare plan in the budget is a public option,  which CBO scores as a savings of over $100 billion. We have $1 trillion  in spending for infrastructure, the same as the President has promised,  but at least we pay for it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, as a member of the Budget Committee, I  find the CBC budget to be a principled and thoughtful budget.   It ends the threat of sequestration, it will accelerate our economic  recovery, it will help eradicate poverty in America, and it will reduce  the deficit by approximately $2.72 trillion over 10 years.   On the other hand, the tax cut that our Republican friends are  proposing will cause a deficit by giving a whopping $2.4-plus trillion  in tax cuts, most to the top 1 percent of the American people.   It will not help the young child as he grows to seek opportunities  and jobs. This will be a bill that is at a price that is not right. If  you work hard, you get less.   Our budget, on the other hand, gives $665 billion in immediate  investments to rebuild our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. It is  crumbling even more so after the devastating hurricanes. It gives $120  billion to fund a national direct job creation program and full  employment trust fund program.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. It provides $80 billion to fund the modernization of  schools, $45 billion to fund an energy infrastructure modernization  program, $20 billion to expand access to broadband services, $25  billion for recapitalization, $15 billion for improving and rebuilding  VA hospitals, $25 billion for HUD's Choice Neighborhoods program, and  $5 billion for summer jobs for young people.   I can attest to the fact that, in discussions with the Federal  Communications Commission, the connectivity in vulnerable neighborhoods  and communities is at an all-time low. Expanding broadband services is  a vital need.   It is a vital need to expand the educational services for this young  man in order for him to be capable of taking a job in the 21st century.  There are hundreds of thousands of jobs that go unapplied for because  the skill set of our young people have been deprived because of  inadequate education.   This budget of the Congressional Black Caucus is a people investor.  It invests in people. For that reason, I believe it is the right way to  go. It balances our needs for the military and it provides for the  American people.  [[Page H7832]]    The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has again expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. It, in fact, provides that roadmap to ensure that  the American people are taken care.   I want to make mention that it provides for $300 billion for programs  that are proven instrumental in lifting millions of Americans out of  poverty.   Shouldn't this be what we are doing?   Right now, in my district, thousands are online for the disaster Food  Stamp program. That program needs to be extended.   This is what we do. We do not make people dependent. We give them a  hand up, not a handout. That is what the budget is supposed to be: a  roadmap for opportunity.   I support the Congressional Black Caucus budget, for that is what it  is: a roadmap for opportunity.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Amendment in the Nature of  a Substitute (ANS) offered by the Congressional Black Caucus to H. Con.  Res. 71, the House Republicans' ``Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year  2018.''   I support the CBC Budget for four principal reasons:   1. It ends the threat of sequestration;   2. It will accelerate our economic recovery;   3. It will help eradicate poverty in America; and   4. It will reduce the deficit by approximately $2.72 trillion over 10  years.   Mr. Chair, if we reject the House Republicans' ``Price Is Not Right''  and ``Work Harder to Get Less'' Budget with its discredited economic  gimmicks and unrealistic projections and adopt the CBC Budget, we will  get instead a comprehensive jobs program that would rebuild our  nation's infrastructure and reinvest in our communities totaling $1  trillion over the next decade.   The jobs created will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure  that it reaches every community in America, while also making the  necessary investments to ensure America's long-term economic  competitiveness.   Specifically, the CBC Budget will create jobs by providing:   1. $665 billion in immediate investment to rebuild our nation's  crumbling infrastructure;   2. $120 billion to fund a National Direct Job Creation Program and  Full Employment Trust Fund Program;   3. $8o billion to fund the modernization of schools;   4. $45 billion to fund an energy infrastructure modernization  program;   5. $20 billion to expand access to broadband services;   6. $25 billion for public housing recapitalization;   7. $15 billion for improving and rebuilding V.A. hospitals and  extended care facilities;   8. $25 billion for HUD's Choice Neighborhoods Program and for  communities that desperately need revitalization; and   9. $5 billion for summer jobs so young persons can save money to  attend college and plan for their futures.   Mr. Chair, when it comes to addressing the poverty that is still too  prevalent in our country, the CBC Budget is clearly superior to the  Republican's ``Work Harder, Get Less'' Budget.   The CBC Budget provides for $300 billion for programs that have  proven instrumental in lifting millions of Americans out of poverty.   The funding provided will be used to restore cuts to the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, extend emergency unemployment insurance,  expand access to affordable housing, increase access to quality and  affordable education, and increase funding for job training and trade  adjustment assistance programs.   Additionally, Mr. Chair, to ensure that federal resources are  targeted more efficiently towards eradicating poverty and are actually  reaching communities most in need, the CBC budget proposes the  codification of the ``10-20-30'' policy for federal spending.   Under the ``10-20-30'' policy at least 10 percent of the federal  funds in certain accounts are to be directed to areas that have had a  poverty rate of 20 percent for the last 30 years.   Finally, I support the CBC Budget because it puts an end to the  draconian sequester burdening the economy and our people for the last  several years.   In addition, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget  Office, it will reduce the deficit by approximately $2.72 trillion over  10 years.   Mr. Chair, it is said often, but is no less true, that the federal  budget is more than a financial document; it is an expression of the  nation's most cherished values.   As the late and great former senator and Vice-President Hubert  Humphrey said:         ``The moral test of government is how that government       treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those       who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who       are in shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the       handicapped.''    The Republican budget resolution fails this moral test; the CBC  Budget does not.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting the  House Republicans' budget and voting for a better alternative, the CBC  Budget.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/4\ minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/4\ minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/4\ minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I stand here to  talk a little bit about the Republican budget first. It is a poor  reflection of the values and priorities that we hold dear in America.   Once again, Americans insist on dooming the American people to the  failed trickle-down economics of the Reagan era. The Republican budget  shifts the tax burden away from the wealthiest Americans and larger  corporations and places it squarely on the backs of hardworking middle-  and low-income Americans. This has never helped, and it won't help now.    Not only would the Republican budget increase the national deficit by  $2.4 trillion over 10 years, but it also foots the bill over to the  most vulnerable segments of our community while cutting other important  social safety network programs.   For example, the budget proposes to slash Medicaid by $1.1 trillion  and Medicare for seniors by $487 billion. Nondefense discretionary  spending across the government would also be cut by $1.3 trillion at  the expense of education, infrastructure, clean energy programs,  medical research, and job training.   These are only some of the reasons why I stand tonight with my  colleagues to support the Congressional Black Caucus budget to propose  an alternative to this budget we are facing.   The CBC's alternative budget asks those who have done well in our  country to finally pay their fair share.   Our budget seeks to invest $665 billion to modernize our crumbling  infrastructure.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 15 seconds  to the gentlewoman.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, our budget looks to  invest $80 billion in our children by modernizing our schools and  better preparing our future generations to compete in a global economy.   Mr. Chair, the Republican budget is a poor reflection of the values  and priorities that we hold dear as Americans.   Once again, Republicans insist on dooming the American people to the  failed trickle-down economics of the Reagan era.   The Republican budget shifts the tax burden away from the wealthiest  Americans and largest corporations and places it squarely on the backs  of hardworking middle and lower income Americans.   Not only would the Republican budget increase the national deficit by  $2.4 trillion over 10 years, but it also foots the bill over to the  most vulnerable segments of our population while cutting other  important social safety programs.   For example, the budget proposes to slash Medicaid by $1.1 trillion  and Medicare for seniors by $487 billion.   Non-defense discretionary spending across the government would also  be cut by $1.3 trillion at the expense of education, infrastructure,  clean energy programs, medical research, and job training.   These are only some of the reasons why I stand with my colleagues of  the Congressional Black Caucus to propose an alternative budget  amendment that serves the interests of the greater good, and not just a  select few.   The CBC's alternative budget asks those who have done well in our  country to finally pay their fair share.   Our budget seeks to invest $665 billion to modernize our crumbling  infrastructure.   Our budget looks to invest $80 billion in our children by modernizing  our schools and better preparing our future generations to compete in a  global economy.   Our budget looks to bring $20 billion in new investment to extend  broadband internet to rural areas, so that everyone--not just the  wealthy few--can have access to high-speed internet and access to  information.   Our budget delivers $300 billion over the next decade for social  programs that help provide millions of Americans a basic standard of  living.   This is a reflection of the values and priorities of the American  people, not what is embodied in the Republican budget.   I, for one, do not believe that our nation does well by cutting taxes  for the wealthiest Americans while increasing taxes for the poor.   I do not believe that our nation does well by making massive cuts to  social programs while allowing corporations to hide trillions of  dollars overseas.   I do not believe that our nation does well by destroying Medicare and  Medicaid for our elderly and poor while pushing tax cuts for the top  one percent.   This is not the future that I envision for our country and neither do  the American people--at least not 99 percent of them.   Mr. Chair, the Republican Budget is not a true; reflection of the  priorities of the American people.   This budget serves the interest of a select few at the heavy cost of  exploiting millions of others.   We need to oppose the Republican budget in favor of a viable  alternative such as the CBC Budget Alternative, which is more  reflective of the values that we treasure in our society.                                time  1915     Mr. Chairman, the Congressional Black Caucus  is a more compassionate, fiscally responsible alternative to the  underlying Republican budget and does not rely on unrealistic growth  projections or bizarre suggestions that massive tax cuts can pay for  themselves. It makes our Tax Code fairer, protects and strengthens the  Affordable Care Act, makes college more affordable, and ensures more  Americans are lifted out of poverty. It also improves retirement  security for our seniors.   With these targeted investments, our budget creates 2 million jobs  next year and reduces our Nation's deficit by $2.5 trillion over the  next decade and puts us on a more sustainable path compared to the CBO  projections of our budget. I urge my colleagues to support the CBC  budget.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia  will be postponed.  [[Page H7834]]
