 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to both bills.  However, I am here to talk about the partisan Federal land grab  package.   Last week, my home State of Texas endured a harrowing winter storm  that wiped out electricity and water for millions of Texans. It  devastated homes and businesses and caused irreparable damage to  livestock, crops, and industry production across the State. Tragically,  some even lost their lives.   Our State was under an extreme emergency. Living through that  underscored the need for safe, affordable, reliable energy. We  absolutely must have a reliable baseload for our energy grids and a  level playing field for all forms of energy. The Federal Government  cannot pick favorites in energy.   What happened in Texas should shake our country into the realization  that, as our population grows and our energy needs expand, any move to  limit production will have dire consequences on our safety and our  national security.   Unfortunately, this bill is another step in the vendetta to limit the  American energy production. The partisan $1.2 million Federal land  grab----    Mr. Speaker, the land grab is another Democrat attempt  to restrict our country's abundant natural resources under onerous  regulations that will kill jobs in the energy industry and put  Americans at risk.   This is a matter of national security, and I urge my colleagues to  vote against this bill and to vote for the  [[Page H607]]  safety and energy independence that this country so deserves. Please  join me in voting ``no'' for both bills and both rules.
