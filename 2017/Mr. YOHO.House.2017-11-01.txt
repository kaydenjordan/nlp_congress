 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 422) urging adherence to the ``one country, two  systems'' policy as prescribed in the Joint Declaration between the  Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Government of  the People's Republic of China on the Question of the Hong Kong, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 422         Whereas the People's Republic of China assumed the exercise       of sovereignty over the Hong Kong Special Administrative       Region 20 years ago, on July 1, 1997;        Whereas the Joint Declaration between the Government of the       United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Government of the       People's Republic of China on the Question of the Hong Kong       (in this resolution referred to as the ``Joint Declaration'')       required China's National People's Congress (NPC) to pass the       ``Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of       the People's Republic of China'' (in this resolution referred       to as the ``Basic Law'') consistent with the obligations       contained in the Joint Declaration, which was approved by the       NPC on April 4, 1990;        Whereas relations between the United States and Hong Kong       are fundamentally based upon the continued maintenance of the       ``one country, two systems'' policy stipulated in the United       States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-383; 22       U.S.C. 5701 et seq.) and established by the Joint       Declaration;        Whereas under the ``one country, two systems'' policy       established by the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong ``will enjoy       a high degree of autonomy except in foreign and defense       affairs'' and ``will be vested with executive, legislative       and independent judicial power including that of final       adjudication'';        Whereas Hong Kong's autonomy under the ``one country, two       systems'' policy, as demonstrated by its highly developed       rule of law, independent judiciary, and respect for the       rights of individuals, has continued to make Hong Kong the       preferred residence for over 85,000 United States citizens,       and at least 1,400 United States businesses operate in Hong       Kong;        Whereas the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law declare       that the lifestyle and social and economic systems in Hong       Kong will remain unchanged for 50 years after the 1997       reversion;        Whereas the Basic Law guarantees Hong Kong residents the       freedoms of speech, press, publication, association,       assembly, demonstration, religious belief and activity,       academic research, and the rights to form unions and to       strike, among others;        Whereas the Basic Law also guarantees Hong Kong residents       the right to vote and to stand for election;        Whereas although the Basic Law states that ``the ultimate       aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal       suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative       nominating committee in accordance with democratic       procedures'', the actual process  [[Page H8366]]       for nominating eligible Chief Executive candidates remains       heavily influenced by the Government of China;        Whereas widespread frustration with the lack of progress       toward a democratic selection of candidates for Chief       Executive provoked large-scale public demonstrations in late       2014, popularly known as the ``Umbrella Movement'', that       involved hundreds of thousands of demonstrators and the       occupation of certain public spaces for as long as 79 days;        Whereas, although Hong Kong continues to enjoy high levels       of economic freedom and judicial independence, certain recent       actions by the Government of China are inconsistent with its       stated commitments to Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and       the preservation of the rule of law;        Whereas international press reported that from October       through December 2015, four employees of Mighty Current       publishing house and its affiliated bookstore, Causeway Bay       Books, a Hong Kong seller of publications critical of Chinese       leadership, disappeared under suspicious circumstances from       Hong Kong, Thailand, and mainland China, in potentially the       most serious breach of the ``one country, two systems''       policy since 1997, which has had a chilling effect on the       freedoms of speech and publication in Hong Kong;        Whereas international press reported that--        (1) Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen and the co-owner of       Mighty Current, was last seen in Thailand in October 2015;        (2) The general manager of Mighty Current, Lui Bo, and the       business manager, Cheung Jiping, disappeared while on a visit       to mainland China around October 2015; and        (3) Lee Bo, who holds British and Chinese citizenship and       is a permanent resident of Hong Kong, disappeared from Hong       Kong on December 30, 2015;        Whereas Mr. Lui, Mr. Cheung, and Mr. Lee each briefly       returned to Hong Kong in March 2016 to ask Hong Kong police       to drop their missing persons' cases before immediately       returning to mainland China;        Whereas Lam Wing Kee, another Causeway Bay Books       bookseller, testified before the Congressional-Executive       Commission on China that he was detained by officials in       Shenzhen, China on October 24, 2015, moved to a detention       facility more than 1,300 miles away, and held incommunicado       and subjected to ``endless interrogation'' for seven and half       months, during which he was forced to produce multiple,       coerced confessions of ``selling books illegally'';        Whereas on November 7, 2016, while the Hong Kong High Court       was considering its final ruling to determine if the oaths       sworn by certain Legislative Council candidates were in       accordance with Article 104 of the Basic Law, the Standing       Committee of the NPC issued its own interpretation of Article       104 of the Basic Law in an attempt to foreclose the       opportunity for the legislators-elect to retake their oaths       and assume office;        Whereas that interpretation of Article 104 by the Standing       Committee of the NPC represented the first time it had issued       such an interpretation while a Hong Kong judge was       deliberating on the case in question and only the second time       it had done so in the absence of a request from Hong Kong       authorities;        Whereas according to the Hong Kong Bar Association, that       preemptive interpretation was ``unnecessary and       inappropriate'' and ``created the impression that the       [Standing Committee] is effectively legislating for Hong       Kong, thereby casting doubts on the commitment of the Central       People's Government to abide by the principles of `one       country, two systems' '';        Whereas on November 15, 2016, the High Court ruled that the       oaths taken by Yau Wai-ching and Baggio Leung Chung-hang were       invalid, and barred the two from serving as members of the       Legislative Council;        Whereas on December 16, 2016, then Chief Executive Leung       Chun-ying and Secretary of Justice Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung       filed for judicial review of the oaths taken by Lau Sui-lai,       Nathan Law, Leung Kwok-hung, and Edward Yiu Chung-yim;        Whereas on July 14, 2017, the High Court ruled that the       oaths taken by Lau Sui-lai, Nathan Law, Leung Kwok-hung, and       Edward Yiu Chung-yim were invalid and barred the four of them       from serving as members of the Legislative Council;        Whereas in August 2017, the Hong Kong Government appealed       the original sentences of three ``Umbrella Movement''       leaders, Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow and asked for       prison time after they had already completed their previous       community service sentences;        Whereas the Hong Kong Court of Appeal subsequently imposed       prison sentences on Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow of       six, seven, and eight months respectively, which effectively       bars them from running for political office for five years;       and        Whereas these developments have called into question Hong       Kong's highly developed rule of law, independent judiciary,       and respect for individual rights, which are fundamental to       its way of life and economic prosperity: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) recognizes, consistent with the United States-Hong Kong       Policy Act of 1992, that--        (A) Hong Kong continues to play an important role in       today's regional and world economy, with strong economic,       cultural, and other ties to the United States;        (B) respect for civil liberties, open markets, rule of law,       and judicial independence are all integral aspects of Hong       Kong's lifestyle and social and economic systems; and        (C) the authority of the United States Government to treat       Hong Kong as a non-sovereign entity distinct from China, for       the purposes of United States laws relating to trade,       finance, transportation, economic and cultural exchange,       travel, law enforcement cooperation, export controls, and       other matters, depends on Hong Kong remaining sufficiently       autonomous; and        (2) urges adherence to the ``one country, two systems''       policy established by the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law       with respect to--        (A) Hong Kong's exercise of a high degree of autonomy;        (B) its enjoyment of executive, legislative, and       independent judicial power; and        (C) the robust protection of the fundamental rights of Hong       Kong residents guaranteed by Chapter III of the Basic Law.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Ranking Member Engel for authorizing  this important measure on Hong Kong, the city once known as the Pearl  of the Orient.   I commend the gentleman for strongly advocating for Hong Kong's  continued adherence to the ``one country, two systems'' policy that has  allowed for Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity for so long. I was  happy to join him as an original cosponsor of this important measure.   During a recent trip that I led to Hong Kong, I heard firsthand how  measures like this are helpful in keeping the pressure on Beijing to  keep its commitment to the Joint Declaration.   Twenty years have now passed since the handover of Hong Kong from the  United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. At the time, the U.S.  Congress played a vital role in the continuity of the U.S. relationship  with Hong Kong by passing the Hong Kong Policy Act in 1992. This act  established that the U.S. would treat Hong Kong as a nonsovereign  entity distinct from China on commercial, cultural, and law enforcement  matters so long as it remained ``sufficiently autonomous.''   Since the handover, Hong Kong has continued to be a global economic  force and a financial hub. In recent years, however, it has also begun  to face increased social, economic, and political challenges, including  external pressures.   Mr. Speaker, we saw the Umbrella Movement protest in 2014, which was  led by youth seeking to liberalize the electoral system and introduce  true universal suffrage to Hong Kong in accordance with the Joint  Declaration between Great Britain and China. In the intervening years,  we have witnessed booksellers kidnapped from Hong Kong, Thailand, and  Mainland China; legislator oaths being invalidated; and the jailing of  protest leaders.   For many of us here in Congress, there is growing concern about the  apparent increased role of Beijing in the affairs of Hong Kong.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is important to reiterate here today that  our special treatment of Hong Kong is dependent upon it remaining  sufficiently autonomous. We want to see Hong Kong's highly developed  rule of law, independent judiciary, and respect for individual freedoms  remain as the lifeblood of Hong Kong and its economic prosperity as  guaranteed, again, by China and Great Britain in the Joint Declaration.   Passage of this resolution demonstrates our support for the  continuation of the ``one country, two systems'' policy in Hong Kong,  so I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I, too, want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Engel; Mr. Royce, the  chairman of the committee; Doug Anderson; and, of course, Hunter  Strupp. I chair the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee of the Foreign  Affairs Committee. It has been a bipartisan committee, and to see  everybody come together to work on these different situations, and  different bills and resolutions, it is so important that we project a  unified body.   I would think China, as they move forward, would look hard to honor  their commitment that they made because it is not just Hong Kong they  are influencing. It is all of the other countries in the world, and it  will determine future negotiations on how China, Beijing, honors their  commitment that they made with Hong Kong that the other nations will  look at.   Hong Kong plays an important role in today's regional and world  economy. Its open market and strong rule of law have served as an  example to the region of how freedom and a rules-based society can  foster a positive environment for its people's happiness and  prosperity.   The U.S. has benefited greatly from strong economic cultural ties to  Hong Kong, and I would venture to say, the world has benefited from  that. We want to continue this relationship, but to do so, Hong Kong  must remain sufficiently autonomous. Our President is headed on a 5- country, 12-day tour of the Asia area at the end of the week, and it  will be his first time visiting China as President.   With this resolution, we send a strong message from Congress about  our support for Hong Kong's continued prosperity and special status.  Thus, we urge faithfulness to the ``one country, two systems'' policy,  as established by the joint declaration and the basic law with respect  to Hong Kong's autonomy and its enjoyment of the executive,  legislative, and judicial powers. Hong  [[Page H8368]]  Kong's independent judiciary must be sacrosanct.   In closing, I would like to thank Ranking Member Engel again and the  original cosponsors: Mr. Smith, Mr. Chabot, Mr. Sherman, and Connolly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
