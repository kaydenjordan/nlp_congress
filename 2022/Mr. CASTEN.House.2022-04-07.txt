 Madam Speaker, I want you to imagine a world where the  Republican Party praised the President of the United States for raising  the price of oil by 24 percent. That sounds crazy, right?   Well, that is exactly what happened 2 years ago this month when Trump  threatened to remove U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia unless they cut oil  production.   Oil prices, of course, are not set by the President, but they are a  function of global supply and demand. And when the President pressures  another country to slash supply, the price at the pump and oil industry  profits surge accordingly. That is exactly what happened in April of  2020.   The GOP praised Trump's approach. What's more, nearly 50 of my  Republican House colleagues wrote a letter directly to the Saudi Crown  Prince demanding that he cut crude output. They wanted higher oil  company profits, so they forced a reduction in supply to make that  happen.   Fast forward to today. Those same Republicans who pressured Saudi to  cut oil supply and increase prices 2 years ago are now berating  President Biden for using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to boost  supply, and blocking every effort to invest in energy efficiency and  renewables that would cut our fossil fuel demand.    Why would a party that fought to raise oil prices 2 years ago fight  to raise them again? Because given a choice between your wallet and the  fossil fuel industry, they will always take from you and subsidize  them.   Americans deserve better.                            ____________________
