 Mr. President. I am pleased to reintroduce the Thomasina  E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2017.  Indian Affairs previously voted our bill out of committee in the 113th  Congress and by voice vote in the 114th Congress, and we remain hopeful  that the full Senate will finally vote to recognize our Tribes in the  115th Congress.   This month marks the 400th anniversary of the death of Pocahontas,  the famous daughter of Chief Powhatan, whose tribes were among the  first to make contact with English settlers in the 17th century. Today,  as we introduce this bill, a delegation from the Commonwealth,  including Chief Stephen Adkins of the Chickahominy, Chief Anne  Richardson of the Rappahannock, and Chief Emeritus Ken Adams of the  Upper Mattaponi, is in England to commemorate the anniversary,  including a presentation and ceremony at St. George's Church, Gravesend  to honor Pocahontas.   The ceremony reflects the sovereign recognition that the British  Government grants to our Virginia tribes, which the United States has  yet to acknowledge. This legislation is critically important because it  strives toward reconciling an historic wrong for Virginia and the  Nation. While the Virginia Tribes have received official recognition  from the Commonwealth of Virginia, acknowledgement and officially- recognized status from the Federal Government has been considerably  more difficult due to their systematic mistreatment over the past  century.   More specifically, Virginia's Racial Integrity Act, a State law in  effect from 1924 to 1967, stripped the identities of the Tribal members  of Virginia's Indian Tribes. The act changed the racial identifications  of those who lacked White ancestry to ``colored'' on birth certificates  during that period. In addition, five of the six courthouses that held  the vast majority of the Virginia Indian Tribal records were destroyed  in the Civil War. Those records were crucial for documenting the  history of the Tribes for recognition by the Bureau of Indian Affairs  Office of Federal Acknowledgement.   Furthermore, Virginia Indians made peace too soon when they signed  the Treaty of Middle Plantation with England in 1677. This predated the  creation of the United States of America by just short of 100 years,  and the Founding Fathers of the United States never recognized the  treaty. Therefore, unlike tribes that received Federal recognition upon  the signing of a treaty with the United States, the Virginia Tribes did  not receive Federal recognition because they made peace with England  prior to the founding of our Nation.   I am proud of Virginia's recognized Indian Tribes and their  contributions to our Commonwealth. The Virginia Tribes are not only  part of our history, but they remain ever present today. We go to  school together, work together, and serve our Commonwealth and Nation  together every day. These contributions should be acknowledged, and  this Federal recognition for Virginia's Native peoples is long overdue.   Virginia's Indian Tribes contributed to the successful founding of  our country and continue to help define our national identity. Their  members have attended our schools, worked next to us, and served in  every American war since the Revolution, all while maintaining a unique  identity and culture. I am hopeful the Senate will act upon my  legislation this year, to give these six Virginia Native American  Tribes the Federal recognition that is long overdue.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself and Mr. Tester):   S. 685. A bill to authorize the Dry-Redwater Regional Water Authority  System and the Musselshell-Judith Rural Water System in the States of  Montana and North Dakota, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources.
