 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention  to the alarming spike in crime happening across major cities in our  Nation.   Right now American families are being forced to face an explosion of  violent crime in their streets and in their neighborhoods. After the  riots of the past year which saw the destruction of both public and  private property, and as we undergo one of the worst crime waves in  modern history, citizens are deservedly concerned about their safety  and well-being.   One of the essential functions of our government is to provide  security to all citizens. Yet the Biden administration, after months of  refusing to acknowledge the crime wave, finally addressed it by  claiming that crime is down. That misleading claim couldn't be further  from the truth. Crime is actually skyrocketing, and it is plaguing  cities across the Nation.   Homicides are up 533 percent--yes, 533 percent--in Portland, 50  percent in Minneapolis, 35 percent in Philadelphia, and 24 percent in  Los Angeles compared to the same time in 2020.   On top of that, ambush-style attacks on police officers this year  have increased 91 percent compared to this time last year. When  Democrats defund the police, lawlessness is guaranteed to follow,  complete with more crimes of all kinds, including murder. Left  unchecked, such lawlessness will eventually destroy our Republic.   So how did a nation of law and order become a nation of lawlessness  and chaos in such a short period of time?   Make no mistake, the socialist agenda of President Biden and far-left  Democrats in Congress is to blame. Radical policies like defunding the  police, abolishing prisons, and eliminating cash bail have contributed  to the surging crime wave.   We cannot tolerate vandalism or violence, and we surely cannot  normalize a culture of violence by failing to fully prosecute those who  are working to dismantle our cities. Tennesseans cannot bear much more  of Biden's crime crisis. The solution to countering the crime wave is  clear: we must fund and support our law enforcement agencies across the  country.                            ____________________
