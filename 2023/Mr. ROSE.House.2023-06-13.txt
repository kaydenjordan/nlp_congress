 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of legislation I am  proud to originally cosponsor, H.J. Res. 44, which would strike down  the ATF's unconstitutional pistol stabilizing rule.   Time after time, this administration has shown they show little to no  regard for our God-given rights protected under the U.S. Constitution.  That is why it is no surprise to see unelected agency bureaucrats  pushing for this  [[Page H2873]]  outrageous and draconian regulation that criminalizes firearm ownership  for millions of law-abiding Americans.   Under this rule, many of the service-disabled veterans who rely on  these braces would no longer be able to exercise their Second Amendment  freedoms and right to self-defense.   That is why I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this  legislation and to vote in favor of its passage on the House floor.   ``Shall not be infringed'' means exactly that. Rest assured, I will  always stand against efforts like these to diminish our God-given  Second Amendment rights.                            ____________________
