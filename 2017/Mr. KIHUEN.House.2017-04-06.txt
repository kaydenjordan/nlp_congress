 Mr. Speaker, in 1988, Congress realized the danger posed  by guns that can pass through security checkpoints undetected, and  passed the Undetectable Firearms Act.   The act, signed by President Reagan, has since been reauthorized  under every single President, both Democrats and Republicans alike.   When this bill originally became law, fully plastic guns were science  fiction. But, today, plans for plastic guns are available online and  can be produced at home with no technical expertise. Unfortunately, the  Undetectable Firearms Act hasn't been updated since 1988, and glaring  gaps exist.   That is why today I am introducing the Undetectable Firearms  Modernization Act. This bill will make modest changes to the original  act to more fully adhere to the spirit of the law.   Mr. Speaker, we need to be working to ensure that terrorists and  criminals can't walk through security checkpoints with firearms  undetected.                            ____________________
