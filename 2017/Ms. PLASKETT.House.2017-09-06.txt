 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.   Mr. Speaker, at the end of this summer the people in the Virgin  Islands, in every place of worship, say the hurricane prayer at the end  of their service. And part of that prayer says at the end: But, Lord,  if a hurricane should come, and You loosen the gale and the winds open  on us, Your will be done.   Right now, the people of the Virgin Islands, and the people of Puerto  Rico are fervently saying that prayer because God's will is being done  on those islands as Hurricane Irma is impacting and crashing against  the shores of St. Thomas, St. John, St. Croix, and Water Island.   This $7.8 billion in emergency supplemental funds is a crucial  initial installment to address the effects of not only Hurricane  Harvey, but the effect expected in my district of the Virgin Islands  today as we stand in the potentially catastrophic path of Hurricane  Irma, which is currently, at worst-case scenario, a Category 5  hurricane, the worst hurricane in the Atlantic's history.   This will need assistance from FEMA to perform emergency protective  measures, the removal of debris, activities performed by other Federal  agencies as assigned by FEMA, and to aid small businesses and  homeowners in rebuilding their lives. Right now, the people of the  Virgin Islands are praying for the lives of themselves, their families,  and especially for the roof over their head.   This funding for initial response efforts is critical, and I thank my  colleagues for the expeditious manner in which this legislation was  brought to us for swift passage.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to approve this much-needed  lifeline, and we are covetous for your prayers right now.
