 Mr. Speaker, I am outraged that for the third  consecutive year, an amendment to create a service medal for our Atomic  Veterans has been dropped from the NDAA Conference Report. I find this  particularly shocking as this amendment, which I offered with my  Republican colleague, Congressman Tom Emmer, was approved by the House  unanimously by a vote of 424-0.   It is unclear to me why our colleagues in the Senate are determined  to deprive our Atomic Veterans this most basic recognition of their  honorable service.   Between 1945 and 1962, about 225,000 members of our Armed Forces  participated in hundreds of nuclear weapons tests. These GIs were  placed in extremely dangerous areas and were constantly exposed to  potentially dangerous levels of radiation in performance of their  duties. They were sworn to secrecy, unable to even talk to their  doctors about their past exposure to radiation.   Thankfully, Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush recognized  the Atomic Veterans' valiant service, and acted to provide specialized  care and compensation for their harrowing duty.   In 2007, our allies Great Britain, New Zealand and Australia enacted  their versions of this amendment by authorizing a medal to honor their  Atomic Veterans who served with the United States.   Regrettably, the Pentagon remains silent on honoring the service of  our Atomic Veterans, arguing that to do so would diminish the service  of other military personnel who are tasked with dangerous missions. Mr.  Speaker, this is a pitiful excuse.   Tragically, more than 75 percent of Atomic Veterans have already  passed away, never having received this recognition. They served  honorably and kept a code of silence that most certainly led to many of  these veterans passing away prematurely.   Past Administrations and Congresses have dealt with the thornier  issues of legality and compensation. What remains is recognizing these  veterans' duty, honor and faithful service to our nation. And time is  running out.   I thank my colleagues here in the House for supporting this  amendment. With their continued support, I hope we can convince the  Senate or the Pentagon to finally do the right thing, before it's too  late. We owe it to our veterans to honor them for their selfless  service to our nation.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent on Tuesday,  November 14, 2017.
