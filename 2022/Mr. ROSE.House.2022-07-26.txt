 Madam Speaker, on Thursday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis  will release its second quarter gross domestic product numbers, an  overall measure of our country's economic output from April through  June.   For decades, a ``recession'' has been defined as two consecutive  quarters of negative economic growth. Therefore, if Thursday's second  quarter GDP number is in the negative, then by definition, the United  States economy will be in a recession.   However, that won't stop the White House from doing everything it can  to deny the obvious. In fact, the White House Council of Economic  Advisers is actively trying to change the definition of the word  ``recession.''   In a blog published on July 21 titled: ``How Do Economists Determine  Whether the Economy is in a Recession?'' the White House argues that  ``it is unlikely that the decline in GDP in the first quarter of this  year--even if followed by another GDP decline in the second quarter-- indicates a recession.''   I hope those students who will be taking economics 101 in the fall  are taking notes because the Biden administration is attempting to  change the decades-old answers to the test questions for purely  political purposes.   Instead of President Biden and his administration attempting to bait  and switch the public on the definition of a recession, they should  change course on their policies that are crushing our economy and  creating significant pain for millions of Americans.   President Biden's disastrous economic policies are having a ripple  effect on the housing market, on gas and food prices, real wages, and,  of course, overall inflation. Now, we will find out on Thursday  whether, by definition, we are in a recession.   Madam Speaker, it didn't have to be this way. We didn't have to  borrow and spend ourselves into this mess. The President didn't need to  cancel the Keystone Pipeline. He didn't need to restrict new oil and  gas leases on public lands. He didn't need to create new regulations on  every sector of the economy through the Securities and Exchange  Commission and other bureaucratic government agencies.   Thankfully, the days of complete Democratic Party rule in Washington  are likely coming to an end. The American people are fed up with their  leftwing economic policies and will reject them soundly at the voting  booth in November.    Until then, Republicans like me who stand for fiscal conservatism  will continue to call them out and hope for more accountability.   At the end of the day, the President is responsible for this economic  mess he created. He must do better. If he can't, Republicans will.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, what do Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Kansas,  Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North  Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming have in  common?   They all have populations smaller than the number of illegal  immigrants that have been apprehended at our southern border since the  Joe Biden administration began. We are talking about 3.1 million  migrants in 1\1/2\ years. This is, indeed, a national security threat.   Border Patrol officials encountered more than 207,000 migrants last  month alone. Six, by the way, were on the terrorist watch list.   How many more are making their way here right now? How many will  succeed at slipping through the cracks? How many caravans will it take?  How many needless deaths will occur under this President?   Every month, thousands more will come if this administration doesn't  begin to take this issue seriously. This President must do better.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time this  evening.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 7734, which would require  the Treasury Secretary, upon the request of Congress, to deliver Bank  Secrecy Act, or BSA, reports within 30 days to congressional staff.   Additionally, it would create a similar requirement for financial  institutions to share BSA filings with Congress.   Currently, SARs, or suspicious activity reports, may be viewed by  congressional staff in a reading room at Treasury. Due to the sensitive  nature of these reports, congressional staff are prohibited from  copying the materials and taking them away from Treasury or FinCEN.   There have been several high-profile leaks of SARs over the past few  years. In one instance, a FinCEN employee, who was later sentenced to 6  months in prison, leaked thousands of SARs to BuzzFeed News.   This legislation would increase the number of individuals who have  access to hard copies of these reports and will lead to more leaks, I  fear, of sensitive information.   Having served on a community bank board, I know how subjective SARs  can be, and I fear that this information will put our entire system in  jeopardy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
