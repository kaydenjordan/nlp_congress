 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the  humanitarian crisis that we are facing at this moment in our country.  It is a moral crisis. It is a crisis that didn't come about by some  natural disaster; it has been manufactured by the actions of the Trump  administration and the actions of our President.   Since this past April, over 2,700 children--some of them just  infants--have been forcibly separated from their parents. That is about  45 children every single day. These children have been ripped from the  arms of their parents, in some cases literally. These children have  been imprisoned or deported, and at this very moment, many of these  children are being warehoused. Some of them are put in what amount to  cages, and some of them are being covered with thin, tinfoil-like  blankets that we see handed out to marathon runners.   I know these children are experiencing great fear, great trauma,  wondering where their parents are, wondering what will happen to them,  confused, feeling isolated and alone. They  [[Page S4027]]  are wondering if they did something wrong, and they are wondering what  they did to deserve this. But more than that, we know these children  are enduring psychological damage, which is literally having a physical  effect on their brains. Pediatricians and researchers know trauma like  this creates toxic stress. These children are enduring things that  affect the development of their brains and their life's well-being. The  research is clear. They found that separating children from parents  literally changes the makeup of their brains--this level of cortisol,  this level of trauma. One pediatric expert called the effect of this  kind of family separation ``catastrophic'' on those children.   At this very moment, so many Americans, these children, and others  are wondering what happened to the America that we believe in, that we  know, and that we hale. What is happening to this Nation that has for  so long been a symbol of hope, a symbol of opportunity? How can we be  seeing an America and how can they be experiencing an America that is  so different from what we say we are? Well, the answer to the question,  unfortunately, is painful, and it is direct.   A little over 2 months ago, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary  of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, and President Donald Trump made  the decision to institute what they are calling a zero tolerance policy  when it comes to individuals and families who cross the southern border  without documentation or authorization. The policy dictates that any  adult who illegally crosses the southern border will be subject to  Federal prosecution and therefore placed in Federal custody.   When the Trump administration instituted this policy, they knew  exactly what they were doing. They were concerned, probably, with the  fallout--what this might mean, what people might say--but they clearly  knew, consciously knew what would happen because any accompanying  children could not be placed in criminal detention facilities with  their parents once their parents were charged and detained. The  families would be separated. The forced separation of children and  families was not an unintended consequence of the Trump administration  policy; it was and is a purposeful decision done with full  consciousness of the impact on families and children.   As news reports and photos of this inhumane policy that is shocking  the consciousness of Americans--not left or right, not Republican or  Democrat; it is shocking the consciousness of America--as images of  these actions have spread over the past several days, we have seen the  President and members of the administration try to distance themselves  from the very policy they created. They have even gone so far--and it  is not shocking at this point, but to hear the President out-and-out  lie and try to blame Democrats in Congress, try to blame a Federal law,  try to blame anything and not accept responsibility, when clearly, as  my colleague Lindsey Graham has said, this is something that didn't  come about from this body--this didn't come about because of some  Democrats. Chuck Schumer didn't do this. Nancy Pelosi didn't do this.  This was a decision made by our President that he could stop right now,  as Senator Graham said, with a phone call.   So let's be clear about something. This is a policy. This is a  decision. This is a President who is assaulting--it is moral  vandalism--the values, the common decency of our country, the ideals we  hold dear. This is being carried out by Trump administration  officials--something that can be reversed with a phone call.   So this moment really is a moment of moral reckoning in the United  States of America. It is a low point. It is a heartbreaking point. I am  one of those people who believe that if this country hasn't broken your  heart, you probably don't love her enough. This is one of those  moments, as we have seen in the past, where we will be judged. How we  react in this moral moment--future generations will look back at this  crossroads of conscience in the same way we look back at some of the  most shameful chapters, shameful moments in our history. They will look  back and see what we did, what we said, how we acted, how we stood up,  how we fought, how we demanded during this time.   Today, we look back at the horrors of slavery and the shame of that  time and the way that purposefully fracturing families was used to  terrorize and subjugate Black Americans, how children were torn from  the mothers and sold away, how wives and husbands were violently  separated. We know these acts were not just financial decisions on the  part of slave owners. It was deeper than that. It was this idea of  subjugating, this idea of dehumanizing, this idea that if you so  demonize people and dehumanize them, it makes it easier to victimize  those folks, to assault their dignity, unconscious of the fact that  when you assault the dignity of others, you assault the dignity of  yourself.   Today, we look back with shame and regret at the practice of the  internment of Japanese Americans, the out-and-out violation of our  values and ideals as a country. Our fellow Americans--over 120,000 men,  women, and children--were forcibly removed from their homes and put  into detainment and internment camps.   Today, we look back with deep shame and regret at how Jewish refugees  fleeing from the Holocaust were turned away from our shores, many who  were sent back to Germany and killed by the Nazis.   Today, we look back with shame at the way Native American families  were separated, their children taken and sent to boarding schools where  they were stripped of their language and stripped of their culture.   These were moral moments in our past. Do you know what? We tell  ourselves that if we were in those moments, if we were in those times,  maybe we would have stood up, and so many people of good faith and of  every background did stand up in those times. We think to ourselves  that if we were there in those moments, we would have done something,  we would have acted. We are at that moment, and we are at a defining  moment in our history. We are at a moral crossroads. We are at a point  where our Nation's character is being revealed.   When we look at history, we have seen the ways we have made mistakes,  but we have also seen the truth of our Nation in those periods, the  ideals that we have professed since our founding, the ideals that  generations of Americans have tried to make more real, more perfect,  more established in this Nation. We see in the history how generations  past--Black, White, Christian, Jewish, folks from all different  backgrounds, men and women--stood up and did the right thing. They were  insistent that this Nation should be different.   We were not founded as a country because we all pray alike or because  we all look alike or because we are all the same race. No. We always  strove to be different as a nation, that we would be a nation of ideals  and values, that we would be a nation bigger than the racial or  religious lives that divide men and women, that we would have unifying  ideals and principles, and that we in America would be a light unto  nations.   We have seen this Nation do it right and live up to those ideals with  Hungarian refugees, Cuban refugees, Chinese refugees, and Haitian  refugees, who all fled and found a safe haven here in the United States  of America. Look at the waves of Irish who came to our shores to escape  famine. Look at the waves of folks who have escaped oppression.   When we were at our best, we were a light unto nations--of hope, of  integrity, of honesty, of honor. We are a nation of refugees. We are a  nation of immigrants. We are a nation of exiles. We are a nation of  ancestors of former slaves. We are not our particularistic parts, but  we are a profound sum of those parts. We have made mistakes, but we  have answered the question of who we are by showing our values, and  that is why the United States has become known throughout the planet  Earth as that beacon of light and hope.   I have traveled around the globe with the privileges of a Senator,  and I see the way people look at this country. I see the way people try  to model their behavior after ours. I see the way we talk about  democratic ideals, democratic principles, how we try to talk about  human rights, how we talk about human decency, and how we are held up  as the model.  [[Page S4028]]    This is why Americans from across the aisle, across religions, across  political affiliations, from across the country are speaking out. I  have seen conservative Christian evangelicals, conservative Catholics,  and Republican colleagues of mine stand up and speak the moral truth  about our Nation that this behavior is un-American. They speak with a  chorus of conviction, telling the one man who has the immediate power  to change this, the one man who did this, to stop his actions, to  restore honor, to correct this wrong.   I am proud to see Democrats and Republicans, progressives and  conservatives speaking out against the moral vandalism that is not just  degrading the dignity and humanity of the migrants at our border, but  it is assaulting the dignity and humanity of America--the people of  this country speaking out in one voice, one people understanding that  we have one destiny, understanding that we share common values, and  understanding that this is a time when we can't be silent. The opposite  of justice is not injustice; it often is inaction. It is silence, it is  apathy, and it is indifference.   We must call on our President to end this. If he refuses, then we  have an obligation here in Congress. We have the power; we can and must  act to stop this inhumane, immoral, and un-American practice. We could  vote today on a bill, the Keep Families Together Act, which has the  support of 47 Democratic Senators and 2 Independents--49 Members of  this body. It would prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from  separating children from their parents unless there are extraordinary  circumstances. The bill is common sense. It is a moderate proposal. It  is literally the least Congress can do to prevent this crisis from  continuing.   Yes, we need to secure our borders. Yes, we need to uphold our just  laws. But separating families and imprisoning children are not how we  do that. We need to protect our borders, but we also need to reflect  our values, to protect our values, to affirm the character of this  country. We need to protect and secure the ideals of a nation we have  all stood for. In this moral moment in our Nation's history, that means  protecting and standing up for the dignity and humanity of these  children.   I say again, future generations will look back at this moment, at  this crisis of conscience, and they will see what has already happened.  They will see this as a low moment, and they will wonder what we did  during this time.   History does have its eyes on us, but we have a chance right now to  show them what we did, to let them see, when our morals have been  tested, how we responded. They will look to see what people in this  country did when people were having their values violated and their  ideals and the dignity of their children and families assaulted. They  will look to see what we did. They will look to see if we are silent or  if we speak up--if we are indifferent or if we act. Do we indulge in  apathy or have we become activists? They will look to see whether we  fought for the ideals that made this Nation what I believe it is, which  is, as Elijah called for the State of Israel, to be a light unto  nations. That is the America I believe in. That is the America I know.   We look back on the low of when women were being denied the vote, and  we see a multiracial, multiethnic coalition--everyone from Frederick  Douglass to Susan B. Anthony--come together and build a movement that  propelled this government to act, and women were granted the right to  vote.   We look back on the low of segregation and how a multiracial  coalition of Americans came together, worked together, fought together,  stood together, sacrificed together, and some died together to advance  the cause of civil rights.   We look back at the Japanese internment, and we see how people,  regardless of their background in America, regardless of their  political party, came together to redress this wrong. In 1988, we saw a  Republican President, Ronald Reagan, who responded by signing the Civil  Liberties Act into law and working to right the wrong of Japanese  internment.   Future generations will look back on this moment. They will look to  see whether we affirmed that in America we don't injure and imprison  children; we protect them. They will look back to see that in America  we don't abuse rights; we protect them. They will look back at America  to see if we are called to be a nation, truly, that works to defend  human rights at home and abroad, not violate them in our own backyard.   This isn't an injustice that needs to take decades, years, or even  months to correct. President Trump must, can, and should end this  immoral policy today. If he refuses to act, this body will be judged.  Congress can vote today on the Keep Families Together Act, and we must  act. We must do something; we must stand for something or the dignity  and the humanity that will be assaulted will not be those of children  on our border. It will be damaging to the dignity and the humanity of  us all.   For the sake of our values, for the sake of our Nation, I urge my  colleagues to act.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor Juneteenth  Independence Day, a day that commemorates June 19, 1865, as the date on  which slavery came to an end in the United States. On this day, over  150 years ago, and over 2 and half years after President Abraham  Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Texas became the final  State where the abolishment of slavery took effect.   On this day, we must confront the ugly parts of our history and honor  the slaves who suffered and died under a repressive regime. We must  also pay tribute to all those who had the strength  [[Page S4033]]  and conviction to fight to end slavery and keep our Union together.   Juneteenth Independence Day is also an important moment to recognize  how far we have come and take note of how far we have yet to go. At the  time the Constitution was drafted, Native Americans were referred to as  savages, African Americans were fractions of human beings, and women  were not referred to at all. The genius of our Constitution wasn't its  perfection, but rather that it inspired each generation to expand the  concepts of liberty and freedom and make our Nation's promise real for  more and more people. We must not rest until that liberty and freedom  is real for all people, and this Juneteenth let us all recommit to  helping our country live up to its fundamental promise and highest  ideals.                            ____________________
