 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1311, a bill to  reauthorize the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Trust Fund, which  was introduced earlier today.    I further ask that the bill be considered read three times  and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, this legislation would reauthorize a  Federal foundation, the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation  Act, which was established to honor the legacy of two great Arizonans:  Morris and Stewart Udall.   The Udall Foundation honors the legacy of the Udalls by awarding  scholarships, fellowships, and internships for study related to the  environment and for American Indians and Alaska Natives to study  healthcare and Tribal public policy. The foundation also supports the  Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy and the Native Nations  Institute to conduct research on environmental policy, American Indian  and Alaska Native healthcare issues, Tribal policy, and training.   My predecessor, Senator John McCain, was a longtime supporter of  [[Page S1363]]  the foundation and its work, and the foundation has honored Senate  McCain's legacy through the John S. McCain III National Center for  Environmental Conflict Resolution.   This legislation does not increase authorization levels for the  foundation. It simply extends current levels through the end of fiscal  year 2028 to allow the foundation to continue its important work.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
