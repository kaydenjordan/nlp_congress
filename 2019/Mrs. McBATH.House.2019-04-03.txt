 Mr. Chairman, I will be short and to the point.   The number one way that women in America are being killed by their  intimate partners is with a gun. We cannot address the epidemic of  gender-based violence without addressing gun violence.   The NRA sees it differently. They don't want us to close the  boyfriend loophole. They don't want to keep firearms out of the hands  of those whose actions show that they are a threat. Their solution to  gun violence is by arming women, selling more guns, even though we know  that this would make women less safe.   Nearly 1 million American women alive today have been shot or shot at  by an intimate partner. They deserve better.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act for those we have lost, for those who have  survived, and for the safety of all Americans.
