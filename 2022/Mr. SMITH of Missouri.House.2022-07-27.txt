 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is at a crossroads.   After 1\1/2\ years of one-party Democrat rule, America is on the  brink of a recession, violent crime is on the rise, and our freedoms  are under attack like never before.   Homicide rates across the Nation are up nearly 50 percent compared to  2020. There have been at least 80 incidents of pro-abortion vandalism,  intimidation, and violence since May.   At a time when 85 percent of Americans are concerned about rising  crime rates, the left is pushing to ban one of the most popular  firearms in America. Not only is this reckless, it is a violation of  America's Second Amendment rights.   Our country needs leadership. When the left is in charge, the only  thing Americans get is an attack on our freedoms.   I will never stop fighting for Missourians and our conservative  values.                            ____________________
