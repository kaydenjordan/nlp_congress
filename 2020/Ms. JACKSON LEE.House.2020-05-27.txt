 Mr. Speaker, we are in the backdrop of commemorating  Memorial Day just 2 days ago, when the Nation bowed their heads to  honor the fallen. We did that without question, without equivocation.  But we also acknowledge, and I stand here today acknowledging, the  sacrifice of those heroes, acknowledging that 1,000 veterans, as well,  have lost their lives from COVID-19.   I stand here today to say to America, almost 100,000 of our fellow  Americans, our fellow residents, our mothers and fathers, sisters and  brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, loved ones, and  neighbors, dear friends, classmates, and all around us have been the  victims of COVID-19.   So I speak for the overwhelming number of Americans who say yes to  the HEROES Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask those in the other body and in the administration:  Have you ever seen a headline that said, when a city tried to do its  best, $15 million in rental assistance runs out in 90 minutes--in my  hometown of Houston.   Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to the mayor, thank you to the county  judge. They are trying.   Have you ever seen someone who's never had to beg for food or ask for  food sit in the hot Sun in their car for 7 hours--I have--to be able to  get groceries for their children?   Have you ever seen folks line up to be tested, because they should  have been tested in February, March, but there were no kits?   So working in a public-private partnership with UMMC, I opened seven  testing sites. The first one opened before any governmental site was  opened.   So I say today, that is why I am on the floor supporting $75 billion  in testing, $1 trillion in making sure that brave municipal workers,  firefighters, teachers, and all those who do our work every day, police  and others, are standing and supporting the community.   That is why I am supporting the direct payment, because Chairman  Powell of the Fed said we have to go big.   There are going to ultimately maybe be 36 million people unemployed.  That is why I am supporting rental assistance and mortgage assistance.  That is why I am supporting food assistance.   Mr. Speaker, has anybody seen the faces of these people? Do we not  understand the pain of what they are going through?   That is why I am here on the floor dealing with the support of the  HEROES Act that must be signed by the President and passed by the other  body, the U.S. Senate.                            We Must Demand Justice     Mr. Speaker, I want to pause for a moment and now  come to something that has soaked my very DNA and my soul, and that is  that a young man by the name of Ahmaud Arbery cannot jog in Georgia and  be left to his constitutional rights. They were denied. He was gunned  down for absolutely no reason whatsoever.   It must be addressed. There must be a trial, and there must be  justice. Justice will render not his life back to his family, but it  will render truth.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have written letters, and I  look forward to us organizing a response that I have asked for in terms  of hearing from the victims and their various representatives.   Brianna Taylor was going to be a nurse; Mr. Arbery was going to be an  electrician. She was going to be a nurse. She was doing what Americans  do--sleeping, getting ready for work the next day--and lo and behold,  she was bombarded; she was invaded. And she was the wrong house and the  wrong person, and that person was in custody already.   We must demand justice.   When you have the color of law and when you have those whom you look  to for sanctity and you can respect them when they are doing their  work, you must also--and I ask my fellow lawmakers and, also, law  upholders--stand together.   Now, brother George Floyd, I was up until 2 in the morning with the  pain of the video. George Floyd, his family--he was raised in Houston  in my district--went to Jack Yates High School. There are people  mourning in Houston, Texas. He lived there for 40 years, a gentle  giant, and he was taken away from us by a knee on his neck, crying for  his mama.   There must be charges. They must be brought to justice, even if they  wear a uniform, in order for law and order to be upheld. Everyone is  watching that.   I have had fellow officers send me messages: Outrageous.   My heart is burning; my heart is hurting. I am crying when I heard  him say, ``Mama, Mama, Mama,'' and his brothers and sisters have the  pain of hearing that over and over again.   People were asking, Good Samaritans, saying: Please take your knee  off his neck, his trach. You are choking him. You are killing him.   How can this be?   I quietly say, Mr. Speaker, as I close, God is on our side. We are a  nation of laws and the Constitution. All I ask for these families, all  I ask, is fairness, simple justice, and mercy for these families.   May they rest in peace, those who have gone on, and others, at the  hands of those who should not have brought them down.   God bless you.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California  for his leadership. I thank Mr. Smith for his leadership as well, and  the gentleman from Texas, my colleague, for his leadership; and  listening to the Speaker for her continued years of leadership.   The treatment of Uyghurs in China, which warranted the call for the  Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020, S. 3744, the treatment is of  such volcanic, mammoth proportions that we cannot even describe it on  this floor.   We, in America, take our faith so seriously. We are gratified that  whatever our faith is, and whatever the time that we have for our  particular faith, whether we go to confession as Catholics or whether  or not we take communion, as many faiths do, whether we honor Easter as  a special moment for Christians of resurrection, whether or not we know  the Passover and the specialness of that, or whether as Muslims we know  Ramadan, we are clearly ones that understand how much faith is a part  of our life.   Can you imagine being in a country that brutalizes you because you  practice your faith; keeps you from reading the very book that gives  you faith and inspiration, the Koran, and then, doing the most  dastardly act, which is to separate you from your families?   Of course, many of us know, Ramadan just finished with Eid on  Saturday. Americans who are Muslims had the opportunity to do and  practice their faith and share it with their families without  recrimination and violence.   Just imagine a Uyghur in China, fearful of your life, and not having  the ability to practice your faith; and as one of my colleagues said,  the worst, forcing you to eat pork and continuing to subject you to  penalties and punishment.  [[Page H2299]]    So, I rise to support this legislation because we can do nothing less  but to support the Human Rights Policy Act for the Uyghurs and bring  them out of the terrible tragedy of oppression in China.    Madam Speaker, as a member of the Law Enforcement  Caucus and a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary and  Homeland Security, I rise in support of S. 2746, the ``Law Enforcement  Suicide Data Collection Act,'' which requires the FBI to open a  voluntary data collection program to track suicides and attempted  suicides within local, tribal, state and federal law enforcement.   Information collected and maintained by the FBI will not include any  personally identifiable information.   The legislation also directs the FBI Director to submit an annual  report on the data to Congress and publish the report on the FBI  website.   This program would serve as the principal data collection tool on  suicides and attempted suicides within law enforcement across the  country.   It is altogether fitting and proper that we do this to commemorate  National Police Week, which occurred earlier this month.   Madam Speaker, this legislation reminds us of the enormous strain law  enforcement personnel necessarily endure daily as they try to do their  best to keep our communities safe and healthy.   By providing accurate and detailed information on these suicides and  attempted suicides, more effective prevention programs could be  implemented to save lives.   I urge all members to Join me in voting for S. 2746, the Law  Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer strong support  for the Public Safety Officer Pandemic Response Act and to just take a  little journey down memory lane.   Just 2 days ago we honored the fallen that have sacrificed their  lives for this Nation for our freedom. We could not help many of us who  held Memorial Day ceremonies for the fallen and to acknowledge their  families who at that time, as well, acknowledge the nearing 100,000  mark of those who died from COVID-19.   As a Member of the United States Congress here during 9/11, right  here in this Capitol, watching the billowing smoke from the Pentagon,  hearing about the Trade Center, and of course, about the plane that no  one could find that wound up in Pennsylvania, in all of those  instances, first responders rushed to the scene. They were on the front  lines.   I remember that; heroic actions. But at the same time, I remember, as  a Member of the Homeland Security Committee, the long and arduous  journey, the suffering that these individuals had to go through to  receive ultimate compensation, even just a few months ago, or about a  year ago, reminded of the first responders that were in the Judiciary  Committee pleading again for compensation through the 9/11 bill.   I believe that where we are today is the right direction to get in  front of and to help those who are still on the front lines,  firefighters and techs, law enforcement officers in a variety of  service, they are still there, many of whom started with COVID-19  without the right PPEs, as many of them will tell you. Some who have  already lost their lives. Many that continue to suffer with the  remnants or the effects of COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the sponsors and thank the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler. I want to thank Mr. Pascrell and  Mr. Rose for all of the efforts to get in front, to say that the Nation  does care. Because right now, Madam Speaker, as we are on this floor,  there are emergency workers rushing to someone's home to be able to  take them to a medical facility to save their lives, or they may be in  an emergency room right now. So COVID-19 has not ended. That is why we  are wearing masks. COVID-19 has taken 100,000 lives with no end in  sight.   So I rise in support to be able to provide these lifesaving front- liners the safety net that they need, and the compensation that they  need, in order for us to say more than a thank you, but to acknowledge  and honor them for their service.   Let us hope that we can, as a Nation, follow the instructions of  social distancing, testing, wearing masks, that we can overcome this.  But all the time that we are taking that journey, we will be looking to  these first responders to be on the first line.   Madam Speaker, I thank you for the time, and I ask our colleagues to  support this legislation.
