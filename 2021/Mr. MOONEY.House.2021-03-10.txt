 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor a great West Virginia  icon and U.S. Army veteran, Mr. Dennis Davis, who passed away on  January 19, 2021.   Dennis was the cabinet secretary for the West Virginia Department of  Veterans Assistance. He understood the needs of our veteran community.   Dennis had also been a member of the West Virginia State University  ROTC program. I enjoyed our time together as we met with veterans all  across West Virginia's Second District.   During his lifetime, Dennis was the much-admired director for West  Virginia Workforce Development, an educator who helped guide citizens  toward jobs, opportunities, and fulfillment in their lives.   We commemorate his leadership, his service as an Army veteran, and  his dedication to our great State. May his legacy forever live on to  inspire hard work, devotion, and service.                            ____________________
