 Mr. President, global hegemony is a Chinese Communist  Party's ultimate aim--we all know that--and they have grown  increasingly brazen in their power plays designed to seize that.   The bill before the Senate purports to counter Chinese ambition and  aggression by accelerating, among other things, American investment in  critical technologies, but I believe such investment will fail to meet  the objective if we shortchange America's military. Unfortunately, that  is just what President Biden plans to do.   Yes, amid all the tough talk about China, President Biden proposes  increasing domestic spending by nearly 20 percent while holding defense  spending basically flat. And that is on top of several trillion more he  has proposed in off-budget spending to supercharge the far-left agenda  here at home.   Meanwhile, China is headed in the opposite direction, increasing the  budget for the People's Liberation Army by nearly 7 percent this year.   Don't think for a moment they aren't taking note of President Biden's  plans and sensing weakness and opportunity here because they are. The  Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese leadership, which is the same,  understands and heeds only one thing: strength and power.   A respected and feared American military, I believe, is the bulwark  against the rise of China and the power of China. That is why we must  not shortchange defense spending--not now, not ever. And that is why I  am pleased to join my Republican colleagues in offering this amendment  to ensure parity between increases in defense and domestic spending.   I encourage my colleagues on the other side to join us here in  putting America's security first. Projecting real strength to counter  Chinese ambition and aggression should be a bipartisan objective. We  will see if it is.
