 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition  of Matt Gruda, my senior adviser and someone who has become both a  friend and a confidant.   Matt will be departing our team and beginning a new and exciting  chapter in his home State of Florida, and I would like to take this  opportunity to pay tribute to Matt and the remarkable work he has done  for our team over the past 2 years.   Matt joined our team in 2019, and quickly became an asset to both our  team and our district. His expertise, sincerity, thoughtfulness, quick  wit, and always pleasant demeanor made him fast friends with so many in  our community with a wide range of personalities for sure. He has  touched so many lives, and he has made more of an impact than he  realizes.   Mr. Speaker, I could rattle off a list of wins and crucial behind- the-scenes tasks attributed to Matt, but we would be standing here for  quite a while. So to be brief, I want to thank him from the bottom of  my heart for his many incredible efforts not just for Team Fitzpatrick,  but for so many organizations, schools, businesses, local government  officials, municipalities, and the people across Pennsylvania's First  Congressional District.   Matt does all things with passion, and he has given so much of his  heart to our community. So much of what has been accomplished over the  past 2 years would not have been possible without Matt's contributions.   Matt's drive, determination, positivity, and compassion are a winning  combination and truly a rarity in this world. I believe this is why he  has been and will continue to be so successful in all walks of life. He  recognizes the importance and value in differing opinions and how we  can learn from those who think differently from us; and to produce  success, we often need to think outside the box; and to best serve our  community and our country, we must give everything we have and never  give up. He has led our team for over 2 years in this manner, inspiring  creativity, collaboration, and passion throughout the ranks.   Matt's most admirable quality is his resiliency. I have spoken to  Matt's mom, Zena, who talked about the fact that his road to get here  was full of challenges, bumps, twists, and turns; yet he faces each one  of them with an open mind and looks at them as an opportunity to learn  and to improve and grow better.  [[Page H1743]]    From an early age, Matt's love of baseball was apparent. He would  spend hours and hours practicing and throwing a ball against a wall;  and once on the field, his eyes and smile reflected his unbridled  enthusiasm and deep-rooted passion for the game. On the field, he was  in complete control and nothing else mattered. Simply to be there in  uniform along with his teammates was a great feeling for him.   Then, in seventh grade, he developed a tumor on his spine. After  three extensive surgeries, Mr. Speaker, he was told he could not play  the game anymore. For most kids, that heart-wrenching gut punch would  be a pivotal moment in their life, one in which they would give up in  defeat. But not Matt Gruda. Faced with a challenge and the unknown, he  decided to seize on the opportunity, becoming the youngest assistant  coach and umpire in the history of the league. He confronted his  adversity, not viewing it as a stumbling block, but as a stepping stone  to success. He has continued to build stepping stones to success with  every challenge he has faced.   In speaking with the people who know Matt best, they described him as  someone who does not hold a grudge; someone who is always looking on  the bright side of things; someone who is kind, considerate, and is  always eager to make you smile; someone who is a good friend, a caring  brother, and a wonderful son; and someone whom you would always want on  your team.   I know that I am grateful to have had Matt on our team for the past 2  years. He will always have an honorary spot on our bench. As a mentor,  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today very proud of what Matt has  accomplished and so excited for him to take this next chapter by storm.  He is a bright, talented, and determined young man, and I look forward  to seeing all that he will accomplish in life.   On behalf of our entire team and our entire community, we thank Matt.                            ____________________
