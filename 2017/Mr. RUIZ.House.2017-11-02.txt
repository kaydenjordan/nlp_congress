 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of my bill, the  bipartisan Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017.   I was proud to introduce this commonsense, bipartisan bill with my  friend on the other side of the aisle, Congressman Dr. Phil Roe.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Roe and his staff for their many years of  hard work and advocacy on this issue. I am pleased that our offices  were able to work closely on this bill, building a strong, bipartisan  working relationship.   H.R. 849 eliminates the well-intentioned but misguided Independent  Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, that was created under the Affordable  Care Act.   Everyone can agree that we need to address the high cost of  healthcare and strengthen the solvency of Medicare. However, the IPAB  approach is misguided, because it establishes an appointed and  unelected panel that would have the authority to make cuts to Medicare,  with no accountability to seniors.   Our constituents must be able to hold elected officials accountable  for decisions made regarding changes to Medicare regardless of who is  in power.   What is more, if the board failed to act, the Health and Human  Services Secretary, whether Democrat or Republican, would be able to  singlehandedly make cuts to Medicare.   Fortunately, the targeted Medicare growth rate to trigger IPAB has  never been reached and the board has not yet been appointed. However,  we must act now to ensure that it never happens.   Again, we can all agree that we must address the high cost of care  and strengthen the solvency of Medicare, but we should do this by  addressing the overall long-term cost of care.   I am pleased we are taking action in the House now, and I hope the  Senate can consider this bill quickly. I encourage my colleagues to  join me in passing this commonsense, bipartisan improvement to the  Affordable Care Act and work together to protect and strengthen  Medicare for our Nation's seniors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, we need a hearing on burn pits immediately.   Burn pits are used by our military at bases in Iraq and Afghanistan  to eliminate tons of waste, including chemicals and plastics. They  cause giant clouds of black smoke containing carcinogens.   Thousands of our men and women in our military are exposed to these  cancer-causing hazards. I know because my constituent and friend,  Jennifer Kepner, a 39-year-old wife, mother, and Air Force veteran,  died from pancreatic cancer 2 weeks ago. Her oncologist made the most  probable link between her exposure to burn pits while serving in Iraq  and her pancreatic cancer.   Congress must act. Too many questions remain. Are burn pits still  being used? What are the DOD and VA doing to help veterans who have  been exposed?   On behalf of Jenn and all concerned veterans, I, along with  Republicans and Democrats, demand hearings in the Armed Services and VA  Committees immediately to get answers.                            ____________________
