 Madam President, I want to thank my colleague, Senator  Barrasso, for leading the effort to do what is the obvious thing to do  on the U.S. Senate floor. Here, in a couple minutes, we are going to  vote on one of the most extreme nominees I have ever seen to be  nominated for anything requiring the confirmation of the U.S. Senate.   To be honest, I can't believe we are even really having this debate.  I can't believe that the Senate is going to put forward and vote on an  ecoterrorist. I can't believe the President of the United States, after  maybe not recognizing who he put forward, didn't withdraw the  nomination. And yet here we are.   We know this administration supports far-left groups and certainly  has nominated some far-left nominees for Senate confirmation to  important positions in the Federal Government. But what hasn't happened  yet is--they have knowingly put forward a far-left nominee who has  clearly lied to the Senate, as Senator Barrasso just showed clearly,  who is not just a far-left extremist, she is a violent extremist.   So, normally, you would think in America that would disqualify you  from a position that requires Senate confirmation--a position, by the  way, that is one of the most important positions to my State, the great  State of Alaska.   And yet here we are. Here we are. We are going to vote for her. And  it looks like all my Senate Democrat colleagues are going to vote aye.  Shocking. I hope America is watching because this is a bigger vote than  just for the BLM Director. This is a symbol of how crazy and far left  this administration has gone and, to be honest, how fearful some of my  colleagues are of that.   So I was here on the Senate floor a little over 1 month ago, and I  called on the President to withdraw his nomination to lead the Bureau  of Land Management, Tracy Stone-Manning. It was the first time in my  Senate career I have called on a nominee to be withdrawn before they  had gone through their vote on the Senate floor and vote out of  committee. I have never done that before.   Usually, the President certainly gets to put forward who he or she  wants for positions to fill out his Cabinet and his Federal Government.  That is normal.   I have never done this before, but I have a reason, just like Senator  Barrasso has been coming down on the Senate floor to talk about this,  to actually call for this withdrawal, because we have not confronted  someone with Tracy Stone-Manning's past, which involves being a member  of part of an extreme, radical, violent group that performed violent  acts in the name of getting attention, a violent group engaging in  overt ecoterrorism.   Her past association with ecoterrorism is so heinous that even the  Director of BLM from the Obama-Biden administration said that her  actions should preclude her from consideration, and her nomination  should be withdrawn by the President.   You would think that would have been it. The last Democrat nominee  for that job said she wasn't qualified because of her ecoterrorism  past. That was Mr. Bob Abbey.   I want to talk about BLM for a minute and why I am on the floor again  talking about this issue. This is an incredibly important and powerful  Federal agency, particularly as it relates to my State.   The Alaska BLM manages more surface and subsurface acres in my State  than in any other State in the country, by far. In fact, I haven't done  the math completely, but I believe they manage more acreage in Alaska  than they do in the rest of the lower 48 combined. That is how  important this is.   Let me give you some of the numbers. This includes over 70 million  surface acres of land and 220 million subsurface acres of land in  Alaska. That is the land equivalent to about one-fifth of the entire  lower 48 States. Most States can't even comprehend that size. That is  why this is such an important nominee.   This, of course, is a huge amount of land, and it is a huge amount of  power over my constituents for access to land for our economy, for our  environment, for our Native culture. It is imperative the Director of  this Agency--and I am not going to always agree with the Director of  this Agency--but the Director of the BLM, with so much power and so  much control over Alaska and its future and our working families, be  someone who is, at minimum, trustworthy, honest, fair-minded, beyond  reproach, and certainly--certainly--not involved with an organization  whose mission was to perpetuate violence against their fellow  Americans.   Is that so hard a standard?   This nominee is none of these things. As Senator Barrasso so ably has  presented, and as I mentioned, she was once a member of an ecoterrorist  organization.   Now, maybe she can go work for President Biden in some other  position, but to get Senate-confirmed, given what she has done, and  have U.S. Senators look the other way--it is OK. She was part of a  group that was perpetuating acts of violence against their fellow  Americans to get attention, and we are OK with that? U.S. Senators are  OK with that? My goodness, this is a low bar.   Tracy Stone-Manning was a member of Earth First!--a radical, far-left  group who has engaged repeatedly in what is defined as ecoterrorism.  She wasn't just a member of Earth First!; she was complicit, as Senator  Barrasso just mentioned, putting big metal spikes, thick ones, in trees  that were meant to either threaten to hurt or actually gravely injure  Americans, working families who were harvesting trees in our country  legally and who were putting trees in sawmills legally. This was a  common technique--tree  [[Page S5083]]  spiking, as it was called--deployed by such ecoterrorist groups in the  late 1980s and early 1990s, and it is extremely dangerous.   Let me briefly talk about the group Tracy Stone-Manning was a member  of. Again, we know that this administration is putting forth far-left  nominees with affiliations with certain groups but not violent groups.  That should be a redline that every Senator agrees with.   Earth First! began in 1980 by disaffected environmentalists who  thought the movement wasn't radical enough. They thought the  environmental movement in America wasn't getting enough attention, so  they thought, hmm, let's get more attention by perpetrating violence  and destruction.   The group's slogan is this: ``No Compromise in Defense of Mother  Earth.'' In their view, ``no compromise'' meant destroying property,  putting steel spikes in trees that could kill someone trying to harvest  a tree, and they even celebrated and encouraged such actions. The group  put out a manual--yes, a manual--on their ecoterrorist tactics  detailing tree spiking and instructions on how to cause other sabotage:  Cut down power lines. Flatten tires of vehicles for timber harvesters.  Burn machinery. Again, these are all American citizens who were trying  to do something legally.   We harvest trees legally in Alaska. We have loggers who have been  doing this for generations from hard-working American families. So many  other States in this Senate--represented here in the Senate. I  certainly hope a Senator from one of those States is not going to vote  yes in a couple of minutes here on this vote.   David Foreman was the founder of Earth First! He talked about these  activities, and he said: ``This is where the ecoteur can have fun.''  That is a quote from the founder of Earth First! This is what he called  fun.   This is how an article in the Washington Post from this time  described such an incident of tree spiking that severely hurt one of  our fellow American citizens, and I am going to quote from this  article:         George Alexander, a third-generation mill worker, was just       starting his shift at the Louisiana-Pacific lumber mill in       Cloverdale, Calif., when the log that would alter his life       rolled down his conveyor belt toward a high-speed saw he was       working on.    Now, we have these saws and these mills in Alaska. These saws are  huge, the size of people. They spin at incredibly fast speeds with huge  teeth. They are dangerous to work on normally, but when you think about  hitting a tree going through a mill with a spike in it, you can  imagine, it is an explosion.   Let me continue this article:         It was May 1987, and [George] Alexander was 23 [years old].       His job was to split logs. He was nearly three feet away when       the log [he was working on] hit his saw and the saw [this       giant saw] exploded. One half of the blade stuck in the log.       The other half hit Alexander in the head [again, these are       giant saws] tearing through his safety helmet and [tearing       through his] face shield. His face was slashed from eye to       chin. His teeth were smashed and his jaw was cut in half.    Good job, Earth First! Good job trying to kill a fellow American.  This is what Earth First! did.   I was up on the Yukon River over the Fourth of July at our fish camp  cleaning brush, trees, working a chain saw, and I honestly was thinking  about this. I was thinking, man, I have this saw, a little saw, not one  of these huge things. Think about if you hit a spike   But these were the kind of tactics that Tracy Stone-Manning, the  Biden administration's choice to lead the BLM, once conspired in. Does  that disturb you, America? Does that disturb you, national media? Does  that disturb you, my fellow Senators? It sure the heck disturbs me.  Every U.S. Senator on the floor here should be very, very disturbed  about this.   So what did she specifically do? Again, Senator Barrasso has  highlighted this. She hasn't been truthful to the Senate, by the way.  That is a crime in and of itself. Here is what she did. In 1989, she  did a fellow friend, an Earth First! friend--really a comrade; it is  more of a socialist Communist organization--a fellow comrade a favor.  She rewrote word-for-word a profane, anonymous letter--you saw it here  from Senator Barrasso a couple of minutes ago--from this Earth First!  member about the 500 pounds of tree spikes that they had hammered into  trees in an Idaho forest--by Earth First!, 500 pounds. That is a lot.   She rewrote the letter on a rented typewriter because, she later told  a reporter, ``her fingerprints were all over it,'' so she didn't want  to get caught. So she knew she was obviously doing something criminal.  She didn't just handwrite it; she typed it and then sent the letter to  the FBI. And you saw it is a very disturbing, profane letter where she  threatens people who are going to get hurt. So she is all in. She is  all in.   She kept quiet on this for years, and that was 1989, until she came  forward in 1993, received immunity, obviously had been investigated-- lied about that--for her part in this tree spiking in Idaho.   She has since then portrayed herself as a victim. But a former  criminal investigator for USDA Forest Service--again, Senator Barrasso  laid this out--wrote a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the  Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and here is what he  said:         Ms. Stone-Manning was not an innocent bystander, nor was       she a victim in this case. . . . Ms. Stone-Manning was not       only a member of Earth First!, but she played an active role       in the Earth First! hierarchy.    He described her as vulgar, antagonistic, and extremely anti- government. He said she was uncooperative and refused to provide hair,  handwriting samples, and fingerprints as ordered by the Federal grand  jury. Come on, U.S. Senate, really? You are going to confirm her?   It was only after she knew that she might get in trouble that she  began to cooperate. ``Let me be clear,'' Special Agent Michael Merkley  wrote very recently. ``Ms. Stone-Manning only came forward after her  attorney struck the immunity deal, and not before she was caught.''   In testimony submitted to the Senate, she claimed that the tree  spiking was ``alleged'' but never investigated. That is untrue. None of  this is true.   But here is what is true: She was a member of an ecoterrorist group  who had as its goal to threaten or actually hurt Americans. Americans  were hurt by this, hard-working Americans doing something legally. She  is clearly dishonest, and she has no business heading up the BLM, a  Federal Agency with enormous power, especially over my State.   So this is a really important issue for me, which is why I have been  on the floor talking about it. As I said, the President should have  withdrawn her nomination, and I certainly hope my Senate colleagues  will not vote to confirm her. I don't think any Republican is going to.  But any of my fellow Democrats who live in places where men and women  harvest logs, hard-working American families, it is going to be really  interesting to see how you write those families after you vote yes, if  you do.   So I hope we defeat her vote here today, but I think there is  something else to talk about. As I mentioned, it is one thing to put  forward far-left individuals for these Senate-confirmed jobs. It is  quite another to put forward someone who is far left and violent, with  a record of trying to hurt your fellow Americans.   I think this is a symbol. We know the Biden administration has a lot  of allies in some of these groups, but the fact that the President of  the United States, with all this evidence that has come out--maybe they  overlooked it, but now it is all out--lying, violence. He is still  standing behind her, and it looks like all my colleagues are going to  vote for her. This is a travesty.   I hope all Americans watching ask the proper question. Dishonest,  lying ecoterrorist took action to hurt people, who is now going to have  one of the most important positions of power in America over my  constituents. We need to do better here, folks. If she passes, this is  going to show just how far left the Biden administration is.   Again, I try to be bipartisan here. I have a lot of friends on both  sides of the aisle. But how compliant or scared my Senate Democratic  colleagues are of these radical groups.   Do the right thing, vote no on this nominee, and get the President to  put forward someone else without a violent past who has been honest. We  might disagree with them. But to my Senate Democratic colleagues today,  do the  [[Page S5084]]  right thing. You know what the right thing is. Do the right thing. Vote  to reject this very radical, unqualified, dishonest nominee.   I yield the floor.
