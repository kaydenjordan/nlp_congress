 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of SECURE 2.0. As  a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I thank Chairman Neal and  Ranking Member Brady for their bipartisan work on this legislation that  will help workers save for retirement at all stages of their career and  protect American futures.   This bill includes two key provisions that I was proud to work on,  Retirement Parity for Student Loans Act and the Public Service  Retirement Fairness Act.   The Retirement Parity for Student Loans Act allows workers to make  student loan payments while receiving employer matching contributions  into their retirement plan. This will allow individuals to pay down  student loan debt and save for retirement at the same time.   The Public Service Retirement Fairness Act creates parity between the  public and private sectors, ensuring public-sector and nonprofit  retirement-saving programs have the same access to low-cost investments  as private sector retirement plans.   SECURE 2.0 supports workers at all stages to save for retirement,  helps small businesses create retirement plan options, and builds on  bipartisan success of the SECURE Act passed last Congress.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues that worked in a  bipartisan effort for their work on this vital legislation, and I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes''.
