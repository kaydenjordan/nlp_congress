 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Gold Star Spouse Day.   Today, we honor the surviving loved ones of military servicemembers  who died while serving our country. This day offers remembrance for the  spouses and their families as well as a time of recognition of their  sacrifices.   As an Army dad, I am blessed my son returned home. I am aware that  this is not the case for all families, and we must take the time to  remember, the time to respect, and the time to honor the spouses and  their families of our fallen servicemembers.   Gold Star Spouse Day brings awareness of the sacrifices and grief  these spouses and families have faced in the name of our country.   Mr. Speaker, let us all take a moment to remember that our freedom is  not free. Gold Star families have lost a loved one and paid a heavy  price, all in the name of protecting our freedom. They deserve our  gratitude today and every day.                            ____________________
