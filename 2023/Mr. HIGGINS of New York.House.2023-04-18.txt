 Mr. Speaker, day in and day out, our  dedicated letter carriers and postal workers deliver to America for  America, but processing and delivering the mail should never leave  these workers stranded, threatened, or at risk of losing their lives.   However, that is what appears to have happened during a massive  winter storm that hit Buffalo and western New York in December. After  numerous personal accounts of unsafe conditions for postal employees,  we are calling on the Office of Inspector General in coordination with  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to investigate.   Weather emergencies happen, especially in Buffalo in the wintertime.  We need a clear process to protect America's postal workers when they  do.                            ____________________
