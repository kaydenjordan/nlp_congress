 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the need for the  Freight Rail Workforce Health and Safety Act.   I introduced this bill to give our critical railroad workers 7 days  of paid sick leave. It would allow them to care for their health and  the health of family members without using their vacation time. It is a  benefit enjoyed by millions of American workers every single day. Yet,  for some reason, railroad companies have refused to provide it to  railroad workers, but they do provide it to railroad management.   Our railroad workers should have the right to paid sick leave. They  risked their health and safety to keep food and medicine on store  shelves during the COVID-19 pandemic.   This bill would allow them to take care of their health without  worrying about their income, and I encourage all of my colleagues to  support it.   We have it here in the Congress, our staff has it here in the  Congress. The railroad workers need it as well.                            ____________________
