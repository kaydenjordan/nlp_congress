 Well, Madam Speaker, one more time I will make my  weekly statement with regard to Vitamin D.   The COVID epidemic is on the downslide but, in the most recent week,  we still had 1,600 Americans die.   I call America's attention, and the subcommittee dealing with COVID,  to the fantastic benefits of Vitamin D.   Israeli studies show people who have inadequate Vitamin D levels,  under 20 nanograms per milliliter, are 11 times more likely to die of  the COVID. And we have known about this for 2 years now.  [[Page H5325]]    I beg the public health establishment to spend a little bit of time  talking about Vitamin D. I beg the public health establishment to check  for Vitamin D levels when people come in. I have found people with  levels as low as 16 or 4. By taking Vitamin D supplements, it may save  their life.   I point out to the medical establishment that when I talk to the  American people back home and they wonder why this isn't being talked  about, they believe it is because there is no money to be made in  giving a supplement that can cost 12 or 13 bucks at Walgreens. And it  is a sad state of affairs when the American public believes that is the  reason they haven't been educated on this lifesaving supplement.                            ____________________
