 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with a sense of awe and  gratitude that God and the voters have permitted me to be a Member of  this body, the House of Representatives, for the last 30 years. At  least for me, my time here has permitted me the opportunity to earn a  living by advocating policies and programs that I believed would  improve the well-being of the American people and would be consistent  with the ideals and principles of our country, the United States of  America.   I came here after spending 7 years as a senior speechwriter for  President Ronald Reagan as well as 2 years of that in the Reagan White  House as a special assistant to the President. My experiences in the  Reagan White House gave me valuable understandings of many issues of  the day as well as contacts that, over the years, I put to good use.  The longer I have been here in Washington, the more appreciative I am  for the leadership and policies of President Ronald Reagan.   When he left office 30 years ago, our economy was strong; the Cold  War was ending as the Soviet Union disintegrated; and Ronald Reagan  handed over to our generation, a new generation of Americans, a country  with an upward trajectory and with tremendous potential. He restored to  America that sense of optimism that is so much a part of our character.   It was an honor to have served at his side in the White House, and,  yes, I am  [[Page H9686]]  proud to have served with the men and women in this Congress from all  over our country who represented both America's diversity and  dedication to high values.   Yes, looking back, I am disappointed that our government while I have  been here did not achieve all that was possible. But at the same time,  I think both Republicans and Democrats in this House of Representatives  can be proud of what has been accomplished both nationally, and, yes,  what they have accomplished back home in trying to meet the needs of  their people, trying to make sure that their own citizens were served,  thus making America a better place not just from the top down here in  Washington but from the bottom up as well. I know many of my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle care deeply about their own constituents and  have spent so much time, when they could have been with their own  families, helping the families who have elected them to come to  Congress.    I cannot think of a life I would rather have lived, the highs and the  lows; the idealism and the pragmatism; the courage and the weakness;  the disappointments, and, yes, the joyous outcomes that I have seen  here as part of this living institution in its 230 years of legislative  service to the people of the United States.   Since our country's government was established back in 1789, fewer  than 11,000 individuals have served in the United States House of  Representatives.   Davy Crockett was one of them, memorialized as a fierce frontiersman  who later died a heroic death battling for Texas independence at the  Alamo. I found his courage under fire here as a Member of Congress to  be much more inspiring than his accomplishments on the battlefield.   Yes, we should look at Andrew Jackson and Davy Crockett and what  happened between those two. The fact is, Davy Crockett was elected to  Congress as a supporter of Andrew Jackson when he ran for President. In  fact, as a fierce Indian fighter, he was expected to be at Andrew  Jackson's side. Jackson was a man who had won many military battles,  and many of those military battles were fought and his victories were  brought on by the fact that he had a large number of American Indians  as part of his battle group, part of his Army.   He promised those Indians who had fought with him at the various  battles, against other Indian tribes and against the British at the  Battle of New Orleans, that they, too, would be part of our country.  Davy Crockett was there when those promises were made.   Later, when Davy Crockett came here to this body, to this Congress,  and Andrew Jackson betrayed those men and women--those Americans who  happened to be American Indians--when he betrayed them, Davy Crockett  would have nothing to do with it. Davy Crockett stood firm, and, yes,  it was memorialized in the Walt Disney series. As we were young, we saw  that. But that did not capture the essence of what happened at that  time.   David Crockett, the man who was the Indian fighter, elected there by  the people of his State to come here and support President Jackson,  stood against that President, and he stood for integrity, honor,  courage, and truthfulness. He got up before the Congress and opposed  the Indian Exclusion Act that had been supported by Andrew Jackson.   For that, one would think, that tremendous show of courage, people  would admire David Crockett and say: Look, what a great thing. He is  standing up against a very powerful man with powerful interest groups  even in his own district.   Yes, there were powerful interest groups in his own district who  wanted to steal the land of the American Indians who lived there. David  Crockett, thus, in his next election, was defeated.   Then David Crockett, of course, having been defeated in Congress,  having his own people turned against him and not willing to stand up  with him, went on to Texas where he then, through acts of physical  courage, not just the ones that he exemplified on the floor of the  House, showed the physical courage at the Battle of the Alamo.   As I say, we Americans should take at least as much pride, if not  more pride, in that stand that he took in Congress against the Indian  Exclusion Act, which was a betrayal of the American Indians.   When I got to Congress, I looked for the speech that David Crockett  gave. I could not find it in the Congressional Record. I could not find  it anywhere. Apparently, Andrew Jackson or some powerful person had  actually pushed that aside so people wouldn't be able to find it.   I had my staff look for it and finally found a copy in the Library of  Congress. I had my staff give that to me. It was a rendition of that  speech that Davy Crockett gave, and I had that put into the  Congressional Record.   During my time here in the people's House, as we like to call  ourselves, I am proud that I, too, have stood against the tide when it  was sweeping in the wrong direction. Yes, when you stand against the  tide, when you stand against a direction in which people are making a  profit, sometimes people whose egos are at stake on certain issues, you  make enemies.   But I have always thought, and I believe even to this day, Members of  Congress should not be afraid to make enemies, because if you are  making an enemy, yes, you may have to suffer some personal  consequences. But if you aren't making some people, even powerful  people, mad at you, you are not doing your job. You are not going to  change things.   It is much better for people to stand up and take that punishment,  because what the American people want us to do is to stand up for  principle and what we think is right. If we later lose, we have done  what we thought was right.   I would love and hope that, someday, I do something that would make  me have any type of recognition as someone who did take several stands  while a Member of Congress that added great difficulty to my life. Most  recently, I have felt that.    During the time that I was with Ronald Reagan and before, I had a  position--as Davy Crockett did as an Indian fighter--I was in a  position as one of the fierce warriors of the Cold War. I was never in  the U.S. military, but I did do things in Vietnam during the Vietnam  war and behind the Iron Curtain as well as other activities that I did  to fight against communism.   During my time in the Reagan White House, I worked with the President  on many of his bold statements and worked with people in developing  what they call the Reagan Doctrine, which enabled our country to defeat  the Soviet Union and bring it down without having a direct conflict  between U.S. troops and Soviet troops. I thought that was a tremendous  accomplishment. I am proud to have been part of the development of that  doctrine, and I brought that knowledge with me here to Congress.   But after the fall of communism, after the disintegration of the  Soviet Union, I believed that it was time that we were working for  peace. Ronald Reagan always talked about peace through strength. The  goal was not strength; the goal was peace.   I felt that we needed to go and reach out to try to find ways of  working with Russia and to try to meet more of our mutually beneficial  goals, but also goals that would be achievable and helpful to the  entire world. We needed to do that, and Russia was in turmoil.   I might just note that there were some people who didn't share my  desire to try to bring Russia into the family of nations and wanted to  continue to treat Russia as a pariah and also try to have American  policy be unrelenting hostility toward anything that Russia would do.  Communism was our enemy; the Russian people were not.   Ronald Reagan reached out to Gorbachev. Ronald Reagan did have an  iron fist, and he helped the freedom fighters against those Soviet- backed regimes. But at the same time, he reached out to the Russian  leadership and the Russian people.                                time  1830    Over these last few years there have been very powerful segments here  in Washington, D.C., who want to reignite the Cold War. They want war  with Russia. I have tried to stand firm and be reasonable, but it has  made me very powerful enemies. But I am proud that I made that stand,  and I think the American people want us to cooperate with Russia where  it is mutually beneficial.  [[Page H9687]]    I have been over and over again labeled Putin's favorite Congressman.  That is absolutely absurd. I will say right now I believe that  everything I have ever done in this body has been based on my love of  my country and thinking of what would be good for the people of the  United States. In this case, working with Russia in order to defeat  radical Islamic terrorists who threaten us was the right thing to do.   The same with maybe working with India, Japan, and Russia, and these  other countries. But instead, we have had just, as I say, an  unrelenting effort on the part of some powerful interests to keep  America and Russia in a hostile situation. We should be able to talk to  people and try to work out differences, rather than trying to establish  something that would lead to armed conflict eventually. So I have taken  a lot of hits on that and I consider that to be the right thing to do.   Over the years, of course, I am very grateful for other things that I  have been able to play a role in and actually succeeded in. For  example, when I first came here 30 years ago, we had a Democratic  majority. But later, when we won a Republican majority, I was granted-- and I was in the Science, Space, and Technology Committee--I was  granted the chairmanship of the Space Subcommittee in the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee. That was the prime subcommittee in  science. I oversaw America's space program for 8 years.   I am very proud and grateful that I had the opportunity in those 8  years to make a lasting difference in the way America's space program  has been configured. Before then, it was always just government  employees, bureaucrats, NASA, and military space ventures. There wasn't  a commercial space industry.   I made sure, when I had a challenge of balancing the budget here,  knowing that the way to bring more money was to encourage the private  sector to invest. I worked on and I passed legislation designed to help  promote commercial space activities here in the United States. I am  very proud of what we have accomplished.   But now we have Blue Origin, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic. There are 10 or  20 different space programs that are at work today. And we have vast  plans that are being made by private companies to develop space. For  example, to develop observation of the Earth and monitoring satellites  that will help us. Look at what we are doing with guidance systems now,  our GPS systems, et cetera.   I am very, very honored and pleased and grateful that God gave me and  this Congress gave me in those 8 years the right to be chairman of that  committee and be part of this type of change for the better that now is  reaping good benefits for our country and the world.   I also have been very active while here on science and technology  issues. For example, the patent issue. Many people don't even look at  patents. They yawn when you say it. But the fact is, Americans have had  the benefit of the strongest patent system in the world. And thus our  investors, from the very Constitution where the patent law was written  into our Constitution, have had that benefit of our creative genius and  of our people being protected in order that they can be nurtured. Thus,  the number one development of new technology in the world has come from  Americans.   I have for the last 20 years, at least--maybe 25 years now--been one  to defeat and champion the cause of the individual inventor in America.  American people aren't interested in something that complicated. It is  hard for them to understand that multinational corporations, many of  them headed by Americans, have been trying to undercut the patent  system in our country.   I am also very proud that during my time here and being recognized as  Ronald Reagan's special assistant when I left the White House, my  conservative credentials gave me the authority and gave me the ability  to talk to conservative people throughout the country--and, yes,  throughout the House and the Senate--on the issue of cannabis.   The fact is, marijuana created an illusion of disruption and of  decadence in the American peoples' minds, because in the late sixties  the use of marijuana was so public and it was identified as something  with hippies and people who didn't like American culture.   Well, the fact is, cannabis has tremendous service to give to the  people of our country who are suffering from various maladies. Older  people, senior people, now some of the greatest people, are utilizing  cannabis--that is, marijuana--in order to cure some of the problems  they face as seniors: the aches, the pains, the lack of an appetite,  and things such as that.   We understand that there are children who are suffering, when before,  no one was able to think that cannabis might be a cure for the seizures  of young people; or, who would have ever suspected that this opioid  epidemic, where some people claim the use of drugs and opiates started  with cannabis? No.   What we are finding out now is cannabis is not a gateway door into  the use of opiates. It is instead a way out. It is a way that cannabis  can actually be used to break the addiction of opiates in our country.   These are things where there was never any research done. I am very  proud that, with my conservative credentials, I can talk to a number of  my Republican colleagues to join with almost all of my Democratic  colleagues and vote to permit the States to decide whether or not  cannabis would be legal or illegal in their State for the medical use  of marijuana.   That has brought a great change over the last 6 years since my  amendment--first, the Rohrabacher-Hinchey, then Rohrabacher-Farr--and  now, over these 6 years, it is a $6 billion industry now. That is $6  billion not going to the drug cartels in Mexico. That is $6 billion of  which can be spent helping people, rather than trying to put someone in  jail for consuming a weed, using all the money for law enforcement,  jails, judges' time, and police time, rather than trying to protect the  American people. What a waste.    My colleagues joined with me in that. I think that has been a  wonderful accomplishment that I am very, very proud of and very  grateful that I had the opportunity to be here and express that in  debate and to reach out to my fellow Congressmen here from both sides  of the aisle and mobilize a majority that got that passed so that the  Federal Government cannot supersede State law now, when it comes to  medical marijuana.   Also, one of the things that I guess is something that is people  don't know much at all, but during my time before Congress and during  my time during the Reagan years, I was deeply involved with various  insurgency groups that were trying to defeat the Soviet Union, bring  down the Soviet Union.   Part of that is I was able to get to know the leadership of the  mujahideen who were fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan. In fact, I  went to Afghanistan and I fought with troops and the mujahideen and  fought against Soviet soldiers at the Battle of Jalalabad. Yes, I had  that type of experience.   Later, when our Pakistani friends and our Saudi friends betrayed us  and betrayed the people of Afghanistan by supporting the creation of  the Taliban, a radical Islamic terrorist organization our Saudi friends  and our Pakistani friends created, I continued to go to Afghanistan  during that time period, while I was here in the Congress, and meet  with the warlords that I had met with during the time that we were  fighting the Soviet Union.   One of them, Commander Massoud, who I met on a number of occasions,  was murdered 3 days before 9/11. I knew he had been tipped off by other  contacts that I had in Afghanistan that there was an attack being  planned on the United States. They said: You will know that it is going  to happen when something major happens in Afghanistan that will change  the political balance. It is a signal that the attack will go forward.   I went all over this city when I realized that Commander Massoud was  murdered 3 days before 9/11, that was the signal to move forward on  this attack on the United States. I tried to warn our administration. I  tried to warn everyone in the city. No one would listen.   Then, I had a wonderful thing happen in my life. Actually, after 9/ 11, people did start to listen. Of course, they did. They remembered:  Dana Rohrabacher was trying to warn us about this. And all of this is  happening without public view. The public never saw any of this.   But I was able then to talk to various people in our government at  high levels  [[Page H9688]]  of positions and outline for them how we should proceed. Our own  military, our Defense Department wanted to send 100,000 American troops  or more into a frontal attack--an attack from Pakistan in the northwest  provinces--into Afghanistan.   I was horrified when I heard this. I knew that territory. It is the  most anti-American territory on the planet. Our military would have  been slaughtered or at least holed up in fortress cities like the  Russians had been. It was a horrible thing.   I thank God that I had this opportunity, because I went to the powers  that be and I told them: You can't do this. This is wrong. They said:  What do we do?   I managed to get ahold of General Dostum and other ``warlords'' in  Afghanistan to enlist them, and the President of the United States,  when given the alternative of using the warlords with special forces  teams and U.S. air power versus sending in hundreds of thousands of  American troops, our President chose to use Afghans in what they called  the Northern Alliance, which I helped create with a team of people-- Charlie Santos, Paul Behrends, and other friends who had been working  with me in Afghanistan over the years--and helped us put that together  and the President decided to go in that direction. I would recommend  the book on the horse soldiers: ``12 Strong.'' There is a movie out. It  is about that first special forces team and General Dostum.   I believe that I was able that day, by convincing the authorities to  go in that direction, to save thousands and thousands of American  soldiers' lives. How demoralizing would it have been if we had not  succeeded in a counterattack after 9/11?   Finally, let me mention a couple of things in passing that are those  things that I discussed that give me pride and that I remember; what  really also is most heartwarming to someone who is a Member of Congress  is what he or she has been able to do for our own constituents.   As I say, whether you are Republicans or Democrats, we know our job  is to help our people. Nobody else is going to help our people, except  us. We care about them. Jack Kemp used to say: They won't care what you  say unless they know that you care about them. Unless you can show them  you care, they don't care about what you say. I never met a Democratic  or Republican that didn't love his constituents or try to help them.   During the time period that I have been a Member of Congress, we had  a flood control project. I know that sounds not so great here. But the  fact is, we had a flood control project in Orange County that basically  saved maybe billions of dollars in flood insurance costs for homeowners  in my area in Orange County. The flood threat was going where people's  lives would have been at stake.   I worked on that and I made sure when I first got here and worked  with other Members of Congress--Democrat Members of Congress, because  it was a Democrat Congress--to help complete that project. That is the  type of bipartisanship we are capable of.   We have a water reclamation project in Orange County. It is the most  high-tech water system in the world. We had a big drought over these  last few years, but Orange County was the one county that stood alone  in not being hurt dramatically because we had a system we invested in.  I brought people from all over the world to see that technology, and I  was able to work with our locals to make that happen.                                time  1845    I was able, over my years, to help veterans who were being stood up,  veterans who were not getting the service they needed. They felt  helpless. They were, some of them, sick, psychologically wounded by the  service that they had provided, yet we were not helping them.   My office has helped hundreds of these men and women who were in  desperate need of someone to care for them. That is a memory now, a  good memory, and I know my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, do  that.   And we have changed the rules so that now the Veterans Administration  has to be more caring. They have to make sure these people are being  taken care of.   I am very proud, again, of the bipartisan approach on these issues of  human caring for our own constituents, making America a better place  from the bottom up instead of from the top down.   Let me just note that there are hundreds of people in my district who  would have lost their homes about 10 years ago when we had an economic  upheaval. People remember the Great Recession. Well, yes, things got  really bad, and people were losing their homes. We established a  program, and we helped over 500 people in Orange County, in my  district, to save their homes, families that would have lost  everything.   Thank God that I was permitted to be a Member of this body, because I  know each and every one of us were doing things like that to help those  in need.   I have gone to help as many seniors who are having trouble with  bureaucracy, with Social Security; and I have also tried to do my best  over the years to work with organizations, organizations that add to  the benefit and that add to the strength, the moral strength as well as  every other strength of our system, organizations, whether they are the  Rotary Club or whether they are the Boy Scouts of America.   I have pinned on hundreds, if not thousands, of Eagle Scout pins for  all of the Scouts for these last 30 years that I have been a Member of  Congress representing Orange County.   So we must be loyal, basically, to these local people, these people  who have elected us. That is our job. Our job is to watch out for them,  for their interests.   I have one last note, and that is this: When we look at the  immigration issue, I would hope that we do so with respect for each  other and understanding that people have good hearts on both sides. But  I know that, in my heart, my main job right now--and it has been for  every Member of this House--should be to watch out for what is in the  best interests of the American people.   Those people who would like to come here illegally, I am sorry. We  already provide for a million people to come here legally.   We have to make sure the policies we set for immigration are what are  in the interests of the people of the United States, and the same with  our foreign policy.   I want to say that I am grateful that God has given me the  opportunity and the voters have given me the opportunity these last 30  years to try to serve in the interests of my people, of the people of  our country, and of those ideals our Founding Fathers and Mothers put  in place when they risked all in the American Revolution back in 1776.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
