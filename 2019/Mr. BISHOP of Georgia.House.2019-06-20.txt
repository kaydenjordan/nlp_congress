 Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 445,  I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The amendments included in the en bloc were made in order by the  rule, and they have been agreed to by both sides. They improve the  bill. I support the amendment, and I urge its adoption.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).                                time  1200     Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Trone).    Madam Chair, at this time, I ask my colleagues  to join me in support of this amendment.   Madam Chair, we have no more speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, I understand the gentleman's  intention, but I could not disagree more.   The agriculture bill funds a variety of national priorities from food  safety, to agriculture research, to drug approval, to rural  development, to nutrition programs for our children.   Reducing spending by 14 percent would hurt our farmers, who are  already suffering terribly from retaliatory tariffs, and it would hurt  small communities who are still in need of adequate broadband. It would  hurt those who are waiting for cures to rare cancers. It would  jeopardize America's status as a leader of global agricultural science.  It would slow our response to foodborne illness outbreaks. It would  harm children and families who rely on these programs to put food on  their tables.   The bill already rejected the administration's draconian cuts to  programs that assist our rural communities and vulnerable populations.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge that this amendment be  rejected.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim  the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this  amendment.   The Distance Learning and Telemedicine program offers grants to rural  areas to provide access to education, to training, and to healthcare.  These resources are critical in providing funding to acquire audio,  video, and other advanced technology equipment to extend educational  and medical services, including those seeking opioid treatment.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).    Madam Chair, the amendment would bring the  total funding for the program to $75 million in our bill. This program  provides grants to encourage and improve telemedicine and distance  learning services in rural areas through telecommunications and other  technologies, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I  thank the gentleman for offering it. It enhances the bill.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of this  amendment.   There is wide support and recognition as to the need for investing in  broadband infrastructure. As a necessity for modern life, we must  continue our efforts to bridge the broadband divide to ensure that as  many rural Americans as possible receive fast and reliable broadband  service and the multitude of benefits that are associated with it.   Madam Chair, the gentlewoman's amendment, if adopted, would bring  broadband funding to the highest level since 2009, with the Recovery  Act. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It will certainly  enhance this bill.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. As I have said  before, Congress' oversight role is one of the most important  functions. That function extends to preserving the integrity of  science.    The academics, economists, and researchers at USDA produce top-notch  scientific reports characterizing the state of the farm economy, the  agricultural industry at large, and analyzing future impacts. It is  clear that one of the most important stressors on agriculture today and  in the coming years will be the effects of climate change.   We cannot prevent the effects of climate change by simply removing  any reference to it in the Department's scientific publications. We  must allow the science community to do its work, free from political  influence.   Madam Chair, I have no objection to the proposed amendment, and I  urge its adoption.    Madam Chair, I rise as the designee of  Chairwoman Lowey, and I move to strike the last word.    Madam Chair, I yield to my colleague from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Chair, I appreciate my colleague's  longtime support for fair trade practices for our livestock and for our  poultry farmers.   I have worked on this issue over the years with the gentlewoman, and  I, too, share her concerns regarding the GIPSA rules and the  administration's past history in such rulemakings.   I look forward to working with my colleague from Ohio as the  administration takes steps toward complying with the farm bill  requirements from 2008.    Madam Chair, as the designee of Chair Lowey, I  move to strike the last word.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    I yield back the balance of my time.
