 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Affordable  Care Act and to discuss the devastating impact its potential  elimination would have on rural families and rural communities.   My State, Virginia, has so many rural communities, and in that, I am  with every other Member of this body, and I want to talk specifically  about them.   The Trump administration has sought for years to end the Affordable  Care Act using every tool available. They have worked on that task here  in Congress to repeal it and sabotage it and even dismantle it in the  court system. Today marks another milestone in that deeply troubling  effort.   The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in a  case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. If  the ACA were struck down, families and communities around the country  would bear life-altering consequences, and the healthcare system would  be thrown into chaos. Tens of millions of Americans would lose  healthcare coverage and protections for preexisting conditions, among  the countless other consumer protections that have been put in place by  the ACA.   A number of my colleagues are going to be on the floor this afternoon  speaking about particular aspects of this that trouble them. I want to  focus on one in particular: how important the Affordable Care Act's  Medicaid expansion is to rural America and how much is at stake for  those communities should the Affordable Care Act be eliminated.   Medicaid expansion enables low-income, rural residents to get  affordable, quality health insurance so they can get the care they  need. It is often the case that insurance companies do not compete with  the same intensity in rural communities because there are just not  enough patients. So it is common in rural America for somebody wanting  to buy an insurance policy on the exchange, for example, to maybe have  only one option. Medicaid expansion has turned out to be a huge benefit  for many low-income people living in rural America. Many of those who  are receiving insurance pursuant to Medicaid expansion were previously  uninsured, and so for some, it is the first insurance they have had in  their lives.   A particular impact of Medicaid expansion has not been on just  individuals receiving that Medicaid but on the hospitals that are sort  of the healthcare and even economic pillars in rural communities. Rural  hospitals often have a difficult time making the finances work. Again,  lower patient volumes make it difficult. Medicaid expansion has meant  that the care they have been providing that in the past might not have  been reimbursed at all--they are now able to at least get a Medicaid  reimbursement, and that has been a significant financial benefit to  these hospitals.   Mr. President, you understand this because your State is like mine,  and there are a lot of rural communities. Rural hospitals are often the  lifeblood of rural communities. They can be the largest employers in a  town or a county. They often do a tremendous amount of outreach on  healthcare and other philanthropic efforts not just within the hospital  walls but outside the hospital walls--sponsoring the Little League  teams and doing the things that make a community a community.   Residents of rural communities need access to healthcare, but they  also need access to jobs and good healthcare information. Rural  hospitals provide that.   I have seen the impact of rural hospital closures in Virginia  firsthand. Two rural hospitals in Virginia closed in recent years  because Virginia did not expand Medicaid initially. In the last year,  Virginia has done Medicaid expansion, but before Medicaid expansion was  done, we saw hospitals close in two communities in Virginia: Patrick  County, which is a south side Virginia county that is on the border  with North Carolina, and Lee County, which is a far southwestern  Virginia county that is on the border with Kentucky and Tennessee. Two  hospitals have closed in those communities.   I got a letter from a mother in Christiansburg, VA, which is actually  up near Virginia Tech. Her name is Robin, and she wrote about the  closure of the Pioneer Hospital in Patrick County in 2017.   She wrote this:         My mother who recently turned 70 still lives in the county,       and we are approaching a point of either moving back to       Patrick County or moving my mother to Christiansburg where we       currently live. My son has severe food allergies that could       lead to anaphylactic shock (which would require immediate       medical attention) so this variable also weighs very heavily       on my mind when considering the options of how to manage my       family's land and take care of my mom. I don't want to live       somewhere without access to emergency health care. It seems       inconceivable that this is the case in the era in which we       live now. . . . Please help get my home county back on the       medical map to give its economy and its people a fighting       chance.    Blacksburg is probably an hour and a half to 2 hours away. The mother  is living in a county that now has no hospital--she has turned 70--so  she doesn't have access to the care that she needs. The daughter is  trying to decide: Do I move back? But I have a son who needs care  because of allergies. Do I have to move my mother out of the home where  she would rather stay?   Rural hospitals across the country are struggling to keep their doors  open for a number of reasons, but here is an amazing set of statistics.  Whether a State expands Medicaid pursuant to the ACA is a massively  significant factor in rural hospitals' financial outlook and  decisionmaking. Without Medicaid expansion, rural hospitals may be  forced to cut vital services or even close. Here is the data point that  really says it all: Since January 2010, 107 rural hospitals have closed  in the United States, and 93 of those 107 hospitals were in States that  had not expanded Medicaid at the time of the closure.   Hundreds more rural hospitals are at risk of closure. Rural hospital  closures disproportionately occur in States that have not expanded  Medicaid. The success of the Texas case would wipe out the ACA,  including Medicaid expansion, and deeply penalize these rural  hospitals.   A comprehensive 2018 study published in Health Affairs found that  Medicaid expansion is directly associated with hospital financial  performance and that expansion substantially reduces the risk of  hospital closure, particularly in rural areas. The study also found  that going back to pre-ACA eligibility for Medicaid would drive even  more rural hospitals to closure.   So we think about Robin's dilemma of a mother living in a rural area  where the hospital has closed. If the ACA is struck down and there is  no Medicaid expansion, this is going to be faced by more and more rural  communities across the country, and that means this is a dilemma  individuals and their families will ultimately face.   Research from Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute  indicates that the uninsured rate for low-income adults in rural  communities fell three times as fast in States that expanded Medicaid  as compared to States that did not expand. Turn that around.  [[Page S4713]]  States that expand Medicaid find that rural families have a  dramatically higher likelihood of having insurance than those in rural  areas where the States haven't expanded Medicaid.   As of now, 36 States, including Virginia, have expanded Medicaid and  14 have not. I am thrilled that earlier this year Virginia, after a  multiyear battle, finally announced that Medicaid expansion was  happening. In less than a year after expansion, nearly 293,000 adults  are newly enrolled in Medicaid in Virginia, many of whom never had  health insurance before in their lives--293,000 adults in a State where  the population is about 8.5 million. That is a significant number of  people who have received insurance through Medicaid expansion. They  risk losing their eligibility if the administration is successful in  its efforts to gut the ACA.   If we care about rural residents and rural communities, there are a  number of things we can do.   First, we need to stand up against the administration's attempt to  end the ACA, including its Medicaid expansion.   I have now been in public life for 25 years since I was elected to  the Richmond City Council in May 1994. I will say that in all of the  elections I have been in, up or down, and all the various legislative  and other battles, the single most dramatic moment in my life as an  elected official was standing on the floor of this body at 2 o'clock in  the morning when Senator John McCain, fresh out of a hospital after  being diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain tumor, cast the deciding  vote, and by one vote--one vote--we saved the Affordable Care Act. I  have never in my life in the public realm experienced something that  was so dramatic and so consequential.   We have to continue to stand up. I would have thought that vote might  have moved us to a new chapter where we would be talking about fixing  and improving rather than repealing, but that is not the case, as  evidenced by the lawsuit today. But my hope is that we will resist  efforts to sabotage and destroy and instead join together in efforts to  improve. I have joined with my colleagues to cosponsor a resolution  allowing Senate legal counsel to intervene in the lawsuit, to defend  the Affordable Care Act.   The second thing we can do to help rural communities is focus on the  14 States that haven't yet expanded Medicaid and provide them a clearer  path and encouragement to do so.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of something called the SAME  Act, which would extend the same level of Federal assistance to every  State that chooses to expand Medicaid regardless of when the expansion  occurs. I think that is important.   Let's use the original Medicaid Program as an example. It was passed  in 1965. It was not a mandate; it was an option. The last State-- Arizona; State 50--that joined didn't join until 1982. There was a 17- year period between when the first State joined the then-voluntary  Medicaid Program and when the last State joined.   Let's make sure that whenever States join, they are treated the same.  If this bill passes, States that choose to expand now--these 14  States--we would make sure that they get the full Federal level of  assistance as was available to those States that initially joined, and  that should help remaining States get off the sidelines.   Finally, we need to stand up against administrative sabotage to the  Affordable Care Act. We shouldn't promote skimpy insurance plans. We  shouldn't slash funding for enrollment, outreach, or marketing. We  should build on and improve and, yes, fix--because it is not perfect-- the ACA to extend its promise of affordable coverage to even more  Americans.   That is why I have introduced Medicare-X legislation to establish a  public insurance plan that could be offered on the ACA exchanges,  beginning in rural areas. My bill would also make the ACA's tax credits  more generous, expand tax credit eligibility to additional families,  and allow for an enhanced reimbursement rate in rural communities where  low patient volumes often pose financial challenges to healthcare  providers.   In closing, the ACA has meant the difference between life and death  for many families across the country, and I run into them every day.   I am going to be standing with some Senate colleagues on the steps of  the Senate in a few minutes talking about a youngster from Winchester,  VA, who has a series of significant healthcare challenges that would  essentially in the past have made him uninsurable because of  preexisting conditions but who now--because of that protection within  the ACA, he and his family at least have the peace of mind of knowing  that he can't be kicked off insurance or turned down for insurance  because he happened to be born with a condition over which he had no  control.   If the ACA were to be struck down, families and communities would  suffer, and I think that in Virginia, that would particularly be the  case in our rural communities.   Again, I am just going to hold up this issue of our rural hospitals.  We need to protect rural hospitals not only because of the healthcare  they provide but because they are employment centers and centers of  community outreach. When we see the closure of rural hospitals  overwhelmingly being in States that have not expanded Medicaid, that  tells us how valuable that portion of the ACA has been to stabilize the  provision of rural healthcare.   I will continue to fight to protect the ACA and the health of my  rural communities in Virginia and elsewhere. I encourage my colleagues  to do the same.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
