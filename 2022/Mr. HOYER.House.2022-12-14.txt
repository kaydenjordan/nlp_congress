The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15       U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``SEC. 38. INVESTIGATION AUTHORITIES.         ``(a) In General.--In the case of a major fire, the       Administrator may send incident investigators, which may       include safety specialists, fire protection engineers, codes       and standards experts, researchers, and fire training       specialists, to the site of the fire to conduct a fire safety       investigation as described in subsection (b).        ``(b) Investigation Required.--A fire safety investigation       conducted under this section--        ``(1) shall be conducted in coordination and cooperation       with appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and       territorial authorities, including Federal agencies that are       authorized to investigate any fire; and        ``(2) shall examine the previously determined cause and       origin of the fire and assess broader systematic matters to       include use of codes and standards, demographics, structural       characteristics, smoke and fire dynamics (movement) during       the event, and costs of associated injuries and deaths.        ``(c) Report.--        ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), upon       concluding any fire safety investigation under this section,       the Administrator shall--        ``(A) issue a public report to the appropriate Federal,       State, local, Tribal, and territorial authorities on the       findings of such investigation; or        ``(B) collaborate with another investigating Federal,       State, local, Tribal, or territorial agency on the report of       that agency.        ``(2) Exception.--If the Administrator, in consultation       with appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and       territorial authorities determines that issuing a report       under paragraph (1) would have a negative impact on a       potential or ongoing criminal investigation, the       Administrator is not required to issue such report.        ``(3) Contents.--Each public report issued under paragraph       (1) shall include recommendations on--        ``(A) any other buildings with similar characteristics that       may bear similar fire risks;        ``(B) improving tactical response to similar fires;        ``(C) improving civilian safety practices;        ``(D) assessing the costs and benefits to the community of       adding fire safety features; and        ``(E) how to mitigate the causes of the fire.        ``(d) Discretionary Authority.--In addition to a fire       safety investigation conducted pursuant to subsection (a),       provided doing so would not have a negative impact on a       potential or ongoing criminal investigation, the       Administrator may send fire investigators to conduct a fire       safety investigation at the site of any fire with unusual or       remarkable context that results in losses less severe than       those occurring as a result of a major fire, in coordination       and cooperation with the appropriate Federal, State, local,       Tribal, and territorial authorities, including Federal       agencies that are authorized to investigate the fire.        ``(e) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be       construed to--        ``(1) affect or otherwise diminish the authorities or the       mandates vested in other Federal agencies;        ``(2) grant the Administrator authority to investigate a       major fire for the purpose of an enforcement action or       criminal prosecution; or        ``(3) require the Administrator to send investigators or       issue a report for a major fire when the Administrator, in       coordination and cooperation with the appropriate Federal,       State, local, Tribal, and territorial authorities, determine       that it may compromise a potential or ongoing criminal       investigation.        ``(f) Major Fire Defined.--For purposes of this section,       the term `major fire' shall have the meaning given such term       under regulations to be issued by the Administrator.''.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  thank the ranking member, Mr. Davis, for his support of this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the Capitol Building is the wellspring of American  democracy, freedom, and equality. We don't always live that out as  perfectly as we would like, but it is that simple.   Every time I walk to the floor, Mr. Speaker, I pass sandstone blocks  quarried and hewn centuries ago by enslaved Black Americans. It is a  tragic irony that the people's House was built by Americans who were  originally excluded from those extraordinary first three words of our  Constitution, ``We the People.''   While we cannot remove the stones and bricks that were placed here in  bondage, we can ensure that the movable pieces of art we display here  celebrate freedom; not slavery, not sedition, not segregation. That is  why I sponsored legislation, which the House passed earlier this  Congress, that would have removed the statues of those who supported  slavery and segregation from the Capitol as well as the bust of Chief  Justice Roger Brook Taney from the Old Senate Chamber.   That bill was cosponsored by Mr. Clyburn, the Democratic whip; by  Joyce Beatty, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus; and  Karen Bass, who was then the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus  and is about to be the mayor of Los Angeles.   That bill regarding whether ``all men are created equal,'' in his  disgraceful Dred Scott ruling, Roger Brook Taney argued this: The  general words above quoted, that is, all men are created equal, would  seem to embrace the whole human family, and if they were used in a  similar instrument at this day--which was 1858--would be so understood.   I want you to think about that for a second. He said that when they  acted in 1787, they said that all men were created equal. Today, of  course, we would say all people are created equal. But Taney observed  in 1858 that those words said some 70 years prior to that would lock  them into the bigotry and division. And so he interpreted not in terms  of what they would believe in 1858 but what they believed in 1787.   He went on to say: But the enslaved African-American race were not  intended to be included and formed no part of the people who framed and  adopted this Declaration.   His narrow-minded, orginalist philosophy failed to acknowledge  America's capacity for moral growth and for progress.   Indeed, the genius of our Constitution is that it did have moral  growth. It did have expanded vision. It did have greater wisdom.  Taney's ruling denied Black American citizenship, upheld slavery, and  contributed, frankly, to the outbreak of the Civil War. That is why I  and so many others advocated for his statue's removal from the Maryland  State House.   When I was sworn into the Maryland Senate in January of 1967, Roger  Brook Taney's statue stood on the east front of the Capitol of Maryland  in Annapolis. It has since been removed. Governor Hogan, a Republican,  led that effort to remove it.   The Maryland legislature led by Democrats supported that effort. And  [[Page H9819]]  the irony is if you are on the east Capitol front, prior to his  removal, you would have gone from Roger Brook Taney; if you had walked  through the Annapolis State House, some 500 feet, come out on the west  side, walked down the steps, you would have walked into the Thurgood  Marshall Park.   What a historic vision of the growth of America, of the change of  America, of the opening up and more equal America.   I advocated for this statue being removed in Maryland and for this  bust to be removed from the entrance to the Old Senate Chamber.   I am glad that this is passing in a bipartisan fashion.   I am disappointed the Senate isn't ready to remove all the statues in  the original bill. I am glad that we agree that Taney's bust needs to  go immediately.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to work with my colleagues next Congress  to remove the other statues.   I look forward to advancing that mission with Democratic Whip  Jim  Clyburn, Chairwoman Barbara Lee, who I did fail to mention--she was the  principal sponsor of this bill--and Chairwoman Joyce Beatty; all of  them, along with former Representative Karen Bass.   They happen to be all Democrats, but there were Republicans, many,  many Republicans, supporting this effort because they, too, stand for  equality and justice. They played an important part in developing the  prior versions of this bill and its reality.   Our legislation, as has been observed, would also commission a new  bust for Justice Thurgood Marshall, not to be put outside of the Old  Senate Chamber, because the historian rightly observed, he was not a  member of the Old Senate Chamber, but it will be placed at some  appropriate place in the Capitol as the first African American to sit  on the Supreme Court of the United States.   As a towering civil rights leader, a defender of our founding  principles, and the first Black Supreme Court Justice, Marshall is a  Marylander worthy of a place of honor in these historic halls.    In removing Taney's bust, I am not asking that we would hold Taney to  today's moral standards. On the contrary, let us hold him to the  standard of his contemporaries: Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass,  Abraham Lincoln, whom the gentleman mentioned, and all of those of  their time who understood that the enslavement of others has always  been an immoral act.   Figures like Taney belong in history textbooks and classroom  discussions, not in marble and bronze on public displays of honor. Yes,  we ought to know who the Roger Brook Taney is, a man who was greatly  admired in his time in the State of Maryland, but he was wrong.   Over 3 million people visit our Capitol each year. The people we  choose to honor in our Halls signal to those visitors which principles  we cherish as a Nation. For Black Americans who have grown up in  segregation, faced racial violence, and still confront institutional  racism, today, seeing figures like Taney honored here is a searing  reminder that the past is present. It need not be, however, our future.   Just last year, the January 6 insurrectionists carried Confederate  flags through the Capitol's corridors, desecrated the poster outside my  office honoring my friend John Lewis, and screamed racial slurs at  police officers as they protected the lives and defended our Capitol.   That was a modern manifestation of the hatred of our past. As our  friend Elijah Cummings used to say, ``We are better than this.'' And it  need not be our future.   Taney represents that which holds our country back: Exclusion,  injustice, complacency, and prejudice.   Thurgood Marshall conveys that which drives America forward:  Inclusion, equality, perseverance, and justice.   Every Member of this body, all 435, talk in those terms. Such a  change would show visitors that America does not shy away from our  past; we rise above it to seize a better future.   It would show them that only in America could a man use the same  court that wrongly upheld the enslavement of his own ancestors to  expand the Constitution's promise of the blessings of liberty. It would  show them that ``We the People'' means all the people.   Vote ``yes'' to celebrate freedom and democracy and justice in this  Capitol.   Vote ``yes'' to declare that the hatred of our past need not and must  not define our future.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding. I would  say that we are going to miss my friend who has been a person willing  to work across the aisle on principles that this bill reflects, and I  thank him for that. We will miss him.   I will remain here. I will not be majority leader, but I will remain  working on behalf of the principles that are the best in our country.  They are not Republican principles or Democratic principles; they are  American principles. And that, I think, is what we all should, and most  of the time, do.
