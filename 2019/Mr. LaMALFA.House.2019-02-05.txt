 Mr. Speaker, yet another instance of illegal immigration  impacting real families has occurred in the western States, Nevada and  California.   I thank President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for honoring  three people from my district tonight as guests for the State of the  Union Address.   Sadly, Debra Bissell, Heather Armstrong, and Madison Armstrong will  be here as guests because of the tragedy that happened in their life.  They are the daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter of Gerald  and Sharon David, who were murdered in their home in Reno, Nevada, just  this last month.   The murderer? An illegal immigrant from El Salvador who had been  living in Carson City for over a year. No motive has been released,  but, then, does the motive really matter to this family, to yet another  loss of life due to illegal immigration and the sieve we have of a  border in this country?   But Gerald and Sharon were two of four people who this man, whose  name I will not mention, shot dead in their homes over the course of a  week. The other two victims were Connie Koontz and Sophia Renken, from  Reno, Nevada.   These brutal murders will have a tremendous impact on the families of  each of these victims, including Debra, Heather, and Madison, whom we  will meet tonight.   When we talk about border security, when the President speaks about  it tonight, these three faces should serve as a reminder of the real- life consequences of our open border policy that this country seems to  have.   This is not just a talking point or political football to be tossed  around. Real people are being hurt--the ones left behind--lives are  being ruined, as well as the lives being taken, time after time,  because the Congress can't get its act together to get a bipartisan  solution for border security, for a border barrier, and a combination  of things that it will take to effectively run the border, to patrol  our border, and to give our personnel down there all the tools they  need to do it effectively, safely for the American citizens and safely  for themselves.   It doesn't matter if you want to call it a wall, a fence, a physical  barrier, or anything else. It is long past time to do something about  the crime, violence, drugs, and human trafficking.   The human trafficking, we don't talk about that enough, what is  really happening to the people who are being brought across who do want  to come seek something better in America but are subject to the coyotes  who take advantage of them, extracting dollars from them and  unspeakable things from the women whom they bring across the border and  the kids. It is long past time to do something about all those subjects  that are currently moving fairly freely in our country.   For Debra, Heather, and Madison from Redding, California, they  represent three generations in their family that has been devastated by  the status quo of our border situation.   I am grateful that President Trump is shining a bright, unmistakable  light on this issue and the urgency with which we must address it.  Every single day we do nothing is another day that another family is  being potentially harmed in some way by the inaction and inability on  both sides of the aisle to come together to get something effective  done.   I wish it wasn't under these circumstances that Debra, Heather, and  Madison will have to be here tonight. Their grief must be immense. But  tonight, their story will be front and center for all America to see.  It is certainly no consolation, nothing to assuage the pain they must  feel, but I hope their presence might help spark some positive change  in this country that is long overdue.    I thank the President and First Lady, again, for inviting them. I  thank Debra, Heather, and Madison for their courage in having to share  this tragedy and go through the pain in order to help advance a cause  of sovereign borders and safety for other American citizens who will,  hopefully, not have to go through this.   I ask the American people to join us in praying for Gerald and Sharon  David, for their family that will join us here tonight, for other  victims and family members who have been taken by the senseless  killing, and to pray that a solution happens so we don't have any more  of this in this great land.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Acting  Secretary David Bernhardt for being nominated to serve as the next  Secretary of the Department of the Interior.   President Trump announced that news on Monday after Acting Secretary  Bernhardt has led the Department in a temporary capacity since  December. I applaud this decision by the President. He has chosen a  nominee that brings a strong background of industry experience and  expertise to the table.   Under this administration, I have worked with the Department of the  Interior to improve stewardship of our public's lands, to increase  water storage, and improve forest management policies in California, as  well as the West, and to help prevent more wildfire damage.   I know that will continue under the leadership of Secretary Bernhardt  as it has since he has led the Department. I intend to invite him out  to my district in California to see firsthand the issues that we face  with our forests and public lands, including the ongoing Camp fire  cleanup in Paradise, as well as the Carr fire in Redding from last  summer, and the conditions that helped create these fires to begin  with.   Until then, congratulations, and I urge the Senate to quickly move on  the confirmation process.                            ____________________
