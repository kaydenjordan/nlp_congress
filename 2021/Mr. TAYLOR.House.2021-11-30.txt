 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate the  Texas Scottish Rite for Children on their 100 years of pediatric  orthopedic excellence.   Founded by a group of Texas Masons, Scottish Rite for Children first  opened its doors on October 10, 1921, with the mission of providing  free medical care to children with polio.   The success of the hospital would not have been possible without the  help of volunteers, staff members, friends, and others who have a  shared commitment to improving the lives of the children they serve.   Consistently recognized as a top-performing children's hospital, it  is no surprise Scottish Rite has been consistently ranked among the top  orthopedic programs in the Nation.   Now as we recognize Scottish Rite for Children on this milestone  occasion, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join  me in honoring 100 years of exemplary care and innovation.                            ____________________
