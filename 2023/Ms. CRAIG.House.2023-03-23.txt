 Mr. Chairman, I support parents' rights, and I am proud to  live in the State of Minnesota where parents have a right to remove  their child from a class assignment if they are not comfortable with  the subject matter. That is State law today in Minnesota.   I hear from parents across Minnesota's Second District every day who  are worried about their children. And I hear from teachers every day  who need more support and resources for their students.   Mr. Chair, there are more than 800,000 public school students in  Minnesota.   I don't think Washington politicians, the people standing here on the  House floor today, should mandate which books are in their school  libraries.   I don't think Washington politicians should mandate their parent- teacher conference schedules.   I don't think Washington politicians should mandate whether these  800,000 kids get the mental health support they need.   Let's be real about what this bill is actually about.   This is about MAGA Republicans who want to start a fake culture war  targeting some of the most vulnerable kids in America in our kids'  classrooms. Shame on you.   If you want to support parents, let's fully fund our public schools  and sharpen our focus on special education programs. Let's figure out  how we recruit and retain talented teachers. Let's get our kids and  educators the mental health resources they desperately need.    Mr. Chair, let's leave the power to decide what is best  for students at the local level.   Mr. Chair, I support parents' rights, but this bill has nothing to do  with that.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Association of School Psychologists expressing serious concern with  this legislation.                                             National Association of                                            School Psychologists,                                        Bethesda, MD, March 7, 2023.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, House Committee Education and the Workforce.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Ranking Member, House Committee Education and the Workforce.      Re: Markup of Parents Bill of Rights and Protection of Women           and Girls in Sports Act of 2023        Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of       the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), and       our 25,000+ members, I write to express significant concerns       regarding the harmful impact of the Parents Bill of Rights       Act (H.R. 5) and the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports       Act of 2023 (H.R. 734). School psychologists work with       families, educators, administrators, and community members to       collectively meet the academic, social emotional, and mental       and behavioral health needs of students. We are committed to       ensuring that every child: has access to well-rounded,       comprehensive, and inclusive curricula; receives the       comprehensive learning supports they need to be successful       and; attends a school with a safe, supportive learning       environment free of bullying, harassment, and discrimination       for all students. Importantly, we work to foster effective       partnerships between families and educators, who share       equally the responsibility for the learning and success of       all students. School psychologists work with school leaders       to create equitable and accessible family engagement systems       in which the diverse perspectives of all families are       actively sought out, acknowledged, and valued. Collectively,       elements of H.R. 5 and H.R. 734 undermine these commitments       by: prioritizing the voices and perspectives of a small       subset of families; condoning discrimination; limiting       curricula; and preventing schools from ensuring physical and       psychological safety.  [[Page H1363]]       Further, elements of these bills will significantly       exacerbate the current youth mental health crisis,       particularly for LGBTQ+ and other marginalized youth.                       Parents Bill of Rights (H.R. 5)       Title I--Amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education           Act of 1965        Sec 101 and Sec 103. State and Local Educational Agency             Plan Assurances        NASP supports efforts to increase transparency and access       to information about school curricula. Existing provisions in       FERPA and PPRA clearly articulate the rights of parents to       review school curricula and materials as well as opt their       child out of specific lessons or survey administration. It is       critical that parents and families know what is happening in       their child's classroom so that they may engage with their       children about what they are learning, and even offer       differing viewpoints and helping their children think       critically. Requirements to make this information publicly       available to all creates an unnecessary burden on the SEA and       LEA which is unattainable and will further impede already       strained local and state education systems. Despite our       belief that Sec 101 and Sec 103 are redundant, we offer the       following edits to ensure that all information is accessible       to all families: families and other persons with disabilities       and those who speak a language other than English:        Sec 101 State Plan Assurances        (O)(i)(I) ``posts on a publicly accessible website of the       agency, in a manner that is accessible to persons with       disabilities and those who speak a language other than       English, such curriculum;        (O)(i)(II) if such agency does not operate a website,       widely disseminates to the public in a manner that is       accessible to persons with disabilities and those who speak a       language other than English such curriculum;        (O)(ii)(I) ``posts on a publicly accessible website of the       agency, in a manner that is accessible to persons with       disabilities and those who speak a language other than       English:        (O)(ii)(II) ``if such agency does not operate a website,       widely disseminates to the public, in a manner that is       accessible to persons with disabilities and those who speak a       language other than English, such curriculum;''        (P) ``in the case of any revisions . . . the State       educational agency will post to the homepage of its website,       and widely disseminate to the public, in a manner that is       accessible to persons with disabilities and those who speak a       language other than English,''        Sec 103 Local Plan Assurances        (9) ``post on a publicly accessible website of the local       educational agency or, if the local educational agency does       not operate a website, widely disseminate to the public, in a       manner that is accessible to persons with disabilities and       those who speak a language other than English, the plan . .       .''        We also request clarification as to the definition of       'curriculum.' Teachers routinely alter lesson plans or       planned pace of curriculum based on students' progress and       needs. Teachers must maintain the ability to differentiate       instruction and to develop lessons, aligned with state       academic standards, that meet the needs of their students.       Many students receive interventions, specific modifications,       or specially designed instruction (as part of a child's       Individualized Education Program) to ensure access to the       general curriculum and state academic standards. We strongly       caution against considering these instructional materials       'curriculum' as it could inadvertently violate the privacy of       students and their families, especially in smaller       communities where identification is easier.        Sec 104 Parent's Right to Know        We support that parents should have the right to see what       materials are available in the school, to be well informed       about potential changes to state academic standards or key       programmatic offerings (not limited to the elimination of       gifted and talented programs), and to voice their opinion       regarding school and school district policy. This information       must be accessible to all families, and we request the       following revision:        (1) ``Notice of Rights''--A local education agency . . .       posts, in a manner accessible to persons with disabilities       and those who speak a language other than English,''        However, the ``right to review'' outlined in this section       must not be synonymous with the right to demand removal or       alteration of specific books or other material available to       all students. We remain increasingly alarmed at continued       reports of the removal of material highlighting the diversity       of our society and our schools. Restricting access to       accurate information and removing evidence-based practices       that promote inclusivity and cultural responsiveness is       fundamentally handcuffing schools and school staff, and it is       harming children. Public schools exist to prepare young       people to live in a global society and be contributing       citizens. Therefore, schools must have resources and       curricula which is reflective of the world they live in. We       have heard from many school psychologists that parents are       frustrated by the removal of certain books and/or materials       from classrooms and/or curriculum, and they are angry that       their opposition to these removals has been ignored as it is       placing unwanted limitation on their child's exposure to       diversity and excludes specific identities from curricula.       This legislation must clearly articulate that the ``right to       review'' does not give one the legal right to demand removal.       Educators, schools, and districts must be empowered to make       decisions based on empirical evidence and the needs of the       school community, including the unique needs of specific       groups of students without fear of reprisal.      Title II--Amendments to FERPA and PPRA        Many of the rights articulated in H.R. 5, including the       right to inspect instructional material and surveys that may       be administered or distributed by the school, and the right       to opt their child out of participation in specific       activities are statutorily afforded to parents via FERPA and       PPRA. NASP does not object to more stringent requirements to       ensure proper protection of student data and to prohibit the       sale of student information for commercial purposes or       financial gain. However, we have significant concerns that,       collectively, Sec 201 (n) `Disclosure of Information'; Sec       202(b); Sec 202 (c)(2)(D)(i), and the proposed definition of       `Medical Examination or Screening' will significantly impede       schools' ability to support student well-being and mental       health and prevent school violence. Sec 201(n) would require       schools to share with parents, upon request, an individual       students' response to any survey. Implementation of this       provision would prove impossible in many scenarios as the       vast majority of surveys are anonymous by design and       identified data is less likely to be valid. Many school-      administered surveys are intended to provide critical       information necessary to: examine and respond to the       global physical and mental health needs of young people;       guide school and community violence prevention efforts;       inform school safety and school climate initiatives; and       guide efforts to reduce substance use and misuse. These       data are critical to identifying potential risks to       children and youth, and to evaluate system wide efforts to       address specific concerns. Parents maintain the right to       exclude their child from participating in these valuable       data collection efforts, but students must be empowered to       be honest without fear of consequence, punishment, or the       unwanted disclosure of personal information without their       permission. As such, we request the following revision:        ``(n) DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.--An educational agency or       institution or authorized representative of such agency or       institution shall;        (1) upon request from a parent of a student disclose to       such parent the identity of any individual or entity with       whom information is shared from the education record;        (2) upon request from a parent of a student disclose to       such parent any response of the student to a survey if        (A) information to accurately identify individual students       was collected as part of the survey, as designed, and        (B) the student consents to the disclosure of such       information        (3) inform students, prior to their participation in a       survey in which identifying information is collected, that       their individual responses may be disclosed to a parent upon       request.''        Current law reflects the requirement for parental consent       prior to student participation in specific school       administered surveys, rendering Sec 202 (c)(2)(D)(i)       redundant, and when considered in conjunction with the       proposed definition of `Medical Examination or Screening,       highly concerning. Revision of the current legal definition       of `physical examination' to `Medical Examination or       Screening', which explicitly includes a mental health or       substance use disorder screening, combined with parental       consent requirements will undoubtedly exacerbate the youth       mental health crisis and undermine efforts to improve school       safety. The term `mental health screening' could be       interpreted in a manner that results in significant harm to       school communities. A mental health screening is not       synonymous with a standardized measure or survey intended to       gather personal information about an individual for       diagnostic use. While those tools may be utilized as part of       a holistic approach to identifying and addressing student       need, mental health screening is a process by which       educators, in collaboration with school psychologists or       school mental health professionals, and families, identify       students who may need support. School mental health       professionals will not engage in a therapeutic intervention       with a student without active parental consent. However,       students must be allowed to seek out a trusted adult or       mental health professional, including school psychologists,       at school and these professionals must be able to assess       student well-being and (as part of their responsibility as a       mandatory reporter) immediately assess if there is concern       regarding risk of harm to self or others. As currently       written, H.R 5 would require parental consent prior to any       contact with a school mental health professional and could       result in unnecessary and preventable harm to self or others.       Parents are already notified of reported risk after an       assessment is completed and inability to reach a parent for       consent to do an assessment can have lethal consequences.        We offer the following suggested revision and would welcome       the opportunity to collaborate on statutory language that       ensures availability of comprehensive school mental and       behavioral health services and balances schools' obligation       to support student learning and well-being and maintain a       safe school environment with efforts to improve family       engagement in all aspects of the education system.        MEDICAL EXAMINATION OR SCREENING.--The term `medical       examination or  [[Page H1364]]       screening' means any medical examination or screening that       involves the exposure of private body parts, or any act       during such examination or screening that includes incision,       insertion, or injection into the body, or a mental health or       substance use disorder screening, except that such term does       not include:        (i) a hearing, vision, or scoliosis screening;        (ii) an observational screening carried out to comply with       child find obligations under the Individuals with       Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.).''        (iii) Informal observation screening, or short term       consultation, of non-therapeutic nature, with a school based       mental health services provider;        (iv) a process to assess and mitigate the risk of inflicted       harm to self or others, provided that parental notification       of such screening occurs as soon as is feasibly possible       unless there is reasonable evidence that parent notification       will result in harm to the child.        Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023 (H.R. 734)         NASP believes, and courts have established, that the civil       rights of transgender students are protected as part of U.S.       public schools' obligations under Title IX of the Education       Amendments of 1972. These rights include honoring a person's       right to express gender identity, and the right to modify       gender expression when necessary for individual well-being,       and to have their gender identify affirmed and acknowledged,       the right to explore and question their gender identity, and       the right to participate in activities, including sports,       that correspond with one's gender identity.        We vehemently oppose any effort, including the Protection       of Women and Girls in Sports Act, to define sex based solely       on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth,       while this legislation, on its face, is narrowly focused on       the issue of athletics, it is legally tenuous to assume that       Title IX allows for multiple, context specific, definitions       of sex. This definition would most certainly be applied       across all educational activities and programs and amounts to       an assault on the existence and civil rights of transgender,       gender nonconforming and intersex children, adolescents, and       adults in our communities. Further, H.R. 734 places unfair       burden on school administrators, who are not medical       providers, to examine and police a student's body.       Administrators and the National Association of Secondary       School Principals have expressed concern and frustration over       individual state's laws which violate Title IX.        This legislation is a ``solution'' in search of a problem.       The policies of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and       the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), among       others have longstanding guidelines regarding participation       on competitive sports teams. The IOC first allowed       transgender participation in the Olympic Games beginning in       2004 and the NCAA has done so since 2011. Both the IOC and       the NCAA have refined their policy to better align with       scientific fact and empirical research; and both       organizations, as well as numerous high school athletic       associations and professional and amateur sports leagues,       currently to allow transgender athletes to compete on teams       and in events aligned with their gender identity. Inclusive       sports participation benefits all students and ensures       equitable opportunities for collegiate sports attainment,       collegiate scholarships, and opportunities to compete in       professional sports. There is absolutely no evidence that       cisgender athletes, or women's athletics in general, are       harmed by these policies.        For almost two decades, transgender athletes in the United       States have been allowed to participate in some of the most       elite national and international competitions as their       authentic selves. Yet, it was not until 2020, out of concern       for the future of women's athletics, that policy makers       sought to prohibit transgender people, particularly       transgender women, from participating in sports teams that       aligned with their gender identity. This legislation is not       about protecting women. This legislation is a thinly veiled       attempt at codifying a harmful and discriminatory definition       of `sex' under the guise of ``protecting women'' from       discrimination in sports. This legislation is not about       sports, it is about further erasing transgender people from       public life. We adamantly oppose this legislation and urge       you to do the same.        We welcome the opportunity to collaborate on legislation       that promotes effective family engagement, ensures access to       a well-rounded and inclusive curriculum, supports student       well-being, and affirms the rights and identities of all       students. Please contact NASP Director of Policy and       Advocacy, Dr. Kelly Vaillancourt with questions, concerns, or       opportunities to promote a public education system that works       for all students.            Sincerely,                                         Kathleen Minke, PhD, NCSP,                                                Executive Director.
