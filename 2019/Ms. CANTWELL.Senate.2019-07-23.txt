 Madam President, I rise today to speak in opposition to  the nomination of Stephen Dickson to be the next Administrator of the  FAA.   I have said that it is very important that in this day and age, when  it comes to aviation, safety must always be our top priority. We  considered Mr. Dickson's nomination, his record, and the ongoing case  of a whistleblower retaliation, and given all of that, it is clear to  me that he is not the right person for the safety culture we need today  at the FAA.   It is distressing to me that Mr. Dickson advanced out of committee on  just a party-line vote. We have never had a partisan vote on an FAA  nominee in the past, and I believe we should have found consensus on  the nominee for the FAA given all the concerns the public has about  flying safety.   The reason why I oppose Mr. Dickson is from what I understood, after  the hearing, from First Officer Karlene Petitt, who has a Ph.D. in  aviation safety and is an experienced pilot over 40 years and happens  to be one of my constituents. At a hearing, we basically understood  that no one was holding Mr. Dickson accountable for actions that he  took against her at Delta Airlines.   Back in 2010, she was a pilot on an A330 flight. She had seen a crash  of an A330 plane--tragically, an Air France plane in the Atlantic  Ocean. She had also heard comments from those in the Delta executive  team that if you have a concern about safety, say something. So she  thought she was doing just that.   As part of what she thought was important information following these  A330 incidents, she said she had concern about pilot training when it  came to potential automation and failures of making sure that they were  giving enough rest time to pilots. She observed that there were issues  she thought were putting both her and passengers at risk.   So what did she do? She did what all employees, we hope, would do.  She informed her superiors and suggested possible solutions. She was  persistent and wanted to make sure that these recommendations were met  with by the leadership of the organization--Mr. Dickson and his second- in-command, Jim Graham. Some of the concerns she raised about  inadequate pilot training and not enough pilot rest were things that  you thought would have maybe gotten her recognized for the great  contribution to a safety culture that is so necessary today in an age  of more and more automation. Whether you are talking about an  automobile or an airplane, it is essential that automation and training  go hand in hand.   Instead of Officer Petitt getting the attention she deserved, the  company sent her for a mandatory psychiatric evaluation. Can you  imagine a whistleblower bringing up concerns as a pilot flying for many  years and instead of being paid attention to, being sent for a  psychiatric evaluation?   Just a few months after Officer Petitt raised her concerns, that is  exactly what happened. Delta and Mr. Dickson removed her from duty and  required her to undergo a mental health evaluation, forcing her to  protect her career and her reputation.   The psychiatrist Mr. Dickson's team handpicked to examine Ms. Petitt  had his own problems of serious red flags and retaliatory threats. For  example, the doctor cited that just because Officer Petitt had three  kids, a job, and helped her husband with his career, she must be manic.  I don't know about the Presiding Officer, but to me it just sounds like  being an American woman today, juggling many things.   The psychiatrist even had the nerve to ask when the first officer was  pumping breast milk for her children. That is the kind of questioning  the officer had to answer.   The good news is that there are laws on the books that protect people  in these kinds of incidents when they are a whistleblower and they have  been retaliated against.   Later, a panel of eight doctors from the Mayo Clinic and another  independent doctor came to the opposite conclusion of this  psychiatrist, stating that Officer Petitt had no mental issues and that  she should continue to fly as she had done for many years.   It is very unfortunate that this situation arose, but it is more  unfortunate that Mr. Dickson was not evenhanded about it when his  nomination came before the committee. It is standard operating  procedure in the U.S. Senate to ask nominees this question: Have you or  any business or nonprofit that you have been associated with been  involved as a party to an administrative agency, criminal, or civil  litigation?   Why do we want to know that? We want to know of any kind of  derogatory information about a nominee whom we are about to entrust  with the public confidence through the U.S. Senate. We want to know  whether there have been any issues and whether that trust has been  misplaced. Instead of answering that question, he did not bring up this  incident at Delta.   I don't know of any nominee before the Commerce Committee who, having  failed to disclose this kind of information, then moved forward after  it was brought up. That is right. The only reason we knew about this  incident is not because of his requirement to disclose it and his  failure to disclose it but because, during the hearing when everybody  heard all of this glowing information, a whistleblower came forward to  explain to members of the committee that this incident took place and  exactly what had happened to her in her career as she tried to raise  important issues.   When Mr. Dickson was asked for further information about this lawsuit  and why he didn't disclose it, he went on to minimize his involvement,  saying that it amounted to essentially one meeting with the pilot;  however, a review of written records, emails, depositions, and other  materials showed that  [[Page S4988]]  Mr. Dickson was more involved than just one meeting.   We all want our officials to show a commitment to safety,  establishing rules and a culture that protects the flying public. That  is one reason Captain Sullenberger has come out against this nominee.  He knows that when it comes to creating a culture of safety, it has to  start at the top, and we have to listen to people like the pilots who  are showing concerns today about the Boeing 737 MAX. We should listen  to them and the inspector general on what types of processes should be  put in place to resolve the challenges we face as we integrate more  automation.   Automation can help us make things safer, but automation without the  pilot training, without the integration, without a culture that rewards  people for bringing up issues, instead of almost red-coding them as a  response, is not what we need to be doing.   A 2016 report by the Department of Transportation inspector general  highlights the essential role of FAA oversight to reduce the hazards  with regard to increased reliance on flight deck automation. The FAA  estimates that automation is used 90 percent of the time in flight.  Yet, according to the inspector general report, the FAA did not have a  process to ensure that airline pilots are properly trained to use and  monitor automation systems while maintaining proficiency in manual  flight operations.   The report recommended that the FAA provide guidance in defining  standards that airlines can use to train and evaluate pilots in the use  of automation. It also recommended that standards be established to  determine whether pilots were receiving sufficient training to develop  and maintain manual flying skills.   These are the very matters First Officer Petitt had focused on when  making her observations and suggestions regarding safety. They are as  critical today as they were for the A330.   We are living in an era of increasing automation, and we have work to  do. I guarantee that we are going to continue to play a role in this in  the Commerce Committee, making sure the inspector general's criticisms  of the FAA with regard to these issues are addressed. We need someone  on the frontline who takes safety seriously and listens to the pilots.  I know these issues are weighing on the American public--the very  questions that Dr. Petitt asked. I am sure, with the right amount of  engineering and cooperation, we can get them right.   But Mr. Dickson has doubled down. He basically said that he had no  regrets about how he handled the situation when we came back at him  about the fact that the information wasn't submitted. He basically said  he had no regrets about trying to end a 40-year career of a  whistleblower. I find this very challenging. I want the FAA to move  forward with confidence that we are going to create the safety culture  necessary for today's environment.   Captain Sullenberger said it best:         This nominee, while a senior executive at Delta Airlines,       either caused or allowed a whistleblower with validated       safety concerns to be retaliated against. I strongly oppose       his nomination. The decisions the next FAA Administrator       makes will determine how safe every airline passenger and       crew will be.    I know that it is hard for people in busy jobs to slow down and  listen to whistleblowers, but I guarantee they have helped us many  times to solve many problems.   I ask my colleagues to turn down this nomination today and to help us  create an environment where whistleblowers will be listened to.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
