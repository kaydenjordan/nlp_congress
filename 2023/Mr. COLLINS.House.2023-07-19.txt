 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding me some  time to speak on this very good piece of legislation.   Mr. Chair, as a member of the Science Committee, the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, and the Aviation Subcommittee since I got  here in January, we have spent countless hours visiting with  stakeholders, manufacturers, and visiting airports to get a good feel  and learn more about this. I must say that I probably still don't know  one-tenth of what the chairman, the ranking member, or Chairman Lucas  knows about this subject.   Mr. Chair, since the Wright brothers took their first flight, America  has been the world's pioneer in the skies. That is why I rise in strong  support of the FAA reauthorization bill that is before us today because  it will build on that legacy.   Today, we will vote to provide much-needed long-term stability to our  Nation's aviation system and ensure that our skies remain the safest in  the world.   With this legislation, we will improve efficiency at the FAA and  invest in our critical infrastructure, including regional and local  airports. We will pave the way for new technologies and ensure that the  FAA is ready to certify innovations like hypersonic aircraft. We will  also strengthen our general aviation community, which is a key part of  our Nation's economy and identity, and we will take steps to grow our  aviation workforce and ensure our airlines can meet the needs of the  traveling public and improve the passenger experience.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Sam Graves and Ranking Member Rick Larsen  for their leadership. I also thank their incredible staffs, and I urge  my colleagues to support this bill.
