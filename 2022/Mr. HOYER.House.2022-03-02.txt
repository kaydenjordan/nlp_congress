 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano not only for yielding  [[Page H1232]]  time, but much more importantly, I thank him for the extraordinary work  he does on behalf of the Armed Forces and for its veterans. He is  tireless in his advocacy of veterans' interest.   I meet with him every Wednesday in the chairman's meeting. He is  always speaking up about how we need to continue our focus on the needs  of our veterans who served our country so heroically, whether they went  overseas or not.   Some of the veterans that we are talking about today were not  overseas when they contracted a disease or an illness as a result of  toxic substances. They were here in America. There is a poet who says:  They also serve who stand and wait ready to serve, ready to be deployed  to the point of the spear.   Mr. Speaker, you and I are old enough--I don't want to be too harsh  on the Speaker--but to remember the song: When Johnny comes marching  home again, hurray, hurray, the boys will shout, the girls will cheer,  and the women, they will all turn out.   One of the problems we have seen, though, after that cheering, that  after that parade, after that exultation, is that memories are short.  As time goes by, some of our veterans, sadly, tragically, and  wrongfully, have been forgotten.   This bill says we do not forget. This bill says we will be there for  you, and, yes, we will be there even if there is a substantial cost to  it.   This is a defense cost. In my view, the veterans cost ought to be in  the defense budget, and it ought to be there because that is what we  are all enthusiastic about spending money on. Veterans need to be and  are our first priority.   I thank the chairman for his focus and for his action. He has long  been a champion of our veterans and their well-being.   I also thank Representative Ruiz and Representative Luria, who is  sitting here with us, who have worked very hard on this legislation.  Mrs. Luria, from Virginia, is a retired commander from the United  States Navy. She and her husband commanded a ship. Dr. Ruiz has been on  the front line of illness, the front line as an emergency physician,  and knows full well the psychological and physical effects of toxic  material to the well-being of individuals. I thank Dr. Ruiz and  Commander Luria for their work on this bill.    Our veterans served with honor and routinely went above and beyond  the call of duty in their defense of our Nation. Many of them risked  their lives; not everybody, there were some that were support, and  without their support those at the point of the spear could not have  been successful.   We have a responsibility, Mr. Speaker, a moral responsibility, to  care for our veterans when they return home and ensure that they  receive the treatment they deserve.   When we send our servicemembers to war, when we recruit them, when we  put them in a position by order and they become ill because of where  they are, because of either negligent or unknowing actions, unknowing  to the extent we don't know the adverse effects that they caused,  whatever the situation, a soldier's exposure is our responsibility.   A soldier's exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances during  their service has been shown to be connected to a greatly increased  risk of cancer and respiratory diseases. There is no doubt about that.   The legislation before us would expand veterans' healthcare access  and benefits to address the effects of those toxic exposures that  occurred during their military service.   Mr. Speaker, you and I both know we asked our veterans to go to  battle for America, and they answered the call. When they return home,  veterans should not have to go to battle against red tape to receive  the medical treatment and benefits they have earned through their  service.                                time  1300    They ought to be able to access care for the physical and mental  wounds they carry without impediment or delay. All of us have gotten  cases where there have been weeks, months, years that veterans have  waited for benefits that they deserve under law, and as a moral  responsibility of our government.   We thank our veterans for their service. As I said, we cheer and  shout and turn out. But this is our responsibility. This is not about  cheering or shouting. This is about doing what we ought to do for those  who were injured in the defense of our Nation and our freedom. This is  our opportunity to keep our promise to put our veterans first and truly  give them our highest respect.   Again, I thank my friend, Chairman Takano. I thank all the members of  the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and all those veterans who don't  forget those who come after them. I thank Mr. Takano for his  leadership, and I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to  join in passing this bill with a strong bipartisan support.   Our President talked about bipartisanship. I talked to Mr. Scalise  about being the loyal opposition. Not loyal to Democrats or Democrat  leaders, but loyal to our country. Being loyal to our country means  being loyal to those who served and preserved the freedoms that we  enjoy, this home of the free and land of the brave. I think it is the  opposite way around, but we get the point. Brave and free go together.  Let us not forget. Let's pass this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the chairman of this  committee, for yielding. We have traveled in various parts of the world  together. We have seen pain, and we have seen progress. We are seeing  pain now, and all I can say with respect to the remarks that were just  made by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), amen.   I thank Mr. McCaul for his working not as a Republican, and I thank  Mr. Meeks not as a Democrat, but as Americans, Americans confronted  with a crisis, a crisis for democracy, a crisis for the global  community. I thank them both because they have, in the best traditions  of this House and of this country, worked together to bring to the  floor a resolution, which, indeed, speaks to the pain and to the moral  responsibility of all those who love freedom and democracy.   Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, as Russian missiles rained down on the  cities of his country, Ukraine's heroic President, President Zelensky,  virtually addressed the European Parliament in Brussels.   Mr. Speaker, President Zelensky spoke of a horrendous missile attack  that had just struck the main square of the besieged city of Kharkiv.  ``This,'' he said, is ``the largest square in Europe . . . it is called  `freedom square.' '' He went on to say: ``And believe you me, in every  square today, no matter what it is called, it is going to be called  `freedom square.' In every city of our country. Nobody is going to  break us. We are strong.''  [[Page H1253]]    Frankly, Mr. Speaker, he didn't have to tell us that. We have seen  that strength. We have seen that courage. We have seen that  determination in the face of overwhelming force confronting them.   These past 7 days, the people of Ukraine have indeed shown the world  they are strong, they are courageous, they are united, and they are  resolved to defend their freedom and their democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I served as co-chairman of the Commission on Security  and Cooperation in Europe, otherwise known as the Helsinki Commission,  for 10 years from 1985 to 1995. It was a historic time where democracy  won the Cold War. It was in the final years of that Cold War that  Ukraine in the nineties emerged and was guaranteed essentially by the  international community, but certainly by Russia and the United States,  that they would be a sovereign nation not just in the east but in the  west as well.   I had the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to travel to Kyiv, to Riga, to  Vilnius, to Tallinn, to Sofia, to other cities behind the Iron Curtain  on a relatively regular basis during those 10 years, certainly in the 6  years from 1985 to 1991. In each place I saw a ``freedom square'' where  either before or shortly after my visit people would gather to demand  the right to choose their own future, their own leaders, and their own  laws.   I saw in many others who traveled to those cities and to those  countries a yearning, I saw the commitment to democracy, their courage  and determination.   President Zelensky is correct: ``Wherever democracy thrives, every  public square is a `freedom square.' '' It may have another name, but  it is a ``freedom square.''   Americans have sacrificed much over the generations to secure our  freedoms and to our great credit the freedom of others around the  world.   I tell people, Mr. Speaker, that America is the nation that had the  most hegemony of power and used it so without acquiring the nations  that it protected or imposing its will on the nations that it protected  which is the least acquisitive superpower in the history of the world.   Americans have sacrificed much over the generations to secure our  freedoms and the freedoms of others. The land of the free and the home  of the brave.   Now, the tyranny and autocracy of Vladimir Putin tests us again.   Though American forces will not be engaged directly in this war, that  does not mean that America is sitting on the sidelines. Far from it.  And we must be engaged. This resolution speaks to engagement.   President Biden has unified not only NATO but a broad coalition of  the world's democratic nations and those committed to the post-war  order of respecting peace, borders, and, yes, diplomacy.   Dozens of nations have partnered to stand up to Putin and to support  the freedom fighters in Ukraine. Together, we have imposed punishing  sanctions that are already hurting Putin's regime.   We are already seeing thousands of Russians taking to the streets in  their country to demand that Putin end this unjust war, this unprovoked  war, this criminal war, and stop the unnecessary death and destruction  on both sides for which Vladimir Putin alone bears responsibility.    Today, this House, the people's House representing the greatest  democracy in history, the leading democratic nation in the world, is  expressing our support for the Ukrainian people in their struggle for  freedom and self-government.   I hope and I urge that this resolution pass with not a single  negative vote. Let there be no mistake throughout the globe that, yes,  we have differences between Republicans and Democrats, but we in this  House are all Americans committed to freedom, committed to democracy,  committed to the peaceful relations between nations.   It recognizes the egregious and inhumane actions undertaken by the  Russian military at Putin's command, including the shelling of civilian  targets and the killing of innocents in order to instill fear and  weaken Ukrainian resolve.   We know that resolve, however, Mr. Speaker, will not be broken. We  have seen it in the eyes of the President, and we have seen it in the  eyes of the citizens in those freedom squares.   This resolution further recognizes importantly that Russian  aggression against Ukraine did not begin last week. It began as soon as  the Ukrainian people rejected a Putin-backed autocrat, established a  true democracy, and sought the security and protection of stronger  bonds with its fellow democracies in Europe and NATO, which, of course,  it had every right as a sovereign nation to do.   Putin sent his forces to occupy Crimea. Mr. Speaker, in my view we  were not as determined that that should not happen at that time. We  must not repeat that mistake. Putin instigated a violent, separatist  uprising in the Donbas region that has festered for 8 long years.   His unprovoked and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine comes after it  became increasingly clear that the separatists could not achieve  Putin's expansionist aims on their own. He tried to do it  surreptitiously through agents. It did not succeed, so he took the next  step, a tragic, criminal step.   This resolution also makes clear that the United States will continue  to support Ukraine by providing both military and humanitarian  assistance while maintaining painful sanctions against Putin for as  long as he pursues this war of choice.   In no small part, this resolution puts into action the promise that  President Kennedy made when he took office at the height of the Cold  War.   This will not be a free war for any of us in the free world. It is  going to cost us something. Gas prices may go up. But we want to stand  on freedom's side.   I am in politics largely because John Kennedy ran for President as I  was at the University of Maryland, and I was inspired by his call to  service.   I would urge all of you to read one more time John Kennedy's  inaugural address. It is an extraordinarily inspiring address, an  address not only to the American people, but to the entire world. And  in it he said this: ``Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well  or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any  hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and  success of liberty,'' and of those freedom squares to which President  Zelensky referred.                                time  1515    Mr. Speaker, Americans and our allies are being asked to pay a price,  to bear a burden, to meet some hardship in the days and weeks and  months ahead, not to sustain fire, not to live in buildings being  bombed, not to have to move from their home to a refuge or another  country, but some hardship.   I know that our fellow Americans are up to the task. They have always  been up to the task because those who say we take freedom for granted,  who say the cost is too high, the burden too great, have always  underestimated the American people.   When we see Putin's corrupt, evil, and menacing grab for power and  tyrannical control, we are reminded of the tyrants and evil ideologies  that Americans have fought and vanquished through our collective  commitment and shared sacrifices.   Mr. Speaker, today, let us make this House Freedom Square. Let us  stand with those who are assaulted by a tyrant.   The generation before mine, John Kennedy referred to England as ``Why  England Slept.'' If we do not meet this tyrant now, we will pay greatly  later.   I urge my colleagues to stand with these brave Ukrainians who stand  for freedom and liberty and international law. Let us all  overwhelmingly, unanimously vote for this resolution and send a  message, not just to Putin but to all the tyrants of the world who  would test us once again, that we will not blink.
