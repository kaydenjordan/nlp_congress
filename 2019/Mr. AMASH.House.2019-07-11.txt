 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The 2012 National Defense Authorization Act authorized the President  to order the indefinite detention of American citizens arrested on U.S.  soil without charge or trial.   The NDAA says that:         The Afghanistan AUMF, empowers the President to detain any       person who substantially supported associated forces of       terrorists.    ``Substantial support'' and ``associated forces'' are not defined.   Who could this cover? An American citizen living in Michigan makes a  one-time donation to a nonviolent humanitarian group. Years later, the  group commits hostile acts against an ally of the U.S. Under the 2012  NDAA, if the President determines the group was associated with  terrorists, the President is authorized to detain the donor  indefinitely and without charge or trial.   This compromise amendment guarantees that persons arrested on U.S.  soil under the Afghanistan AUMF or the NDAA will be charged for their  wrongdoing and will receive a fair trial. The government will be  required to tell people detained on U.S. soil the allegations against  them, and the government will have to make its case before a judge,  just as the Constitution requires.   President Obama pledged in signing the 2012 NDAA that he ``will not  authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American  citizens,'' saying that to do so ``would break with our most important  traditions and values. . . . ''   But, Americans' constitutionally protected rights should not depend  on Presidential promises or who is in charge. A free country is defined  by the rule of law, not the government's whim.   Mr. Chair, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time remains.    Mr. Chairman, leaving these powers on the books is not  only a dangerous threat to our civil liberties, but also undermines one  of our strongest assets in trying suspected terrorists: Article III  courts and domestic law enforcement.    Since September 11, the Federal Government has successfully  prosecuted hundreds of defendants charged with crimes related to  international terrorism. Our Constitution works.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Barbara  Lee and Chairman Smith, for joining me on this amendment. I urge all of  my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
