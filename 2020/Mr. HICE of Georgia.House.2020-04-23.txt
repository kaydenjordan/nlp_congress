 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, in a very short period of time, this body has moved an  unprecedented amount of money at an unprecedented speed, and rather  than taking a step back now and looking at the effectiveness of what we  have implemented so far, here we are today rushing forward, not only  with additional funds, but also to rig up an unnecessary and  duplicative select subcommittee for the purpose of investigating the  President of the United States. Make no mistake. That is the purpose of  this subcommittee.   It is entirely political in nature, designed to influence the 2020  elections. From the moment it is gaveled into life, there is no  question that the mission will be to prevent the reelection of  President Donald Trump.   There are already eight real oversight and watchdog processes in this  body. Eight.   The Oversight and Reform Committee, of which I am a member, has the  broadest jurisdiction in this body, and we have the power and the  experience needed to oversee any Federal coronavirus response.   So why does the Speaker want a ninth? Why are we here looking at a  ninth oversight subcommittee, especially when the Democrats are already  in charge of the eight that we already have? Why would the appointment  of this new select subcommittee be a member of her own leadership team  who has already publicly stated that this virus creates for the  Democrats a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit their  vision?   That makes it clear what the purpose of this is all about: it is  because this is an election year, it is because they hate the President  of the United States, and because of that, I strongly encourage my  colleagues to reject this resolution, which is intended to create an  un-needed and duplicative committee.   Madam Chair, I again thank the gentleman for yielding.
