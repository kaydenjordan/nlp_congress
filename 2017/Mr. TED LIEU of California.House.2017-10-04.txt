 Mr. Chairman, I thank Representative  Grijalva for his leadership.   Our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling. The American Society of  Civil Engineers estimates we have a $4.6 trillion infrastructure  deficit. That is why the People's Budget wisely invests $2 trillion to  fix our infrastructure.   Not only will this budget help repair roads, highways, and bridges,  but it will also put broadband all over America, including rural areas,  and create millions of good-paying jobs, over 2.5 million in its first  year.   We are presenting this plan. We are asking for support. Donald Trump  talks a big game on infrastructure, but he has yet to put out a plan.  So we urge the President to support our plan. If he doesn't want to,  then put out his plan so we can have a discussion on how to move  forward on fixing our infrastructure and creating high-paying jobs for  Americans.
