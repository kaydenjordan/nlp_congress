 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Oregon, for yielding, but especially for leading us to this moment  where we have the opportunity to do something big and meaningful that  will put millions of Americans back to work in a meaningful way and  stimulate this economy and also position us to lead in the 21st  century.   I will say this, however. We have been through this before. I have  been here 8 years, and every year somebody from the other side comes  down to this floor to offer the same amendment to take away an  important protection that is actually quite simple.   It just simply says people who work for a living ought to be paid a  fair wage, a wage that is consistent with the prevailing wages in the  community so that people don't have to work full time and live in  poverty, as tens of millions of Americans do right now.   It is pretty straightforward. Thankfully, even when the Democrats  were not in the majority, there were enough thoughtful Republicans on  the other side who would join with us to protect workers.   But I do find, and I know this is an issue that is very difficult for  many of our Members to take, and it is an emotional subject because it  is the same Republican leadership that pushed through a tax bill that  granted huge economic benefits to a very small number of people at the  very top who now want to pull the rug from under working families. This  can't stand, and it won't.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague,  Congresswoman Tlaib, for her leadership and for bringing this amendment  to the floor. I am proud to join her in it.   As many of you know, I represent my hometown of Flint, Michigan.  Flint is the community that really brought national attention to this  issue of lead in drinking water.   Fifteen thousand children were impacted in Flint, Michigan, because  of lead leaching into their drinking water. Those lead service lines  were the source of that contamination.   There is no safe level of lead in drinking water. Right now, we have  a rule that allows for a certain level of lead. Many communities exceed  it, but there is no safe level of lead in drinking water, and we need  to do everything we can to eliminate it. This is a big step forward in  dealing with it.   And let me just remind my friends, yes, of course, this sort of  initiative comes with a price tag. But if you really want to know the  price of this issue, come to Flint and you will see the price of  failure, the price of lead exposure.   It is not just measured in the half a billion dollars that it has  cost to remediate a problem that could have been solved if this program  had been in place before, but the cost is measured in the effect that  that lead exposure has had on developing small brains and the effect on  the trajectory of the lives of those kids forever.   You are not going to get a CBO score that measures the quality of  life and the trajectory of the life of a child whose brain has been  affected by exposure to lead. We have a chance to do something about  this. We have a chance to prevent the next Flint, Michigan.   My people at home are tough, and they have been through a lot. They  don't want Flint to be an anomaly. It should be an example to the rest  of the country.   This is an important amendment that will make even better this bill  that I support that invests in the future of our country.   I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Tlaib, for her outstanding  leadership on this.                                time  1315
