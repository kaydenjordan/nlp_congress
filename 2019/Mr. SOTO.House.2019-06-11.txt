 Madam Speaker, in honor of Pride Month, I would like to  honor John Ruffier.   John Daniel Ruffier is an attorney and leader of the LGBTQ community  in central Florida. John was born in Orlando, Florida, and attended  Edgewater High School where he was part of the State champion men's  crew team.   He went on to attend Vanderbilt University and then the University of  Florida College of Law. Upon graduation from law school, John joined  the law firm of Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor & Reed in Orlando  where he practices to this day, sitting on the firm's executive  committee and leading the firm's senior housing practice group.   John has been involved in numerous community activities having served  on the board of directors for both the Central Florida Coalition for  the Homeless and the Hope and Health Center of Central Florida.   Along with Jennifer Foster, John founded the central Florida chapter  of the Human Rights Campaign and later joined HRC's national board of  governors.

Honoring Dr. George Wallace During Pride Month     Madam Speaker, in honor of Pride Month, I would like to  honor Dr. George Wallace.  [[Page H4427]]    Dr. George Wallace was born in New Hampshire and moved to central  Florida in 1992. He returned to New England in 1995, and after  finishing his undergraduate degree, he returned to Florida in 2002.   George spent the first half of his career advocating and working with  persons with disabilities as a case manager and later turned his  passion for arts into a career as a senior leader of the Orlando  Fringe.   During the Pulse tragedy, George was serving on the board of the  LGBT+ Center of Orlando. Knowing that he wanted to continue serving his  community, he accepted the role as executive director of The Center in  Orlando in 2017. Dr. Wallace has since grown the organization to  include a programming center at its satellite office in Kissimmee in  our district.   George is a very visible leader within central Florida and enjoys  travel, photography, and cheering on the Boston Red Sox in his free  time.   For that, Dr. George Wallace, we honor you.                  Honoring Eric Rollings During Pride Month     Madam Speaker, in honor of Pride Month, I would like to  honor Eric Rollings.   After 30 years of change, of loss, and of victories, Eric Rollings  continues to be one of the most active and visible LGBT leaders in  Orange County.   Eric started volunteering at the Hope and Help Center in the early  1990s because he witnessed the injustices and stigma that his friends  suffered from HIV/AIDS as they were dealing with it every day. In 1993,  he was awarded the Volunteer of the Year for his dedication.   In the present day, Eric is serving his sixth term on the Community  Development Block Grant Board and helps secure funding for the LGBT+  Center of central Florida and helps make recommendations for housing  and services for people living with HIV/AIDS and low- to moderate- income households in the Orlando area.   In Eric's early small business career he was discriminated against  for being gay. He saw an opportunity to help educate other business  entrepreneurs and worked to provide a safe business environment. With  that, he helped grow the Metropolitan Business Association, the LGBT  Chamber of Commerce, serving on the board of directors twice.   Eric, with many of his friends and activist allies, was instrumental  in passing ordinances and protections for the LGBT people of the city  of Orlando and Orange County. In the early days, nothing was certain,  but because they did not give up on Orlando and Orange County, today  our home is one of the most inclusive, welcoming, and economically  vibrant areas in the Nation.   After the Pulse tragedy, all of Orlando came together and became  Orlando United. Eric was honored with an Orlando United Medal from  Mayor Teresa Jacobs. Eric was elected as one of the first openly LGBT  people to serve in an Orange County-wide position. He worked as  chairman of our Soil and Water Conservation Board. He continues to work  now politically to improve our environment and to stand up for equality  for all, including a ban on conversion therapy.   For that, Mr. Eric Rollings, we honor you.            Honoring Ricardo Negron-Almodovar During Pride Month.     Madam Speaker, in honor of Pride Month, I would like to  honor Ricardo Negron-Almodovar.   Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Ricardo obtained a master's degree in  education, a juris doctorate, and is a licensed attorney in Puerto  Rico.   In 2015 Ricardo moved from Yauco, Puerto Rico, to Orlando, Florida.  During his first year in Florida, he taught English to adults and  became involved in civic engagement efforts to register new voters.   After the Pulse tragedy on June 12, 2016, of which he is a survivor,  Ricardo worked to empower the LGBTQ Latinx community and has advocated  against discrimination and gun violence. Ricardo currently serves as a  legal service coordinator for LatinoJustice where he has had the  opportunity to assist those transitioning from Puerto Rico to Florida  after Hurricane Maria devastated my family's native island.   Recently Ricardo obtained a master's degree in nonprofit management  and launched the community organization Del Ambiente, which is an  effort led by the LGBTQ Puerto Rican community to build up the LGBTQ  Puerto Rican community in Florida's activism in environmental work.   For that, Ricardo Negron-Almodovar, we honor you.                 Honoring Karen Castelloes During Pride Month     Madam Speaker, in honor of Pride Month, I would like to  honor Karen Castelloes.

Honoring David Arthur Jones During Pride Month     Madam Speaker, in honor of Pride Month, I would like to  honor David Arthur Jones.   David Arthur Jones, son of Mary Lou Jones and the late Arthur  Henderson Jones, Jr. was born and raised in a union household in  upstate New York. The environment of David's upbringing provided a  foundation of values associated with human rights to which he has been  largely committed to over the course of his lifetime.   After surviving a raucous adolescence, David served with the United  States Jaycees and the New York Young Democrats and was awarded the  prestigious Governorship Award which confers an honorary lifetime  membership. Among his proudest works was the establishment of a  spacious town park in Whitestown, New York.   David went on to enroll at the Mohawk Valley Community College and  Utica College of Syracuse University where he earned his degree in  occupational therapy.   Together, John and David moved to Lake Wales, Florida, in 2004, in  Florida's Ninth Congressional District. As a committeeman, David  incorporated LGBT issues as part of meetings of the Polk County  Democratic Committee.   In 2001, David and his life partner, John, officially certified their  love for each other by virtue of marriage in Utica, New York. David and  John spearheaded the effort to establish the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,  Transgender, and Allies Democratic Caucus of Polk County. In that same  year, David became a Florida LGBTA Democratic Caucus regional director  serving six counties, including Polk, Lake, Osceola, Orange, Seminole,  and Volusia County, of which I am proud to represent much of that area.   David is now in his fifth term serving as the area's regional  director. Currently David Jones is focusing on securing all-inclusive  human rights ordinances in municipalities within Polk County. Thus far,  David has spoken before the commissions of three Polk County cities and  has recruited a number of supporters to do the same in the quest to  secure fundamental rights for all, and our office has helped in that  effort.   David is extremely grateful for the public support that has been  given by Florida House Representative Sam Killebrew and our office,  Team Soto, towards securing all-inclusive human rights ordinances,  securing the effort as being one of bipartisanship.   For that, David Arthur Jones, we honor you.               Honoring Anthony H. Sandonato During Pride Month     Madam Speaker, in honor of Pride Month, I would like to  honor Anthony H. Sandonato.   Anthony is a proud Orlando resident, human resources executive, LGBTQ  community advocate, and a member of the Human Rights Campaign's  national board of governors.  [[Page H4428]]    Originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Anthony currently resides  with his husband, Tracer Foster, in downtown Orlando, Florida.   After completing his bachelor's degree in education from Edinboro  University of Pennsylvania, Anthony relocated to Fort Lauderdale,  Florida, in 1995 to pursue his career. It was there that he took on his  first role in human resources with a Miami-based retailer.   Anthony began volunteering to effect change for the LGBT community.  He took on volunteer leadership roles with south Florida's volunteer  committee for the Human Rights Campaign, the Nation's largest LGBTQ  advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United  States.   Anthony volunteered through HRC to protect Miami-Dade's hard-won  human rights ordinance and to attempt to stop the passage of Florida's  2008 amendment which ultimately banned gay marriage and civil unions in  that State until 2015.    At the Federal level, Anthony championed HRC's efforts in south  Florida to achieve the passage of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act,  the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, and the decade-long  effort to pass the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, otherwise known as  ENDA.   Anthony moved to Orlando in 2012. Shortly after relocating, he joined  HRC's Orlando/central Florida volunteer committee and continued his  LGBTQ advocacy as a political and community engagement leader. His  focus in central Florida has been to continue his efforts to influence  policy by coordinating local get-out-the-vote campaigns and by working  with community leaders and Members of the House and Senate for repeal  of the current administration's transgender military ban and the  passage of the Equality Act, which I am proud, Madam Speaker, we passed  out of this House earlier this year.   For that, Anthony H. Sandonato, we honor you.                  Honoring Nikole Parker During Pride Month     Madam Speaker, in honor of Pride Month, I would like to  honor Nikole Parker.   Nikole Parker is a transgender woman of Puerto Rican, Italian, and  African American descent.

He competed in the UFC.   Berto was known as the man who helped so many people. He was  recognized for his conception of a cardiovascular weight loss training  program.   Although Berto was injured in a horrendous car accident that left him  in a wheelchair for over a year, he did not let the accident define or  confine him. Therefore, Dieuseul Berto began creating ways to self- train in his wheelchair by including pushups and the use of a punching  bag, which served as a catalyst for his cardio program. He then  incorporated those techniques used in the workout.   Berto's fitness program is credited with helping more than 1,200  people gain access to better health by shedding unwanted and unhealthy  pounds, resulting in lowering blood pressure and cholesterol concerns  over the past 20 years. He is considered a pioneer in helping people  with their health and, consequently, their self-confidence.   He was also a family man who helped many kids and tried to keep them  out of trouble with his kids program. Berto also mentored children and  encouraged them to never sell themselves short by reiterating that any  dream is possible and attainable with hard work and dedication. He is  credited with teaching children to set larger-than-life expectations  for themselves.   He interacted, impacted, and inspired people from all aspects of  life.   Berto and his wife are the parents of seven children, including Andre  Berto, a two-time former welterweight world champion; Edson and  Revelina, who are also professional mixed martial artists; and his son  Cleveland, who is an actor.   Madam Speaker, for that, we honor Dieuseul Berto.
