 Madam Speaker, the wallets of South  Carolinians and all Americans have been negatively affected by the  destructive decisions of Biden and the Democrat-led Congress destroying  jobs.   However, through the leadership of Governor Henry McMaster, with the  largest Republican supermajority in South Carolina in 150 years, South  Carolina has achieved a record surplus of over $3.5 billion in  unexpected revenue for the year.   Last week, in the State of the State Address by Governor McMaster, he  stated that 2022 was the most successful year for economic growth in  our State's history.   The Governor announced 12 projects valued at over $10 billion  creating 14,000 new jobs. Governor Jim Edwards recruited Michelin,  Governor Carroll Campbell recruited BMW, Governor David Beasley  promoted workfare programs, and Governor Nikki Haley saved Boeing.   South Carolina remains a shining example for America.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Our support is for our appreciated ally Turkey, which has been so  devastated by the earthquake.  [[Page H747]]                                ____________________
