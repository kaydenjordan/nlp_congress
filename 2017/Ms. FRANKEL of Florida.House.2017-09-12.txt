 Mr. Chairman, my, my, my. Here we go again.  Another bill to protect the derrieres of big business, allowing them to  hide crucial data from public scrutiny, information that would disclose  pay disparities in the workplace.

Mr. Chairman, let's pass this amendment. Root out pay discrimination,  because it is time that all Americans are paid for their hard work and  not for their gender or the color of their skin.
