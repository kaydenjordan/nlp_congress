 Mr. Speaker, it is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Every  day, nearly 1,000 women in this country receive a life-changing  diagnosis that they will be affected by breast cancer. Nearly 200,000  of these diagnoses occur each year. One in eight women in our country  will face breast cancer.   Breast cancer has a devastating effect on our families, taking away  wives, mothers, aunts, uncles, sisters, and daughters.   I wish I was a brilliant scientist and could develop a cure. I wish I  was a magician and could wave a magic wand and cure breast cancer, but  I am just a Member of Congress. Actually, there are things this  Congress could do to make breast cancer less likely, less deadly, and  less painful.   Cannabis has shown promise in cancer research for over 2 decades.  This research finally came to fruition in 2007, when Dr. Sean  McAllister showed that cannabis-related compounds helped fight  malignant forms of breast cancer. In the decade since, other research  has confirmed and built on Dr. McAllister's findings, and there is now  conclusive research that shows that cannabis-related compounds have  antitumor properties.   Yet, despite these findings, scientists are going too slow. It is  time for cannabis research to begin, and we should declassify it as a  schedule I drug.                            ____________________
