 Mr. President, last night, the United States  accomplished something really remarkable. After years of work, dozens  of hearings, and an open process, we passed a historic overhaul of the  Nation's Tax Code. It will deliver real relief to families and small  businesses all across our country. We passed tax reform to spur the  American economy, to encourage job creation and grow economic  opportunity, to bring jobs and investment home, and to put more money  into the pockets of hard-working men and women whom we represent. We  voted to repeal ObamaCare's individual mandate tax so that low- and  middle-income families are not forced to purchase something they either  don't want or can't afford. We voted to responsibly develop more of  Alaska's oil and gas potential, strengthening our economy and our  national security in the process.   I would like to commend my colleagues in the Senate for their work to  pass these historic reforms and bring our Tax Code into the 21st  century.   I want to extend special thanks to Senate Finance Committee Chairman  Orrin Hatch, a skilled legislator whose expertise was essential to  shepherding this legislation through a challenging process while faced  with complete and total obstruction.   I thank Chairman Mike Enzi for his assistance and Chairman Lisa  Murkowski and Senator Dan Sullivan, who worked tirelessly to bring the  people of Alaska a victory on energy exploration for which they have  been waiting for almost 40 years.   I am grateful to the other Senate conferees--Senators Cornyn, Thune,  Portman, Scott, and Toomey--who worked day and night to get this  legislation across the finish line.   And of course, in addition to Senator Hatch, his colleagues on the  Senate Finance Committee deserve our gratitude as well: Senators Burr,  Cassidy, Crapo, Grassley, Heller, Isakson, and Roberts. This could not  have happened without all of them.   Of course, a great deal of credit goes to President Trump, Vice  President Pence, and their dedicated White House team. Their efforts  were absolutely essential to this process, and we are proud to have  worked together to deliver on a key part of the President's agenda.   It goes without saying that tax reform would have been impossible  without Speaker Ryan, Chairman Brady, and the Members of the House who  share our commitment to make taxes lower, simpler, and fairer. I am  proud to call them my colleagues.   When the final version of this historic law passes the House later  today, it will await the President's signature. Then, families and  small businesses--like so many in my home State of Kentucky--can begin  to enjoy the benefits. Our constituents called out for relief from the  Obama economy, and Congress delivered                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different matter, the Senate's  work this week is not finished. Before Friday, Congress must agree on  funding to sustain the necessary operations of the Federal Government.  I know that all our colleagues on both sides of the aisle want to keep  the government funded and attend to a number of other urgent  priorities. I am confident we can work together to do just that.  Americans are counting on us, after all.   To begin with, our men and women in uniform are counting on us to  provide the resources they require to fulfill their missions and keep  the country safe. The burden of the Budget Control Act has fallen  disproportionately on our All-Volunteer military. Under that law,  defense cuts have outpaced nondefense cuts by $85 billion since fiscal  2013. At the same time, the previous administration insisted that new  defense spending be matched equally by  [[Page S8154]]  new nondefense spending, notwithstanding the actual needs of our  military.   This week, let's dispense with the arbitrary standard--as we did  earlier this year--and provide our warfighters with the funding they  need to accomplish the tasks put before them.   Americans whose premiums are soaring or whose coverage is in jeopardy  because of the failures of ObamaCare are counting on us to take  bipartisan steps toward stabilizing health insurance markets.   The parents of 9 million children enrolled in the Children's Health  Insurance Program are counting on us to renew the program's funding.   Our country's law enforcement professionals are counting on us to  renew an important foreign intelligence program that helps them defend  the homeland from those who wish us harm.   Veterans are counting on us to renew the popular Veterans Choice  Program and preserve their flexibility to access care outside of the VA  system.   Just as we have done in the past, we need to pass a routine pay-go  waiver to avoid a draconian sequester that none of my colleagues want  to see take effect. Americans are counting on us not to inflict harmful  cuts on Medicare and other essential operations.   I look forward to working together in the coming days to fund our  government in a manner that does right by the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 277, S.
