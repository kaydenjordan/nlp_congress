 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as a former chair of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee, I have a pretty good sense of how complicated it  is to pull together a legislative package of public lands like the one  this Senate is about to pass.   So I would like to begin my comments with a special shout-out to our  chair and committee leadership, Chair Murkowski, Senator Cantwell,  Senator Manchin, then-chairman and my friend Congressman    Rob Bishop,  and now-Chairman Grijalva for helping me negotiate the Oregon  provisions in this bill.   This morning, I have brought to the floor of this Senate a copy of a  wonderful story. It is called ``Fire at Eden's Gate.'' It is an  inspiring account of our late Republican Governor, Tom McCall. Nobody  understood better than Tom McCall the very basic idea that protecting  our public treasures should not be a partisan proposition. In this day  and age, too often, it can feel like the sense of common purpose around  protecting our public treasures is slipping away, but I hope this bill  is a bit of a signal that it is coming back.   That is why this morning, I am dedicating the Oregon provisions of  this bill to the memory of our late, great Tom McCall. If Governor  McCall were here with us this morning, he would say the Oregon  provisions in this legislation are all about protecting and enhancing  Oregon's unique and extraordinary livability. At the heart of that  livability are our natural treasures and the recreation economy that  pumps billions of dollars into Oregon, especially in our rural  communities.   I am heading home this weekend. I have townhall meetings in every one  of Oregon's 36 counties. In those rural areas, I am constantly seeing  people whose livelihood revolves around that theory Tom McCall talked  about--our unique livability. We will see small businesses, we will see  guides who are taking folks out into the back country, and people who  sell gear. The recreation economy is a big economic multiplier, and it  is all tied to what Tom McCall talked about, which is protecting  Oregon's livability.   Tom McCall would be very pleased with a number of aspects of this  bill, and I want to tick them off briefly this morning. I believe  Governor McCall would be especially pleased that this legislation does  more to protect Oregonians from the growing threats of wildfires that,  in our part of the world, are not your grandfather's fires. They are  becoming infernos. We are seeing fires leap our majestic Columbia  River, something that used to be unheard of but is a reality today.  This legislation, in my view, makes a real difference in reducing the  threats of wildfires.   I want to talk about one provision specifically, and that is what the  bill does for Crooked River Ranch in Central Oregon. The Crooked River  Ranch provision I worked on with the committee leadership and that we  got in this bill is just common sense because it reduces the risk of  fire and also prevents the increasing backlog that prevents our land  managers from clearing out dead and dying hazardous fuels near the  homes of families.   Folks from this really small community, the Crooked River Ranch, came  to my townhall meetings and told me about their very understandable  fear of being engulfed in one of these infernos, which is how I  describe some of these fires that just leap through Federal, State,  local, and private boundaries. I want everybody at Crooked River Ranch  this morning to know the provisions of this bill reduce the risk of  those huge fires, promote forest health, and reduce the backlog that is  so critical to preventing fires in the future. I think the provisions  in this bill show all those folks from Crooked River Ranch who came to  our townhall meetings that the Senate has listened to them and  responded to this very real threat.   In addition, I can picture Tom McCall this morning--this towering  figure--striding through the forests that this bill designates as the  first new wilderness in Oregon in nearly a decade. I am talking about  the Devil's Staircase Wilderness area, which is 30,000 acres of rugged  rainforest in our beautiful Oregon Coast Range. This is an untouched,  pristine area, and it was named after a series of cascading waterfalls.  It is an area that is so remote and so steep that hikers--who come from  all over the country and literally from around the globe--when they  come to Devil's Staircase, they can only gain access after a daylong  trek through miles of devil's club, which is a tall, spiky bush that  has irritated many a hiker. Few people have actually seen the  waterfalls and the primeval stands of old-growth trees that surround  it. In true Tom McCall fashion, this bill ensures that these majestic  Douglas firs and tall trees on the hike are there for future  generations to come, and that, in particular, is something Tom McCall  personally talked to me about.   I am going to mention volunteers in the forests and a conversation I  had with Tom McCall not long before he passed. He was always coming  back, trying to make sure those of us in positions to make policy were  thinking about future generations.   Nancy and I are older parents. We have twins who are 11 and a little  redhead who is 6. Pictures are available on my iPhone after my  presentation.  [[Page S1185]]  Whenever I look at them, I think about what Tom McCall said: You are  making policy for future generations. Now, because of the provisions  here to protect Devil's Staircase and create this unique, new  wilderness area, it is going to be there for those future generations,  for Oregonians, Americans, and literally visitors from around the  world.   While we are on the topic of remote areas in my State, the lands bill  we are about to vote on protects yet another very special place, the  Chetco River in Southwestern Oregon. The Chetco lives within steep,  mountainous terrain in the heart of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness area.  This river--one of the wildest in Oregon--drops almost 4,000 feet in  elevation from its headwaters in the Rogue-Siskiyou National Forest  before it empties into the Pacific Ocean near Brookings. This area  would be particularly beloved by Tom McCall because it is a haven for  treasured Oregon fish species like salmon and steelhead. There are so  many pictures of Tom McCall throwing a rod because he loved to fish.  Although it is a hike to get there, it is an irresistible challenge to  even the most proficient anglers and whitewater kayakers, but they will  find it the trip of a lifetime.   In addition to its recreation benefits and wildlife-sustaining  habitat, the river also provides a clean and pristine source of  drinking water for the city of Brookings and the town of Harbor on the  Oregon Coast.   For years, this extraordinarily pure river, with crystal clear water,  was being threatened by those who simply didn't appreciate what it  meant for fishing and protecting the future, and simply just looked at  as an opportunity for mining. This legislation ends the future  potential for mineral exploitation along the banks to the Chetco once  and for all.   I and other Members of the delegation have been working for years to  try to make sure this was done permanently. We wouldn't have to lurch  from one kind of administrative fix to another. Now we are embedding in  black letter law that we are ending the future potential for mineral  exploitation along the banks of the Chetco River.   I have been working on this for my entire time in public service  representing Oregon in the U.S. Senate, and it is something that I-- again, apropos of that shout-out to Senator Murkowski, Senator  Cantwell, Chair Bishop, Chair Grijalva--am so appreciative of.   The Chetco, by the way, is just one of the many rivers the public  lands bill will protect and conserve in my home State. The bill  protects more than 250 miles of rivers and streams in Oregon by adding  them to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.   As an Oregonian, I know it doesn't take an act of Congress to remind  us that rivers and streams are the backbone of Oregon's recreation  economy. I spoke about it earlier, but this is something that, in my  view, is missed in much of the debate about public lands. Recreation is  an enormous economic multiplier for our communities.   I see our new colleague in the Chair, the Presiding Officer, and I  know Florida cares deeply about treasures. So, again, this is not a  partisan concern. This is all about looking down the road. When I have  a chance, as I will this weekend, to be home for townhall meetings, I  am always stunned at how far the reach is with respect to the  recreation economy.   I was home recently, and a young man said he wanted to talk to me  about his kayak business, and so we visited. He talked about how he had  tourists come, and he would take them out in his kayak. Then he talked  to me about how there is a global market for his kayaks.   I am the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee with  jurisdiction over trade. He asked me about my view on economics. One  out of five jobs in Oregon revolves around international trade. We like  to make things and grow things and add value to them and ship them all  over the world.   Well, the recreation economy creates opportunities here at home, as  that young man took folks out in his kayaks, but creates even more  opportunities as the rest of the world benefits from his kayaks as  well.   In Oregon, we outdoor enthusiasts understand that from every corner  of the United States we have an opportunity to show Oregon's true  natural beauty as well as give people the experience of a lifetime  seeing unparalleled treasures. It is a big boost to a lot of families  for increasing their incomes.   Rivers and streams, such as those we are going to protect with the  new additions to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, are a  place for families to picnic, for anglers to cast a fly rod into some  of the best fishing holes in the country, and for whitewater rafters to  get an adrenaline rush while enjoying Oregon's treasures.   I can tell you about Tom McCall because Tom McCall loved fishing  almost more than life itself. I am telling you, he would look at these  provisions, and he would say that what this bill does to protect those  hundreds of miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers is something that he would  call part of laying the future for future generations but making sure  there is a lot that benefits the people of my State and our country  right now.   From Brookings to the Willamette Valley, from the Chetco to the  Molalla River, this bill and the provisions we were able to negotiate  on rivers protects treasured fishing streams and salmon habitats in  every single corner of Oregon. As I indicated, it is going to be a real  shot in the arm to rural communities that are going to be able to  create world-class recreation destinations and look at that recreation  economy as an increasing opportunity to build a more secure economic  future.   Especially important are some of the protections this bill gives to  the Rogue River in Southern Oregon. Fifty-one years after President  Johnson named the Rogue to the original Wild and Scenic Rivers Act,  this bill adds just over 120 miles of important Rogue River tributaries  to the list. In doing so, this bill further protects and safeguards the  mighty Rogue that the iconic western author Zane Grey put on the map  when he wrote about the wilderness and remoteness of the river from his  cabin at Winkle Bar nearly one century ago.   With these designations, Oregon will now have more miles of Wild and  Scenic Rivers than any other State in the contiguous 48. Stay tuned,  folks. Alaska is the only State that has more miles designated, but  given that State is about six times the size of my Oregon, I still  think we are in a position to catch up.   As the Governor who gave the public access to all of Oregon's beaches  and passed the Nation's first bottle recycling bill, Tom McCall valued  those who volunteered to keep Oregon so special. He was a great  champion of promoting volunteers--again, something that historically  has been bipartisan.   I ran the legal aid program for older people for a number of years-- the Gray Panthers, for about 7 years--and shortly before he passed, Tom  McCall came to see me. I had never been elected to anything. I was  stunned that such an important person would come to see an obscure  fellow like myself. He was talking about the elderly, and it really led  to a broader discussion of volunteerism and people participating,  getting involved in their communities, and because he was always  working to get people involved in cleaning up our beaches, and then he  passed the Nation's first bottle recycling bill, he always came back-- as he did that day when he came to see me--to talking about how  volunteerism is a big part of what keeps Oregon so special.   In that spirit, this bill honors the conservation legacy of two  Oregonians who spent their lives working to keep Oregon special--Frank  and Jeanne Moore.   Frank Moore just embodies the Oregon way. He served in World War II,  and he returned to Oregon and settled with Jeanne in North Umpqua,  guiding generations of anglers on the river. Frank and Jeanne dedicated  their lives to preservation and conservation of the Umpqua River.   For somebody who knows a thing or two about casting a fly rod, Frank  Moore understood just how important protecting the river is. I and my  colleagues have felt it is long past time to honor Frank and Jeanne's  legacy along the river and in their community. That is what this bill  does.   I went and visited them not long after we made a judgment that we  wanted to protect these Oregon icons and their conservation legacy, and  now Frank and Jeanne Moore will be recognized in this bill for  protecting nearly 100,000 acres of Forest Service land near the North  Umpqua River through  [[Page S1186]]  the inclusion of the Frank and Jeanne Moore Salmon Sanctuary.   As anybody who works on public lands legislation knows, sometimes it  is hard to find a balance in order to get public lands legislation  passed. Nobody gets everything they want. Nobody gets everything they  believe they ought to have. The question is, can you bring people  together.   I am going to close by way of saying I have highlighted a number of  provisions that I am glad we got in here. It was 10 years earlier when  then-President Obama signed seven pieces of public lands legislation  that I was the lead author of. So these opportunities don't come along  all the time.   There are additional protections that I wish were in this bill we  will vote on in a few hours. I particularly wanted further protections  for the Rogue and the Molalla Rivers. I want to say to the people I am  so honored to represent at home that as soon as we get this done, we  are going to go back and start building support to get those  protections through Congress in the future, and I am optimistic that if  we can have the same kind of cooperation I have been talking about this  morning, we can get them across the finish line.   This public lands bill may not be perfect, but it is a major  accomplishment. If you had told me, in a polarized political climate  like the one we have today, that we could get a permanent authorization  for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, I would have said, ``No way.  Can't happen,'' but now we have real protection for, as it is called,  LWCF.   I am just going to close by mentioning, finally, my friend, our late  Republican Governor, Tom McCall. He embodied--and you see it in this  book, ``Fire at Eden's Gate: The Oregon Story.'' Tom McCall, a  Republican, embodied Oregon's long and proud history of conservation.   I want to close by saying the reason I focused on Tom McCall this  morning is that he is part of a historical legacy. Sometimes, over the  last few years, I have gotten the sense that that historical principle  that protecting public lands was not a partisan issue--sometimes I felt  it was just slipping away. Today, it seems to me, we are pushing back.  We are headed in the right direction, and protecting the special places  my home State is known for is something that gives me great pride. It  is also something you bring some humility to because Tom McCall was in  a league of his own with respect to protecting our treasures, and I am  very glad today, with the Oregon provisions in this bill, we can build  on Tom McCall's legacy. I am proud to have been able to play a role in  making sure those provisions that help Oregon and our country have been  included in this bill.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
