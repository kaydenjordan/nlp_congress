 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Former President Obama was never a champion of the Second Amendment  right to keep and bear arms. He fought to deny Americans their  constitutional rights throughout his whole 8 years in office. In fact,  on his way out the door, former President Obama finalized a rule that  discriminates against individuals with disabilities and that deprives  law-abiding Americans of their Second Amendment rights. Under this  rule, certain Social Security disability beneficiaries, who also need  help, would be stripped of their Second Amendment rights. More  specifically, their names would be reported to the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System.   Mr. Speaker, just because someone has a disability does not mean he  is a threat to society. Furthermore, needing help to manage your  benefit does not make you dangerous; but you don't have to take my word  for it as the disability community has also raised serious concerns  with regard to this rule.   The National Council on Disability, which is the independent agency  that is charged with advising Congress and the President on disability  policy, said:   ``There is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to manage  money and the ability to safely and responsibly own, possess or use a  firearm.''   In addition, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record many letters of  support I have received for my bill from one of the disability  community's Second Amendment groups and civil rights groups and others.                                 National Council on Disability,                                   Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: I write on       behalf of the National Council on Disability (NCD) regarding       the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA)       released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of       the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. In       accordance with our mandate to advise the President,       Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,       programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with       disabilities, NCD submitted comments to SSA on the proposed       rule on June 30th, 2016. In our comments, we cautioned       against implementation of the proposed rule because:        ``[t]here is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to       manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own,       possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not only       unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with       disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the       stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a       representative payee[.]''        Despite our objections and that of many other individuals       and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed       rule, the final rule released in late December was largely       unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional       right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule       legitimizes, NCD recommends that Congress consider utilizing       the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule.        NCD is a nonpartisan, independent federal agency with no       stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control       other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun       possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual       disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to       whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to       themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.       Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction       on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only       after the individual has been afforded due process and given       an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not       able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her       disability. NCD believes that SSA's final rule falls far       short of meeting these criteria.        Additionally, as NCD also cautioned SSA in our comments on       the proposed rule, we have concerns regarding the ability of       SSA to fairly and effectively implement this rule--assuming       it would be possible to do so--given the long-standing issues       SSA already has regarding long delays in adjudication and       difficulty in providing consistent, prompt service to       beneficiaries with respect to its core mission. This rule       creates an entirely new function for an agency that has long       noted that it has not been given sufficient resources to do       the important work it is already charged with doing. With all       due respect to SSA, our federal partner, this rule is simply       a bridge too far. In fact, it is conceivable that attempts to       implement this rule may strain the already scarce       administrative resources available to the agency,  [[Page H897]]       further impairing its ability to carry out its core mission.        The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory       overreach, and NCD urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In       this particular case, the potential for real harm to the       constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and       intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to       undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of       people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their       basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCD feels that       utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only       warranted, but necessary.            Regards,                                                    Clyde E. Terry,      Chair.                                   ____                                          National Rifle Association                                                      of America,                                                        Fairfax, VA.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: I am writing       on behalf of the National Rifle Association Institute for       Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) to urge you to vote yes on H.J.       Res. 40. This measure is a joint resolution to disapprove,       under the Congressional Review Act, a Social Security       Administration (SSA) rule that would result in hundreds of       thousands of law-abiding Americans permanently losing their       Second Amendment rights.        SSA claims its rule was mandated by the NICS Improvement       Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA), as interpreted by the Obama       administration's Department of Justice. The supposed intent       of the rule is for SSA to identify disability or       Supplementary Security Income beneficiaries who qualify as       prohibited ``mental defectives'' under the Gun Control Act       (GCA) and report them to the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS).        NICS came online nearly 20 years ago, but at no point       before this new regulation did SSA consider its own       operations or decisions as somehow implicated by the       prohibitions in the GCA. Clearly this was not provoked       because of the NIAA or because of changes in the SSA's own       procedures, but because of the antigun politics of the Obama       administration. President Obama made clear that if Congress       would not support his desire for increased gun control, he       would act on his own. That's why he issued this proposal in       the final days of his administration.        The SSA received over 91,000 comments in response to its       proposed rule, the overwhelming majority of them in       opposition. Comments submitted by NRA-ILA explained in detail       how the rule misread the underlying statutes; ignored binding       case law; targeted harmless individuals who do not pose a       risk of harm; violated due process; and hijacked the SSA's       legitimate functions for political purposes.        Our opposition was joined by mental health professionals       and advocates for the mentally ill, who argued that the       proposal was not supported by evidence or science; added to       the stigma of mental illness; and created disincentives for       mentally ill persons to seek help and benefits to which they       are entitled.        Reporting law-abiding, non-dangerous individuals to NICS       and forcing them, as a condition of removal, to prove they       are not a threat to society is inconsistent with the GCA, the       Second Amendment and basic due process.        For these reasons, the NRA strongly supports H.J. Res. 40.       Because of the importance of this issue to NRA members and       gun owners throughout the country, votes on H.J. Res. 40 will       be considered in future candidate evaluations and we will       notify our members accordingly.            Sincerely,      Chris W. Cox.                                   ____                                              National Coalition for                                          Mental Health Recovery,                                   Washington, DC, January 29, 2017.

Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: I write on       behalf of the National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery       (NCMHR) regarding the final rule the Social Security       Administration (SSA) released on December 19th, 2016,       implementing provisions of the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of       2007, 81 FR 91702.        NCMHR submitted comments to SSA on the proposed rule in       June 2016. In our comments, we cautioned against       implementation of the proposed rule because there is no       causal connection between the inability to manage money and       the ability to safely and responsibly own, possess or use a       firearm. This arbitrary linkage not only unnecessarily and       unreasonably deprives individuals with disabilities of a       constitutional right, it increases the stigma for those who,       due to their disabilities, may need a representative payee.        Despite our objections and that of many other individuals       and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed       rule, the final rule released in late December was largely       unchanged.

NCMHR is a nonpartisan, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit with no       stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control       other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun       possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual       disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to       whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to       themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.

Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Office of the Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The Co-      Chairs of the Rights Task Force of the Consortium of Citizens       with Disabilities (CCD) urge you to support a Congressional       Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule       issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on       December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement       Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule would require the Social       Security Administration to forward the names of all Social       Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental       Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a       representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a       mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background       Check System (NICS).        The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is the       largest coalition of national organizations working together       to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the self-      determination, independence, empowerment, integration and       inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all       aspects of society.        Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the CCD Rights       Task Force conveyed its opposition to the rule through a       letter to the Obama Administration and through the public       comment process. We--and many other members of CCD--opposed       the rule for a number of reasons, including:        The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public       dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people       with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there       is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed       by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.        The absence of any data suggesting that there is any       connection between the need for a representative payee to       manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a       propensity toward gun violence.        The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior       to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.       Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to       transmit the names of individuals who have been       ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own       affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication       and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly       unable to manage their own affairs.        Based on similar concerns, the National Council on       Disability, an independent federal agency charged with       advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies       regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the       Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.        We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to       disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it       inflicts on the disability community.

Vote YES on the Resolution of Disapproval, H.J. Res. 40           (Social Security Administration NICS Final Rule)      Vote NO on the Resolution of Disapproval, H.J. Res. 37           (Federal Acquisition Regulation/Fair Pay and Safe           Workplaces EO)         Dear Representatives: On behalf of the American Civil       Liberties Union (ACLU), we urge members of the House of       Representatives to support the resolution disapproving the       final rule of the Social Security Administration which       implements the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007.        Additionally we urge members to oppose the resolution of       disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of       Defense, the General Services Administration, and NASA       relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that implement       the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order 13673.      Social Security Administration (SSA)'s Implementation of the NICS     Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007 Harms People with Disabilities         In December 2016, the SSA promulgated a final rule that       would require the names of all Social Security Disability       Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)       benefit recipients--who, because of a mental impairment, use       a representative payee to help manage their benefits--be       submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System (NICS), which is used during gun purchases.        We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the       harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a       vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent. There is no       data to support a connection between the need for a       representative payee to manage one's Social Security       disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. The       rule further demonstrates the damaging phenomenon of       ``spread,'' or the perception that a disabled individual with       one area of impairment automatically has additional, negative       and unrelated attributes. Here, the rule automatically       conflates one disability-related characteristic, that is,       difficulty managing money, with the inability to safely       possess a firearm.        The rule includes no meaningful due process protections       prior to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.       The determination by SSA line staff that a beneficiary needs       a representative payee to manage their money benefit is       simply not an ``adjudication'' in any ordinary meaning of the       word. Nor is it a determination that the person ``[l]acks the       mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs'' as       required by the NICS. Indeed, the law and the SSA clearly       state that representative payees are appointed for many       individuals who are legally competent.        We recognize that enacting new regulations relating to       firearms can raise difficult questions. The ACLU believes       that the right to own and use guns is not absolute or free       from government regulation, since firearms are inherently       dangerous instrumentalities and their use, unlike other       activities protected by the Bill of Rights, can inflict       serious bodily injury or death. Therefore, firearms are       subject to reasonable regulation in the interests of public       safety, crime prevention, maintaining the peace,       environmental protection, and public health. We do not oppose       regulation of firearms as long as it is reasonably related to       these legitimate government interests.        At the same time, regulation of firearms and individual gun       ownership or use must be consistent with civil liberties       principles, such as due process, equal protection, freedom       from unlawful searches, and privacy. All individuals have the       right to be judged on the basis of their individual       capabilities, not the characteristics and capabilities that       are sometimes attributed (often mistakenly) to any group or       class to which they belong. A disability should not       constitute grounds for the automatic per se denial of any       right or privilege, including gun ownership.     Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Regulations Advance Worker Safety and                                   Rights         The rules implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces       Executive Order take an important step towards creating more       equitable and safe work conditions by ensuring that federal       contractors provide workplaces that comply with federal labor       and civil rights laws.        Employers that have the privilege of doing business with       the federal government must meet their legal obligations. The       Fair Pay and Safe Workplace regulations are crucial because       they help ensure that federal contractors behave responsibly       and ethically with respect to labor standards and civil       rights laws and that they are complying with federal labor       and employment laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act       (which includes the Equal Pay Act), Title VII of the Civil       Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and       the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and their state law       equivalents. The Executive Order also bans contractors from       forcing employees to arbitrate claims under Title VII of the       Civil Rights Act as well as claims of sexual harassment and       sexual assault.        Congress should stand with workers, increase the       accountability of federal contractors and oppose any attempts       to undo the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulations. These       rules will help ensure that the federal government does not       contract with employers that routinely violate workplace       health and safety protections, engage in age, disability,       race, and sex discrimination, withhold wages, or commit other       labor violations.        If you have any questions, please feel free to contact       Vania Leveille, senior legislative counsel.            Sincerely,      Faiz Shakir,        Director, Washington Legislative Counsel.      Vania Leveille,        Senior Legislative Counsel, Washington Legislative Office.                                   ____           The Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law,                                  Washington, DC, January 30, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Office of the Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The Bazelon       Center for Mental Health Law urges you to support a       Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the       Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)       on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' The Center is a       national legal advocacy organization that protects and       advances the rights of adults and children with mental       disabilities.        This rule would require the Social Security Administration       to forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance       (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit       recipients who use a representative payee to help manage       their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National       Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).        The rule is inconsistent with the statute it implements,       has no evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate       inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental       disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too-      scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the       agency's longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits       applications toward a mission in which the agency has little       expertise.        First, there is no statutory basis for the rule. The       National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)       statute authorizes the reporting of an individual to the NICS       database on the basis of a determination that the person       ``lacks the capacity to contract or manage his own affairs''       as a result of ``marked subnormal intelligence, or mental       illness, incompetency condition or disease.'' The appointment       of a representative payee simply does not meet this standard.       It indicates only that the individual needs help managing       benefits received from SSA.        Second, the rule puts in place an ineffective strategy to       address gun violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis,       targeting individuals with representative payees and mental       impairments as potential perpetrators of gun violence. In       doing so, it also creates a false sense that meaningful       action has been taken to address gun violence and detracts       from potential prevention efforts targeting actual risks for       gun violence.        Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association       of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important       efforts to promote community integration and employment of       people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people       with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or       services, or from applying for financial and medical       assistance programs.        Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA       without providing any additional resources. Implementation of       the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work       of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to       overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are       waiting for months and years for determinations of their       benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to       make the determinations about safety that it would be called       upon to make as part of the relief process established by the       rule.        Based on similar concerns, the National Council on       Disability, an independent federal agency charged with       advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies       regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the       Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge       Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this       new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the       disability community.            Sincerely,                                                   Jennifer Mathis,                             Director of Policy and Legal Advocacy.   [[Page H899]]                                      time  1400     Mr. Speaker, we need to put a stop to this  rule now. That is why I introduced H.J. Res. 40, along with Congressman  Abraham, to overturn this rule and make sure the constitutional rights  of individuals with disabilities are protected.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and pass this resolution.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   This is about constitutional rights of individuals with disabilities.  Just because someone has a disability does not mean they are a threat  to society. Furthermore, needing help to manage your benefits does not  make you dangerous.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record additional letters of support.                                             American Association of                                        People with Disabilities,                                   Washington, DC, January 26, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Office of the Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The       American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) urges       you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to       disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security       Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation       of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule       would require the Social Security Administration to forward       the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)       and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who       use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due       to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS).        AAPD is a national disability rights organization that       works to improve the lives of people with disabilities by       acting as a convener, connector, and catalyst for change,       increasing the economic and political power of people with       disabilities.        Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, AAPD conveyed its       opposition to the rule to the Obama Administration. We, and       many other disability rights organizations, opposed the rule       for a number of reasons, including:        1) The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public       dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people       with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there       is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed       by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.        2) The absence of any data suggesting that there is any       connection between the need for a representative payee to       manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a       propensity toward gun violence.        3) The absence of any meaningful due process protections       prior to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.       Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to       transmit the names of individuals who have been       ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own       affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication       and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly       unable to manage their own affairs.        AAPD urges Congress to act, through the CRA process, to       disapprove this new rule to prevent the damage that it       inflicts on the disability community and the extraordinarily       damaging message it sends to society that people with mental       impairments could should be feared and shunned.  [[Page H905]]         Thank you for taking our position into consideration.            Yours truly,                                                  Helena R.

ADAPT urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA)       resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social       Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016,       ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of       2007.'' This rule would require the Social Security       Administration to forward the names of all Social Security       Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income       (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to       help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the       National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).        ADAPT is a national grass-roots community that organizes       disability rights activists to engage in nonviolent direct       action, including civil disobedience, to assure the civil and       human rights of people with disabilities to live in freedom.        We oppose the rule for a number of reasons, including:        1) The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database.

Hon. Chuck Grassley,      U.S. Senator, Iowa,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ralph Abraham,      5th District, Louisiana,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Johnson,      Chairman, Social Security Subcommittee, House Committee on           Ways and Means, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Grassley, Chairman Johnson, and Congressman       Abraham: On behalf of the 1.3 million members of AMAC, the       Association of Mature American Citizens, I am writing in       support of the Joint Resolution to protect certain Americans'       Second Amendment rights, H.J. Res. 40. Using the       Congressional Review Act, this Joint Resolution is meant to       undo a Social Security Administration (SSA) regulation that       would deprive thousands of Americans who are disabled and who       utilize a ``representative payee'' in order to acquire their       benefits of their ability to purchase a firearm. This       regulation is both unnecessary and unfair to thousands of       law-abiding seniors and citizens who wish to exercise their       basic Second Amendment rights.        In December 2016, SSA finalized a rule providing that any       American receiving disability benefits due to a ``mental       disability'' and who are also receiving assistance in       managing their benefits should be labeled ``mentally       defective.'' As a result, those who are inappropriately       labeled as ``mentally defective'' are mandatorily reported to       the National Instant Criminal Background Check System--a       federal list of people who are barred from purchasing       firearms--as required by the Gun Control Act. This finalized       rule unjustly equates persons with disabilities and those who       require assistance to manage their benefits to those who are       actually ``mentally defective.''        Aside from the fact that this regulation inappropriately       equates disabled persons relying on representative payees       with those who are ``mentally defective,'' AMAC objects to       the way in which this regulation has been implemented. Over       the past several years, Americans, particularly seniors, have       been at the mercy of executive overreach and mandate. As       millions of American seniors rely on SSA for their retirement       income, the burden of this regulation has been largely       concentrated in our communities. This Joint Resolution is a       welcome reprieve to seniors who have had their Second       Amendment rights subverted by an administration and agency       with significant influence over their retirement income.        As an organization committed to representing the interests       of mature Americans and seniors, AMAC is dedicated to       ensuring senior citizens' interests are protected. This       midnight regulation has placed an undue burden on those       requiring assistance to manage their benefits and who suffer       from disability. As an organization, we thank Senator       Grassley, Chairman Johnson, Congressman Abraham, and their       respective staffs for their quick response and steady resolve       to protect seniors and those who have been affected by this       regulation. We ask Congress to quickly pass this Joint       Resolution and restore the basic Second Amendment rights this       rule has abridged.            Sincerely,                                                         Dan Weber,      President and Founder of AMAC.                                   ____                                                          The Arc,                                   Washington, DC, January 30, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Office of the Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The Arc of       the United States (The Arc) writes to urge you to support a       Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the       Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)       on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule would require       the Social Security Administration to forward the names of       all Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)       disability beneficiaries who use a representative payee to       help manage their benefits, and who have been found eligible       by meeting or equaling an SSA mental impairment listing, to       the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).        The Arc is the largest national community-based       organization advocating for people with intellectual and       developmental disabilities (I/DD) and their families, with       over 660 state and local chapters nationwide. The Arc is       devoted to promoting and protecting the human and civil       rights of people with intellectual and developmental       disabilities and has over 60-years of history of advocating       for the rights of children and adults with disabilities. The       Arc is concerned about the safety of all Americans, including       through gun violence. However, The Arc--and many other       members of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities       (CCD)--opposes the rule for a number of reasons, including:        The damaging message that may be sent by an SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public       dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people       with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there       is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed       by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.        The absence of any data suggesting that there is any       connection between the need for a representative payee to       manage ones Social Security disability benefits and a       propensity toward gun violence.        The absence of any meaningful due process protections when       interfering with an individual's constitutional right, prior       to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.       Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to       transmit the names of individuals who have been       ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own       affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication       and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly       unable to manage their own affairs.        The potential for the rule to deter some people with mental       impairments from seeking access to the Social Security and       SSI disability benefits that they are eligible for, out fear       of being added to the NICS or having their privacy violated.        We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to       disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it       inflicts on the disability community.            Respectfully Submitted,                                                        Marty Ford,                           Senior Executive Officer, Public Policy.

Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Office of the Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The       Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) urges you to support a       Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the       Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)       on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule would require       the Social Security Administration to forward the names of       all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and       Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use       a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a       mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background       Check System (NICS).        The Autistic Self Advocacy Network is a nationwide       501(c)(3) advocacy organization run by and for autistic       people ourselves. ASAN promotes public education and public       policies that are aimed at eliminating stigmatizing attitudes       and increasing autistic Americans' access to all aspects of       the community.        Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the Autistic Self       Advocacy Network conveyed its opposition to the rule through       a letter to the Obama Administration and through the public       comment process, in addition to joining in public comments as       a member of the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities       Rights Task Force. We--and many other disability rights       organizations--opposed the rule for a number of reasons,       including:        1) The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database.

House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative, You will soon consider a number of       resolutions that will disapprove rules offered within the       last six months of the Obama Administration, pursuant to the       Congressional Review Act. On behalf of the more than one       million members and supporters of the Council for Citizens       Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I urge you to support the       following resolutions:        Rep. Bill Johnson's (R-Ohio) resolution to disapprove the       Department of the Interior's (DOI) Stream Protection rule.       The rule rewrites more than 400 regulations, while       threatening one-third of the nation's coal mining workforce.       The rule would also override preferable existing regulations       at both the state and federal level.        Rep. Bill Huizenga's (R-Mich.) resolution to disapprove the       Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rule, ``Disclosure       of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers.'' The SEC, whose       mission is to maintain efficient markets, estimates       compliance of the rule could reach $591 million annually. The       rule also fails to protect investors and prevents capital       formation.        Rep. Sam Johnson's (R-Texas) resolution to disapprove a       rule promulgated by the Social Security Administration       relating to the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System (NICS). This rule misinterprets the NICS Improvements       Amendment Act, and it allows disability or Supplemental       Security Income beneficiaries to be deemed ``mental       defectives'' in NICS without any due process as required by       law.        Rep Virginia Foxx's (R-N.C.) resolution to disapprove the       so-called ``blacklisting'' rule promulgated by the Department       of Defense, General Services Administration, and National       Aeronautics and Space Administration. This rule requires       employers bidding on federal contracts to disclose both       violations and alleged violations of state and federal labor       laws for every contract bid, and to update that information       every six months during the contract. This rule unnecessarily       drives up the cost of projects, violates due process, and       puts small business at a disadvantage.        Rep. Rob Bishop's (R-Utah) resolution to disapprove the       Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Venting and Flaring rule.       This rule is an example of agency overreach, as BLM lacks the       statutory authority to regulate air quality. Further, the       rule fails to address BLM's real problem: a backlog of       permits for the pipelines, in turn forcing the methane       companies to vent and flare gases wastefully.        It is critical that Congress removes as many of the       ``midnight regulations'' as possible forced on taxpayers by       the previous administration. All votes on these resolutions       will be among those considered for CCAGW's 2017 Congressional       Ratings.            Sincerely,                                                     Tom Schatz.       President.                                   ____                                            Disability Law Center,                                    Anchorage, AK, January 25, 2017.      Re: Social Security ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement           Amendments Act of 2007''.       Sen. Lisa Murkowski,      Anchorage, Alaska.      Sen. Dan Sullivan,      Anchorage, Alaska.      Congressman Don Young,      Anchorage, Alaska.        Dear Senators Murkowski and Sullivan, and Congressman       Young: This past summer, our office commented on Social       Security's propsal to report certain beneficiaries to the       federal firearms database. A copy of these comments is       attached. Despite those comments, and many others, the agency       went ahead with its proposal. 81 Fed. Reg. 91702 (December       19, 2016). According to press reports today, you will soon       have before you a joint resolution disapproving these new       regulations. This is to urge you carefully to consider, and,       if appropriate, pass this joint resolution.        This is not a situation where Congress would be asserting       its political will over an agency that carefully analyzed the       comments on its proposed regulations and responded to those       comments in a thoughtful way. Instead, in its responses to       comments, Social Security:        1) Simply failed to take into account that its disability       determination process does not purport to decide whether       someone is a ``mental defective,'' that Social Security is       not the kind of ``court, board, commission, or other lawful       authority'' that makes such findings, and that written       decisions saying that someone qualifies for benefits       typically do not mention whether the person meets or equals       the mental Listings, thus omitting information necessary for       people to decide whether to appeal. 81 Fed. Reg. at 91703.        2) Relied, repeatedly, for its legal analysis on a DOJ       Guidance that has not been published anywhere, let alone       published in the Federal Register. 81 Fed. Reg. at 91703,       91704, 91706.        3) Responded to the suggestion that people might not apply       for disability benefits they deserved because they would be       reported to the database by saying that the reason they were       on the database would be kept private, so they would not be       ``stigmatized'' or ``embarrassed.'' 81 Fed. Reg. at 91707. It       isn't a matter of stigmas or embarrassments. It's a matter of       wanting to own a firearm and being discouraged from applying       for benefits because you know that if you get benefits you       may lose your property.        4) Agreed that the process can assign someone a       representative payee even though the person is competent, 81       Fed. Reg. at 91709-10, but did not see that this fact ought       to keep that person from going onto the federal firearms       database; and        5) Completely failed to analyze whether putting someone on       the database restricts Alaskan subsistence activities as       protected by ANILCA.        This is agency decisionmaking that is, for want of a better       word, wrong. It deserves to be analyzed and rejected under       the Congressional Review Act.     Mr. Speaker, as the ACLU said: ``We oppose  this rule because it advances and reinforces the harmful stereotype  that people with mental disabilities, a vast and diverse group of  citizens, are violent. There is no data to support a connection between  the need for a representative payee to manage one's Social Security  disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence.''   Mr. Speaker, we must act today to protect the rights of individuals  with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of H.J. Res. 40, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
