 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of a  legend in Arkansas sports, the late Razorback track and field coach  John McDonnell.   Coach McDonnell was laid to rest last week, leaving a truly  remarkable legacy: the most decorated coach in NCAA history, having won  40 national championships in indoor and outdoor track and cross  country. He was the national coach of the year 30 times and is  responsible for six NCAA triple crowns at Arkansas.   He coached and mentored some of the world's best athletes: Southwest  Conference champions, Southeast Conference champions, NCAA champions,  and Olympic champions. He himself was an outstanding runner, and he  knew how to help his student-athletes become successful.   Coach McDonnell was a native of Ireland. He came to the U.S.,  graduated from Southwest Louisiana, and earned his citizenship in 1969.   He devoted his life to inspiring young people to excel. On the many  occasions that I had a chance to visit with Coach McDonnell, I always  came away thankful that we in America were blessed to have him.   When the starting gun fires and they are calling the Hogs on the  track that bears his name, we will all be reminded of his legacy of  good works and great coaching and his unrelenting Razorback spirit.   My deepest condolences to his wife of more than 50 years, Ellen,  children Sean and Heather, and the rest of the McDonnell family.                            ____________________
