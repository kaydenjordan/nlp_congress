 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering a bill that purports to make it  easier for small businesses to obtain coverage, and tomorrow we will  vote on a bill that will take away health insurance coverage for 24  million Americans and force everyone else to pay more for less. So not  only are we considering a bill today that will make things worse, we  are considering it a day before we vote on ruining health security for  working families in order to provide tax cuts for the wealthy.   As we debate the possible replacement of the Affordable Care Act, I  think it is instructive that we look back at what the situation was  before the ACA passed.   Listening to some, you would think that the costs weren't going up at  all. In fact, costs were going through the roof before the ACA, and  small businesses, particularly, were having spectacular cost  increases--and that is until somebody got sick. At that point, you were  unlikely to be able to afford any insurance at all.   Every year before the ACA, small businesses were dropping insurance  right and left, particularly after somebody got sick. Also, before the  Affordable Care Act, people with preexisting conditions couldn't get  insurance. Women were paying more than men. Millions of people were  losing their insurance every year.   Since then, the costs have continued to go up, but at the lowest rate  in the last 50 years. People with preexisting conditions can get  insurance at the standard rate. Small businesses can cover their  employees through the Affordable Care Act at the average cost, whether  or not anybody in their small business has cancer or diabetes. Women  are not paying more than men. Instead of millions of people losing  their insurance every year, 20 million more people have insurance.   In addition to that, families now enjoy strong consumer protections.  The full name of the Affordable Care Act is the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act. Now there are no caps on what an insurance company  pays, and they can't cancel your policy for anything other than  nonpayment. Preventive services such as cancer screenings are available  with no copay or deductible. Those up to 26 can stay on their parents'  policy, and the doughnut hole is being closed.   The ACA did not cure every problem, but it went a long way to making  Americans healthier and giving them some economic security. It could  have gone further if, in the past 7 years, Republicans would have been  willing to work with Democrats to build on the progress instead of  forcing over 60 votes to repeal all parts of the Affordable Care Act.   If we do anything now, we ought to improve the situation, not make it  worse. The Republican plan makes things worse. The CBO analysis  concluded that 24 million fewer people will have insurance, and most of  those that get insurance in the future will be paying more for policies  that don't deliver as much.   For seniors, particularly, the costs will skyrocket. And, in fact,  the prediction that the rates will go down in  [[Page H2320]]  the future are a result of the conclusion that so few seniors will be  able to buy insurance that they will no longer be in the insurance  pool.   The insurance pool would be younger, and, therefore, the costs would  go down. But that is only because seniors won't be able to afford the  insurance. Therefore, the insurance pool will be younger and cheaper  for those who can actually afford it, but that is not a good thing for  seniors who need the insurance and can't afford it.    So today we are considering another failed policy. The association  plan ideas have been studied for years, and it has been concluded that  it is a bad idea. Under the Affordable Care Act, essentially everybody  pays average. If you change that arithmetic so some can pay a little  less, then arithmetic matters. Everybody else is going to pay a little  more.   In the association plans, quite frankly, I will admit, they will  always work for the few that can get into them. That is because, if you  can draw out your own group, if they are healthier than average and can  pay less, they will pay less and the association will work. But if you  pull out a group and it turns out they are a little sicker than average  and the bids come in above average, then the association will dissolve  and everybody will go back into the insurance pool.   So if you can pull out a group, they will always pay less until  somebody gets sick, and then everybody jumps back into the insurance  pool. The higher cost groups will be left behind. The lower cost groups  will segment out, and then the rates will go down for a few and up for  everybody else.   This is exactly why the American Academy of Actuaries has said that  expanding association plans ``could result in unintended consequences  such as market segmentation that could threaten . . . viability and  make it more difficult for high-cost individuals and groups to obtain  coverage.''   One of the other problems is a lack of regulation. If a group is  allowed to circumvent State regulations, that policy may be cheaper  because the policy is not as good.   There are a lot of ways that you can save money. You can pull out a  group of just young men and save on maternity benefits. That would be  cheaper for them but more expensive for everybody else.   And what happens when a new spouse needs coverage and tries to get it  as an optional benefit? They won't be able to afford it.   Workers and businessowners are likely to get fewer benefits under the  association approach and will be disadvantaged compared to those in the  regular pool getting comprehensive benefits.   This is exactly why Consumers Union has stated that the legislation  is ``likely . . . to provide minimal and nonuniform benefits.''   Mr. Speaker, this bill will make it easier to set up these kinds of  associations and let them avoid State regulations, which could require  solvency, nice solvency requirements, and consumer protections. The  protections in this bill are not sufficient to protect consumers, and  most States would require stronger capital requirements than the bill  requires.   Much like the Republican replacement bill, this bill goes in the  wrong direction, so I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, would the Chair advise us how  much time is available on both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to point out a few letters that we have  received, one from the Diabetes Association, which includes, in part:  ``The Association has serious concerns that AHPs would lead to a two- tiered market, in which AHPs offer inadequate coverage to healthy  groups only, while State-regulated plans provide adequate coverage with  consumer protections but at an increasingly higher premiums. For these  reasons, we urge you to oppose the Small Business Health Fairness Act  of 2017, H.R. 1101.''   We have also received a letter, Mr. Speaker, from the National  Association of Insurance Commissioners. They said in their letter:  ``The legislation as written would eliminate all State consumer  protections and solvency standards that ensure consumers receive the  coverage for which they pay their monthly premium. These protections  are the very core of a State regulatory system that has protected  consumers for nearly 150 years . . . history has demonstrated that AHP- type entities have done more harm than good to small businesses.''   Mr. Speaker, we also received a letter from The Main Street Alliance,  which said: ``In short, H.R. 1101 would result in higher premiums and  poorer coverage for the most vulnerable small-business owners, would  destabilize the small group market, and would lead small-business  owners and employees to assume unnecessary financial risks.''   We also heard from the Consumers Union: ``Consumer's Union has long  raised the inadequacies of AHPs . . . and urges Congress to reject them  as likely to fragment the insurance risk pool and provide minimal and  nonuniform benefits exempt from State benefit mandates.''   We also heard from a long coalition of consumer groups, providers,  and labor unions which said that this bill would just move backward to  a two-tiered system that makes it harder to purchase comprehensible,  affordable coverage for all but a minority of small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these letters.                                  American Diabetes Association,                                                     March 21, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the       nearly 30 million Americans living with diabetes and the 86       million more with prediabetes, the American Diabetes       Association (Association) is writing to express our strong       opposition to the Small Business Health Fairness Act (H.R.       1101). This legislation is nearly identical to legislation       considered by previous Congresses and that last passed the       House of Representatives in 2003. The Association opposed       that legislation and writes now to express our strong       concerns with this bill and the impact it will have for       people with, and at risk for, diabetes.        The legislation would create federally certified       association health plans (AHPs) with the goal of making       coverage more affordable for small businesses by allowing       them to band together to purchase coverage on behalf of a       larger insurance pool. We share the goal of making coverage       more affordable, but not at the expense of required consumer       protections, signed into law in 47 states, which ensure       people with diabetes have access to the services and       financial protection they need.        H.R. 1101 would broadly exempt AHPs from critical state       benefit standards, solvency rules, and consumer protections,       including requirements to cover health services essential to       those with diabetes. Specifically, H.R. 1101 would confer on       AHPs wide authority to:        Determine benefits to be covered: Other than requiring AHPs       to meet limited federal requirements for ERISA-governed       plans, H.R. 1101 would give AHPs broad discretion to omit       important health benefits.        Determine eligibility for coverage: While H.R. 1101 would       require AHPs to comply with ERISA non-discrimination       provisions, the AHP board would retain sole discretion to       approve applications for participation in the plan and to set       premiums based on an employer's health care claims       experience.        Maintain inadequate reserves: H.R. 1101 applies federally       determined solvency standards that are weaker than state       standards, exposing plan members to the risk of insolvency       and unpaid medical bills.        Because AHPs would compete with state-regulated plans on an       uneven playing field, they would likely cherry-pick healthy       small employer groups, making the risk pool in the state-      regulated market less healthy and more costly. In addition,       those who obtain coverage through an AHP would likely have       benefits that lack coverage for essential services and would       expose them to higher out-of-pocket costs and potential plan       insolvencies. In fact, numerous AHPs offered in the past have       gone insolvent and left consumers uninsured and with unpaid       medical bills.        The Association has serious concerns that AHPs would lead       to a two-tiered market, in which AHPs offer inadequate       coverage to healthy groups only, while state-regulated plans       provide adequate coverage with consumer protections but at       increasingly higher premiums. For these reasons, we urge you       to oppose the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017,       H.R. 1101.        If you have questions or would like to discuss this issue,       please contact Rob Goldsmith, Director, Federal Government       Affairs.            Sincerely,                                        Lashawn McIver, MD, MPH,                                  Senior Vice President of Advocacy,                                     American Diabetes Association.

Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Madame Chairwoman and Mr. Ranking Member: The U.S.       House Education and the Workforce Committee is once again       scheduled to consider legislation that would allow a new       category of health insurance company, ``Association Health       Plans (AHPs),'' to form and operate outside the authority of       state regulators and beyond the reach of proven state       consumer protections and solvency laws. This bill, H.R. 1101,       would adversely impact consumers and the National Association       of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) urges you to oppose it.        The NAIC, which represents the nation's insurance       regulators, shares the sponsors' concern for the growing       number of small business owners and employees who cannot       afford adequate coverage. However, the root cause of this       problem is the steadily rising cost of healthcare merely       reflected in premiums, and this legislation would do nothing       to address that reality. In fact, we fear the legislation       could actually increase the cost of insurance for many small       businesses whose employees are not members of an AHP.        Even more troubling than prescribing a treatment that does       not address the underlying disease, the legislation would       actually harm consumers by further segmenting the small group       market, eliminating critical state consumer protections, and       could lead to increased fraud and plan failures. This       legislation would encourage AHPs to ``cherry-pick'' healthy       groups by designing benefit packages and setting rates so       that unhealthy groups are disadvantaged. This, in turn, would       make existing state risk pools even riskier and more       expensive for insurance carriers, thus making it even harder       for sick groups to afford insurance. In addition, the       legislation as written would eliminate all state consumer       protections and solvency standards that ensure consumers       receive the coverage for which they pay their monthly       premium. These protections are the very core of a state       regulatory system that has protected consumers for nearly 150       years. As we have already seen in the past when such plans       were allowed under federal law, consumers will be left with       unpaid claims and nowhere to turn when they are harmed. A       prior law along the lines of H.R. 1101 was repealed because       it was found to harm consumers; the same mistake should not       be made again.        We recognize that supporters of AHPs are well intentioned,       looking for solutions to the same problems we are seeking to       address, but history has demonstrated that AHP-type entities       have done more harm than good to small businesses. A far       broader approach to the existing problems--one that addresses       healthcare spending, allows more innovation, and permits more       state flexibility--is necessary to bring real relief to small       businesses. The federal government and the states need to       work with healthcare providers, insurers and consumers to       implement effective reforms that will curb spending and make       insurance more affordable to small businesses. Rehashing       strategies that have failed would not be a step forward. It       is time to move on and find more effective solutions.            Sincerely,      Ted Nickel,        NAIC President, Commissioner, Wisconsin Office of the       Commissioner of Insurance.      Eric A. Cioppa,        NAIC Vice President, Superintendent, Maine Bureau of       Insurance.

Chairwoman Virginia Foxx,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Bobby Scott,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of       the House Education and Workforce Committee: On behalf of the       Main Street Alliance, I write to express opposition to the       ``Small Business Health Fairness Act'' (H.R. 1101). The Main       Street Alliance is a national network of small business       owners across the country. Access to affordable, high-quality       health coverage has been a core concern for small businesses       for years, and slowing the skyrocketing rate increases       continues to be a top priority for our membership.       Unfortunately, the proposed legislation would erode important       gains in premium stabilization while causing our business       owners to assume unnecessary financial risks.        As you may know, prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA)       small business owners paid substantially more on average for       health coverage and received fewer comprehensive benefits       than larger companies. They also experienced broad       unpredictability in costs, with premiums varying wildly from       year to year. One employee's expensive illness could cause       the insurance rates for the whole firm to spike in subsequent       years.        Critical market reforms instituted through the ACA       addressed many of these concerns. Insurance companies in the       individual and small-group market--including association       health plans--can no longer charge small firms higher       premiums based on their business sector, an employee's health       status, age, or gender. Nor can they offer sub-par plans that       exclude essential services, such as maternity care or       pediatric care. Instead, they must now base their pricing on       the cost of covering all individuals in the market, not just       one firm. Participating in this larger risk pool means that       small business owners, like their larger counterparts, are no       longer vulnerable to sharp swings in their rates based on the       health of a few employees. It also means that they can expect       a basic quality assurance with any health plan they select.        H.R. 1101 would undermine these protections by allowing       small employer groups and individuals to join together to       obtain health insurance through an unregulated association       health plan (AHP). These plans would be exempt from the ACA       reforms identified above, along with any state laws. This       would allow them to ``cherry pick'' good risk through the       design of the benefit package or choice of service area. AHPs       could also have limited risk simply due to the types of       businesses that belong to the association. While AHPs may       save money in the short-term by avoiding costs of consumer       protections, enrollees would receive less robust coverage and       may be left without important protections right when they       need them the most.        Furthermore, the bill would destabilize the small group and       individual market by exacerbating adverse selection, driving       up costs for the most vulnerable enrollees. Under the       proposed legislation, AHPs would compete with other small       group and individual market plans. The proposed legislation       would allow employers with younger, healthier workforces to       withdraw their employees from a state's small group market       thus leaving behind small businesses with older and sicker       employees. While the rates may drop for those businesses that       belong to associations, which offer health coverage, premiums       will increase for the remaining. This adverse selection would       make it harder for higher-cost individuals or groups to       obtain coverage.        Finally, the proposed legislation could expose employers       and employees to financial ruin. The proposed legislation       would allow certain AHPs to self-insure and accept insurance       risk. Because of the current regulatory void, AHPs are not       subject to state solvency requirements that are in place to       ensure insurance companies have sufficient resources to avoid       financial failure. As with unregulated multiple employer       welfare arrangements, AHPs could experience bankruptcies--      leaving millions of small employers and workers without       health coverage due to insolvencies.        In short, H.R. 1101 would result in higher premiums and       poorer coverage for the most vulnerable small business       owners, would destabilize the small group market, and would       lead small business owners and employees to assume       unnecessary financial risks. The Main Street Alliance       strongly urges you to oppose the legislation.        Please feel free to contact Michelle Sternthal, Policy       Director for the Main Street Alliance, with any questions.            Sincerely,                                                 Amanda Ballantyne,      National Director.                                   ____                                                   ConsumersUnion,                                                     March 21, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We are writing today to oppose the       Small Business Health Fairness Act (H.R. 1101) and the       proposed rules for association health plans.        Today, small businesses are already able to join together       to purchase coverage through Association Health Plans (AHPs).       These AHPs are currently regulated by the states, just like       other insurance in the small group market. H.R. 1101 would       allow an AHP to be entirely exempt from state regulation by       being self-insured or following the rules of a single state       nationwide.        ConsumersUnion has long raised the inadequacies of AHPs as       a solution to improving access and strengthening the health       of insurance markets, and urges Congress to reject them as       likely to fragment the insurance risk pool and to provide       minimal and non-uniform benefits exempt from state benefit       mandates. These plans would split the healthy from the sick       and drive up costs for those who do not enroll in them.        As a non-partisan, independent organization that has       advocated for the best consumer products and policies for       more than 80 years, we believe that altering the rules for       AHPs as proposed in this bill would undermine consumers'       access to fairly priced, quality health coverage.        Our objections are that:        AHPs would be offered alongside other small group and       individual market plans.  [[Page H2325]]       However, they would operate under different rules. Past       experience shows this is likely to lead to cherry-picking,       adverse selection, and increased costs for sicker individuals       and small businesses. Put another way, this would lead to       health risk being segmented with the less healthy consumers       excluded from the AHP risk pool. A core, long-held       ConsumersUnion principle is to support broad pooling of risk       as fairer and more cost-effective for consumers. We do not       support lower rates for healthiest consumers at the expense       of older or sicker consumers.        This Act would undermine state consumer protection laws by       restricting the ability of states to regulate AHPs. This loss       of protections could lead to increased fraud, inadequate       coverage and consumer-unfriendly benefit designs. In July       2003, Consumer Reports profiled similar plans in a story       entitled Phony Health Insurance. The story noted that       fraudulent sales and financial instability stiffed consumers       for $65 million in unpaid medical bills.        This Act would give AHPs sole discretion to select what       type of care they will and will not include in their       products; this is a departure from current policy, which only       permits AHPs that meet insurance standards set for the       individual and small group market. Consumers who buy into       these plans will lose the guarantees of care created by the       ACA's essential health benefits and actuarial value       requirements--likely unknowingly--and will have difficulty       knowing what AHPs cover.        It is unlikely that these AHPs will be able to attract       enough members to be able to negotiate more effectively with       providers, compared to large insurers already operating in       these states. Consequently, we do not believe that these       designs will lower costs for consumers.        Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements (MEWAs) once       operated in a regulatory vacuum similar to the one proposed       through H.R. 1101. Self-funded MEWAs had no clear regulatory       authority, as initially it appeared that ERISA exempted them       from state-level regulatory oversight. Multiple MEWA       bankruptcies resulted, and consumers had limited avenue for       redress. In the absence of clear regulatory authority over       AHPs, insolvencies could leave millions of small employers       and workers without health coverage or redress. Current state       solvency standards have a 150 year track record of protecting       consumers and should not be undermined.        We believe there are much better, time-tested ways to       increase the availability, affordability, and accessibility       of health insurance for consumers--approaches that rely on       the wise and accepted insurance principles of broad pooling       of risks and avoidance of risk selection--without resorting       to the detrimental effects of H.R. 1101. We note that the       National Association of Insurance Commissioners, as well as       the American Academy of Actuaries, has similar, grave       concerns about this Act.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to quote from another  letter that we received from Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. They  say: ``We have very serious concerns that H.R. 1101 would create  preferential rules that would allow an AHP to be entirely exempt from  State regulation by being self-insured or follow the rules of a single  State nationwide. Research clearly shows that creating special rules  for AHPs and exempting them from State regulation would lead to major  problems, including . . . increased insolvency risk . . . increased  costs for older, sicker workers.'' Therefore, they are also in  opposition to this legislation.   I include in the Record the entire letter.                               BlueCross BlueShield Association,                                      Washington, DC, March 7, 2017.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Chairwoman and Mr. Ranking Member: The Blue       Cross and Blue Shield Association shares your commitment to       ensuring small employers are able to provide their employees       with high quality, affordable health coverage. However, we       are concerned that H.R. 1101, the ``Small Business Health       Fairness Act'' would not accomplish this critical goal, as it       does not reflect key principles that are essential to       ensuring a viable private health insurance market: (1) all       competitors should abide by the same set of rules; and (2)       states should have clear authority to regulate.        Today, small businesses are able to join together to       purchase coverage through association health plans (AHPs).       AHPs are currently regulated by the states, just like other       insurance in the small group market, and can be a good option       for small employers who want to provide their employees with       affordable coverage.        We have very serious concerns that H.R. 1101 would create       preferential rules that would allow an AHP to be entirely       exempt from state regulation by being self-insured or follow       the rules of a single state nationwide. Research clearly       shows that creating special rules for AHPs and exempting them       from state regulation would lead to major problems,       including:        Increased insolvency risk: The legislation as drafted would       allow for some AHPs to be entirely exempt from state       regulation, and instead operate under very limited federal       rules and oversight. Past experiences with these kinds of       arrangements left millions without health coverage and unpaid       claims due to insolvencies.        Increased costs for older, sicker workers: Ultimately, H.R.       1101 would make it much harder for small employers with       older, sicker workers to obtain coverage. This is because       lower-cost groups would move to a more loosely regulated AHP       with fewer benefit and rating rules, while older and/or high-      cost groups would remain in traditional insurance plans.        Attached is a compendium of research findings, which       provides overwhelming evidence that AHP legislation would       make health insurance less accessible, less affordable and       less secure for small employers and individual consumers.        We look forward to working with you on solutions that can       be taken to improve access and affordability for small       employers.        Sincerely,                                                        Alissa Fox,                                             Senior Vice President.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, association plans will help the fortunate few who can  get in so long as the members of that association remain healthier than  average. But everybody else will pay more. Furthermore, these plans,  when they are formed under the bill, will evade important State  regulations that could improve solvency and provide important consumer  protections.   This is not unlike the philosophy, I guess, on the other replace bill  where 24 million fewer people will have insurance; the rest will pay  more and get less; while millionaires benefit with huge tax cuts. In  this, the fortunate few benefit to the expense of everybody else.   I would hope we would defeat the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to claim  the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the intent of the  amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington, which seems to  allow health association plans that are currently in existence to  continue to operate under existing State and Federal law. In fact,  giving States the ability to regulate association plans is very  important. That is why I oppose the underlying bill.   The amendment also points out another interesting fact, and that is  associations currently exist under current law, and the underlying bill  simply unravels most of the regulations that apply to them, and this  amendment would at least maintain State regulations.   We know that this bill creates winners and losers. The winners are  those who are young and healthy enough to be invited into an  association. The losers are small businesses and employers who are  older, sicker, or just have more costly health bills. There is no  guarantee that plans under this legislation will have the standard  level of benefits or consumer protections, and that is why I am  disappointed that the majority failed to rule any Democratic amendments  submitted to the Rules Committee in order, although each and every one  was germane.   The gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat), who is a member of the  committee, offered an amendment that  [[Page H2328]]  would have protected the ability of the States to regulate any  association health plan, including regulation related to benefits,  consumer protections, and rating restrictions. Representative Torres  from California offered an amendment to ensure that association plans  cover 10 essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act.   One amendment was offered by Representatives Susan Davis of  California and Suzanne Bonamici from Oregon--both committee members-- would have required association plans to provide for women's health  benefits, including maternity care.   Representatives Bonamici, Davis, and Wilson also offered an amendment  to prevent this legislation from taking effect if it would lead to  increased premiums for older workers. These older workers will not be  able to get into the associations because they would increase average  costs of the association, and the point of the association is to get  away from high-cost enrollees like older Americans. So these older  people will be left out of the pool with other older and sicker workers  where they will necessarily be paying more.   It is simple arithmetic. Their amendment would have been particularly  important because we know that the Republican replacement plan contains  an age tax that will severely disadvantage older populations.   None of the Democratic amendments, although germane, were allowed  under the rule, and there does not seem to be any earnest attempt to  look to try to correct the shortcomings of the bill. So while I do not  intend to oppose this amendment, I do not think the amendment is enough  of an improvement of the bill, nor does it change the underlying fact  that the legislation does not adequately protect small businesses,  workers, and their families, nor does it help those left behind who are  not invited into the association who will necessarily be paying more.   Mr. Speaker, if those on the other side of the aisle want to go on a  rescue mission, they ought to improve things, not make things worse.  For most Americans, this bill will make things worse, and, tomorrow, 24  million Americans will be left out while many others will be paying  more for less while millionaires get huge tax cuts. That is not an  improvement.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would point out that when one  size fits all, everybody can benefit; but when you start picking and  choosing winners and losers, some will benefit and many others will  lose. Under this bill, a fortunate few who get into association plans  will benefit; everybody else loses.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
