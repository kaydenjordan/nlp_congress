 Mr. Speaker, in 2012, President Obama was speaking to  some of his supporters in Minneapolis. They were eager to know how he  was planning to make progress on key issues in his second term, given  the uncompromising rabid opposition of the majority in this House.   Here is what President Obama said: ``I believe that if we're  successful in this election, when we're successful in this election,  that the fever may break, because there's a tradition in the Republican  Party of more common sense than that.''   Five years later, I can say--we can all say--that the fever has not  broken. The fever is running as hot as ever. The fever drove this House  majority to threaten default on our Nation's debt, to shut down the  Federal Government, to indulge racist birther conspiracies, to elevate  the very champion of those conspiracies to the Presidency of the United  States.   Ten years ago, I know Republican leaders could not imagine that kind  of conspiracy would spread throughout the Republican Party rank and  file, but it did and it has.   Five years ago, GOP leaders could not have imagined that their party  would nominate Donald Trump and elect him to the Presidency, but they  did.   One year ago, I know Republican leaders could not imagine that they  would cover for the Trump campaign and Trump administration's collusion  with the Russian Government, but they have, and they are.   For far too long, Democrats have wanted to believe that the GOP would  come to its senses. We wanted to believe that it was really just a  fringe minority within the GOP that was the problem, that sober,  sensible leaders like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell wanted to do the  right thing, but they couldn't because of the Tea Party. They couldn't  unless we helped them.   And that is why Democrats bailed out Boehner time after time, jam  after jam. Democrats have to stop deluding themselves. There is only  one Republican Party, and it is the party of Trump.   It is the party whose Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, blocked efforts  by the Obama administration to stop Russian interference in the 2016  election. It is the party that every day looks the other way in the  face of Trump's appeasement of Russia and fails to hold Trump  accountable.   Last week, Congressman Ted Lieu and I introduced two amendments to  the National Defense Authorization Act that the House is debating  currently on the floor.   The first would endorse the intelligence community's assessment  regarding the Russian's meddling in our 2016 election. This is critical  because Donald Trump has repeatedly cast doubt, as recently as  yesterday, on the report that despite unanimous agreement from all of  our intelligence agencies, that indeed there was collusion, that indeed  there was interference by Russians.   The second amendment would block an outrageous Trump administration  initiative to create a new cybersecurity partnership with the Russian  Government. Trump's plan would let the fox into the henhouse and pave  the way for more election interference in our upcoming elections and  others, all at the invitation of Donald Trump.   These would have been two sensible steps that the House of  Representatives could have taken this week to counter interference in  our elections, but last night, the GOP leadership, under Chairman  Sessions and the House Rules Committee, blocked these amendments. They  refused to give these amendments a chance to be debated and voted on  the floor.   As more and more information comes out about Russia, Americans all  over the country keep hoping that the GOP will do the right thing, that  they will put country before party and hold Trump accountable, but they  have not, and they will not.   Just this past week, Donald Trump, Jr., himself released emails that  show unequivocally the Trump campaign's eagerness to collude with the  Russian Government, but that hasn't changed a thing.   It hasn't stopped Speaker Ryan from blocking a Russian sanctions bill  at the Trump administration's request. It hasn't stopped Chairman  Sessions and the Rules Committee from blocking my amendment to set the  record straight on Russian interference and help prevent it in the  future.   The truth is, they are all complicit. It is time to recognize the GOP  majority is not the victim here. They aren't suffering from a fever  that Democrats have to help fight.   It is the United States Congress, as a whole, that has a fever, and  it is the GOP's grip on the majority that is the cause.   It is time for us to face reality. The problem isn't the Tea Party,  it is the Republican Party.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am a Marine Corps infantryman. When I was fighting  door-to-door in Iraq, some of the bravest marines in my unit, men of  valor and patriotism, were Muslims. They stood with the Iraqis to risk  their lives and endangered loved ones to help us.   At this very moment, marines are still fighting in Iraq and  Afghanistan. Many of them are Muslim. They still rely on the steadfast  support of our Muslim allies. That is why I find this amendment so  troubling.                                time  1830    Mr. Chairman, at a time when American forces are deployed across the  Muslim world and depend on the support of Muslim governments, the  Franks amendment will send exactly the wrong message to our friends and  adversaries alike.   By singling out a faith tradition for a strange and unprecedented  study by our military, we are sending a dangerous message and signal  that America is at war with Islam. America is not ever going to be at  war with a single religion.   It is our task as Members of Congress who care about our military and  about the American values that our servicemembers risk their lives for  to defend it and to reaffirm those values, and we can do that by  defeating this misguided amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 13, 2017, on page H5810, the following appeared: amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have available?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I think what we need to remember is there is some  commonality here; and I am reminded of this almost every weekend,  especially when I stay here in Washington, D.C. I go to section 60 of  Arlington National Cemetery to visit my friends that died in the war in  Iraq. In every headstone there, you will see a lot of different symbols  of religions, whether it is the Jewish star, whether it is the Islamic  symbol or the Christian symbol, or the nonbeliever, no symbols  whatsoever.  [[Page H5811]]    The one thing they all have in common is they are all sharing the  same ground. They are all sharing the same sacred ground of Arlington  National Cemetery because they all died for the same American values.  That American value says that we will not ostracize somebody else for  their religion, for who they believe or who they don't believe. Any  steps towards that is dangerous.   If we want to continue to reaffirm the values that those men and  women have died for that are now sitting in section 60, we need to  defeat this amendment and do it because we know it is the right thing  to do, and it reaffirms those American values that those men and women  have died for.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
