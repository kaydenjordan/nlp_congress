 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend and  colleague, Congresswoman Robin Kelly for tonight's special order hour  on gun violence.   Congresswoman Kelly is a stalwart leader against gun violence and  serves as a visible, out-front advocate for putting an end to the gun  violence epidemic.   Far too many children, families, and communities have been devastated  and destroyed by a gun inappropriately in the hands of a shooter.   We have seen far too many deaths, too many young African-Americans  with guns, too many killed by guns.   My district in Central Ohio has seen an alarming rise in gun  violence.   Just this week, Columbus saw its 130th homicide of the year, which is  closing in on an all-time record.   We can and must do better.   I stand with Congresswoman Kelly in her relentless efforts, calling  on the Congress to honor victims through action.   We can join together to pass commonsense gun laws--background checks;  no fly-no buy; and safety locks.   Gun violence is a health epidemic--one that we cannot address in  isolation.   We must fund mental health programs, we must address the needs of  urban communities, and we must provide sustainable community and  economic development initiatives to reduce violence--like community  policing coupled with commonsense gun reforms.   Tonight, Congresswoman Kelly puts a face on the victims of gun  violence. I join and salute her for reading the names of victims.   As we read the names, let us remember that, gun violence isn't a  Democrat or Republican issue--it is an American issue requiring an  American solution.                            ____________________
