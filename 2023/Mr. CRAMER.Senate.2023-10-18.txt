 Madam President, October is the month the  Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute--CCAI--recognizes  individuals across the Nation who make a difference in the lives of  young people in need of foster care and forever homes. My wife Kris and  I are adoptive parents ourselves and share a commitment to adoption and  foster care and applaud the work of the CCAI.   This year, I nominated Roger and Bobbi Loven of Bismarck as among  those honored this year as CCAI Angels in Adoption. I consider it a  privilege to annually recognize the work of individuals and families in  North Dakota who devote years toward loving children in the foster care  system. Roger and Bobbi Loven began foster care when he was doing his  anesthesiology residency in Omaha, NE, in the early 1980s. They took  babies for up to 3 weeks before they were permanently placed with an  adoptive family.   When they moved to Bismarck in 1984, they had already cared for 17  babies. In 1991, while raising three sons of their own, they became  licensed foster care providers in North Dakota. Because Roger is a  medical doctor, they were often contacted about babies coming out of  NICU, including those born with drug addictions and recovering from  withdrawal. They also took babies with physical injuries, including a  3-month-old with a skull fracture and broken bones in every extremity.  Another 2-month-old had been sexually assaulted by the father. They  adopted one foster daughter when she was 4 years old, and following  high school graduation this year, she is attending college. In the 40  years since taking their first, they estimate they have cared for at  least 85 children.   The Lovens enjoy contact with many families whose children they have  fostered. And they mentor countless other adults new to foster care. A  common concern is about getting so attached to the children it is hard  to let them go. ``There are many hard days with foster children, but  the rewards are there too,'' says Roger. ``Being able to see them  thrive and learn to attach to others is worth it.'' They also are  active in a group at their church where caregivers listen to and  support each other in whatever challenges they are facing. ``It's so  important to remain positive,'' Bobbi says.   Roger retired in 2019 after 35 years as an anesthesiologist at  Bismarck's St. Alexius Hospital. Although they talk about pulling back  in the number of children they will take in the future, they continue  to counsel others providing foster care and are in constant contact  with NICU nurses who are well acquainted with this couple and their  loving hearts.   I join all North Dakotans and the entire Congressional Coalition on  Adoption Institute in congratulating and honoring Roger and Bobbi  Loven. We thank you for your years of dedication and the work you  continue to do fostering children in your home and inspiring others to  also become involved. You are exceptionally deserving of recognition as  Angels in Adoption.                            ____________________
