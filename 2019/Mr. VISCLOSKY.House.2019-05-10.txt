 Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in  opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.   We are still waiting for a final damage assessment, and we understand  that the Air Force has just adjusted its original fiscal assessment.   The underlying bill includes $400 million for the airport. The  Cunningham amendment will increase the amount to a total of $670  million.   The need for additional funding is acute. I have two of my colleagues  who will also speak on that need.   I would simply point out that I deeply regret at this late date that  the administration still has not made official requests to fund the  needs of both the Air Force and the Marines in the recovery from last  fall's hurricane.   Absent a comprehensive request, the funds necessary to address the  extensive damage for these key installations will be provided in an  inefficient and piecemeal fashion.   I would urge the administration, and particularly, the Office of  Management and Budget and the Secretary of Defense, to finally send a  full and detailed cost assessment to Congress and properly prioritize  rebuilding of these installations.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Fortenberry), my colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Madam Chair, I support the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of  order.
