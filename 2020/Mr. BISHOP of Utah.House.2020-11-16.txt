 Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop), who has the proper  last name, if not the correct first name.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this longstanding issue has been one that has been  before many Congresses, so I appreciate Mr. Butterfield for his efforts  and Mr. Bishop--both of them North Carolina Representatives--for  bringing their State together and coming up with a cooperative way of  doing it.   The issue with the Lumbees goes back to 1956, as has been mentioned,  but also had, starting in 1988 and 1989 and finishing in the last  administration, conflicting opinions from solicitors of the Interior  Department that have caused this problem regarding the Lumbee Tribe on  what they may or may not pursue as far as administrative recognition or  other issues that are dealt with.   So the proper way when there are conflicting opinions, especially  coming from the executive branch, is for Congress to stand up and do  its responsibility and its duty, and that is what H.R. 1964--which was  a wonderful year for me; I remember it very well--does is allow  Congress to do its responsibility by taking these conflicting opinions  and stating what is the purpose and intent of Congress. This is the  right way of doing things.   Far too often have we tried to use administrative shortcuts when, in  essence, we find out that it produces long-term problems for us. So I  commend Representative Bishop from North Carolina, not only for a great  name, but also for the fact that he is representing his constituency  extremely well, and he is doing it in the proper way in bringing a  piece of legislation to us through markup.   I appreciate, also, the letter that was mentioned by Mr. Huffman as  well, because it is significant. One of the things the majority party  still has to do is make sure there is a CBO score attached to this  bill, perhaps, before it  [[Page H5738]]  goes all the way through, but we have overlooked those in the past. We  don't need to necessarily overlook them in the future going through  there.   But I appreciate what the gentlemen are doing with this process. It  is a positive thing, and I urge all of the Members who are here or who  are not here to pass this one in the affirmative because it is  something that needs to be done. I applaud those who have worked so  hard to get unity within the delegation from North Carolina and move  forward with it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, wish to support H.R. 6237, which is officially  the Proper and Reimbursed Care for Native Americans Act. Over the last  century, Native Americans have served in the U.S. armed services at a  higher per capita rate than any other ethnicity, and with Veterans Day  occurring last week at the same time as the opening of the Native  American Veterans Memorial, I thank those who have served and continue  to serve in this capacity.   Under current law, the Department of Veterans Affairs or the  Department of Defense reimburses the Indian Health Services for any  health-related services provided to Native Americans.   Unfortunately, not all Indian Health Services or Tribally operated  facilities can provide every level of care, and some patients must be  referred. For these situations, the VA or the DOD cannot reimburse the  Indian Health Service or Tribal facility for certain services.   H.R. 6237 would amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to fix  this problem and ensure that the Veterans Administration or the  Department of Defense has authority to pay for the care Native veterans  receive regardless of where those services are provided.   So I have to thank subcommittee Chairman Gallego, who is, himself, a  marine veteran, for his service and ensuring that Native Americans  receive proper care.   I urge adoption of this measure, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, S. 327, requires the Department of the  Interior and the Department of Agriculture to make available, free of  charge, a lifetime national parks and Federal recreation land pass to  any veteran who has been found to have service-connected disabilities.   This builds upon the Secretary of the Interior's, Mr. Bernhardt's,  recent Secretarial order which provided free park and public land  passes to all U.S. veterans and Gold Star families. Providing free  access to our Nation's veterans connects them to the treasured lands  that they fought to protect.   Each year thousands of veterans will benefit by recreating on these  public lands, and providing a park pass is a small token of gratitude  to our Nation's cherished servicemen and -women. So I urge adoption of  this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), who will  explain and introduce this particular bill. The gentlewoman is someone  on our committee who clearly understands the significance of mapping,  especially for storm preparations and flood management and everything  else.   I wish to congratulate Miss Gonzalez-Colon because she is the only  one of us on the floor who just recently was returned here for a 4-year  term.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking  Member Bishop for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 1069. This  legislation authorizes NOAA's Digital Coast Program and ensures coastal  communities have up-to-date data and tools to prepare for storms,  manage floods, restore shorelines, and plan for long-term coastal  resilience.   NOAA's Digital Coast Program has been extremely valuable for  jurisdictions like Puerto Rico, where we have 799 miles of coastline  and 62 percent of our population lives in coastal municipalities. For  instance, after Hurricane Maria devastated the island with powerful  storm surge and flash floods, Digital Coast staffers updated their  Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper to incorporate high-resolution flood maps  for the territory. They also held training sessions on flood mapping  and resilient infrastructure, allowing officials to visualize storm  surge, high tide flooding, sea level rise, and tsunami scenarios in  order to increase our preparedness for such events.   This bill would build upon this work, authorizing NOAA to continue  providing comprehensive mapping information that allows planners and  coastal managers across the Nation to make accurate decisions and smart  investments. This bill will also require NOAA to focus additional data  collection efforts on underserved coastal areas.   As Puerto Rico's sole representative in Congress, I know firsthand  the importance of having reliable coastal data to help respond to  emergencies, to build resilience, and manage water resources.  Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to support S. 1069.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   The Digital Coast Act will enhance Federal, State, Tribal, and local  authorities' decisionmaking regarding coastal resiliency, mapping, and  infrastructure planning. It is one of these good measures that we need  to support. I truly support it. It deals with the entire coast of the  Nation. It deals with the coasts in other areas that are not yet part  of the 50 States--yet--and it deals with the Great Salt Lake. I am  sorry, it deals with the Great Lakes.   What I am saying is the only way you could improve this stupid thing  is if you added the Great Salt Lake into it as well. But as part of the  Intermountain West, I'm used to being ignored by the rest of Congress  as they go merrily on their way, not realizing the kind of value that  we have in the Intermountain West.   So despite that flaw in this particular piece of legislation, I  support it wholeheartedly and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this particular piece.   Mr. Speaker, I inquire of the gentleman from California if he has any  further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon) on this particular bill.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking  Member Bishop.   Mr. Speaker, I express my support for S. 910 to reauthorize the  National Sea Grant College Program, which is a network of 34  university-based programs that support coastal States and territories,  as well.   In 2019, the Sea Grant program generated over $400 million in  economic benefits and supported more than 10,000 jobs. In my district,  the program, based at the University of Puerto Rico, has produced vital  research to address erosion, has developed strategies for the  sustainable use of fisheries, and has contributed to the island's  tourism-based economy through its coral reef restoration efforts.   Puerto Rico's Sea Grant is also a critical source of funding for  research projects that provide data for the development of sound  management plans for our marine resources.   Mr. Speaker, I believe it is crucial that we reauthorize and support  the Sea Grant program, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, as now we come to some of the  [[Page H5744]]  realities of this particular bill and the procedures.   Mr. Speaker, it would be nice if we actually dealt with the good of  the body and recognize that reauthorizations are important so that we  can reevaluate what kinds of programs actually exist and if they are  still necessary. We don't do a very good job in Congress of doing that.  We allow reauthorizations to lapse, and then we simply go on automatic  pilot, unfortunately.   This is the situation with this particular program because the Sea  Grant College Program expired in 2014 and has never been reauthorized  by Congress since that time. The appropriators still put money into it,  even though they are not supposed to do it. But once again, when we, as  a Congress, fail to do the reauthorization investigation and hearings  and prioritize, then we make major mistakes in what we are attempting  to do. We certainly don't have the priorities that we should when these  programs were originally started to make sure that they are doing what  we originally intended them to do, or if, indeed, there needs to be a  change, like including the Great Salt Lake in many of its provisions so  that you actually do something positive for the rest of the world.   Mr. Speaker, Congress in the last year, fiscal year 2019, even though  this was not an authorized program, still spent $72 million to do that,  even though it was eliminated from the administration's budget. The  House in this fiscal year appropriated in the 2020 bill only $71  million for this program.   There is, of course, a glitch in that appropriation, which simply  means that unlike other Senate bills that are coming here to the floor,  this one will not go directly to the President's desk. It has to go  back to the Senate for some kind of a revote and reanalysis with it.  But this is not simply a reauthorization of a program. This is a  reauthorization that changes things, including of which is a much  higher amount with that program.   So, beginning with this bill, this would change it not only from $70  million; it would take it to the $87.5 million for fiscal year 2020 and  add a generous 5 percent increase to each year through 2024. In  addition, it funds an additional $30 million for six specific research  and extension activities.   Now, once again, whether those are justifiable or not--it would be  nice--that should be part of the discussion in a reauthorization  program before you actually come up with these kinds of numbers that go  into that. The increases won't necessarily result in more Sea Grant  marine research or outreach because it also increases the percentage of  funds that can be used by program administration.   Now, the CBO score of this bill is at $513 million. A half-billion  dollars for any program is simply a big deal if it is not considered in  the context of the other priorities that this government should have,  and that is one of the programs and processes that should be done.    So, this bill, like its House companion bill, goes beyond simple  reauthorization. It adds new priorities. It adds new programs that  benefit certain offices more than others. I am not just going to  contend that this has a disproportionate influence on certain bodies,  but let's just say this provides for free office work, fellows that are  placed in offices year after year.   In the latest list of congressional placements and their  opportunities, out of 29 total spots in both the House and the Senate,  only five were put in Republican offices. Maybe there is a reason for  that. Maybe there is simply a process that we are not looking at in the  reauthorization and the way this program is managed, which, once again,  should be considered before you go through the reauthorization approach  to it.   The problem is that some of these positions now go in there, and it  should not be that Congress provides itself its own free staff, but  that is exactly what this is attempting to do. Those free staffs are  involved in drafting legislation that benefits the Sea Grant program,  which is, of course, a built-in conflict of interest.   With those other conflicts of interests, there is another advantage  that has now been built-in for these fellows that I don't think is  appropriate and something we should actually think about properly  before we even go forward with that and decide if these kinds of  programs need to be done at taxpayer expense. The Sea Grant bill also  gives preferential access to Federal jobs. This bill allows the direct  hire of fellows by any Federal agency, regardless of if there are  better qualified candidates.   So, fellows already receive a unique educational professional  experience that provides advancement in opportunities that others in  the same field may not have. Yet, they are now being asked to reduce  the competition to get a job in the Federal workforce to help a select  few in this program.   I am sorry, that is a process that is simply not in the best interest  of good government. It is that process that needs to be revisited, that  should be revisited.   Actually, this also eliminates some of the transparency. Right now,  this program needs to report to Congress on a yearly basis. By this  bill, the advisory board will have to report every other year to  Congress.   I understand that the Sea Grant program is popular among some States,  especially coastal States. Even as a representative from an inland  State, I have to applaud the efforts for research and outreach that are  conducted by Sea Grant universities and institutions, and I also don't  object to fellows at all who are placed in the executive branch. But I  have grave concerns regarding the politicized nature of this program,  the fellowship program. I have problems with the direct-hire incentives  and authorities that are given in this particular program, also,  without actually having some rationale for it, just the mandatory  increase in spending that goes along with this type of program.   Therefore, I cannot vote for this particular piece of legislation.  Obviously, for me, I will vote ``no'' and urge the rejection of this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman has no other  speakers, I yield back the balance of my time.
