 Mr. Speaker, this is an important debate. I have been on  the Energy and Commerce Committee a long time. I am the ranking member  on the Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee which has  jurisdiction on this.   We are in this debate today because emotion is trumping science. We  are  [[Page H27]]  not willing to give the scientific community enough time to say that  this class of chemicals is bad. We want to do something we have never  done. We want to legislatively ban a chemical by legislative fiat, not  by doing the due diligence of the scientific process.   I got lectured last night. We get lectured all the time about how  Republicans don't believe in science on the climate change debate.   Well, then the contrary is true. Democrats don't believe in science  to allow us to have an adequate debate on these chemicals. When we come  to the floor, we talk about PFAS like it is one chemical. PFAS stands  for perfluorinated or polyfluorinated compounds. There are over 7,800  of these types of compounds. Some are long-chain compounds; some are  small-chain compounds, and they are in every aspect of our life.   In fact, the FDA has approved PFAS for food container linings. Let me  get that right. Things that are touching our food, the FDA has  evaluated it and said, this packaging material is safe.   But no, that is not good enough for my colleagues, because emotion,  which we operate on here, especially on the floor of the House--I  taught history and the Constitution, and we are supposed to be the  emotive body. So this is what we do, as House Members we come to the  floor, we cry out we are being harmed; government, save us, without  doing the due diligence of science.   And some of this was mentioned by my colleague, Mrs. Lesko, on her  debate. But in the F-16--here are all the components that are made that  have some form of poly- or perfluorinated compounds in the F-16.   She used one of our favorites; why is this compound good in medical  devices? It is great because--why is it good in military field jackets  for our men and women in uniform? Because it repels water. That is what  makes it great. That keeps our soldiers dry.   I was an infantryman. I would rather be dry in a monsoon than wet,  and that is what Gore-Tex or the Gore technology that uses the PFAS  type of chemical does.   We think there are two that we need to be concerned about--you have  heard about it in the debate; we will hear about it more--PFOA and  PFOS. But that doesn't mean the other 7,798 chemical formulations are  bad.   But what this bill that they are going to be bringing to the floor is  saying, ban them all, even though the FDA said for food packaging it is  safe. Even though it is a lifesaving medical device that is implanted  in the heart of a child who has a hole in their heart, ban that. Don't  worry about it. We will figure out something else to do.   The rule is bad because there were opportunities for the bill to be  fixed and brought to the floor. One dealt with medical devices. A  cardiothoracic surgeon, Larry Bucshon, from Indiana, he offered an  amendment to say, if you are going to have this implantable device, and  then the device is not used and it is put in the landfill, please don't  call that a toxic chemical, because these things save lives. That  wasn't allowed in order.   We are moving into an electric vehicle world. Guess what all these  components of an EV vehicle are going to be? Components with PFAS- connected chemicals.   Lithium batteries, what do you think they have in them? PFAS- connected.   So we have this next chart. Automotive parts containing  fluoropolymers. Here they are. Starter motor, wiper motor, humidity  sensor, engine control unit.   I understand my colleague from Michigan and the firefighter foam  debate. But what do you think this does to the automobile industry,  where you have all these components that are made up of some form?   So what we have been trying to do in working with our colleagues is  say, let's find the ones we can agree upon and move upon.    So let's find the ones that we can agree upon and move  into law.   We worked diligently, and it was mentioned before--so the debate is  also going to come and say, Republicans hate people, we hate health.  Nothing is going to be done. We have to save the Republic, right? Not  true.   Even though I am an authorizer, as I said in the Rules Committee, we  don't like when other committees usurp our authorization, right,  chairman? And we don't like when appropriators do it. But they did it  right at the end of the year.   In the National Defense Authorization Act, it requires EPA to mandate  that drinking water systems monitor unregulated PFAS. Click that off.  We did it.   Provide grants to communities to address this issue. Checkmark. We  did that.   Requires new reporting of PFAS under the Toxic Release Inventory  Program. We did that.   Requires manufacturers and processors of PFAS to submit health and  safety information to the EPA. Another checkmark.    Guidance for appropriate destruction of PFAS, restriction of long  chain.   Let me say something that is really problematic about this bill. It  bans all new uses of PFAS chemicals. We know science creates healthier  environments. So if we are able to create a PFAS system that may not be  a major concern, we can't bring it to market because this bill bans it.   Remember, we are talking about 7,800 formulations.   It was also mentioned by my colleague that, in the omnibus bill, 20  million more dollars to go to communities to address this problem.   So as we go through this debate, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''  They should have brought more amendments allowed to make the bill  better.   Having said that, we can go home--and we did--saying we have  addressed this problem; and this bill, that takes a terrible provision  of doing something we haven't done in 40 years, ever, legislatively ban  a chemical.    Mr. Speaker, this is the only thing that can get signed  into law. We have the Statement of Administration Policy put out last  night that said, in this form, he would veto the bill.   But more challenging is the fact that numerous colleagues on the  other side of the building have said they are done.   We worked with the four corners to address a compromise. What this  amendment does is help move the ball forward that, unfortunately, my  Democrat colleagues could not say yes to when we had three of the four  corners supported; House Republicans, Senate Democrats, Senate  Republicans.   So part of this exercise is to say, oh, you know, we really screwed  up. Now we have got to show the public we are doing something when we  rejected a four-corner compromise that could have been signed into law.   So what we do is--the Lesko amendment is the language, as I  mentioned, that House Democrat and committee leaders rejected as part  of the NDAA; so we are trying to then move and get the final portion of  the most-agreed upon project.   It requires drinking water standards for the best-known PFAS in 2  years, using a science and risk-based approach, and creates an  expedited pathway for PFAS in the future.   Listen, I would rather use total science. I don't want to use  emotion. But the problem is, science takes time and emotion doesn't.                                time  1300    They have to show activity, but if FDA has said some of these  compounds are safe for food packaging, how do we say they are all bad?  Let me say that again. FDA has said some of these compounds are safe  for packaging of food. How do we ban 7,800 different permutations of  the PFAS?   I would not have drafted this proposal this way. There are some ideas  in it that give me pause. But overall, I know how to say yes to solve  problems when they need solving. Making compromise means supporting  things you may not be comfortable with in order to get something  everyone can live with. Don't make the perfect be the enemy of the  good. Take the olive branch. Solve PFAS. Reject partisanship over  problem-solving.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the Lesko amendment.
