 Mr. Speaker, as a young college student, I remember  coming to Washington, D.C., to work at the White House.   I was so inspired that, in 1999, I returned to D.C. through UCLA's  Quarter in Washington Program. It was known as the CAPPP program, which  stands for the Center of American Politics and Public Policy.   This time, my internship experience was very different. The UCLA's  CAPPP program offered something unique, setting it apart from most  programs that focus only on internships. It had a required research  seminar that introduced me to serious original social research and  writing. There is no doubt that this program honed my skill set and  challenged me with a major research project.   At UCLA, the classes were so big that I did not have a similar  opportunity on campus. The program engaged and encouraged me to  seriously explore policy questions of interest to me in a disciplined  way.   In fact, my research was on the issue of racial disparities in public  health, a top priority of mine in Congress today.   The rewards I derived from UCLA's CAPPP Quarter in Washington program  have been shared by many others who have benefited. I have learned that  since my time in the program, CAPPP has brought ever more diverse  cohorts of students, especially women and students of color. CAPPP  demonstrated that top universities like UCLA can be competitive,  excellent, and diverse at the same time.   Every May, UCLA hosts Undergraduate Research Week in its famed Pauley  Pavilion. Over the past several years, CAPPP Quarter in Washington  students have distinguished themselves, winning awards such as Dean's  Prizes and UCLA's coveted Library Prize.   The recent director, a former UCLA professor of mine, Professor James  Desveaux, said that more students from this program--2,500 miles from  Westwood--have participated in UCLA's Undergraduate Research Conference  than from any other program or department in the social sciences or  humanities.   After graduation, CAPPP's alumni have gone on to remarkable  accomplishments. Just a few examples of CAPPP alumni:   The top applicant to Yale Law School in 2018, now an editor at the  Yale Law Journal.   The daughter of Nigerian immigrants who grew up in low-income housing  in Los Angeles was an English major at UCLA with zero training in the  social sciences until the CAPPP program in Washington. Because of her  research in Washington, she gained admission to the prestigious Ph.D.  program at Harvard's Chan School of Public Health in 2020.   Zachary Baron, oversight counsel for the House Committee on Ways and  Means in this very Chamber.   Addar Levi, the Deputy General Counsel for the U.S. Treasury  Department.   The former deputy city attorney for San Francisco.   And the list goes on and on.   This program taught us critical thinking and research skills that  have transformed our lives and set us up to make a real difference in  the world.   As an alumna, I join the UCLA CAPPP alumni group on Facebook. A few  weeks ago, as I was reading my news feed, I got some stunning news:  UCLA's CAPPP program has been dismantled.   I read the former director's farewell letter. The decision had  nothing to do with COVID or funding shortages. The decision was made by  a handful of administrators who believe that having a research  requirement as part of UCLA's internship program in Washington is  unnecessary. Students can do research on the campus, they insisted.   For 31 years, UCLA's CAPPP program demonstrated success. There was  always high demand from its students wanting to engage in research  while interning in Washington. Why deny them this opportunity? After  all, aren't research universities supposed to be about teaching and  research?   As a product of UCLA's CAPPP program, I know its value firsthand. I  believe the skills I learned and the research I conducted had a role in  getting me where I am today.   It truly saddens me to learn the program is coming to an end. This  seems contrary to the mission of the number one public research  university. I hope that UCLA will reconsider and give students the  opportunity to grow from this unique undergraduate opportunity.                            ____________________
