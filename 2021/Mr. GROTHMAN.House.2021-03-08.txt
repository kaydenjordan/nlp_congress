 Madam Speaker, I was hoping when I flew back last night  that the fence would be gone from around the Capitol. Unfortunately, it  is still there. But given the bills we have before us today, maybe it  is only fitting when you look at the Capitol you see a fence around it.  It makes the Capitol appear as if it is a capital of a more  totalitarian state looking at the bills we have before us today.   The first bill is H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. They  call this an assault on the Second Amendment, something our forefathers  put in the Constitution because they knew that the power in this  country has to rest with the people. Instead, we have a bill here  making it much more difficult to transfer a firearm and putting one in  a position where they could face prison or a $100,000 fine if they do  something wrong.   It is just beyond belief. It is hard to believe when you look at this  bill, Madam Speaker, that until 4 years ago when they began a war on  the police, the murder rate in this country had fallen over 20 years in  a row. Unfortunately, the majority is going to try to make it much more  difficult to transfer a firearm as well as create a situation when you  are waiting for your NICS check, if the FBI doesn't get back to you,  you are delayed in getting a firearm.  [[Page H1091]]    Madam Speaker, I urge rejection of the rule.
