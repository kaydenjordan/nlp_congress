 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman  from Massachusetts giving me time.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is simply the latest attempt by extreme  MAGA Republicans to distract from the legal peril facing their twice- impeached, twice-indicted party leader.   This cynical resolution has nothing to do with border security, it  does nothing to stop fentanyl deaths, and it has nothing to do with  constitutional law.   Extreme MAGA Republicans hoped for chaos at the Southwest border when  title 42 pandemic restrictions ended, but migrant encounters last month  actually decreased 15 percent according to Customs and Border  Protection.   Now, since MAGA Republicans have no policy solutions, they are  attempting a backdoor maneuver to advance a baseless impeachment of  President Biden--something they openly admit they wanted to do from day  one.   Under this rule, my committee will have to put aside its homeland  security oversight and authorization activities to deal with the  Boebert resolution, which is predicated on phony policy differences  rather than any allegation that the President committed a crime.   Let that sink in, Mr. Speaker. The House Homeland Security Committee  is going to become a venue for a political Presidential impeachment.   I have proudly served on the committee from its creation, and I guess  if you are around long enough, Mr. Speaker, you will see everything.   Is this distraction for a disgraced ex-President the best way for the  Homeland Security Committee to spend its time?   No, it is not. We know the answer, and it doesn't have to be that  one.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule.
