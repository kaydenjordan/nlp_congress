 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1027, I  call up the conference report on the bill (H.R. 5515) to authorize  appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military activities of the  Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense  activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel  strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on the conference report to accompany H.R.  5515.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, first, I want to express my appreciation to the ranking  member of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Smith, not only for his  work on this conference, but also for his work throughout the process  of bringing this bill to fruition. However strongly he and I may  disagree on some particular issues, it is always clear that he seeks,  first and foremost, to do the right thing for our military personnel  and our country's national security, and I very much appreciate the  opportunity to work with him.   Second, I want to thank all the members of the conference committee  and of the House Armed Services Committee. Each of them has contributed  to this final product, although I suspect none of them is pleased with  everything that is or is not in it.   It is the result of a negotiation between House and Senate Members  with a variety of interests. Taken as a whole, however, I think all  Members who participated, whether in committee, in conference, or here  on the floor, can be proud of the result.  [[Page H7700]]    Third, I want to thank our staff, both committee staff and personal  staff. They worked long and hard to get this done and get it done  earlier than we have in many years. I especially want to thank the  committee staff director Jen Stewart, as well Paul Arcangeli and my  personal chief of staff, Josh Martin, for all of their work.   Mr. Speaker, next, I want to express particular appreciation to a  group of folks who often do not get publicly recognized in order to do  this conference report and do it on the timeframe we have had  available. Those working in legislative counsel have had to work  extraordinarily hard, and I am grateful to each of them. Some of those  in legislative counsel who have worked on this product include Hadley  Ross, Sherry Chriss, Tony Sciascia, Noah Wofsy, Ken Cox, Brendan  Gallagher, and Mat Eckstein. There are others who will be named  shortly.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Rules Committee and that  staff for helping us work through a procedural issue in the last couple  of days.   Mr. Speaker, this bill takes a major step forward in rebuilding our  military, reforming the Pentagon, and better preparing this country to  deal with the national security challenges that lay before us.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore     Mr. Speaker, this bill continues to make readiness a  key focus, for if we send our men and women out on missions, then they  deserve to have the best equipment, the best training, and the best  support that this country can provide.   It advances implementation of the new National Defense Strategy, so  we can be better prepared against threats from peer or near-peer  adversaries, such as Russia and China. In fact, there are many, many  provisions in this bill, Mr. Speaker, directly related to countering  the aggressive actions we have seen from each of those countries.   One section of this conference report is the first update to our  foreign investment laws in many years. I commend Chairman Hensarling,  Chairman Royce, and, of course, Speaker Ryan for negotiating a strong  CFIUS bill, which helps protect our Nation's security.   This conference report also prohibits the Federal Government from  buying products or services from Chinese telecommunications companies,  such as ZTE and Huawei. And, importantly, it prohibits the Federal  Government from doing business with any company that buys their  products or services.   A more complete summary of the provisions has been provided to all  Members, but the top priority of this bill and of our committee remains  the men and women who volunteer to serve our Nation in the military.  This bill authorizes the largest pay increase in 9 years. It provides  additional assistance for spouses seeking employment; it makes  transition assistance more tailored to the individual; and it prohibits  the closure of military healthcare facilities; all of that and more  focused on our people, who are our most valuable asset.   Mr. Speaker, speaking of patriotic Americans serving our country, one  provision on which the House receded to the Senate was the title of the  bill. We happily agreed to name this legislation after Senator John  McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. We do so not  just because of his current position but in recognition and in tribute  to a lifetime of patriotic service to our Nation.   Navy pilot, prisoner of war, Member of the House, Member of the  Senate, Presidential nominee, whatever his job, whatever his role, John  McCain has carried it out with passion and intensity and with a love  for our country that knows no bounds. History will find Senator John  McCain to be one of the giants of our time.   While battling cancer at home in Arizona, he has helped guide this  year's NDAA throughout the process. Now, that does not mean that he  agrees with every one of the outcomes in this conference report. I know  from firsthand experience that he can be a fierce advocate and a tough  negotiator.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, Senator Inhofe has done a great job on Senator McCain's  behalf, and this conference report bears Senator McCain's unmistakable  stamp. He has, once again, made a strong, positive difference for the  men and women in uniform and for the national security of the United  States of America.   We certainly wish him and his family the best in his current fight.  We thank him, and we attempt to honor him and his outstanding record of  service to our Nation with this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), who is the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Readiness.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Turner), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on  Tactical Air and Land Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Rogers), the chair of the Subcommittee on Strategic  Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman), the chair of the Subcommittee on Seapower and  Projection Forces.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), distinguished chair of the Subcommittee  on Oversight.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Stefanik), distinguished chair of the Subcommittee  on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), a distinguished subcommittee chair  from the Committee on Financial Services.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), a leader on CFIUS reform.    Mr. Speaker, I inform the Chair that at this point I  have no additional speakers other than myself to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to all of the Members  who came to speak on the conference report today. Yet, I have the  feeling we have only begun to scratch the surface of all of the issues  that are addressed in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, this is a big bill. It is about 1,800 pages big. About  200 pages of that is the CFIUS reform, led by the Financial Services  Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, but there is a lot that is  in this bill. The distinguished ranking member just talked a bit about  reform.   This bill eliminates a number of requirements that Congress had put  on the Department of Defense in previous years. It streamlines some  decisionmaking. It begins to put in some sort of comprehensible order  all of the laws related to acquisition. It requires that there be  savings of overhead expenses of a number of DOD agencies that have  [[Page H7707]]  not been addressed before. I could go on and on.   There was a Secretary of Defense who wrote a book a few years ago,  who complained about this bill, who said that it is too much that  Congress is doing to tell us what to do.   Yet, I would remind all of us, Mr. Speaker, that the Constitution  puts that exact responsibility on our shoulders. It says that it is  Congress' job to raise and support, provide and maintain, and make the  rules and regulations for military forces of the United States.   This is the bill by which we carry out that responsibility. It is our  job to do it. And this bill is the product, as you have heard, of  Members of both sides of the aisle throughout the process.   There have been, approximately, 1,005 amendments that have been  proposed at some point in this process: subcommittee, full committee,  floor consideration, and then on to conference. About an equal number  of them were Republicans and Democrats.   We have come together, as we have for each of the past 57 years, to  exercise our constitutional responsibilities on behalf of the men and  women who risk their lives to protect us.   I would certainly join with the ranking member and other Members, who  have said: Now, in order to get the full benefit of this, we need to  have an appropriations bill that matches, on time, before the end of  the fiscal year.   Mr. Speaker, over the course of this debate today, you have heard a  lot of thanks. It is appropriate because, obviously, it takes a lot of  work, by a lot of people, to put together an 1,800-page bill and try to  think through the consequences of what it means for us, what it means  for our servicemembers, and what it means for our allies around the  world.   It truly is a team effort, a bipartisan team effort. And I believe  the reason that is so, the reason it has passed every year, and has  been signed into law every year for the past 57 years, is because of  the men and women, of whom we are so proud, who risk their lives to  protect us and our freedom. They continue to be at the forefront of our  thoughts. It is on their behalf, and for their benefit, that we bring  this conference report, urge its adoption, and appreciate their service  to the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
