 Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced a  bill with my colleagues, Congressman Jim Langevin and Congressman   David Young of Iowa, to modernize the charter of the National FFA  Organization.   FFA, formerly called the Future Farmers of America, was founded in  1928.   Congress recognized the importance of FFA as an integral part of  agriculture and, in 1950, granted it a Federal charter.   The charter provides Federal authority to create an interagency  working agreement that is focused on strengthening FFA and school-based  agriculture education.   It is important to note that only about 100 organizations have  charters with Federal agencies, only six organizations require the  respective government agency to select one member for the board of  directors, and FFA is the only organization that requires a majority of  its board of directors be chosen by its partner government agency.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5595, the National FFA Organization's Charter  Amendments Act, makes updates to allow the National FFA to be a self- governing organization while maintaining its long-held relationship  with the U.S. Department of Education.   This amendment brings FFA, a great cornerstone of rural America, into  the 21st century, and I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this  legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  and my chairman from the House Education and the Workforce Committee  for hosting this Special Order tonight on an issue that is impacting  every ZIP Code in America.   The gentlewoman's poster says it all. This is close to home: Life  beyond opioids, and stability, health, and healing.   The opioid epidemic is considered by many to be the worst public  health crisis of our generation and, according to the National  Institutes of Health, more than 115 people in the United States die  every day from an opioid overdose.   This epidemic is not an urban problem and it is not a rural problem.  It is a national problem. No ZIP Code, as I said, in the country is  immune from this crisis. This is an epidemic that transcends all  socioeconomic classes, and all of America's people, all of America's  diversity of families is at risk.   Heroin and pain pill addiction doesn't discriminate on age, race,  gender, or socioeconomic status. Your neighbor could be using heroin  and so could their high honors high school student.   Unfortunately, the people of Pennsylvania have seen some of the  worst. Last year, the crisis surged when Pennsylvania experienced a 44  percent increase in opioid overdoses. It is just tragic what this does  to families and how it steals lives and futures.   Addressing this unprecedented rate of opioid-related death means that  we must focus on nearly 2.2 million Americans who currently struggle  with opioid addiction. No one person can beat addiction alone, and  overcoming this epidemic will not only take a communitywide effort, but  a nationwide effort.   The breadth of this epidemic requires us to respond with a  multifaceted approach. Congress has engaged many agencies, including  the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration,  National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and  Customs and Border Protection, just to name a few, to help combat  opioid abuse.   This crisis has torn apart families. It has weakened our workforce  and overextended our healthcare system. As a nation, we must act with a  unified urgency to help those who have fallen victim to addiction in  every corner of the country, and we must not forget their families who  have seen firsthand the crippling effects of this disease day  [[Page H3566]]  in and day out. I know we are not only prepared to do so, but we are  prepared to win this fight.   I have had the opportunity to convene opioid crisis community  roundtables throughout my congressional districts to hear firsthand  from families, from healthcare providers, from law enforcement, from  emergency medical services, from those who are involved in the  treatment community, and the impact is just so significant.   After coming away from these, I have also come to the conclusion,  what is important to focus on really is the substance abuse behaviors.  In one community in Clarion County, the issue at one time was opioids,  and then it went to heroin. But when the heroin started to be mixed  with other really deadly drugs and components, and so many people died  within the user community, they moved on to the new--they went actually  back to--they want to Suboxone, which is what we use to treat opioid  and heroin abuse. And when the Suboxone--those who were dispensing that  as treatment tightened that, the community found that they now had a  crisis, they went to meth.   So it is so important, as we work on this, we keep a broader  perspective of dealing with the substance abuse behaviors, because the  drug of choice will change, based on economics, based on availability;  but this, our goal should be to increase awareness. Our goal should be,  acknowledge there is a problem, and I think we have done that.   In my work in healthcare and, specifically, I worked in acute  psychiatric services for a period of time, I know that until you  acknowledge you have a problem, you can't really deal with it. I think,  across the board, in your communities, our States, at a local, a State,  and national level, we acknowledge we have a problem, and that is an  important first step.    I am proud of what we have done here in Washington, legislatively and  providing funding, but this is an all-hands-on-deck problem. It  requires prevention. That is where education is so important.  Prevention, education, treatment.   We have to equip our youngest generation with decisionmaking skills,  with discernment, so they have the filters to make better decisions  when they are exposed to access, when they are approached by others,  when they are preyed upon in terms of those who push drugs.   We certainly need to equip our medical professionals to improve how  they prescribe, how they dispense medications, and increase their  utilization of alternative pain management.   As a former rehabilitation professional, there are some great tools  out there to help deal with managing pain. One of the things that,  culturally, we have come to the point where we try to eliminate pain,  and I think that is what has pushed us with the opioids into the  situation that we are in today.   And we need to equip our communities with evidence-based treatment,  something closer to home. And so I do very, very much appreciate  Chairwoman Foxx's leadership on education and workforce issues, and  really appreciate her putting this Special Order together this evening  and leading us as we address what truly is the public health crisis of  our generation.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the  gentlewoman's leadership on this.   The fact that we had two great hearings, which were on top of a lot  of the work that we have been doing as a Congress, this really is an  all-hands-on-deck public health crisis, and we know that because of the  work that we are doing in Education and the Workforce.   This transcends education. It impacts the workforce in a significant  way at a time when we have an estimated somewhere between 5 and 6  million jobs available in this country; and we have increasing job  growth, and we have an aging workforce which is retiring, a significant  number each and every year.   This is an issue that impacts our national security because it takes  individuals out of the workforce not able to pass that drug test, not  able to be able to qualify.   This is obviously an all-hands-on-deck because we see so many  different committees and their members across both sides of the aisle  who have been working on this, the amount of legislation going back.   One of the more memorable ones is the CARA Act, the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act, that was like 16 individual bills--16 or  18, I don't remember exactly how many--that we debated on this floor  and we passed on this floor. We rolled it into one package, and it was  actually passed by the Senate, and the President signed it.   It dealt with things from little unborn babies who were born  addicted, a terrible situation with the suffering of those new babies  because they were born to moms who were active addicts, to veterans  that VA physicians--and there are some really great VA physicians. I  don't want to paint them with a broad brush. But there were some that  were referred to as the candy man because they dispensed the pills like  Skittles is what it looked like, and their solution to everything was  to medicate, and everything in between.   Also, providing resources to our local communities so our local  communities could engage in this, great programs that have been around  for very long time like the Drug-Free Communities moneys that are used  by parents and kids and teachers and community leaders who come  together to deal with and confront this epidemic in their communities.   I have a community up in Erie County, Iroquois School District, and  it is a  [[Page H3567]]  school district that has been devastated with overdoses. Most of the  children in that school, a middle school--and it was heartbreaking-- either had a family member or knew someone who had died of an overdose.   Some of the stories you hear, and one that really stands out with me  because I have talked with this mom who was in my congressional  district, her son, unfortunately, had a disease, Crohn's disease, and  had to go through some surgery as a small child and endured that rather  well. It worked out well. But when this young man turned about 16, 17,  18 years old, he had to go back and do surgery as a result, and this  time, the painkillers they gave him he used basically one time and his  life spiraled out of control.   This was an athlete. This was a kid who did so well in school, but  his life just went into almost a death spiral, and he wound up being  incarcerated--and all because he wasn't wired to be able to handle  these painkillers.   That is a part of this battle. We need better science. We need better  medicine so we can determine who can tolerate certain medications and  who cannot, whose life would be transformed in such a negative way by  using a painkiller one time. But that certainly is all a part of this  battle.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership  on this and thank her for hosting this Special Order tonight.
