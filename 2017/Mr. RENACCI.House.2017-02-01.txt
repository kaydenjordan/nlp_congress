 Mr. Speaker, in the waning days of his Presidency, the  Obama administration finalized the stream buffer rule, a final parting  shot at the coal industry on his way out the door. Not once did the  Office of Surface Mining visit and assess the economic impact of this  rule on operating mines. In fact, in their analysis, they relied on  ``hypothetical mines.''   These aren't hypothetical mines and they aren't hypothetical jobs  that will be affected. In the real world, this rule could mean the end  of coal production in Ohio and the end of thousands of good-paying jobs  in countless communities like the one I grew up in.   Ohio will be directly impacted by this rule. Fifty-nine percent of  our electricity comes from coal-fired power plants, and Ohio's coal  industry employs thousands of hardworking Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to stop this rule, to stop  the war on coal, and to stop this rule which could cause hardworking  Americans to lose their jobs. I urge my colleagues to support this  joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act.
