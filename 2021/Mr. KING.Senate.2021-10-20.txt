 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  outstanding career of a leader in economic development in the State of  Maine. Steve Levesque, of Greenville, ME, is retiring after 41 years of  professional experience in the areas of economic and community  progress, land use planning, and environmental services in both the  private and public sectors, including when I was Governor as  commissioner of Maine's Department of Economic and Community  Development. Most recently, Steve has made an indelible mark in his  position as executive director of Midcoast Regional Redevelopment  Authority, MRRA. From his first days in economic and community  development in Maine, Steve has held a number of leadership positions  in which he has led and advocated tirelessly for local, regional, and  State economies with consistent messages of the quality of the business  environment in Maine alongside our quality of life as Mainers.   In 2005, there were indications that the Naval Air Station Brunswick,  NASB, would be disestablished and Steve, at that time, led the  Brunswick Local Redevelopment Authority, charged with overseeing the  successful completion of the Reuse Master Plan for NASB. He has been  MRRA's only executive director since its formation in 2008. In 2011,  when NASB officially closed, there were persistent doomsday forecasts  about the hole that was left behind. Steve brought his own brand of  fervency to MRRA to realize a dream of the adaptive reuse of the former  base, now known as Brunswick Landing. He started by assembling a  passionate and hard-working team and began carefully cultivating what  would become critical and dedicated partnerships, developed over the  years with so many groups: the Navy, the towns of Brunswick and  Topsham, the State of Maine, all of Maine's congressional delegation,  the FAA, and especially the impressive list of businesses and private  developers who have invested in the vision to convert a former Navy  base into an economic engine that  [[Page S7123]]  today holds more than 2,400 jobs, surpassing the $150 million former  Navy payroll.   When you read the list of other benchmarks at Brunswick Landing, over  only 10 years--the creation of TechPlace, a manufacturing business  incubator with 35 resident businesses; attraction of over a half  billion dollars in private sector capital investment; property sales to  more than 20 new property owners, including more than 650 units of  workforce housing; more than $150 million in new valuation and $3  million in annual property taxes generated for the Towns of Brunswick  and Topsham; more than $40 million in upgrades to Brunswick Executive  Airport's--BXM-- infrastructure and buildings; more than $100 million  invested in new building construction and infrastructure projects owned  by MRRA; creation of Brunswick Renewable Energy Center, including  ownership of former Navy electrical grid with 3.5-megawatt load and 2  megawatts of on-site renewable electricity generation; 10 percent  annual growth in air operations, based aircraft, and aviation fuel  sales at BXM; environmental stewardship and wildlife habitat  preservation, including transfer of more than 1,200 acres of open space  and trails to the town of Brunswick and local land trust--it is no  wonder Steve's leadership has been recognized, not once but twice, as a  recipient of the Association of Defense Contractor's Community  Leadership Award as well as by many other State development  organizations. I join them wholeheartedly in recognizing Steve for  demonstrating innovation and excellence in his work.   Even in his volunteer time, Steve serves on a number of industry and  economic development boards, including the Loring Development Authority  of Maine, Moosehead Lake Region Economic Development Corporation, Owls  Head Transportation Museum, and the Maine Spaceport Leadership Council,  to name a few. Steve has also served his country in the U.S. Marine  Corps as an aircraft mechanic.   Due to Steve's commitment to economic development and ability to  secure funding for a variety of initiatives throughout the years, there  has been continued high quality service for new and expanding  businesses here in Maine. His ability to coordinate programs and foster  partnerships were critical factors in his success, whether it be at the  local, State, or national level. As a champion of economic development,  I join with his colleagues, friends, and the people of Maine in  thanking Steve for his unwavering service to the economic development  of our State.                            ____________________
