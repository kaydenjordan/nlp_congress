 Madam Speaker, today I pay tribute to my late friend,  Rich Trumka.   Rich was a labor giant who dedicated his life to fighting for workers  and giving them a voice.   His death was a huge and sudden loss for all of us, especially the  working people of this country--even those who never knew him.   Rich was a friend to all, and many of us were lucky enough to know  him personally.   I first met Rich at an AFL meeting in Cherry Hill, NJ, when I was a  labor leader in South Jersey, and he was raising money for coalminers  on strike back in the 80s.   From there, I was lucky to work with Rich for three decades, from his  time with the Mineworkers to his leadership at AFL-CIO.   Rich improved the lives of workers by leading winning battles across  the nation to secure better benefits, higher wages, and safer working  conditions.   His memory will live on as he has set the stage for workers to lead  the way in the economic recovery.   Specifically, Rich was a big proponent of the PRO Act, and now we  will work to honor his legacy and ensure this critical piece of  legislation becomes law. Because of Rich Trumka, the labor movement  will forever be changed for the better.   We will continue to push forward and follow the path he paved for so  many.   His steadfast leadership and powerful voice will be missed by all who  had the honor to work with him.   My condolences go to his family, loved ones, and all who knew him.                            ____________________
