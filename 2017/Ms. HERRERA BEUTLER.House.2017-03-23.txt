 Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to introduce  my pastor and dear friend, Bob MacGregor, as our guest chaplain this  morning.   Pastor Bob is the lead pastor of City Harvest Church in Vancouver,  Washington, my home church. City Harvest is a thriving church that  greatly impacts our community by caring for the needy and supporting  mission work.   Pastor Bob and his wife, Sue, have four daughters and eight  grandchildren. They have been married for 38 years and share a burden  to help build marriages and families of ministers who face the demands  of ministry life.   It is my great pleasure to welcome Pastor Bob and thank him as he has  blessed us this morning with his prayer.                            ____________________
