 Mr. President, from El Paso to Brownsville, TX, my State  [[Page S82]]  shares a 1,200-mile border with Mexico. If you were daring enough to  attempt to walk that entire stretch, you would trek through deserts,  cross mountains, through cities, and probably end up getting a little  wet in the Rio Grande River. You would meet folks who are proud of the  strong bonds our country has with our southern neighbor. Many, of  course, have relatives in both countries. You would talk to sheriffs,  police officers, Border Patrol agents, all who care deeply about  protecting our communities. And undoubtedly, you would end up eating  some good Tex-Mex along the way.   In my time in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to meet  countless Texans who live and work along the southern border, and I  seek their advice and counsel on what Congress ought to do, what the  Federal Government ought to do to protect them and their communities.  What they tell me is that Texans and the Nation rely on the billions of  dollars of legitimate trade that comes across the ports of entry with  Mexico. But with the growing volume of goods crossing our borders and  the persistent staff shortages for Customs and Border Protection, they  want to make sure there are no security gaps that can be exploited by  criminals or slow down the legal movement of goods. That is a concern I  share, and I continue to advocate for additional improvements in our  ports of entry to protect this vital lifeline for our economy, as well  as our security.   But just as these communities care deeply about the economic benefits  of our shared border, they care deeply, of course, about their own  safety and security. They believe that both can peacefully coexist, and  so do I.   During my visits, I have witnessed some of the horrific treatment  that migrants receive at the hands of the criminals, including those  who smuggle them. The truth is, these criminal organizations that move  people and drugs and contraband across our border exploit our porous  border and care nothing for human life. It is a commodity. It is the  way they make money. They care nothing for the people they hurt, so  they wring another dollar out of someone else's misery on a daily  basis. It is a high-volume business, too, and incredibly lucrative.   I have seen the stash houses with windows lined with tin foil, and  inside, a veritable cesspool that makes you want to gag or lose what  you had for lunch. This is where the human smugglers cram large groups  of illegal immigrants in unimaginable conditions while awaiting their  transit to the interior of the United States.   I have seen their logbooks where they record their corrupt  transactions, correlating real-life human beings with their value in  dollars and cents.   I have talked to Border Patrol agents who have discovered tractor  trailers full of people attempting to enter our country, some of whom  never complete their journey because they die from exposure or are  smothered to death in the crammed quarters.   In Brooks County, TX, where the Falfurrias checkpoint of the Border  Patrol is located, about 50 miles north of the border, I have seen  unmarked graves of the migrants who were trying to cross vast swaths of  South Texas in the August heat in order to bypass the Border Patrol  checkpoint but then were left to die by the smugglers. Their graves are  marked only with identities like ``skull case'' or ``unknown female.''   Border security is not immoral, as Speaker Pelosi has shamefully  claimed, but refusing to act in the face of evil is immoral. It is  clear that there is a crisis, as it is clear that it is our  responsibility to restore safety and security and order. In my wildest  dreams, I never would have imagined we would be debating whether we  should secure our borders, as we apparently are now. That is something  on which we should all agree. Instead, we should be focused on how to  secure our borders and how to do it in a smart, responsible way.   In my experience, learning from the experts, they tell me there is no  one-size-fits-all solution. You can imagine that with a 1,200-mile  border with just Texas and Mexico, with the variety of topography and  geography, one-size-fits-all does not work. What works best in the Rio  Grande Valley doesn't necessarily work in an urban environment like El  Paso, with Juarez right across the international bridge.   We need to customize solutions that meet the specific need rather  than trying to dictate from here in Washington--thousands of miles  away--a solution that solves nothing. We need to look at border  security as a combination of three things: physical infrastructure-- yes, that includes barriers, walls, fences, vehicle barriers in  appropriate locations, but it also includes technology--radar, ground  sensors, drones, aerostats. This is a layered approach that provides  flexibility for the experts on the ground to determine what is best for  each sector, what is best for each part of our immense border, and  implement the changes necessary to achieve desired results. As I said,  in many areas, the landscape and location mean physical barriers may  not be needed and may not be practical. In rural areas, technology-- censor technology or cameras--may be sufficient, but we know we need  additional boots on the ground, too, because it is not enough to put a  barrier in place or have a radar or ground censor in place if you don't  have the Border Patrol to show up and detain people they discover  trying to make their way illegally into the United States or bringing  drugs into the United States. So some combination of these three  elements I think is always going to be needed, no matter where you are  talking about.    I am proud of the work we have done in the Senate, generally  speaking, and I know when we work together we can do a lot of good, but  logic and experience should tell us we shouldn't be the ones deciding  how every inch of our southern border is secure. I don't claim to be an  expert, although I have gone to school on the topic and spent a lot of  time talking to those people who are experts and learning from them. I  believe we need to let those experts drive the decision-making process  on the right combination of resources needed to achieve operational  control of the border. Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues'  refusal to invest in real border security has landed us in a partial  government shutdown resulting in 800,000 Federal workers who on Friday  will not get a paycheck. That is unnecessary. Unfortunately, they are  collateral damage to a political game which we should not be playing. I  know many of these 800,000 Federal workers are already anxious about  how they will make a car payment or how they will pay their mortgage or  their rent or how they will put food on the table. It is completely  unnecessary, this shutdown.   I am afraid this debate on border security of course is not really a  debate about border security at all; it is a way for congressional  Democrats to take a stand against a President they oppose while putting  border communities at risk and sending the men and women who protect  them to work without pay. This battle has gone on too long, and I can  only hope Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer show some  leadership rather than continue to take the low road. This shouldn't be  about winning a partisan fight; it should be about protecting our  citizens and stemming the tide of illegal immigration, drugs, and  contraband entering our country. If there were ever a time, now is the  time for common sense to prevail and end this senseless shutdown.                      Remembering Richard Arvin Overton    Mr. President, on another matter, I want to share a few words about  an American hero I had the pleasure to get to know, Mr. Richard Arvin  Overton. Richard's story began more than a century ago on May 11, 1906,  in Bastrop County, TX. Throughout his young life, he held a variety of  jobs--landscaping, picking cotton, working at a furniture store, and  building homes.   In 1940, Richard enlisted in the U.S. Army and began his military  service at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. Serving with the 1887th  Engineer Battalion, an all-Black unit, one of his first stops was Pearl  Harbor, the day after what we now know as the West Loch Disaster.   In an interview in 2016, Richard recalled that day, seeing the water  turn red from the blood of his brothers, saying: ``I didn't look the  same, but I got out all right.'' This was only the first stop on  Richard's tour that led him to the Pacific theater. His service  included stops in Guam, Palau, and Iwo  [[Page S83]]  Jima, where he witnessed firsthand some of the darkest days in our  country's modern history.   When the war ended, Richard returned to Texas and built a home on  Hamilton Avenue. He originally reentered the furniture business and  then began working for the State treasury department. At the sprite age  of 85, Richard Overton decided to retire.   In 2013, the 107-year-old Richard Overton made his first trip to  Washington, DC, with an Honor Flight. He was able to witness the  memorial built to honor his service and his comrades who died in  battle, a sight that brought him to tears.   While his military service alone deserves our praise, that is not the  only thing that brought Richard to national attention. His comments  about the keys to his longevity and long life and particularly his  daily routine made Richard an internet sensation. His penchant for  enjoying coffee with whiskey and 12 cigars a day won hearts and caused  all of us to question the secret to his long life. Richard also enjoyed  a bowl of ice cream every night--always butter pecan. He called this  the Overton diet and welcomed anyone interested to give it a shot.  Richard used his newfound fame to continue life as he always had but  with more fans eager to stop by and say hello while he was sitting on  the front porch. He continued to live in the same house he built after  the war, although the street name has now been changed to carry his  name--Richard Overton Avenue.   I first met Richard in 2013, and I remember the day my wife Sandy and  I met him in his home in Austin. I was taken aback to learn he had just  gotten through mowing his lawn that morning--107 years old and still  mowing his lawn.   Sadly, on December 27, 2018, the story of this American hero came to  an end. At the ripe old age of 112 years, Richard passed away, leaving  a host of cousins and extended family members.   Yesterday, I introduced a resolution, with my colleague Senator Cruz,  to honor this great man, his military service, and his enduring legacy.  Our country has lost a true patriot, our State has lost a legend, and  our community has lost a dear friend.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
