 I thank my colleague.   Mr. President, I rise to speak about what the Senior Senator from  Virginia just spoke about, and that is the miners' healthcare. We have  complete action at long last. This should have been done in December,  when we were pleading with the majority leader at the time to get it  done then.   But we are happy we are at this point now, where one of two--one  promise has been fulfilled, and that is the promise of permanent,  guaranteed healthcare for thousands, tens of thousands of miners across  the country. In my home State, the last count was 1,955. Let's round it  off to 2,000--a lot of families. We are grateful we are at this point.   I do want to reiterate what Senator Warner said about our colleague  from West Virginia, Senator Manchin. He is right. Joe Manchin brought  this up at every meeting over the course of many, many months and  several years. We are grateful for the leadership he demonstrated and  grateful that he kept us all focused. I thank all of our colleagues who  worked on this.   I think, initially, going back years ago, before Senator Manchin was  in the Senate, Senator Rockefeller was raising this issue. This really  has been around a long time--for at least 5 years. We heard this  morning from Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of  America, who talked about this 5-year fight.   I commend and salute Senator Manchin. I also thank the committee  dynamic here, the Finance Committee--several members on the committee-- with Senator Wyden helping us get this bill, the Miners Protection Act,  through the Senate Finance Committee and the leadership of Senator  Schumer, as well, in focusing our caucus on getting this done.   I just want to make two additional points. One is a negative note,  but I think it is important to point this out. There was a story  yesterday in the publication, ThinkProgress. Here is what the headline  was: ``Trump administration admits it used miners' healthcare as a  bargaining chip.'' That was the headline. Then the subheadline was:  ``Coal miners were just pawns in a larger game.'' That is what the  headline and subheadline said.   I am not sure I have read a more disturbing headline in a long time,  where the healthcare of coal miners--retired coal miners, who were  promised this decades ago, would be used as pawns in a debate about a  spending bill. Unfortunately, that is at least what has been reported.  I hope we don't ever see a headline like that again.   Going forward, the problem for us now is, as much as we are happy  about this current result on healthcare, we still have a lot of work to  do for miners, especially when it comes to their pensions. That is the  second half of the promise.   So I remind everyone again, these miners kept their promise. They  kept their promise to their company to work in the darkness and danger  of a coal mine, sometimes for decades, not just years. They kept their  promise to their families to support them in the most difficult job  imaginable. And many of them have served in combat or served in the  military, in one war or another. They kept their promise to their  country. It is time we fulfill the entire promise, and that means  getting pensions done as well.   We are grateful to be part of this, and let's keep the momentum going  for pensions for all of the retired miners.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.   Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, there is a question Americans should  be asking all of us every day: Who are you fighting for? We should be  asking ourselves that. Who are we fighting for?   Here is who Joe Manchin is fighting for--Senator Manchin, my  colleague from West Virginia, and my other colleagues who are here on  the floor: Billy Hull. He is a retired coal miner with 30 years of  working at the Peabody Coal Mine near Montrose, MO. He wrote me a  letter earlier, about 6 months ago, saying in part:         My wife and I, married 59 years fall under the Patriot Coal       Companies Voluntary Employees Beneficial Association. My wife       Earlene is a 2 time cancer survivor and I suffered a stroke       in 2012. If we lose our benefits it will be hard for us to       afford our medicine cost.    So these folks were made a promise by--I am accused of being a fan  girl of this guy, and I am a fan girl of Harry Truman. I think he was  plain-spoken. I think he was earnest, honest, and kept people like  Billy Hull in the front of his mind 24/7--good, salt-of-the-earth,  hard-working people who play by the rules. Mr. Hull played by the  rules. Thousands of coal miners in our State played by the rules, and  their widows played by the rules.   The promise made by Harry Truman deserved to be kept. The promise  deserved to be kept. So my friend, Senator Joe Manchin, decided he  wasn't going to go with the flow around here. He was going--I think he  said at one point on the floor, I think his quote was: If you don't  stand up for something, we don't stand for anything. And he decided  that he was going to get this done.   Now, I have to tell you the truth. For about 2 years, everywhere you  went, you would walk behind Joe, and Joe would be trying to talk to  somebody about the miners. After he would walk off, people would  whisper: You know, it is never going to happen. We are never going to  get this done. It is not going to happen.   I can't tell you how fun it is to celebrate getting something done.   We bail out everybody around here. We bail out Wall Street. We bail  out banks. We bail out corporations. We are busy figuring out how we  can cut the wealthiest's taxes, as we speak. It is all about making it  easier for folks who have plenty. Why is it so hard to help the people  who don't have anything--who depended on a promise, just to have the  basics in their lives, and put in long days of work for years as their  part of that bargain?   I am so proud of Joe Manchin. I can't imagine how proud the coal  miners in his State must be of him. I am glad we had an opportunity to  stand with him as he stood for something. I am proud that we got it  done.   Now we have another big task because there is another bunch of people  out there; really, we are running roughshod over them, and that is a  bunch of truck drivers, truck drivers in my State who have driven  trucks for 35, 40, 45 years, understanding that at the end of that long  period of time, they would have a pension. It is not their fault that  the pension is not there for them.   I have to tell Joe that I have to sign him up. I want Senator Manchin  as the captain of the team as we now go on to fight for the pensions  these people have earned.   If we can bail out everybody we are bailing out, if we can cut taxes  by $7 trillion, surely, we can find the money to make good on these  promises.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
