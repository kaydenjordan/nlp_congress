 Madam Speaker, we all anticipate and await  the presentation from an international hero. Hearing from President  Zelensky tomorrow is exactly what this Congress and what the Nation  needs to hear. I believe that we will come out united. Certainly, our  thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine and the bravery of  President Zelensky.   Madam Speaker, I am here to also talk about another urgency here at  home. The fierce urgency of now, as Martin Luther King said, would  apply to seniors all across our country. We are all painfully aware of  the results of the pandemic with more than 900,000 Americans having  perished and over 660,000 of them over the age of 65.   Madam Speaker, you know firsthand as well because you led Chairman  Neal's racial equity initiative that also underscored this very group  of people--seniors and especially people of color--who have been  impacted the most.   As John Lewis said: This is the next major civil rights issue. And if  Black Lives Matter and is more than just a slogan, it is long overdue  for the Congress of the United States to take action.   I commend you, Madam Speaker, for your efforts in making sure that we  [[Page H3717]]  bring to the American public's attention this inequity that exists.  Imagine more than 5 million Americans in the wealthiest nation on the  face of the Earth living in poverty, millions of whom have paid all  their lives into a Social Security system that gives them a below  poverty-level check.                                time  1215    The last time Congress did anything to enhance Social Security was in  1971. Richard Nixon was the President, and a gallon of milk cost 72  cents.   A lot has transpired since then, especially as it relates to our  seniors. The people who are impacted the most, along with COVID, are  the people who are on fixed incomes. They are impacted by inflation as  well. That is why it is so vitally important, with more than 10,000  baby boomers a day becoming eligible for Social Security, that Congress  finally acts.   Help is on the way. Social Security 2100: A Sacred Trust will do just  that and make sure that it provides across-the-board relief and makes  sure that no one can retire into poverty and raises the new floor for  those who are in desperate need now. We can no longer afford to kick  the can down the road. The pandemic has only further underscored the  problem that our seniors face.   Madam Speaker, as you know, it is not just our seniors. When we look  at veterans, more veterans rely on Social Security disability than they  do on the VA. When we look at spousal and dependent coverage and the  need for children to stay on their policies and be able to be eligible  as Social Security recipients, how we have treated widows and widowers,  all needs to be addressed.   Who is impacted the most by this? Women. And specifically women of  color that are most in need, because of the jobs they held in society  and because they were primarily caregivers and spent more time at home.  It is they who are living longer and also need assistance from the  United States Congress.   It is long overdue for us to act. It has been more than 50 years  since Congress has done anything. This is not something the President  can do with an executive order or that is going to be adjudicated by  the courts. This can only happen if Congress takes action.   I am proud of the efforts of Chairman Neal and the Ways and Means  Committee as we move toward a markup of Social Security and to bring  this to the floor and then to vote on it in the Senate.                            ____________________
