All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee  [[Page H7178]]       Print 117-59, modified by the amendment printed in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce or their respective designees; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 3.  House Resolution 517 is hereby adopted.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent  that all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1256, providing for consideration of  H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, under a structured rule.   It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural  Resources, makes in order one amendment, and provides one motion to  recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 4040, the Advancing  Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act, under a closed rule.   The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Pallone,  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,  and provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule deems as passed H. Res. 517.   First, the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act, led by  Representative Cheney, and I am a proud cosponsor, will extend critical  telehealth policies implemented during the pandemic while making it  easier for seniors to access telehealth services.   We know that because of the pandemic, healthcare visits to the doctor  drastically changed, and these health services have become critical to  patients in accessing care. The pandemic made access to healthcare  difficult, but telehealth turned this negative into a positive.   To avoid exposure, many patients, including high-risk, vulnerable  people, choose to visit their doctor by video or telephone to receive  care. In response to the COVID-19 public health emergency, we in  Congress authorized bipartisan legislation expanding telehealth  services for Medicare beneficiaries in March 2020. This was especially  important for our seniors and underserved areas, where it is already  significantly more challenging to access in-person care.   Telehealth is a very popular program among populations living in both  remote and rural areas and in highly populated areas. According to a  recent study, nearly a quarter of U.S. adults over 65 had a video  doctor's visit during the pandemic.   In November 2021, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  announced that it would extend some telehealth coverage through 2023.  However, certain telehealth services are scheduled to end when the  declared public health emergency expires.   Why should we end something, a program, that is helping vulnerable  people access medical care?   Telehealth is no longer an innovative option for accessing healthcare  services. For many, these services are a lifeline.   H.R. 4040 would extend critical telehealth policies under Medicare  that were initially authorized at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic  through 2024. Specifically, H.R. 4040 would provide patients with  better access to telehealth regardless of where they are by removing  geographic barriers.   It would expand the availability of telehealth services for patients  by increasing the number of health clinics' eligibility, including  federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics.   It will allow flexibility for Medicare beneficiaries to access mental  health telehealth and ensure audio-only telehealth services under  Medicare continue to be covered.   These provisions will help increase access to care and allow Medicare  to adapt to innovations in medical technology, all while reducing  healthcare costs and significantly reducing wait times for patient  care.   H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, will improve public safety  and protect wild animals by prohibiting the private possession of  lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars, cougars, or any hybrid of  these species.   In short, this bill prevents people from keeping big cats as pets and  helps ensure that these animals are not kept in inhumane conditions.  Many law enforcement and first responder groups are supportive of this  legislation and are asking Congress to pass this bipartisan bill to  protect themselves and the general public.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these two bipartisan  bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1030     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, today Democrats are talking  about expanding access to healthcare and helping our constituents live  healthy lives. That is what Democrats are bringing to the floor today  in a bipartisan way.   But yet here we are with some Republican colleagues across the aisle  continuing to insert divisive politics into a debate about healthcare,  about being able to see your doctor, and about being able to live a  healthy life. Perhaps it is because there are billions to be made in  gun sales or oil sales. But Democrats will continue to try to find  Republicans on the other side to save American lives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I absolutely agree that we can do more than one thing at a time. But  unfortunately, today should be a day that we are working together in a  bipartisan way, again, to expand access to healthcare for fragile  Americans that want to have an opportunity and deserve to have an  opportunity to see their doctor.   So, while my colleagues continue to talk about the millions and  billions of dollars that gun manufacturers and oil folks are making, we  want to talk about expanding healthcare.   But let me remind my colleagues, too, that it is easy to come to the  floor and rant and rave when you have no real ideas to offer or  solutions.   But let's take a look at the facts. The current drop in gas prices is  one of the fastest declines in over a decade. Gas prices have declined  by an average of 50 cents per gallon over the past 34 days. The most  common price at gas stations across the country is now $3.99, with  around 20,000 gas stations across over 30 States.   But, you see, it is not just about gasoline. We are also increasing  availability and options for Americans to drive electric vehicles. So  we can do more than one thing.   But I urge my colleagues across the aisle, if they truly care about  telehealth, if they truly care about improving healthcare options for  Americans, that we focus on the two bills, the rule that we have in  front of us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Working together means meeting each other in the middle when we agree  or disagree on an issue, finding middle ground. That is what this bill  does because some Republicans and Democrats agree that the healthcare  of the American people is worth so much more than nonsense political  headlines.   So today, once again, we come together, some of us, to help continue  to save lives by passing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   It is unfortunate that we fail--some of us on this floor--to  recognize that the lead author of this bill is a Republican member of  their caucus. Unfortunately, it is a Republican member of their caucus  that they no longer find conveniently friendly to their agenda of hate  and division.   Today, we stand together, and I urge my Republican colleagues to  support this bill, to, again, help Americans find the doctor and the  healthcare that they need in order to live a better life.  [[Page H7181]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   The two bills before us for consideration, H.R. 263 and H.R. 4040,  will increase access to critical healthcare services and improve public  safety. I am proud of Representative Liz Cheney.   And while my colleagues continue to argue and work against the  healthcare of the American people, we will stand together with those  Republicans that have the courage to stand up for healthcare and  healthcare options.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1256         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 8488) to prohibit the Secretary of Energy from       sending petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum       Reserve to China, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy       & Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 8488.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
