 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts and my friends on the other side of the  aisle.   The good news is that Democrats, and I hope some good friends, some  Republicans, will not kick American families down the aisle and down  the road. That is why we are here today, to ensure that those human  beings will not be kicked down the road.   I am stunned by the actions of my friends that would not support the  paying of your bills.   Let us not discard the reality of what lifting the debt ceiling  means. It is the bills that have already accrued. It is the light bill;  it is the telephone bill; it is the heat bill; it is the tuition for  college. Those are bills that have accrued that we are paying for. That  is the example the American people ask.   Then we are trying to work together to ensure that lead poisoning  that is killing our children in water--that the INVEST Act is ready to  go with the Build Back Better, that broadband is ready to go with the  Build Back Better.   Then, of course, we want to do something innovative. The housing  crisis in  [[Page H5621]]  America is unbelievable. Homelessness is on the rise. Veterans who have  pledged their life to us as Americans and who have put on the uniform  unselfishly are homeless in droves. They are homeless in big cities,  like Houston, Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, and in rural areas.  None of that is attributed to local leaders.   When I was home yesterday interacting with the engine of the  economy--construction companies and workers and engineers--they begged  for having us come together, INVEST Act, Build Back Better. This bill  includes a $35 billion investment in the HOME Investment Partnerships.   We want to make sure that Medicare is strong, Federal Medicaid. We  want housing, climate change, the immigration reform. There are many  elements that will stop pushing the American people down the road like  a can and just keep saying to them: We will get it one day. We will get  it another day.   Provide education for all those workers who were stymied during the  pandemic. Stop the eviction of individuals who I saw come out into the  street.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The New York  Times.                 [From the New York Times, October 8, 2021]          What the Debt Ceiling Means for Social Security and More         The federal government is about two weeks away from being       unable to pay its bills--and that could delay benefit       payments to tens of millions of retirees, Medicare and       Medicaid providers, and numerous others receiving checks from       the U.S. Treasury.        Running into the federal borrowing limit could lead to a       catastrophic default on the nation's debt. Once the       government reaches the ceiling--and exhausts all other       measures to keep payments flowing--it will run out of funds       for bills it has already promised to pay.        To avoid such a calamity, Democrats are weighing a change       to filibuster rules in order to hold a vote. Senator Mitch       McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, has suggested       allowing a temporary increase until December, although that       would merely postpone a default deadline for a matter of       weeks.        The government has never defaulted on its obligations, so       what would happen is unclear. But the effects could be wide-      ranging, covering programs as varied as Social Security       benefits and school lunches.        ``There is no public playbook for what to do when you       breach the debt limit,'' said Marc Goldwein, senior policy       director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a       fiscal watchdog group. ``We don't know what will happen.''                       What Programs Could be Affected?         A lot, covering a lot of people.        A default could potentially--but not necessarily--delay the       payment of Social Security benefits, which reach about 65       million Americans in some form.        It could also delay payments to government contractors,       including hospitals that accept patients who use Medicare and       Medicaid benefits. If the situation dragged on for weeks or       months, it could threaten access to health care, Whitney       Tucker, the deputy director of research on the State Fiscal       Policy team at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,       said in a recent note.        Some state-run programs that use federal money, like those       providing free or reduced-cost breakfast and lunch to low-      income students, might not be immediately reimbursed. The       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as       food stamps, would also be affected.        And it would probably halt payments being made to families       under the newly expanded child tax credit, which in July       began sending eligible families half of the credit in monthly       installments. Roughly 35 million families received the       benefit in July.                           When Could this Happen?         That's not totally clear. The Treasury secretary, Janet L.       Yellen, has said the government will hit the debt ceiling on       Oct. 18. But some analysts believe the actual date could be       pushed back a few days, or perhaps longer.        It's important to note that this situation is different       from a government shutdown, which happens when Congress fails       to pass bills that permit new spending. White House officials       warn that running into the debt ceiling is far more damaging.                 Won't the Government still have some money?         Yes, the Treasury will have some revenue coming in--from       estimated quarterly income taxes, excise taxes and other       sources--but the department has maintained that it does not       have the authority to pick and choose which payments it will       make.        ``There is only one viable option to deal with the debt       limit: Congress needs to increase or suspend it, as it has       done approximately 80 times, including three times during the       last administration,'' a Treasury spokesman said.        But if no agreement is reached, some policy experts say       that the Treasury may ultimately have to pick winners and       losers--and that's a difficult bind, because there are       several conflicting laws at play.        The law says the government cannot borrow once it hits the       debt limit, but the 14th Amendment to the Constitution says       that the United States must honor its obligations. Other laws       state that certain benefits and salaries must be paid.               Is there anything else the government could do?         The Treasury might decide to issue more bonds anyway and       leave it to the Supreme Court to figure out the       constitutional questions, said Len Burman, an institute       fellow at the Urban Institute.        ``They could ignore the debt limit,'' he said. ``It is a       question that has never been adjudicated because it hasn't       come up before.''        But previous administrations have rejected that approach,       he said, and legal experts don't agree about whether it would       actually work.                         What about Social Security?         Social Security--which reaches tens of millions of       Americans through retirement, disability and survivor       benefits--is a bit different from other programs because it       is largely financed through a dedicated payroll tax. It also       has its own trust funds, which may give it more flexibility,       some experts said.        The taxes coming into the program aren't enough to pay all       of the benefits, according to Jason J. Fichtner, chief       economist at the Bipartisan Policy Center, who held several       positions, including acting principal deputy commissioner, at       the Social Security Administration. But since the checks are       sent out on a staggered basis, the agency could wait for more       cash to come in, which would result in delayed payments.        But there's also at least one other possibility. If the       Treasury redeemed the special-issue bonds from the program's       trust fund to pay benefits--and then quickly replaced them       with newly issued bonds--that wouldn't raise the debt       ceiling, Mr. Fichtner argues.        It's not clear whether the Treasury agrees with his       assessment.                           What else could happen?         If the United States were to default on its debts--that is,       stop making payments on the Treasurys it has sold--there       would almost certainly be major consequences in the global       markets.        The immediate effect would be that portfolios held by       investors as varied as pension funds and holders of 401(k)s       would face a market tailspin. Even after any debt-ceiling       standoff were resolved, global investors would demand higher       interest payments on U.S. Treasury bonds--so the government's       borrowing in the future could become more expensive.        A default may also make it more difficult for consumers to       secure loans, and they would most likely pay more when they       did.        ``In the case of a debt default, it would quickly spark a       credit crunch so the issue for borrowers becomes much more       about whether you can get a loan in the first place,'' said       Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.       ``Lenders would likely freeze or cut credit lines on home       equity lines of credit and credit cards. Personal loans would       be harder to get and could see higher rates.''                 What if the problem isn't quickly resolved?         An extended impasse would cause significant damage to the       U.S. economy, Wendy Edelberg and Louise Sheiner, both senior       fellows at the Brookings Institution, a research group, wrote       in a recent report.        ``Even in a best-case scenario where the impasse is short-      lived, the economy is likely to suffer sustained--and       completely avoidable--damage, particularly given the       challenges that Covid-19 poses to the health of the       economy,'' they wrote.        If it dragged on through November, the federal government       would have little choice but to significantly slash       government spending by roughly $200 billion--a       ``devastating'' blow to the economy, Mark Zandi, chief       economist of Moody's Analytics, said in a recent analysis.        And the increased expense of borrowing would only add to       the hit in the long run.        ``Americans would pay for this default for generations,''       he said.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from  Forbes.                        [From Forbes, Oct. 4, 2021]  Defaulting on the National Debt Ceiling Would Be Catastrophic for Small                                 Businesses         Here we go again. It seems every time this issue arises,       lawmakers seem intent to put the U.S. economy and small       businesses at risk.        Unfortunately, the U.S. Department of Treasury Secretary       Janet Yellen has said that the federal government will run       out of money on October 18 if the debt ceiling is not raised.       The government reached its debt limit at the end of July and       Treasury has been taking steps to keep from defaulting. If       the debt ceiling is not raised in the coming weeks, the U.S.       will default on its debt for the first time in its history       and that will be catastrophic for small businesses.        There is no question that our national debt needs to be       addressed in the coming years with a mixture of revenue       raises and spending cuts as the Clinton Administration did in       the 1990s. However, defaulting on the debt is not the answer.       It will not be some teachable moment on government spending.       Instead, it  [[Page H5622]]       will have unnecessary and irreversible consequences for       almost all Americans. A Navigator survey also found that 58       percent of Americans support raising the debt ceiling.       Unfortunately, this has become a political issue. Just a few       days ago, Senate Minority Leader McConnell blocked Democrats       from using a simple majority to get this done.        Why? Republicans may want to use this as a campaign issue       against Democrats this coming fall trying to claim that they       are growing the national debt. But, the real story is, the       national debt has risen regardless of which party is in       control. There will be a time when Republicans will be in the       driver's seat and need to raise the debt limit, and let's       hope Democrats move beyond politics because playing       ``chicken'' with the debt limit is not good politics, not       good for small business, not good for our national security,       and not good for the economy. In fact, an analysis by Moody's       Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi estimates that       defaulting on the national debt would wipe out as many as 6       million jobs and erase $15 trillion in household wealth.        ``We can't emphasize enough how disastrous it would be for       Congress to consider a government shutdown if consensus       cannot be met in advance of the funding deadline. Small       businesses are especially vulnerable and many would not       survive a government shutdown at this time due to the       pandemic, particularly with the rapid spread of the Delta       variant, and trying to move from crisis to recovery,'' wrote       Candace Waterman, President and CEO of Women Impacting Public       Policy, in a letter to U.S. House and Senate leadership.        Here are five ways defaulting on the national debt would       harm Main Streets across the country.        1. More Expensive Small Business Loans        A majority of credit rating agencies rate the U.S. federal       government at AAA, the highest level. Defaulting on the debt       would lead to an automatic downgrade of the country's credit       rating, driving up interest rates for all Americans. Small       business loans will become costlier as private lenders are       forced to increase their interest rates. Even Small Business       Administration (SBA)-guaranteed loans, which are often lower       cost and more accessible but still reflective of market       conditions, will become more expensive.        2. Higher Credit Card Interest Rates        Many small business owners use their personal credit cards       to cover business expenses and manage debt. As with loan       rates, small business credit card and personal credit card       interest rates will also rise, squeezing the amount of       capital small business owners have to work with and       potentially driving them into more debt.        3. Tightened Credit Markets        One can look at the stories of Argentina and Greece to see       what happens to a country's credit markets when it defaults'       on its debt. The same will be the case for the United States       if it follows in these countries' footsteps. Credit markets       will tighten up and U.S. banks will prioritize lending to       businesses where they have pre-existing relationships, which       are more likely to be larger ones than small ones. Small       businesses, especially unbanked ones and those in underserved       communities, would be at a severe disadvantage when they have       the least financial cushion.        4. Plunging Stock Markets        Moody's Report estimates that stock prices would likely       plunge by one-third, sparking that $15 trillion loss in       household wealth. This would be a one-two punch for small       business owners who would see their own retirement savings       dissipate and then lose business from consumers who are now       dealing with their lost nest egg. In turn, larger public       companies could lose value, thus making it harder to       incorporate small businesses into their vendor supply chain.        5. Delayed Treasury Payments        The Treasury Department has been taking steps to meet its       obligations, including payments to households such as Social       Security. If the U.S. default on its debt, the government       would immediately need to stop more than 40 percent of       expected payments, including Social Security and other       household income. There are a number of downstream effects       this would have on small businesses, including a loss of       customers and a strain on business owners and employees now       taking steps to make ends meet for themselves and their loved       ones.        The American economy and its Main Streets are working       through their greatest crisis since World War II. Both are       still standing right now but a default on the national debt       would be a knockout blow. Let's stop playing politics and get       the debt limit raised. Once that's done, we can return to the       important work of getting an infrastructure bill passed that       has the ability to pave the way for the next generation of       American small businesses and entrepreneurs.     Mr. Speaker, let us do the debt extension that the  Senate has given us, but let us not accept this paltry extension. Do it  right in December and save the American people. Build Back Better and  the INVEST Act, do it together. Do it now.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Rule governing debate of  H.R. 2119, the ``Family Violence and Prevention Services Improvement  Act,'' H.R. 3992, the ``Protect Older Job Applicants Act,'' H.R. 3110,  the ``Pump for Nursing Mothers Act,'' and the Senate Amendment to the  House Amendment to S. 1301, ``Temporary Extension of Public Debt Act.''    SENATE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE AMENDMENT TO S. 1301 TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF                           PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT ACT    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in support of the rule  governing debate for RCP 117-16, the Senate Amendment to the House  Amendment to S. 1301, ``Temporary Extension of Public Debt Act,'' a  temporary stopgap measure raising the national debt limit by $480  billion and extending it through December 3, 2021, which is imperative  to avoid a wasteful, irresponsible, reckless threatening of the  nation's singular indispensable asset: the full faith and credit of the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, preserving the full faith and credit of the United  States by raising to the debt limit to ensure that America pays the  bills for past expenditures when they come due is not a partisan  exercise but an act of patriotism, a recognition and embrace of the  solemn obligation to preserve the unrivaled advantages that flow from  the ability provided in the Article I, Section 8, clause 2 of the  Constitution to ``borrow money on the credit of the United States.''   Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first and  greatest Treasury Secretary, understood that the path to American  prosperity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness which provided the  affordable access to capital needed to fund internal improvements and  economic growth.   It is because of the existence and wise use of the Borrowing Power  that the nation was able to expand its reaches, resources, and riches  by financing the Louisiana Purchase, the purchase of Alaska from  Russia, to fund the investments to end the Great Depression, to finance  the mobilization of resources needed in World War II to defeat fascism  and save freedom in the nation and the world, to revive the economy  after the catastrophic Great Recession of 2008, and most recently, to  protect the public health and safety and restore the economy during the  COVID-19 pandemic.   This is why the ability to borrow money on the credit of the United  States to finance its growth and protect its people and interests is  essential to the national security and led Hamilton to proclaim that  ``the proper funding of the present debt, will render it a national  blessing.''   But to maintain this blessing, or to ``render public credit  immortal,'' Hamilton understood that it was necessary that: ``the  creation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of  extinguishment.''   In other words, to retain and enjoy the prosperity that flows from  good credit, it is necessary for a nation to pay its bills.   The United States has never defaulted on the payment of any debt  incurred, and because of the size and strength of its economic and  unmatched creditworthiness, is able to borrow on the lowest and most  favorable terms of any nation or entity in the history of the world.   So secure and reliable is a bond issues by the Department of Treasury  that the United States is the preferred haven for investments of  foreign governments, corporations, and sovereign wealth funds.   The interest rate charged the federal government of the United States  is the base for which every rate, from the prime rate charged the  richest corporation to rates charged small business on purchases to the  mortgages rates and students loans taken out by consumers.   If you raise the cost of borrowing for the government of the United  States, you set off a chain reaction of increased interest rates for  every other borrower in the United States and around the world.   This is why leading public finance experts and agencies, like Moody's  Chief Economist Mark Zandi, have said it would be ``cataclysmic'' for  the United States to default on its loan obligations.   Republicans know the debt ceiling needs to be raised; in 2019 during  the Trump Administration, the Republican Senate Majority Leader  marshalled Senate Republicans to vote to raise the debt ceiling,  saying: ``We raised the debt ceiling because America can't default[,]  that would be a disaster.''   Mr. Speaker, this debate over extending the debt limit is not about  restraining future spending, it is about paying the bills piled up  already under both Republican and Democratic administrations.   The question of raising the national debt limit does not depend on  how one feels about the Build Back Better agenda, as wildly popular as  it is among all Americans, Democrats, Independents, and Republicans  included.   It is instead about preserving the singular asset of the United  States, its enviable and unrivaled creditworthiness, to finance future  investments beneficial to the national interest, like the provision of  free college for two years, or $2 billion investment to reduce violence  in communities approved by the Committee on the Judiciary, or  investments to preserve and strengthen Medicaid expansion programs, or  extend broadband to underserved rural and  [[Page H5623]]  urban areas, an action that will be as life-changing as the rural  electrification program was in the 1930s.   Mr. Speaker, if our friends across the aisle really want to shrink  the deficit, reduce the national debt, practice fiscal responsibility,  and bring about sustained economic growth and prosperity, there is a  much better, easier, and more certain way to achieve these goals than  by tampering with the U.S. Constitution.   The easier and better way is for the American people to keep a  Democrat in the White House and place Democratic majorities in the  House and Senate.   In the 1990s under the leadership of President Clinton the budget was  balanced for four consecutive years, the national debt was paid down,  the national debt, 23 million new jobs were created, and projected  surpluses exceeded $5 trillion.   Under President Obama the financial crisis and economic meltdown  inherited from his Republican predecessor was ended, the annual deficit  was reduced by 67 percent, the auto industry was saved from collapse,  and 15 million jobs were created.   In contrast, under every Republican administration since President  Reagan the size of the deficit bequeathed to his successor was  substantially larger than the deficit he inherited, a major economic  recession occurred, and economic growth was lower than it was at the  beginning of his administration.   To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and credit of the United  States, protect American jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure  the continued growth of the economy, I support and urge all Members to  join me in voting for the Senate Amendment to the House Amendment to S.  1301, the temporary stopgap measure increasing the national debt limit  by $480 billion and extending the public debt limit to December 3,  2021.    H.R. 2119 ``Family Violence and Prevention Services Improvement Act''    I rise today in support of the Rule governing debate of H.R. 2119,  the ``Family Violence and Prevention Services Improvement Act,'' which  will improve the protection and prevention for Americans affected by  family violence, domestic violence, and dating violence.   Through FVPSA, survivors receive services such as emergency shelter,  crisis counseling, safety planning, and assistance recovering from  financial abuse and housing insecurity.   The FVPSA supports life-saving services throughout the country via  grants to states, tribal governments, and territories through three  primary sets of activities, all of which are administered by HHS.   First, the FCPSA funds a national domestic violence hotline receives  calls for assistance related to this violence. The hotline provides  crisis intervention and counseling, maintains a database of service  providers, and provides referrals for victims and others affected by  domestic violence.   Second, FVPSA funds efforts to prevent domestic violence through a  program known as Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancement and  Leadership Through Allies (DELTA).   Third, FVPSA supports direct services for victims and their families.  Most of this funding is awarded via grants to states, territories, and  tribes.   FVPSA is the only federal funding source dedicated to providing  support to domestic violence shelters and programs.   FVPSA provides base core funding to support more than 1,600 local  public, private, nonprofit and faith-based organizations and programs  in their response to the urgent needs of over 1.3 million domestic  violence victims and their children.   In 2020, the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) found  that in just one day, FVPSA-funded programs helped 76,525 victims of  domestic violence.   However, over 11,000 people were unable to be served due to a lack of  funding.   This shortage of funding is especially severe with shelters serving  rural and marginalized populations, and increased funding and  culturally-specific programs are essential to addressing the needs of  these communities.   FVPSA was first passed in 1984 and was most recently reauthorized in  2010. Its authorization expired in 2015.   Mr. Speaker, this bill marks an historic effort to acknowledge and  address the unique suffering of family violence survivors from  marginalized communities.   We must recognize that not all survivors are a monolith.   Different communities and cultures have different perceptions of  domestic violence and reactions to it--therefore different communities  and cultures need different treatments and prevention measures to  address domestic violence.   That is why I am proud to support this bill, which includes  provisions that are tailored to these specific populations.   Such provisions include:   1. Providing new grants to local programs serving culturally specific  or traditionally underserved communities;   2. Increasing access for survivors from racial and ethnic communities  to services by creating a national grant program to build the capacity  to address domestic violence; and   3. Increasing funding for Native American tribes by allocating tribal  grants as a set-aside to acknowledge their sovereign authority.   In addition to addressing the special needs of minority communities,  there is a litany of other exciting provisions in this bill that build  upon the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, such as:   1. Increasing the funding authorization level to $253 million to  address chronic underfunding that resulted in 11,000 people not  receiving services in a single day.   2. Technologically updating the National Domestic Violence Hotline  and improving hotline services for underrepresented populations.   3. Authorizing funding for tribal coalitions, which provide support  to tribal domestic violence programs but are not currently authorized  by statute to receive FVPSA funding.   4. Authorizing new grants of up to $150,000 to each state,  territorial and tribal coalition to prevent domestic violence.   A bill of this nature is incredibly important for my home state of  Texas, where it is estimated that 1 in 3 Texans will be a victim of  domestic violence during their lifetime.   In Texas, 29 percent of domestic violence victims are Black despite  making up only 12 percent of the population.   The share of domestic violence victims in Texas who are Native  American is twice as much as the proportion of Natives in the general  population.   Mr. Speaker, no member should be complacent with these egregious  statistics.   With this bill's increased commitment to prevention and treatment of  family violence, we are sending a message to survivors that you are not  forgotten.                H.R. 3992 ``Protect Older Job Applicants Act''    Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in support of the Rule governing  debate of H.R. 3992, the ``Protect Older Job Applicants Act,'' which  will amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which  prohibits age-based discrimination in hiring, to specifically prohibit  employers from limiting, segregating, or classifying job applicants on  the basis of age.   People of all ages, but especially older applicants, must be  protected from discriminatory practices and loopholes that hurt their  chances to get a job, especially as we have seen that older American  workers have disproportionately experienced long-term unemployment in  the COVID economy.   The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967 was  passed to prohibit age-based discrimination for current employees and  job applicants.   However, two federal circuit court decisions over the last five years  have ruled that some provisions of the ADEA's federal anti-age  discrimination protections only applied to current employees, not job  applicants.   In 2016, the 11th Circuit case Villarreal v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco  Company held that the ADEA disparate impact statute only covers  employees, but not older applicants, and in 2019, the 7th Circuit  adopted the same interpretation in Kleber v. CareFusion Corporation.   The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to review the appellate court  decisions.   Currently, employers, especially those within the 7th and 11th  Circuits, have a valid defense to claims under the ADEA where external  job applicants allege they have been negatively impacted by hiring  practices on the basis of their age.   H.R. 3992 would give external candidates the express right under  federal law to bring these types of claims against employers.   This bill will include the job application process in ADEA's anti- discrimination provisions.   Specifically, this bill will make it unlawful ``to limit, segregate,  or classify . . . [job applicants] in any way which would deprive or  tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise  adversely affect his status as . . . [a job applicant], because of such  individual's age.''   According to the AARP, 1 in 4 workers age 45 and older have been  subjected to negative comments about their age from supervisors or  coworkers, and 76 percent see age discrimination as a hurdle to finding  a new job.   In one University of California, Irvine, study, resumes were sent out  on behalf of more than 40,000 fictitious applicants of different ages  for thousands of low-skill jobs like janitors, administrative  assistants and retail sales clerks in 12 cities.   This study found that the older the applicant was, the fewer  callbacks the applicant received.   This study also found that age discrimination has the highest impact  on women, who suffer more age discrimination then men starting in their  40s.   According to David Neumark, a professor of economics who oversaw the  study, ``[t]he evidence of age discrimination against women . . . pops  out in every study'' conducted on age discrimination.  [[Page H5624]]    Ageism is still very much present in our society, and it is important  we acknowledge that we still have much work to do to correct this bias  and give every job applicant a fair and equal opportunity when applying  for a job.                  H.R. 3110 ``Pump for Nursing Mothers Act''    Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 3110, the ``Pump for  Nursing Mothers Act,'' which will close an unintentional loophole in  the 2010 Break Time for Nursing Mothers Act.   The 2010 law requires employers to provide break time and a place for  hourly wage-earning and some salaried employees to express breast milk  at work for one year after the birth of the employee's child.   Unfortunately, this law unintentionally excluded a quarter of all  working women--nearly nine million employees--from protection.   H.R. 3110 closes this coverage gap by extending the law's protections  to cover salaried employees as well as other categories of employees  currently exempted from protections, such as teachers, nurses, and  farmworkers.   H.R. 3110 would also provide employers clarity on paid and unpaid  pumping time.   The bill leaves in place existing law protecting many salaried  workers from having their pay docked and clarifies that employers must  pay an hourly employee for any time spent pumping if the employee is  also working.   Lastly, the bill would ensure that nursing mothers have access to  remedies that are available for other violations of the Fair Labor  Standards Act.   New parents face an incredible amount of increased difficulties while  juggling work, family and mental and emotional tolls that are  exacerbated as a new parent.   According to a study published in Reviews in Obstetrics and  Gynecology, breastfeeding provides health benefits for not only  infants, but also for mothers.   Abstaining from breastfeeding has been associated with an increase in  developing various types of cancers, type 2 diabetes, heart attacks,  retained gestational weight gain and metabolic syndrome in adult women.   For infants, not being breastfed is associated with infectious  illnesses such as pneumonia, ear infections, gastroenteritis, and can  increase the risk of developing childhood-onset obesity, type 1 and 2  diabetes, leukemia and SIDS.   This bill will ensure that mothers will no longer be forced to choose  between their own health, their infant's health, and their income.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act will alleviate the disparities that  currently exist between breastfeeding employees and their coworkers,  sending a clear message that the workforce will protect and support  women who opt to balance a career and motherhood.   For these reasons, I encourage all Members to support the Rule  governing debate for H.R. 2119, the ``Family Violence and Prevention  Services Improvement Act,'' H.R. 3992, the ``Protect Older Job  Applicants Act,'' and H.R. 3110, the ``Pump for Nursing Mothers Act.''
