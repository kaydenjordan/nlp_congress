 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 693 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 693         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 3326) to increase accountability, combat       corruption, and strengthen management effectiveness at the       World Bank. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Financial Services. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall       be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose       of amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the       nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on       Financial Services now printed in the bill. The committee       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered       as read. All points of order against the committee amendment       in the nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to the       committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in       order except those printed in part A of the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such amendments are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any       Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any       amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill       or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2954) to amend       the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 to specify which       depository institutions are subject to the maintenance of       records and disclosure requirements of such Act, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. The amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services       now printed in the bill, modified by the amendment printed in       part B of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial       Services; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                time  1230                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                time  1230                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying  legislation.   This rule makes in order two bills reported favorably by the  Committee on Financial Services. In addition, the rule makes in order a  majority of the amendments submitted.   These bills were the subject of hearings in the Financial Services  Committee, and both were marked up and reported favorably to the House.  Both bills received bipartisan support in the committee, and I expect  that we will see bipartisan support for both bills on the floor this  week.   Mr. Speaker, formed in 1944, the World Bank is the oldest  multilateral development bank. As a post-World War II effort of  international cooperation, the goal of the World Bank was to fund  reconstruction efforts in war-torn nations.   In 1960, the United States pushed for the creation of the  International Development Association within the World Bank. Where the  original World Bank division funded middle-income countries, the IDA  was created to make concessional loans; that is, loans with low  interest rates and long repayment periods to the world's poorest  countries.   The number of countries served by the IDA currently stands at 75. The  IDA is typically the single largest source of funding for critical  social programs in these low-income countries. However, the bill before  us reduces the United States' contribution to the IDA.   The IDA is funded through replenishments by donor countries. We are  currently in the 18th replenishment period, known as IDA-18. The bill  reduces the United States' contribution in IDA-18 by 15 percent.  Further, the bill requires that the Treasury Department certify that  the World Bank reform its practices and lending controls in relation to  the IDA.   A 2016 report commissioned by the World Bank reveals serious problems  with one particular IDA project in Uganda. While IDA's role is to  reduce inequality and support the development of civil society, the  report outlines numerous failures to achieve these objectives on the  part of the IDA.   The report details how IDA financing of a project in Uganda led to  systemic spreading of HIV/AIDS, sexual abuse of minors, child labor,  retaliation against local citizens, gender-based violence, and other  gross abuses of powerless Ugandans. While the IDA took several steps,  including withdrawing some loans from this particular project, there is  much concern that this project is indicative of many others.   The House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing at which  testimony was received from the International Consortium of  Investigative Journalists indicating that governments that allow or  participate in the abuse of their citizens and the subjugation of the  poor have not been turned away by the World Bank.   The testimony reads in part: ``We found instead that the bank  repeatedly funded governments that not only failed to adequately  resettle communities, but in some cases were accused of human rights  abuses such as rape, murder, and violent evictions associated with bank  projects. We found in several cases that the World Bank continued to  bankroll these borrowers  [[Page H424]]  even after evidence of these abuses came to light.''   Mr. Speaker, the IDA has a quality control problem, and we are right  in reducing their funding.   As if the abuse of citizens by corrupt governments is not enough, the  committee has also uncovered evidence that the World Bank has serious  internal problems as well.   According to the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group, World  Bank staff has long been incentivized to simply get more loans out the  door without any incentive to ensure the quality of the projects. This  has been a longstanding trend documented since the early 1990s.   But it is not just perverse incentives. The World Bank has not  focused enough on rigidly guarding itself against internal corruption.  A professor from Caltech testified before the committee that it was  common for World Bank projects to be captured by corrupt governments  and that World Bank staff try to suppress corruption investigations.   She said: ``Corruption investigations can shut down projects and  derail careers. They are also inconvenient for senior management in the  bank who are balancing delicate relationships with their country  clients.''   Due to these problems, the underlying bill protects American  taxpayers by withholding funding from the World Bank until these  deficiencies are fixed.   Mr. Speaker, not only should we be holding international  organizations accountable, we should also be holding our own government  accountable, and the second bill made in order under this rule does  just that.   In 2011, Dodd-Frank transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau regulatory authority over home mortgages. Since then, CFPB has  made information reporting by lenders more extensive.   The impact of these increased regulations has led to greater costs to  lenders. Consequently, smaller lenders have had to pass on these costs  directly to potential borrowers. This has reduced access to affordable  credit to borrowers who would typically seek out smaller lending  institutions.   The underlying bill is simple: exempt small lenders from CFPB's  onerous reporting requirements.   Under the leadership of Chairman Hensarling, House Republicans have  consistently put forward a plan to reform the CFPB. However, until we  can pass broader reforms, we should do everything we can to protect  Americans from harmful regulations pushed on them by the CFPB.    Today, we have two bills before us that hold powerful organizations  accountable to American taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and these  bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend from Colorado that the House did pass  the Children's Health Insurance Program bill in November. We did send  it to the Senate. Perhaps if he could talk to the leadership in his  party over in the Senate, we could get that bill passed in the Senate  instead of blocked, and we could deal with a very important issue, an  issue in Colorado that is absolutely essential, because the money is  running out in Colorado, one of the few States where it is even more  important than many of the other States.   I appreciate my colleague's concern on this issue. I share his  concern. The House acted responsibly in a broad, bipartisan bill.  Hopefully, we can get our friends over in the Senate to get more done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Emmer), my good friend and the sponsor of one of the bills today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), chair of the Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and  Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Overlooking corruption and abuse is unacceptable in any governing  body, particularly one funded by the United States.   It is clear that serious reforms and oversight are needed at the  World Bank. The International Development Association has strayed from  its mission to help combat inequality around the world.  [[Page H428]]    The World Bank Accountability Act puts our international partners on  notice that the United States is not simply going to stand by and allow  abuses to continue.   And while we stand up for the underprivileged around the world, we  also must ensure that every American has equal access to our own  financial institutions.   The Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act ensures that CFPB  regulations do not shut out certain groups of Americans.   I thank Chairman Hensarling for putting these bills forward. I thank  my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee, who have joined me  on the floor today to make the case for these efforts. I thank Chairman  Sessions for his leadership on the Rules Committee and for providing  the debate on these issues today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the rule  and supporting the underlying bills. We must ensure that American  taxpayer money is not spent on corrupt regimes and that all Americans  have access to financing here in the U.S.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 693 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution. . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). The question is on ordering the  previous question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
