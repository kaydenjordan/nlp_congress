 Madam Speaker, the October jobs report  was strong. The unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, at 3.6  percent, and 128,000 jobs were added. Employment of African Americans,  Asian Americans, and Hispanics are at record highs.   I am grateful for President Donald Trump's actions to create jobs by  reducing taxes and regulations. All Americans have benefited, with  stocks achieving an all-time record high. The Dow Jones Average has  risen to over 28,000, for the first time in history, on Friday.   With increased liquidity, jobs are created for small businesses and  retirement accounts. The stock market, under President Donald Trump,  has soared from 18,000 on election day to, now, over 28,000.   By creating jobs, lowering unemployment, and consistently working to  promote opportunities, President Trump is continuing his record of  keeping his promises. Baseless attacks on the President by Democrats  and fake news try to conceal these successes, but President Trump is  focused to work for American families and jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
