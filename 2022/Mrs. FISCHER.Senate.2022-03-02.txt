 Mr. President, the Ukrainian people have captured the  hearts of freedom-loving men and women around the world since Putin  launched his unprovoked invasion of their homeland last week.   Even as we speak, they are still under attack, not just in the  capital of Kyiv but in cities all across Ukraine. The images coming out  of Ukraine are truly heartbreaking: newborn babies in need of intensive  care, kindergarten buildings and apartment complexes being shelled  indiscriminately, and tearful goodbyes between loved ones.   Putin's invasion has caused Europe's largest refugee crisis this  century. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, nearly  900,000 Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries so far, but many  of the other images we have seen show inspiring courage. Citizens of EU  countries have welcomed their Ukrainian neighbors with open arms.  Regular, everyday men and women--teachers and software engineers and  moms and dads--have taken up arms to defend their country and their  loved ones. President Zelenskyy has chosen to remain in Ukraine when he  could have fled, refusing to desert his people in their darkest hour.   The English writer G.K. Chesterton once said:         The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in       front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.    I can't think of a better way to describe this conflict.   The Russians are fighting to fulfill Putin's imperial ambitions. The  Ukrainians are fighting to protect their families, their democracy, and  everything that they hold dear. That may be their greatest advantage as  they, God willing, continue to hold out in the coming days.   Responsibility for this horrific invasion lies squarely with Putin.  Leading up to this crisis, President Biden and our allies offered  Russia every opportunity to choose deescalation and peace. Instead,  Putin chose to use diplomacy as a smokescreen, buying time while he  prepared for war.   In a deliberate message of contempt for the international community,  Putin ordered the attack to begin  [[Page S940]]  while the U.N. Security Council was meeting to discuss Russia's buildup  on the Ukrainian border. Here is a glimpse into how little power  organizations like the U.N. have in moments of crisis like this: During  this meeting on what to do about Russia's coming invasion, the Russian  Ambassador was presiding.   Innocent Ukrainians as young as 6 years old are being killed because  one man fancies himself the next Joseph Stalin. Because of one man's  desire to restore the borders of the Soviet Union, the fundamental  principles of security in Europe are in peril.   In response to this invasion, President Biden has announced new  sanctions against Russia. These measures will affect 2 of Russia's  largest banks--Sberbank and VTB--as well as 45 of their subsidiaries.  The administration is also imposing sanctions against several other  Russian financial institutions and a number of state-owned enterprises.   The United States, with our allies and partners, not just in Europe  but also in Asia, have agreed to pursue even more aggressive sanctions  against Russia. That includes beginning to remove certain Russian banks  from the global SWIFT financial messaging network. It includes freezing  the currency reserves of Russia's central bank. All of this will make  Putin and his inner circle feel the pain. It will hurt Russia's ability  to wage war now and in the future. Many companies are joining this  effort on their own, and they are withdrawing from the Russian market.   Putin's unprecedented aggression demands an unprecedented response.  Beyond economic sanctions, this invasion has only made the NATO  alliance stronger and more resolved to stand firm against unlawful  aggression. This includes Germany, which has traditionally taken a more  positive view of Russia than many of our other European allies.   Germany's Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has rightly committed to  increasing Germany's military investment after decades of putting  defense spending on the back burner. Scholz also said Germany would  seriously pursue options to reduce their reliance on Russia for natural  gas. If he follows through on increasing Germany's military spending,  that will bring German defense investment above the 2 percent target  NATO has set for its members by 2024--a target that most NATO countries  still aren't meeting.   While historically neutral Sweden and Finland are considering joining  NATO, they aren't members yet, but they are still sending much needed  military aid to Ukraine. Even Switzerland has broken its tradition of  neutrality in order to freeze billions in Russian assets being held in  Swiss banks, and our other allies and partners around the world, like  Japan and Australia, are helping fund the Ukrainian resistance as well.   After this near universal condemnation from the world's democracies,  Putin hasn't backed down. No. He has turned to nuclear blackmail. He  put Russia's nuclear forces into special combat readiness on Sunday,  explicitly using Russia's nuclear deterrent to discourage Western  nations from supporting Ukraine.   This kind of escalation is unthinkable to Americans but not to Putin.  This is why the men and women of the U.S. Strategic Command, which is  based at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, work day and night to deter  threats like these. There is a reason that their motto is ``Peace is  Our Profession.'' Separately, at least five Offutt-based jets from the  Air Force's 55th Wing are flying reconnaissance missions in Europe.  Together, these planes have flown 10 of the 86 missions the United  States and our NATO allies carried out in the days leading up to the  Russian attack. I was told of these missions during a visit to Offutt  last Friday.   In addition to what we have done so far, I believe the Ukraine crisis  demands that we fundamentally reevaluate our approach to dealing with  Putin. We can no longer pretend that he might, one day, play by the  same rules as the rest of us.    Since he came to power, Presidents of both parties have sought to  improve relations with him. Too often, they have overlooked decades of  bad behavior to try to achieve that goal, hoping that American  restraint might lead Moscow to take that same approach.   If it wasn't clear even before this attack, the events of the past  week have proven that idea to be a fantasy.   Putin thought Russia would get a quick win when he invaded Ukraine.  He never expected this kind of resistance from the outmatched and the  outnumbered Ukrainians. But he didn't account for their bravery. He  didn't account for the fact that while Russia is fighting to gobble up  more land in Eastern Europe, the Ukrainians are fighting to protect  their children, spouses, parents, and their very way of life.   After the events of the past week, Putin's naked aggression, his  imperial ambitions, and his contempt for the international order are  undeniable.   Global norms and treaty obligations mean nothing--they mean nothing  to him. Russia had explicitly sworn to uphold Ukraine's territorial  integrity in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, one more agreement added to  the long list of those Russia has violated under Putin.   After his completely unprovoked invasion, this would-be 21st-century  czar has lost whatever credibility he had left. The United States and  our allies must keep this in mind as we think about where we go from  here.   We have to accept that as long as Putin is in power, a cooperative  relationship with Russia will not be possible. We have to do what we  can to push back against Putin's warmongering and continue to support  the brave people of Ukraine.   I yield the floor.
