 Mr. Speaker, 8 months after Typhoon Mangkhut and 7 months  after Super Typhoon Yutu, we are finally ready to send a disaster  relief bill to the President for signature. Of course, this has taken  longer than any of us might wish. But I want to use my time simply to  say thank you to my fellow Americans who are always willing to help  when they see a neighbor in need.   Is not this attitude of charity for all, as Lincoln said, what binds  our Nation?   Almost 50 years ago, the people of the Northern Mariana Islands, whom  I represent here, voted to join the United States. It is at moments  like this that we remember what a wise decision that was and what a  great nation we are now part of.   On behalf of all in the Northern Mariana Islands who suffer to this  day because of the lasting effects of Typhoons Mangkhut and Yutu, I say  thank you.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, 12 years ago, Congress enacted legislation extending  U.S. immigration law to my district, the Northern Mariana Islands; and  for my 11 years here in Congress, I have worked to make the resulting  transition as least difficult as possible.   Because there were unforeseen consequences, there were people who  fell through the cracks. Today we have the chance to help some of those  people. Their circumstances were not taken into account when Federal  immigration was extended to our islands.                                time  1600    During the Obama administration, they were granted humanitarian  parole that allowed them to stay. But President Trump decided that was  an improper use of parole.   The President's executive order of January 25, 2017, directed that  parole be granted only on a case-by-case basis not to categories of  people, as had been done in the Marianas.   As a result, 1,039 long-term residents of my island lost their parole  status last December. They were given until June 29 to adjust status or  leave.   I have no argument with the President's thinking. In fact, I have  worked to provide permanent status in law for these long-term  residents. But immigration legislation is difficult. I have not been  successful.   I hope today that will change because even though the Trump  administration ended parole, at the same time, the administration also  recognized that these long-term residents should be allowed to stay in  the Marianas. The administration drafted legislation giving these  [[Page H4203]]  people permanent status in the Marianas, and just in the Marianas, so  they could continue to live and work as they have for years as part of  our community.   I introduced that legislation, H.R. 559, and the administration  submitted a statement for the hearing record to the Natural Resources  Committee supporting passage, which I include in the Record.                                                  U.S. Department of                                               Homeland Security,                                  Washington, DC, February 21, 2019.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Grijalva: This letter sets forth       Department of Homeland Security (DHS) views with regard to       H.R. 559, the ``Northern Mariana Islands Long-Term Legal       Residents Relief Act.''        Thank you for seeking the Department's input on this new       legislation. We appreciate the opportunity to review H.R. 559       as the Committee begins the legislative process in the 1st       session of the 116th Congress.        As you are aware, H.R. 559 would provide for the admission       of certain aliens who are currently present in the       Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and who       had been parolees as CNMI residents. In doing so, the bill       would establish an alternative regime to the now-terminated       categorical parole program for the CNMI. DHS believes that       the bill would address the discrete needs of this alien group       in an equitable and lawful manner--more so than any other       bill that is now pending Congressional consideration.        In light of the aforementioned, DHS supports H.R. 559. DHS       would respectfully urge the Committee to consider the bill       favorably. Further, it is the Department's hope that the full       House of Representatives will take up and pass the measure       expeditiously.        The Department is pleased to inform you that the Office of       Management and Budget has no objection to the presentation of       this letter to Congress. Nonetheless, I appreciate your       interest in the Administration's concerns on this matter.       Fortunately, there are none.        Again, thank you for the opportunity to review and share       the Department's position on H.R. 559. An identical letter       has been sent to Representatives Sablan and Bishop.            Respectfully,                                              Christine M. Ciccone,                       Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, let me read from the administration's  letter. ``H.R. 559 would provide for the admission of certain aliens  who are currently present in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana  Islands, CNMI, and who had been parolees. . . . In doing so, the bill  would establish an alternative regime to the now-terminated categorical  parole program for the CNMI. DHS believes that the bill would address  the discrete needs of this alien group in an equitable and lawful  manner. . . . It is the Department's hope that the full House of  Representatives will take up and pass the measure expeditiously.''  Signed: Christine M. Ciccone, Assistant Secretary for Legislative  Affairs, Department of Homeland Security.   To be completely transparent, the bill before us has been altered  slightly from the original. The bill now includes an administrative  appeal procedure if an applicant believes an error was made in  processing their petition for permanent status. But that new language  was also drafted, at my request, by the administration. So the bill  remains 100 percent as drafted by the administration.   Again, the bill provides permanent status in the Marianas only, with  no right of entry to any other part of the United States and no right  to any public assistance, to a small group of people who have lived and  worked in the Marianas, always lawfully present, since before U.S.  immigration law was ever extended to our islands.   The Trump administration agrees. These individuals should be allowed  to stay, but not by administrative fiat. They should be allowed to stay  under the rule of law.   Today, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass that  law. Do as the administration advises. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 559.
