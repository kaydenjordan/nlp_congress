Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislation days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday the Committee on Rules met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1464, providing for consideration of  S. 4524, the Speak Out Act, under a closed rule. The rule provides 1  hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary as well as one motion  to commit.   The rule further provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability this week to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspensions.  The rule also provides roll call votes on suspension bills considered  on November 14 or 15 may be postponed through November 18.   Lastly, the rule provides standard recess instructions for the  district work period from November 21 through November 28 and deems  passage of House Resolution 1463.   Madam Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of the Speak  Out Act, a straightforward, bipartisan bill, that passed the Senate  unanimously, to prevent nondisclosure agreements from silencing victims  of sexual assault and harassment.   Over the past 5 years, we have seen numerous cases of women and men  disclosing their experiences of sexual harassment in the workplace. As  more people came forward, others felt empowered to share their  experiences, and offenders who had long gotten away with such  reprehensible conduct increasingly faced consequences to their actions.   While many high-profile cases focused on movie executives, actors, TV  personalities, professional athletes, and elected officials, sexual  assault and harassment has been endemic in American workplaces for a  very long time. The silencing of survivors with nondisclosure  agreements has played a significant role in allowing such misconduct to  continue.   Over the span of multiple congressional hearings, we have heard  firsthand accounts of how harassment affects workers in all industries,  from farms to offices to restaurants to colleges. Sexual harassment is  pervasive in U.S. workplaces. It is not a problem unique to athletes  and celebrities that we see on TV.   However, the one thing that many of the stories have in common is  that the perpetrators are often people in positions of power, CEOs,  bosses, managers, and executives, and these people have access to  expensive lawyers and PR teams to exploit flaws in our legal system to  protect themselves and silence those they have abused.   Now, thanks to the courage of survivors and the increasing power of  women and other historically underrepresented groups in the workplace,  there is a newfound recognition of the social and economic consequences  of a status quo that enables or excuses such misconduct, and there is  new momentum to ensure that the American workplace environment is safe  and fair for all.   I am so encouraged that this Congress has been able to come together  and pass legislation to address this problem. Earlier this year,  Congress passed bipartisan legislation that now prevents companies from  using forced arbitration agreements to resolve cases of sexual assault  or harassment.   Forced arbitration clauses are widespread in employment contracts and  generally prevent workers from suing their employer in court.  Arbitration proceedings overwhelmingly benefit the employer because the  employer decides the venue, terms of mediation, and even the  arbitrators themselves. Forced arbitration, combined with nondisclosure  agreements, meant that victims were kept silent and forced into  settlements over which they had little control and kept predators from  facing accountability for their actions.   Even more concerning, the silencing of survivors of abuse through  forced arbitration and nondisclosure agreements thwarts an important  tool for preventing future misconduct. Abusers  [[Page H8503]]  who are not held responsible are free and, in a sense, encouraged to  offend again. Given the stigma that victims of such abuse often  encounter, they are less likely to come forward if they think the abuse  they endured was an isolated incident.   With the passage of the Speak Out Act, both of these legal gimmicks  will be banned in cases of sexual assault in the workplace, freeing  workers and making corporations take responsibility for actually  creating a safe work environment. These laws won't end sexual  harassment and abuse in the workplace overnight, but it will now make  it easier for victims to seek justice and deter bad behavior.   As a woman, and the mother of a daughter, like at least a third of  women in the American workplace, both of us have experienced or  witnessed such workplace behavior, so I wholly support this  legislation.   In my view, passing the Speak Out Act should be an easy task for the  House of Representatives. It is a simple, sensible bill, and it passed  unanimously in the Senate, an institution not always known for finding  consensus.   Here in the House, the Speak Out Act should receive similar  treatment, passage with an overwhelming, if not unanimous, majority.  But we have been forced by the obstruction of a number of our more  extreme Republican colleagues to expend the time needed to pass a rule,  engage in hours of debate, and take four votes to pass the bill in the  House, when we have numerous pressing items demanding Congress'  attention before year's end.   The fact that the bill passed with all 100 Senators in support, in an  evenly divided Senate, should tell you that if there were serious  problems with the bill, they have already been resolved. Anyone who has  actually read the legislation knows that.    NDAs are meant to protect trade secrets and business dealings. Why  would anyone try to enable their use in covering up sexual assault?   I am here to get results for my constituents, and that includes  measures to ensure that our workplaces are free from sexual assault and  abuse.   Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage all my colleagues to support  today's rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I am looking forward to the fact that by  the end of the week, the Speak Out Act will be signed into law.   While these reforms to the nondisclosure agreements and forced  arbitration agreements will only go so far, they will create a more  even playing field for survivors of sexual assault and harassment.  Thousands of people will be freed from the unfair burdens of NDAs, and  I sincerely hope this brings justice and closure to those who need it.   I also recognize that there is a lot more this Congress should do to  support both workers and victims of sexual assault.   We can't ignore the disproportionate power that most employers hold  over their employees, which can often lead to unfair outcomes for  workers. Whether it is NDA agreements that silence victims, contracts  that undercut workers' pay or rights, forced arbitration clauses, or  egregious noncompete agreements, there is much more work to do to  guarantee an even playing field for all workers in this economy.   I am proud of the work House Democrats have accomplished for workers  this Congress. Although the Senate filibuster has greatly curtailed the  scope of what we should do, Democrats and President Biden have secured  multiple wins for workers over the past 2 years, and the Speak Out Act  is another victory in that column.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support today's rule.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
