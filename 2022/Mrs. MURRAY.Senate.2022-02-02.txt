 Madam President, reserving the right to object.   Just weeks ago, we celebrated the anniversary of Roe v. Wade--the  landmark decision that affirmed the right to abortion and changed so  many lives for the better.   Across the country, patients spoke out about their experiences before  Roe--about how Roe meant they could get an abortion they needed or even  how, after Roe, they still struggled to get access to abortion. But  what was present in all of those stories was real fear about what the  future holds--the fear of what a country without Roe would look like-- because that is what Republicans are pushing for all across the  country.   Republicans in Texas passed SB 8, which bans abortions after 6 weeks  and allows people to sue anyone who helps someone get an abortion.   In Idaho, bordering my home State of Washington, extreme Republican  legislators are trying to pass a law modeled after the Texas abortion  ban.   Republicans in Mississippi brought a direct challenge of Roe to the  Supreme Court and have told the Court, in no uncertain terms, they  believe Roe should be overturned.   Now, those are just a few examples, and we have got one more here in  the Senate today.   The resolution from the Senator from Indiana sends a message that the  Republican Party knows best when it comes to some of the most personal  decisions people make about their health and their futures, about when  and whether to have children, and about what is best for themselves and  their families.   Well, they don't.   In fact, the majority of Americans support Roe and do not want to see  it overturned. They want a country where everyone can control their own  bodies and their own futures, and that is exactly what I am fighting  for so I object.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
