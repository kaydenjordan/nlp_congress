 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentlewoman from Texas, the Honorable Mayra Flores, be permitted to  take the oath of office this evening.   Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to her election.    Madam Speaker, central to the preservation of our  democracy is recognition of the results of fair elections you lose just  as much, if not more, than the elections which you win. Tonight, we  welcome to this Chamber a new Member and recognize a fairly won  Republican victory in my home State for the 6 months remaining this  year in the term of our recent colleague, Filemon Vela, who resigned.   Mayra Flores was born and raised in Tamaulipas, Mexico. She came  legally to the United States at 6 years old with the help of her father  and became a naturalized American citizen.   Mayra graduated in 2014 as a respiratory care practitioner and  currently works caring for those with chronic respiratory issues. With  Latino Texans bearing a very disproportionate burden from the pandemic,  she has been on the front lines combating COVID. She graduated from  South Texas College, and her husband serves as a Border Patrol agent.  Mayra will be the first Mexican-born woman to serve in the House and  the first Hispanic Republican woman to serve in our Texas delegation.   She ran a very vigorous campaign. I congratulate her on her success.  I see that she brings a beautiful family to our Chamber. I look forward  to working with her this year.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), who  is the senior Texas Republican in my Ways and Means Committee.
