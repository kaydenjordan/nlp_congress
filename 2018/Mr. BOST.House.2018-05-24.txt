 Mr. Speaker, on May 25, we celebrate National Poppy Day.   After World War I, the poppy flourished in Europe. Scientists said  the growth was because the soil in France and Belgium became enriched  with lime from the rubble left by the war. From the dirt and mud grew  beautiful red poppies.   The red poppy came to symbolize the blood shared during battle  following the publication of a wartime poem, ``In Flanders Fields,'' by  Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae while serving on the front lines.   The poppy honors those who served and died for our country in all  wars and  [[Page H4699]]  reminds the American people of the sacrifices made by our veterans  while protecting our freedom.   To those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, we say thank you.                            ____________________
