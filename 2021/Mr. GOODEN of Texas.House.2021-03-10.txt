 Mr. Speaker, in what alternative reality does it  make sense for this Congress to take away people's rights to defend  themselves and, at the same time, defund the police? That makes no  sense.   What we have seen in the last few days and the last week in this  Congress is an effort to punish the law-abiders in this Nation. We have  to stop doing this.   If we take away guns from law-abiding citizens, we are doing nothing  to reduce crime. Look at Chicago. The law-abiding citizens there do not  live in a safe environment. They are able to follow these procedures  that you are passing, but it is not going to do anything to stop the  violence.   We have to get away from this. We have to stop these laws that do not  represent the will of the American people.   Let's stop punishing the law-abiding citizens of the United States  and get back to what they sent us here to do.
