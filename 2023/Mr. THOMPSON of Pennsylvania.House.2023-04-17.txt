 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend  Del Spafford of DuBois, Pennsylvania, for receiving the 2023 James M.  Roche Spirit of Volunteerism award.   The Roche award is the highest volunteer award given by the  Department of Defense's office of Employer Support of the Guard and  Reserve. The award calls attention to significant achievements made by  volunteers in contributing to and accomplishing the ESGR mission of  promoting cooperation between civilian employers and servicemembers of  the National Guard and Reserve.   Since retiring as Battalion Commander from the famous 28th Division  of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, Spafford has demonstrated the  spirit of patriotism and service.   For more than 34 years, Spafford has served the ESGR in many  capacities and has the distinguished honor of being the longest  continuing serving committee member in Pennsylvania.   Most notably, he has accumulated an astonishing 1,285 volunteer hours  with the ESGR in the past 8 years alone while serving in a variety of  overlapping roles.   I commend Del Spafford for earning the James M. Roche Spirit of  Volunteerism Award for his commitment to our citizen soldiers and for  his dedication to supporting military-civilian relations in north- central Pennsylvania.                            ____________________
