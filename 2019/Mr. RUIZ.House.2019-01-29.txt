 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Mayor Greg  Pettis, a leader and devoted advocate for our desert communities in  California's 36th Congressional District, who unexpectedly passed away  recently on January 15.   I had the privilege of working with Mayor Pettis to fight for  equality and social justice for the people of the Coachella Valley.   Mayor Pettis set an example as a public servant committed to  protecting the rights of all his constituents.   During his decades of service to our communities, Mayor Pettis never  wavered in his advocacy for civil rights, improved transportation, and  access to healthcare.                                time  1015    As Cathedral City's first openly gay public servant and longest  serving council member, Mayor Pettis was a trailblazer and a role  model.   Every day, Mayor Pettis brought his passion for helping others to the  call to public service. He helped our valley build a public library,  combat drug addiction, and expand affordable housing.   Through his leadership and kindness, Mayor Pettis will live on in the  memory of his brothers, Stephen and David Pettis, and the friends,  neighbors, and families whose lives he touched.                     Recognizing Supervisor Marion Ashley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Supervisor Marion  Ashley on his retirement after more than 35 years of public service.   Supervisor Ashley has served the people in Riverside County since  2002 with leadership, integrity, respect, and enthusiasm. He grew up in  Riverside County, California, and like me, has had the privilege of  returning home to serve.   To see his positive impact on the cities of Banning, Beaumont,  Calimesa, and others, you only need to look around. You will see  medical centers, public parks, wildlife conservation areas, and fire  stations that exist thanks to his advocacy.   In retirement, I hope Supervisor Ashley will enjoy spending more time  with Mary, his wife of more than 60 years, and their 6 children, 19  grandchildren, and 9 great-grandchildren.   On behalf of communities across Riverside County, it is my honor to  congratulate Supervisor Ashley on a well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
