 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  resolution, which condemns the wave of attacks on pro-life groups and  facilities.   As a Nation, we are blessed to have a nationwide network of faithful,  dedicated pro-life pregnancy centers that provide care for pregnant  women and their babies.   Women deserve to be offered the full range of health support that can  help them in their time of need. Pro-life pregnancy centers do exactly  that, offering a compassionate support system for pregnant women.   Shamefully, since the Dobbs decision was rendered, these pregnancy  centers have been under attack by radical abortion activists. We have  seen horrific displays of vandalism, threats, and intimidation directed  at pro-life groups and facilities for the simple fact that they support  life and serve to help pregnant mothers in need.   No one is forced to receive care at a pregnancy center, yet we see  people committing violence on pregnancy centers. Why? Are they angry  that so many choose to not terminate the life of their own baby and let  their child live, like all of your mothers did, rather than violently  terminate the life of their own baby?   Madam Speaker, I ask Congress to stand together and strongly condemn  this violence by passing this resolution.
