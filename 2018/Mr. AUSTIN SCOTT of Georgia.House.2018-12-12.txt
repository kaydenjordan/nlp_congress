 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank  Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson for their leadership  during this process.   I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the conference report  to the 2018 farm bill to provide the first major reforms of our  Nation's agriculture policy in nearly 5 years.   For the last several years, Members of both sides of the aisle have  worked to make sure that our Nation's primary agricultural policy works  for American producers.   This year, I was honored to, once again, be chosen to serve on the  farm bill conference committee to fight for the good people of middle  and south Georgia who dedicate their lives to agriculture. I am  confident that this bill delivers the reforms that our farmers and  industry stakeholders desperately need to keep our producers in rural  communities growing and innovating for the 21st century.   This bill strengthens the farm safety net and provides certainty and  flexibility that our producers need. It also ensures that our farmers  can provide the food, nutrition, and fiber, not only for America, but  the rest of the world.   In this legislation, we have laid the groundwork for expanding  quality broadband access to rural America by giving the USDA the tools  and resources to bridge the digital divide that is leaving millions of  rural Americans behind and hindering our communities from thriving.   I am very glad that two amendments that I offered were included in  the final agreement, which will bring modernization and accountability  to broadband services and spur broadband infrastructure investment in  rural America. Bridging the digital divide is something I have been  fighting for, for years now, and I look forward to seeing the growth in  network service and infrastructure development through the provisions  of this bill.   In this conference report, we also found some common ground to make  improvements to SNAP. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  conference report.
