 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to call on all of those  who support freedom and democracy to stand with the long-suffering  people of Venezuela. We have finally reached the tipping point where  freedom for the Venezuelan people hangs in the balance.   On Friday, President Trump recognized the duly elected leader of the  National Assembly, Juan Guaido, as the constitutional interim President  of Venezuela. Shortly afterward the vast majority of Western Hemisphere  nations affirmed their recognition of the Guaido government.   On January 10 the OAS passed a resolution, Mr. Speaker, that refused  to recognize the illegitimate Maduro regime, and OAS Secretary-General  Luis  [[Page H1251]]  Almagro expressed his congratulations to Mr. Guaido as Venezuela's  legitimate sitting President.   Now, Mr. Speaker, it is time to choose to stand with the courageous  protesters demanding freedom, many of them bruised and bloodied from  the violence perpetrated on them by the Maduro thugs. Reports indicate  that at least 29 protesters have been killed just since last week, and  the Maduro regime holds hundreds of political prisoners. The Maduro  regime has ruthlessly corrupted Venezuela's once-democratic  institutions, including the Supreme Court.   The U.N. High Commissioner of Human Rights and others have documented  egregious human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary  detentions, and torture. We have seen that the Venezuelan people  continue to demand freedom in the face of teargas, imprisonment, and,  yes, even bullets.   The United States is standing with the Venezuelan people, sanctioning  65 of the most corrupt and abusive members of the Maduro regime,  including Maduro himself. Congress and the administration are also  working to alleviate the grave humanitarian crisis that the Maduro  regime has caused, providing nearly $100 million in humanitarian aid to  those Venezuelans who have fled to other countries and an additional  $37 million in development assistance to Colombia.   Earlier this year, my colleague, Congressman Darren Soto, and I  worked together to introduce the Venezuela TPS Act of 2019 which would  provide Temporary Protective Status to Venezuelan nationals here in the  United States. The situation in Venezuela is way too dangerous to force  them to return now.   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, the humanitarian crisis rivals the grave  democratic crisis in Venezuela. Under Venezuela's socialism, its people  are suffering skyrocketing inflation, profound destitution, and  shortages of necessary food and medicine.   Venezuela was once, just recently, one of the wealthiest countries in  the world. Now the vast majority of Venezuelan people have sunk into  poverty. Hospitals are abandoned, Mr. Speaker, and food and medicines  are scarce. But, Mr. Speaker, we have entered a time of critical  importance. Rarely is there such an obvious choice between good and  evil, freedom and enslavement, and accountable government and tyranny.   From Venezuela's one last vestige of democracy came a glimmer of  hope. From the democratically elected National Assembly, a leader  emerged who was courageous enough to lead the opposition and face  certain persecution. Juan Guaido stepped up to represent the Venezuelan  people and work with the international community toward a democratic  transition to unite the many voices in the opposition behind a common  purpose: freedom, human rights, and free and fair elections.   He has designated his charge d'affaires here in the United States,  Carlos Vecchio, whose leadership was welcomed by Secretary Pompeo and  who is coordinating between the Guaido government and the United States  Government.   Already as President Guaido is gaining strength, we are seeing signs  of cracks from the Maduro dictatorship. The United States must continue  to be the world leader in defense of those struggling for democracy,  and others in the world community who value freedom also must stand  with the people of Venezuela in their quest for democracy.   Mr. Speaker, the people of Eastern Europe have not forgotten that we  stood with them during those decades in their struggle against  Communism for decades. They were victorious; and today they are free,  and they are allies. The people of Venezuela will also be victorious.   (The English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as  follows:)         To the Venezuelan Armed Forces, this is the time to recover       your honor, to recover your dignity and stand with the       Venezuelan people in this noble cause, which is freedom.        And to the brave Venezuelan people, you are not alone. The       Trump administration, the United States Congress, the United       States is with you.         A las Fuerzas Armadas de Venezuela, este es el momento de       recuperar su honor, de recuperar su dignidad y ponerse de       lado del pueblo Venezolano en esta noble causa que es la       libertad.        Y al valiente pueblo Venezolano, no estan solos. La       administracion del presidente Trump, el Congreso de los       Estados Unidos, si todo los Estados Unidos estan con ustedes.
