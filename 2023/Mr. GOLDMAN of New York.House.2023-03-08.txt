 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   This bill purports to protect free speech from government censorship.  I agree, it is a great idea. It is such a good idea, in fact, that the  Founding Fathers put it in the Constitution. It is called the First  Amendment. We don't need a new bill to protect free speech because that  is currently the law of the land, so we must ask ourselves: What is the  point of this bill?   As our esteemed ranking member observed last night, Vladimir Putin  and Xi Jinping probably don't make a habit of watching congressional  proceedings, but we are willing to bet that this floor debate is of  keen interest to Russian and Chinese agents bent on destabilizing our  democracy and influencing our elections to serve their interests.   H.R. 140 would effectively allow these and other foreign malign  actors--who have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into online  propaganda to create chaos, mistrust, hate, and confusion for  Americans--to continue using social media platforms unfettered to wreak  havoc on our democratic institutions, including the integrity of our  elections.   It would do so by undermining the only defense that we have against  these operations, which is the ability of our national security,  intelligence, and law enforcement agencies to warn social media  platforms and the public about the deployment of counterfeit accounts,  disinformation, and cyber surveillance by malign actors.   Now, I have no doubt that my Republican colleagues will claim that,  of course, all of our national security apparatus is able to warn  social media companies of foreign interference. But the way that this  bill is written--even if that is the case, which it is not--they would  have to wait 72 hours in order to do that. Seventy-two hours on the  internet is a lifetime. Everything that they would want to accomplish  would be accomplished within 72 hours.   Now, there are exceptions to that. So, clearly, my Republican  colleagues recognize that there need to be exceptions, but those  exceptions cover a very, very narrow window, a narrow scope of child  pornography, human or drug trafficking, or the dissemination of  classified information. Anything else that might not be lawful speech  still has to wait 72 hours, far too long.   Now, Democrats acted in good faith to identify and correct these  dangerous loopholes in our committee, but all of our amendments were  voted down. Our Democratic and Republican colleagues attempted again to  address the most dangerous flaws of this bill by submitting 64  amendments for floor consideration, but Republicans only allowed 10 to  be considered here today. Of those, only one--one--was offered by a  Democrat. So much for all the open floor rules that our Republicans  have talked about.   Now, in fairness, Republicans accepted multiple minor amendments that  were submitted late, and yet still rejected many of the timely  amendments. Some of those Democratic amendments would have cured the  obvious weaknesses and loopholes of this unnecessary bill.   There was one amendment that would allow our intelligence community,  national security apparatus, and law enforcement to inform social media  companies of national security threats.   Another amendment would allow them to inform the social media  companies in order to combat domestic and international terrorism.   Another amendment would have addressed fraud targeting seniors.   Another amendment would have ensured the safety of children online.  Another amendment prevented attacks on the U.S. Capitol.   One amendment even would have prevented the incitement of violence by  Neo-Nazis and other hate groups.   They were all voted down. They even blocked a bipartisan amendment  offered by Congresswoman Houlahan and Congresswoman Mace to ensure that  law enforcement can still act immediately to prevent sexual assault.   By rejecting these commonsense amendments, Republicans have made it  clear that this bill is not about protecting the rights and safety of  all Americans. In fact, even though there is no evidence--and I will  get to that in a minute--that warrants this bill, there is plenty of  evidence that Russia interfered in our elections in 2016.   Now, what this bill does is it welcomes the same kind of election  interference that we know Russia did in 2016 and that they continue to  do today. Just like Donald Trump sided with Vladimir Putin over our  intelligence communities in Helsinki in 2018, this bill and the  Republicans who are sponsoring this bill are siding with Russia and  Vladimir Putin over our national security apparatus and our law  enforcement.   My Republican colleagues claim that they have put this bill forward  because the FBI somehow colluded with Twitter to suppress the New York  Post article on the Hunter Biden laptop story for all of 24 hours 3  weeks before the Presidential election, a private business decision  based on the best information available at the time, and which had  absolutely no discernible impact on the availability of the article nor  the outcome of the election.    The chairman of this committee just referenced a hearing that we had  where there were hours of testimony about censorship. Well, the only  testimony I witnessed about censorship was former President Trump  trying to take down tweets that he did not like on Twitter. There was  no evidence--none at all--that the FBI or any other law enforcement  agencies directed Twitter to take down any unlawful speech, and that  includes the Hunter Biden laptop story.   Now, we can spend some time, although we don't need to, on why that  story was both highly suspicious and also glaringly false, but the  broader point is that this is a bill that seeks a solution where there  is no problem. There is no protected speech that has been prohibited by  the Federal Government, and there is no actual evidence of any  censorship under the First Amendment.   We are basically trying to change the law to redefine censorship, and  in doing so we would be opening up the floodgates to allow for all  sorts of unprotected speech to be distributed throughout our social  media world online because the government officials who are charged  with making sure that our laws are not violated, that crimes are not  committed will be handcuffed and unable to do their jobs for fear that  they will be fined thousands of dollars if they are wrong.   I urge all my colleagues to stand with free speech and American  democracy and oppose this dangerous bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1182]]         Mr. Chair, I would like to respond briefly  because there is all this talk about collusion between the Biden  administration and the FBI and Twitter, and you can say it as many  times as you want to say it, and it still doesn't make it so because  there is no evidence of that.   In this country we rely on facts and evidence. We don't just rely on  conclusory allegations including fake polls that don't support what  you're trying to say.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Landsman).    Mr. Chairman, I will point out one  additional factor here that I think is very important for everyone to  consider. When asked what evidence there is that the FBI colluded or  directed Twitter to take down any speech, the chairman offered two  emails from one specific FBI agent, which suggested that a couple of  Twitter handles or tweets had given misleading information very  specifically about the time, place, or manner of voting in the upcoming  elections.   If my Republican colleagues believe that people should be able to lie  on Twitter and provide disinformation about when, where, and how to  vote, then they should absolutely support this bill. If that is all  that you have, and that is all that you have cited, this bill is a  complete waste of time and is totally unnecessary.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Lois Frankel).  [[Page H1183]]         Mr. Chairman, I have no idea what hearing  the gentleman from North Carolina is referring to, because at the  hearing with Twitter executives that I attended where the head of trust  and safety was specifically asked if the FBI had given any information,  instructions, or directions about the Hunter Biden New York Post story,  he specifically said no, they did not receive any information.   If that is what you all think that you are basing this bill on, the  actual facts in evidence are precisely the opposite of that.   It is preposterous that you continue to say that over and over and  over as if it is true when the evidence is directly contradictory to  that.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I remind you and everyone that the First Amendment does  not protect all speech. It protects lawful speech.   For example, if you make a death threat over the internet, that is  not protected speech. That is a Federal crime.   Let's remember, as we take on this absolutist view that all speech is  free speech, that there are many restrictions under our laws about what  is lawful speech and what is not.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), our constitutional legal scholar and esteemed  and distinguished ranking member.    Mr. Chair, I must commend my colleagues.  Everyone is really consistent on the talking points that must have been  circulated. Of course, they are not based on evidence, but everybody  does seem to believe that somehow the FBI was censoring people on  Twitter. Of course, those of us on the Oversight Committee who have sat  through the hearings have not seen any of that.   I am also a little bewildered now because what is basically coming  out is that my friends on the other side of the aisle apparently don't  support law enforcement doing their jobs, don't support the  Intelligence Committee doing their jobs to protect our national  security, to protect our elections, to protect our democracy. Instead,  they want to provide an opportunity for alternative facts to get around  the internet as fast and as quickly and as unfettered as possible, but  I am here to tell you that we Democrats fully support the First  Amendment.   Every single one of us observes, adheres, cherishes the First  Amendment. That is, in fact, part of the reason why we in the minority  on the Oversight Committee have asked the chairman to do some oversight  of Michael Cohen, the former President's former personal lawyer, who  was jailed in solitary confinement for 16 days by the Trump  administration because they did not want him to publish a book.   That is a prohibition on our free speech. That is censorship. That is  a violation of free speech. If we want to talk about free speech, that  is what we should be talking about, not some phantom issue that doesn't  exist about the FBI trying to make sure that our elections remain free  and fair and without foreign interference.   Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have now been here for about an  hour. I have yet to hear any evidence at all that the FBI has, in any  way, censored any one on social media, on Twitter, or otherwise.   What I have heard is a private company has temporarily restricted a  false article from appearing on its website based on serious suspicions  of its derivation and, in fact, the same basis for that false article,  a hard drive, was proven subsequently to have been altered.   The basis of what we are talking about underlying their concern was  false, but nevertheless it was still able to be sent around the  internet with ample time, and the social media site even apologized for  doing it.   This is a bill that, once again, is a solution searching for a  problem. Our First Amendment covers everything that is in here, but the  effect of this is it would allow foreign countries to jeopardize our  national security, to jeopardize our elections, and to, once again,  interfere in our democratic process.   That is the only thing that this bill accomplishes and it should be  voted down.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment that is offered at the desk.    Mr. Chair, we hear that the gentleman is  concerned about the censorship of conservative viewpoints on social  media. But we don't hear the same concern when Elon Musk takes over  Twitter and immediately takes down the accounts of six journalists that  he does not like. There was no other explanation for it, but it  certainly sounds exactly like what my Republican colleagues are talking  about, horrific censorship on Twitter. But somehow, that is okay.   So the only, then, explanation we get is, oh, well, it wasn't the  Federal Government who told Mr. Musk to do that. Yet, it was the  Federal Government who told Twitter to--I don't know--stall the Hunter  Biden story or whatever we did, whatever they were alleged to do.   Well, the facts don't bear that out. There was actually no effort by  the FBI to censor any journalist, any New York Post story, or anything  else. But we continue to hear that over and over and over.  Unfortunately, the facts don't actually match up with it.   Now, Twitter can do whatever it wants; it is a private company. So we  need to have some sort of nexus to the Federal Government.  Unfortunately, the facts and the evidence that has so far been  developed by the Republican majority on the Oversight and  Accountability Committee do not support any of these allegations.   What this amendment will do is continue their effort to undermine our  Federal law enforcement, because what this amendment will do is create  more bureaucracy, more reports, more time wasted on doing things other  than keeping Americans safe and protecting our national security and  our democracy.   This is nothing but an effort to have our good men and women in  Federal law enforcement be distracted from doing the jobs that they are  supposed to do, which is to protect our elections and our democracy  from foreign interference, rather than write lengthy reports.   For that reason, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, it is funny to hear about how the  Democrats are colluding in order to censor free speech on social media  when the administration in control of the Federal Government at the  time of the alleged horrific censorship that my Republican colleagues  are citing was a Republican administration.   It was the administration of President Donald Trump in October of  2020 when the Hunter Biden laptop story was paused for 24 to 48 hours.  Yet, somehow, I gather that the FBI is supposed to be a Democratic- leaning organization and agency doing the Democrats' bidding. Well, you  could have fooled me back in 2016 when the Director of the FBI  announced 10 days before the election that he was reopening an  investigation into the Democratic candidate for President while an  investigation was also ongoing into the Republican candidate for  President and yet that remained quiet. Explain to me how that is the  FBI doing the bidding of the Democrats.   This whole thing, this amendment and this bill, have no place in this  Congress. The amendment would just simply add more burdensome  bureaucracy to what is already a fruitless effort of a bill. Therefore,  we oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is a technical amendment. It doesn't make much of a difference  to what is already a bad bill.   But it is interesting to me that this amendment was allowed to come  to the floor, and so many amendments from the Democrats, which actually  made meaningful substantive changes to this bill, were not allowed to  come to the floor.   Now, we have heard a lot over the past 2 months of this Congress  about how the Republican majority is going to do things differently,  that they are going to have open rules so that everybody can offer  amendments on the floor. But what is clear is that the open rules, I  suppose, only apply to the Republican Party. They don't apply to the  Democratic Party.   What is upsetting about that, at least for me personally, is I had an  amendment that I had also offered in the Rules Committee last night to  include an exception not just for child trafficking, child  exploitation, human trafficking, and drug trafficking, but also for  foreign interference in our elections so that our law enforcement could  actually do the work that is needed to protect our democracy, to  protect our elections.   This is not some fanciful idea that this bill is actually addressing,  a nonexistent problem where the FBI is not actually even censoring  people. No, that amendment had to do with two charged indictments of  Russians in 2016 for interfering in our election. There is actual  evidence to support that amendment. Yet, my Republican colleagues did  not even allow it to come to the floor.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time for closing.   Mr. Chair, I think this amendment and the chairman's comments are  very telling. Of course nobody objects to protecting the free, lawful  speech of any American from the Federal Government. That is the First  Amendment. But what this bill does is it creates a tremendous barrier  to our law enforcement intelligence community and national security  apparatus from protecting Americans from all sorts of illicit, malign  activity that occurs on social media.   So by preventing us from bringing our substantive, thoughtful  amendments to the floor for a vote, what this bill is ultimately doing,  the net effect of it, even if it is not the intent of it, is that it is  allowing foreign actors to interfere in everything that happens in our  democracy, including our elections.   Now, why does this matter? Why would it matter? Well, because we all  know the special counsel definitively proved that Russia interfered in  the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win. And the Trump campaign  welcomed that interference and used it for their benefit. If you  disagree, go look at Special Counsel Mueller's report. That is what is  called conclusions based on evidence, not what this bill is.   Mr. Chair, for that reason, we oppose this amendment as well as the  underlying bill itself.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my esteemed colleague from North  Carolina says that lawful speech on the internet should never be  prohibited by Federal agencies, by the government. We agree. It is  called the First Amendment. It has existed long before H.R. 140 was  written.   What H.R. 140 does and what this amendment does even further is it  makes it impossible for unlawful speech to actually be policed. What  the private companies do not have is access to the intelligence agency  information, national security information, law enforcement information  that can determine whether or not the speech that is on the internet is  being used in furtherance of crimes or is in and of itself a crime.   They recognize this because there is an exception. There is an  exception to this prohibition on law enforcement agencies or Federal  Government agencies from actually communicating with social media.   There is an exception for child pornography, human trafficking, and  drug trafficking. I gather this amendment also deals with obscenity,  but I think it is trying to close this loophole.   Clearly, there is a recognition that law enforcement needs to  coordinate to some degree with our social media sites. What this law  does is that, but for those very narrow categories, law enforcement has  to wait 72 hours.   Everything is around the internet and over again many times within 72  hours. It is an exception that eats the rule. There is no way that law  enforcement can do its job because of this bill.   One would say if you were correct and if there were actual  prohibition and censorship of lawful speech that was going on, and if  you could show us evidence of that, then maybe one could imagine that a  congressional bill was warranted and necessary. Of course, we have none  of that. All we have are allegations without any facts or evidence.   We have people who have clearly not read the Twitter files talking  about the Twitter files. What we don't even hear about is all the  evidence that Twitter algorithms actually promoted conservative voices  more than they promoted Democratic voices.   If this amendment, as I understand it, restricts law enforcement's  ability to coordinate with social media sites to protect the public,  prosecute crimes, investigate crimes, protect our national security,  and protect our infrastructure, then I oppose this amendment because it  makes a bad bill even worse.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, it is unclear to me at all why  this amendment is here because Federal officials are not allowed to  censor lawful speech in their official capacity, which is also what the  bill says. This is a completely redundant, unnecessary amendment, I  suppose designed to rail against public service unions.   I do find it odd that the gentleman refers to the IRS not being able  to respond to calls from Americans seeking help with their taxes when  one of the very first bills that the majority passed would have  eliminated the increase in IRS employees that was passed as part of the  IRA last summer specifically so that the IRS would have enough  employees to respond quickly to Americans seeking assistance.   Apparently, we have had a rise of conscience here recognizing that  Americans and constituents of all of ours cannot get through to the  IRS, which is why the IRA increased the number of agents working at the  IRS. Apparently, that is not okay if they are collectively bargaining  for fair wages and benefits.   This amendment is completely unnecessary. It is redundant. It makes  what is already a bad bill duplicative and superfluous, and therefore,  I oppose.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, part of the problem with having a redundant amendment on  the floor is that there were so many important amendments that the  Democrats offered that were not even allowed to come to the floor,  notwithstanding the purported open rules that Republicans have been so  proudly championing this Congress.   One of those amendments would have included in the category of  exceptions to this unnecessary bill coordinating between law  enforcement and social media companies about neo-Nazis inciting anti- Semitic violence on social media. That amendment was offered in the  committee and was unanimously rejected by my Republican colleagues, who  apparently believe that neo-Nazis should incite violence against Jews  unchecked and unfettered on social media.                                time  1645    Unfortunately, that amendment was also offered and rejected at the  Rules Committee last night, and so, therefore, we don't have it here to  argue about, and we will not be able to vote about it on the floor.  Instead, we are voting on this redundant, unnecessary, and confusing  amendment that does nothing to meaningfully change this bill but,  instead, is an opportunity to rail against union workers.   For that, Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is yet another redundant  and unnecessary amendment. It is already presumably included in the  exception for child pornography and child exploitation. I suppose if it  is adding obscenity to those exceptions, then perhaps there is  something there to it.   What really strikes me here is that there was a bipartisan amendment  that was offered in the Rules Committee last night that would include  an exception for sexual assault, and that was not passed through to the  House floor.   If the chairman would indulge me for a moment and I could yield to  him, can the gentleman explain why he opposed the bipartisan amendment  that would prohibit sexual assault and yet he allowed through this  amendment on basic obscenity?   Apparently, the chairman doesn't know what I am referring to.   There was a bipartisan amendment offered last night in the Rules  Committee between Congresswoman Houlahan and Congresswoman Mace that  would have added to the specified list of exceptions to law enforcement  coordinating with social media companies in the event of information  related to sexual assault.   That amendment was not passed through to the House, and we are not  considering it today. Yet, here we are considering the gentleman from  Virginia's amendment including as an exception, in the same way, issues  related to obscenity and obscene matters.   Now, if my Republican colleagues believe that basic obscenity on the  internet is worse than sexual assault, then they should say so. But  that seems quite preposterous to me, and it is a shame that we cannot  address the bipartisan Houlahan-Mace amendment on the floor today.   Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Let's get this straight. We have an amendment here because my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to protect children from  obscenity. Yet amendments that the Democrats have offered to protect  our national security, to protect our elections from foreign  interference, to protect against live-streaming of terrorist events and  attacks used by international terrorists around the country to strike  fear in Americans and others worldwide, and to an amendment that could  protect against sexual assault, none of those amendments are here for  us to address today.    Instead, what we are addressing right now is in addition to child  pornography and child exploitation--two very legitimate law enforcement  purposes that, of course, should be permitted to have coordination with  social media companies--no, now we are really worried about protecting  children from seeing nudity online.   Apparently, that is of such paramount importance that we don't care  if Vladimir Putin has a red carpet to interfere in our elections. We  don't care if people are threatening to assault people online and to  threaten sexual assault. And we don't care if people are sending death  threats online. No. We need to protect our children from seeing some  nudity. That is what is so important that we need an amendment on the  floor.   The joke of it all--and the gentleman from Pennsylvania commented on  how great it is that we are considering amendments--is that apparently  it is only great if you are a Republican because only Republican  amendments are allowed to be considered on the floor.   That is a travesty. That is not what we were promised. That is not  what the American people want to hear. So for all of those reasons, I  oppose this unnecessary amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, just briefly, we were at that  Twitter hearing when the former general counsel of Twitter and of the  FBI suggested that there needs to be legislation in order for social  media companies to properly coordinate with law enforcement, and we  wholeheartedly agree.   I am certain that he would never in a million years imagine that this  would be the legislation because this completely guts the FBI's ability  to protect the safety and security of the American people and our  democracy.    Mr. Chair, let's not pretend the witness at  that hearing wants this bill to be the legislation in order for social  media and law enforcement to coordinate. I am happy to work with the  chairman on that, but it is not this bill.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, accountability matters, says my  friend from Tennessee, and his amendment would place further penalties  in the hands of the Office of Special Counsel which, as he mentions, is  the office that also adjudicates the Hatch Act. Well, if you want  accountability, let's start talking about the Hatch Act. Let's talk  about the 13 Trump administration officials who violated the Hatch Act.  Let's talk about Kellyanne Conway, who had more than 60 violations of  the Hatch Act, so many that the Office of Special Counsel--that the  gentleman from Tennessee references--recommended that she be fired.   Did anything happen to her? No. You know what she said? She said:  Come talk to me when there is a jail sentence. Well, that is why last  week in our markup on this bill I introduced the Kellyanne Conway  amendment, which would have added criminal penalties for a knowing,  willful, and intentional violation of the Hatch Act.   Now, as we all know, the Hatch Act is actually a law that prohibits  government officials from abusing their office, as the gentleman from  Tennessee just said. Without teeth in those penalties, the Trump  administration senior officials ran roughshod all over that.   Unfortunately, what Mr. Ogles and the chairman are focused on is not  on adding accountability to prohibit government officials from abusing  their positions for political purposes. Instead, we are talking about  the phantom problem of government officials abusing their authority to  censor free speech, none of which has happened, and yet here we are  with so many examples of violations of the Hatch Act, but we are not  dealing with that.   We are not dealing with actual evidence, actual facts, actual  violations of the law to put accountability, as the gentleman from  Tennessee says, and some teeth into our laws under the jurisdiction of  the Oversight Committee to prevent abuse of power by government  officials. That is where we should be spending our time, not on this  bill and not on this amendment, which already has plenty of punishment  for those who are in violation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle want to appear so tough that 5 years of debarment from  Federal employment is not enough, so we are going to make it 10 because  5 just doesn't do it. The difference between 5 and 10 is going to mean  that someone, some government official who is trying to censor lawful  speech on the internet is going to say, whoa, whoa, 10 years, oh, I am  not going to do it now--but 5 years.   These amendments are trivial; they are unnecessary; they have no  meaning; and yet the meaningful amendments were not allowed to be  brought to the floor.   Apparently the open rules only apply to my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle, they do not apply to us. That is a shame because  there are some very significant amendments that would make this bad,  bad bill slightly better.   For that reason, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H1194]]     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the problem with these civil  penalties is not that it is going to bankrupt any government officials,  but it has a tremendous chilling effect on anyone trying to do their  job, on any Federal law enforcement or intelligence community official  trying to protect our country, trying to enforce our laws, trying to  keep Americans safe, trying to keep our democracy safe because what  these penalties will do is create an amorphous barrier to this  amorphous law where no one has any idea whether what they are doing is  lawful or unlawful because who is to define lawful speech?   Well, traditionally, it is a court, and it is government officials  who have to make that initial call, that initial discretionary decision  whether or not speech is lawful. In what world, if they are risking a  $50,000 fine, are they ever going to take a risk to actually try to do  something that might be on the line?   What these penalties will ultimately do is encourage good,  upstanding, patriotic American Federal officials not to pursue their  jobs, not to do their jobs in the way that we, the American people,  need them to do their jobs, in a way that keeps us safe, in a way that  enforces our criminal laws, in a way that protects us.   That will not happen because they are going to be fearful that they  will lose a third to a quarter of their salary if they violate this  H.R. 140.   Why on Earth would anyone take a chance if they are going to lose a  third of their salary for an entire year on actually executing their  job if they run the risk that someone somewhere is going to say that  they stepped over the line and that in retrospect speech that they  thought might be in furtherance of a crime wasn't actually in  furtherance of a crime, and therefore, they lose their job and they  lose a third of their salary?                                time  1715    It has an incredible trickle-down detrimental effect on any Federal  official trying to do his or her job. Whether or not you realize that,  that is how it is going to be perceived by every hardworking, patriotic  American who has decided to go to work for their government.   You may think, my friends on the other side of the aisle, that the  real problem here are Federal Government officials. You would be sorely  mistaken, because I spent 10 years as a Federal career government  official, working alongside every single law enforcement agent we had,  and they are all trying to do their best.   What this law will do is it will prevent them from doing their best,  and it will jeopardize every American in this country because of it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.
