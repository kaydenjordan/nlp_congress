 Mr. Speaker, it is understandable why the author of this  censure doesn't know what is up and what is down because obviously  someone who wants to talk about crime supports a former President  currently running for President that is facing 91 Federal and  State indictments.    It is clear she doesn't know what is up or down because we sit on the  Education and the Workforce Committee together talking about how she  wants to help our kids, but all she wants to do is criminalize their  ability to exist as individuals.   It makes sense that she doesn't know what is up or down because she  keeps talking about accountability, and she doesn't understand that  criminal charges are accountability. Pleading guilty is taking  accountability. That is what the gentleman has done.   The only reason we are here is because she wants more time on camera.  It is to make sure there is an ability to send a fundraiser asking for  money.   This censure is not necessary because this gentleman has already been  held accountable.
