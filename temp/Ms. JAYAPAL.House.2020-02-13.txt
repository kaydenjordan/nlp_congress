 Madam Speaker, what a glorious day this is.   Today, the House of Representatives will vote to remove the arbitrary  deadline to ratify the equal rights amendment. With our vote today, and  with Virginia's historic vote to become the 38th and final State  necessary to ratify the amendment, little girls, their moms, and women  across this great Nation will know that, yes, our Constitution can,  will, and must enshrine a ban on discrimination on the basis of sex.   Equality of sexes is not debatable. It has no expiration date.   First proposed almost a century ago and passed by Congress in 1972,  the equal rights amendment would be a momentous step forward for women  to  [[Page H1136]]  end unequal pay, pregnancy discrimination, and sexual harassment and  exploitation.   So today, to women across this country who are watching, as the first  South Asian woman ever elected to the House of Representatives, let me  say: We see you. We stand with you. And we will fight for you.
