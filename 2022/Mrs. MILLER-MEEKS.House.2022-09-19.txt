 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the crisis at  our southern border.   The Biden administration's inaction and removal of vital policies  such as title 42 has caused a massive influx of illegal immigrants into  our country.   This past weekend, 1,433 migrants attempted to cross the border and  claim asylum. In this group, there were four gang members, one sex  offender, and one migrant with an active warrant out for their arrest.   We need to approach immigration with commonsense legislation that  prevents bad actors like this from entering our country.   It is disturbing to hear stories from people in the district who have  lost loved ones or close friends from fentanyl overdoses and other  illegal drugs coming across the southern border.   Today, I would like to reiterate my calls for President Biden to  visit the border. Since taking office, I have visited the southern  border three times to listen to the stories of our fearless border  agents about the Biden administration's ineffective policies. President  Biden has proven that he is not interested in or capable of securing or  keeping America safe.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish an amazing person, my husband, Curt  Meeks, a happy birthday. Happy birthday, Curt.   Mr. Speaker, I am also extending my deepest heartfelt sympathies to  my sister-in-law, Diana Cogliano, Mari-Eleanor Miller Martino and her  husband, Ralph Martino, on the sudden passing of their mother,  Josephine Martino, this morning when she passed. May God's grace go  with you as you cross this journey.                            ____________________
