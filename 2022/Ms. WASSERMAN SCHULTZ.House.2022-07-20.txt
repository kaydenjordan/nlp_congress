 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding  and for his leadership and compassion about this extremely important  issue.   Mr. Chair, I must rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment.  While I know she has the best of intentions, I want to be very  practical about my opposition to this. The reality is the amendment  will not alleviate the suffering of the Cuban people, quite the  contrary. In fact, it may exacerbate their pain by simply enriching a  tyrannical regime who uses violence and repression to keep their cruel  grip on power.   On a day in which we just heard from the First Lady of Ukraine, who  is obviously experiencing what the brunt of repression means from a  brutal dictator, we certainly should not be caving to brutal  dictatorship in the Western Hemisphere.   The dictatorship in Cuba controls all trade on the island, and, in  turn, uses resources to oppress its own people.   The current cash-in-advance requirement for the financing of  agricultural exports to Cuba ensures that the regime in Cuba cannot  benefit from loans or credit, and that its corrupt, military-run  financial institutions are not intertwined with American financial  institutions.   Please, anyone within the sound of my voice needs to understand that  this amendment allows U.S. persons to invest in Cuban agricultural  businesses, even if those businesses are involved in trafficking and  confiscated property, as defined in the LIBERTAD Act, which is law,  even if the business is controlled by the Government of Cuba, the Cuban  military, or any other entity. It is inexplicable to me how we could  allow that.   It is also important to point out that unlimited quantities of food,  medicine, and other basic necessities are already permitted into Cuba  both for sale and through humanitarian donations.   And as the Biden administration has done, the best way to lift up the  Cuban people is to support their efforts for democratic reform and  mount pressure for release of hundreds of arbitrarily detained  political prisoners, including 20 children.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and  support liberty all over the world.                                time  1230     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   With great respect for my friend from Massachusetts, I rise in strong  opposition to these amendments.   I spend every day in my work as chair of the Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee protecting and  improving the lives of our Nation's veterans. I vigorously oppose  privatization, so much so that I voted against the VA MISSION Act, in  which the AIR Commission appeared as part of that law, because of my  concern about sending veterans who might end up remaining permanently  in community care.   This en bloc contains two amendments to the MILCON-VA division that  would eliminate funding for the AIR Commission at the Department of  Veterans Affairs. This independent commission was established by the VA  MISSION Act to develop recommendations to modernize and realign VA  health facilities so we can best meet the needs of our Nation's  veterans.   The reality is that the VA has different infrastructure needs today  than it did decades ago. Not only are most VA facilities over 60 years  old, but the veteran population has also shifted geographically over  time.                                time  1245    The draft market assessments VA has developed and will continue to  fine-tune are essential to ensure that VA's facility footprint meets  veterans' needs where they are physically located today, not where most  veterans were over 60 years ago. We can't ignore these changes and also  effectively meet the current needs of our veterans.   We cannot just cancel the Commission and pretend the problem doesn't  exist or need to be addressed. We all care about veterans and, since we  do, we should be focused together on making sure they have state-of- the-art facilities that are designed to modern standards and are best- positioned to serve them.   The point of VA's market assessments is to identify the current, true  needs of our veterans in each market, and the AIR Commission will then  review those assessments and make final recommendations to the  President and to the Congress. They come back to Congress after these  market assessments and recommendations are made.  [[Page H6897]]    The funding in this bill does not implement the recommendations. I  repeat. The funding in this bill does not implement the  recommendations.   We all, on both sides of the aisle, consistently talk about meeting  the needs of our veterans. Making sure veterans have access to high- quality care in high-quality facilities is a priority we all share.  Adjusting the landscape of our facilities to meet veterans where they  live today is key to meeting the needs of our veterans.   If we want to make sure that we don't move further toward privatized  healthcare for our veterans, we need to make sure that there are VA  facilities that are convenient for them, or that they are eligible by  law to go into community care if there are not.   I have the utmost respect for the gentleman and my colleagues who are  sponsors of this amendment, but as Chair of the Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee responsible for the  entire budget for the VA, it is our responsibility to meet the needs of  veterans across the entire country.   We need to be careful about making rash decisions that have a long- term impact. Unfortunately, the amendments in this en bloc will do more  harm than good. And for those reasons, I will vote ``no'' on this en  bloc, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
