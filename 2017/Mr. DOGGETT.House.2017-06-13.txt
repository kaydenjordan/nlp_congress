 Mr. Speaker, this so-called American Health Care bill is  a real Titanic of a sorry piece of legislation: It would sink 23  million Americans losing their health coverage; millions more who have  a preexisting condition would face great barriers; it would undermine  Medicare; it would provide price-gouging, Big Pharma manufacturers with  a huge tax windfall, all as part of almost a trillion dollars in a tax  cut--which is what their bill is really all about, not healthcare-- those benefits going to a few corporations and the superrich among us.   Most every healthcare professional group in the country along with  the AARP and the vast majority of Americans reject this bill. We would  have even more people rejecting if it hadn't been hidden, if even one  administration official had had the courage to come and be held  accountable for this bill in a public hearing. But, apparently, we will  not have that anywhere in this Congress before this huge bill is  approved.   The American people are locked on board this sinking ship. Our  insurance markets are already taking on water from Trump sabotage, and  disaster looms in front of us.   This is not a Verify First bill that we take up today; it is a patch  on this sinking Titanic ship.   It is not a Verify First; it is a ``Vilify First'' our immigrants,  and it is really just the next chapter in Trump's anti-immigrant  crusade, which he tweets about on a regular basis.   Our Republican colleagues celebrate this Immigrant Heritage Month,  June. They celebrate the fourth anniversary of 68 Members of the United  States Senate, in a bipartisan way, approving comprehensive immigration  reform. They do it with this ``Vilify First Act.''   And while I want to protect taxpayers and think we have a  responsibility to ferret out and prevent every dime of fraud that might  be out there, I also feel a responsibility to struggling families that  I represent who already have so many barriers in the way of getting  medical coverage to their children.   Not everyone is as fortunate as Jimmy Kimmel, although he had the  misfortune of a child born with serious medical needs, he at least had  the ability to do something about it. And folks need to be able to  access promptly and immediately, sometimes, a family doctor.   We should fight fraud wherever it occurs. I do wish we had the same  level of enthusiasm about protecting taxpayers from Medicaid fraud by  big pharmaceutical manufacturers, for offshore tax dodging that denies  us billions of dollars, as they voice for taking on the poor. We don't  have that, but we do need to analyze carefully what the Government  Accountability Office that provides the basis for this legislation  really said.   They found a need to address $750 million. Under the program, they  did not find one dollar, one red cent that an immigrant had taken  improperly from this program. They did not document any immigrant  fraud. There may be some out there, but you can't rely on this study to  find it.   We were asked: Well, why do you think this has anything to do with  immigrants? Well, I can tell you why. Because the sponsor of the  amendment, who is here on the floor, when he introduced this piece of  legislation, said he was after what he called illegal immigrants; and  he said that he would not vote for TrumpCare, that sorry Titanic of a  bill, he would not vote for it unless this provision was adopted.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I personally represent San Antonio, San  Marcus, Lockhart, and Austin families that already face barriers to  getting their children medical coverage, and adding an additional  requirement just means they are that much less likely, in the event of  an emergency, to be able to get coverage. We need to prevent fraud.  This is not the way to do it.   What we need is comprehensive immigration reform to deal with these  immigration issues just like the Senate approved 4 years ago--make  improvements on it; debate it; consider it--sink this sorry piece of  legislation, try to raise up the antifraud provisions and the  comprehensive immigration reform that we so desperately need, and to  grow this economy.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges  of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the  President shall immediately disclose his tax return information to the  House of Representatives and the American people.   Whereas, President Nixon explained that ``People have got to know  whether or not their President is a crook'' when he invited the Joint  Committee on Taxation to audit his returns after the Internal Revenue  Service gave him an unwarranted tax discount;   Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since  Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return information to the public;   Whereas, the Chairmen of the Committee on Ways and Means, Joint  Committee on Taxation, and the Committee on Finance have the authority  to request the President's tax returns under section 6103 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986;   Whereas, pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the  Constitution, often referred to as the Origination Clause, the House of  Representatives has the sole authority to initiate legislation that  raises revenue for the national government, and the Committee on Ways  and Means is considering a comprehensive reform of the Tax Code;   Whereas, according to media reports analyzing President Trump's  leaked 2005 tax return, we know that had his own tax plan been in  place, he would have paid an estimated mere 3.48 percent rate instead  of a 24 percent rate, saving him $31.3 million;   Whereas, according to The New York Times, the President used a  legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have allowed him to  avoid paying any Federal taxes for 18 years;   Whereas, President Trump holds ``interests as the sole or principal  owner in approximately 500 separate entities,'' according to his  attorneys, and the President's tax plan proposes to cut the tax rate on  such ``pass-through'' entities from 39.6 percent to 15 percent;   Whereas, one analysis estimated that President Trump would personally  save $6.7 million from two tax breaks included in the Republicans'  first tax cut, which they misleadingly call the American Health Care  Act;   Whereas, without the President's tax returns, the American people  cannot determine how much he will personally benefit from proposed  changes to the Tax Code;   Whereas, an ABCNews/Washington Post poll found that 74 percent of  Americans would like President Trump to disclose his tax returns and  the most-signed petition on the White House website calls for the  release of the President's tax return information to verify compliance  with the Emoluments Clause, with more than 1,097,000 signatures as of  date of this resolution;   Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could help those  investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election better understand  the President's financial ties to the Russian Federation, Russian  businesses, and Russian individuals;   Whereas, after breaking his pledge to make his tax returns available,  President Trump instead presented a one-page letter from a law firm  giving him a clean bill of health on any business dealings with  Russians, but failed to note that the very same law firm boasted of the  ``prestigious honor'' of being named ``Russia Law Firm of the Year''  for 2016;   Whereas, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey,  before he was fired by President Trump, publicly confirmed that the  Bureau has been investigating potential ties between President Trump's  campaign and Russia since July and that the Russian President Vladimir  Putin favored a Trump electoral victory;   Whereas, President Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared  Kushner, met during the Presidential transition at the behest of the  Russian Ambassador with Sergey N. Gorkov, a graduate of a school run by  the successor to the KGB and who was appointed by Vladimir Putin to  head a Russian state-owned bank that is on the U.S. sanctions list;   Whereas, Mr. Kushner proposed establishing a secret back channel of  communications directly to Vladimir Putin, even considering the use of  Russian embassy facilities to do so;   Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions falsely stated during his  Senate confirmation hearing that he ``did not have communications with  the Russians,'' when in fact he met at least twice during the campaign  with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak;   Whereas, former Director Comey testified before the Senate  Intelligence Committee that President Trump had asked him in the Oval  Office about ``letting Flynn go,'' referring to the investigation into  former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's business ties to  Russia;   Whereas, President Trump stated on May 11, 2017, that he had decided  that he was going to fire Comey because of ``this Russia thing'';   Whereas, former Director Comey, on June 8, 2017, testified that  Special Counsel Robert Mueller could investigate whether President  Trump's actions with regard to Director Comey and the Flynn  investigation constituted obstruction of justice;   Whereas, in 2013, President Trump said, ``Well, I've done a lot of  business with the Russians. They're smart and they're tough,'' and  President Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., told a news outlet in 2008  that ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a  lot of our assets'';   Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the nonpartisan  Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his  ownership stake in his businesses;   Whereas, the Director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics  said that the President's plan to transfer his business holdings to a  trust managed by family members is ``meaningless'' and ``does not meet  the standards that . . . every President in the past four decades has  met'';   Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the Constitution for  the express purpose of preventing Federal officials from accepting any  ``present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or  foreign state'';   Whereas, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has hired  a  [[Page H4899]]  ``director of diplomatic sales'' to generate high-priced business among  foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations;   Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of  President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public;   Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means used the authority under  section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in 2014 to make  public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers;   Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has now voted three times  along party lines to continue to cover-up President Trump's tax  returns;   Whereas, the House of Representatives has now refused nine times to  act on President Trump's tax returns;   Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not  their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to  international affairs, tax reform, Government contracts, or otherwise;   Whereas, the House of Representatives undermines its dignity and the  integrity of its proceedings by continuing the cover-up of President  Trump's tax returns: Now, therefore, be it   Resolved, That the House of Representatives shall, one, immediately  request the tax return and return information of Donald J. Trump for  tax years 2006 through 2015, as provided under section 6103 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as the tax return and return  information with respect to the President's businesses of each business  entity disclosed by Donald J. Trump on his Office of Government Ethics  Form 278e, specifically each corporation and each partnership within  the meaning of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1986 where he is listed as an officer, director, or equivalent, or  exercises working control; and   Two, postpone consideration of tax reform legislation until the  elected Representatives of the American people in this House have  obtained President Trump's tax returns and return information to  ascertain how any changes to the Tax Code might financially benefit the  President.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the  floor by a Member other than the majority leader or the minority leader  as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence  only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 legislative days after  the resolution is properly noticed.   Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the  gentleman from Texas will appear in the Record at this point.   The Chair will not at this point determine whether the resolution  constitutes a question of privilege. That determination will be made at  the time designated for consideration of the resolution.                            ____________________
