 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to one  very remarkable young woman. Earlier this year, I had the honor of  meeting Masedi while visiting Botswana as part of a delegation trip.   Sadly, Botswana is still struggling with HIV/AIDS. Every year, there  are 14,000 new infections, and 1 in 5 adults in the country has HIV/ AIDS. Masedi is one of these adults.   Born with HIV/AIDS 23 years ago, she lost both of her parents and  many other family members to this disease. But when my husband, Dexter,  and I visited with her in Botswana, she was full of optimism and  determination.   Masedi's story is remarkable, and what she has had to overcome is  truly inspiring. She has made it her mission to educate the people of  Botswana on HIV/AIDS to dispel any rumors or stigmas related to this  disease and to one day see a Botswana free of this terrible ordeal.   We were so inspired with this visit, and she is truly a shining role  model for the entire country.   That is why our PEPFAR program is so vitally important, Mr. Speaker.  In just over 15 years, PEPFAR has saved and improved millions of lives  while preventing millions more in HIV infections. Thanks to American  leadership, PEPFAR, and remarkable individuals like Masedi, we can  achieve the goal of sustainable control and eradication of the HIV/AIDS  epidemic.    Congratulating Bob Rosasco's Efforts with MINTS International Seminary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and thank  my dear friend Bob Rosasco for his efforts with MINTS International  Seminary and its seminary-in-prison degree program.   Since 2010, this organization has been teaching theology in Florida's  prisons in order to educate, to train, and to equip members of the  prison population, so they can teach others about religion and the word  of God.   This program provides inmates with the necessary tools and training  that prepare them to reenter society and become productive members of  the community after their release. Studies have shown that those who  participate in education programs, including religious programs, while  incarcerated are much less likely to reoffend.   Because of Bob Rosasco and the efforts of so many like him, this  program now has more than 200 students participating, with plans to  keep expanding beyond Florida and across the United States.   We are blessed to have Bob Rosasco as a member of our south Florida  community, and I commend him for continuously giving back to others by  sharing his time, his knowledge, and his passion.                           Recognizing Ryan Dooley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ryan Dooley,  a dedicated Federal employee, a public servant, and my friend who lives  in my congressional district in beautiful south Florida.   I first met Ryan 14 years ago, shortly after he arrived in Miami as  Assistant Director of the State Department's Miami Passport Agency.  Ryan's commitment to service is unparalleled, and because of his  efforts, he was soon promoted to Director of the Miami Passport Agency.   When the San Juan Passport Agency opened its doors to the public in  2014, Ryan was chosen to lead that office as well. For the first time,  our fellow Americans living in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands  gained direct access to much needed-passport services, and that was  truly a historic milestone.   Today, Ryan is responsible for helping countless citizens across a  huge geographic area. Ryan and his staff are consummate professionals  dedicated to serving their communities efficiently and accurately.  Under Ryan's leadership, they have met and overcome numerous passport  workload challenges.   I have had the opportunity to work with Ryan on multiple occasions,  both in Miami and here in D.C., and I can say that he is respected and  admired by his colleagues at local, State, and Federal levels.   I also know numerous State Department employees who got their start  in Miami and were mentored by Ryan and encouraged to excel in their  public service paths.   In his career that has taken him around the world, Ryan has always  promoted the ideals of freedom, of democracy, and of being responsible  to the citizens of our great Nation.   I would like to say, on behalf of my constituents: Ryan Dooley, thank  you so much for all of your tireless work. I commend you for a job well  done. I hope that you continue to serve the people of south Florida,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands faithfully. I wish you and  your partner, Gerald Darby, the best in the years to come. Gracias,  amigo.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce for his  amazing leadership and also Ranking Member Engel. They brought this  important and timely resolution to the floor, and I am so grateful to  have worked not only with Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, but  also with Chairman Cook and Ranking Member Sires of the Western  Hemisphere Subcommittee.   All of us introduced H. Res. 981, and this resolution, as Mr. Sires  and Mr. Royce have pointed out, condemns the persecution; it condemns  the intimidation, the violence, and the murders that are being  committed by the Government of Nicaragua against its citizens under the  orders of Daniel Ortega.   Mr. Speaker, 450, that is how many Nicaraguans have been killed by  Ortega's regime and its thugs just since April of this year. Heaven  knows how many today or how many just these past days. The death toll  is rising every day. And as the regime has now authorized a shoot-to- kill policy in cities like Masaya and Jinotega, shoot to kill against  dissidents, against protesters, and add that to the thousands who have  been injured, arrested, and forced disappearances, we are talking about  a massive and severe repression by a regime that will do anything to  stay in power. That is what this is all about. Ortega and his wife want  to stay in power at all costs.   On Monday, Daniel Ortega had the nerve, the audacity, to go on our  news channel, FOX News, American TV, to say that everything was under  control in Nicaragua and that it was, in fact, the Nicaraguan people  who were committing the acts of violence, that the Nicaraguan people  are the ones responsible for the bloodshed. It is a desperate attempt  by a desperate but dangerous fool.   Mr. Speaker, it is a dire situation, and it is getting worse by the  day. That is why we need to hold Ortega accountable for his evil and  violent acts and put additional pressure on his regime.   The administration has shown great leadership in condemning Ortega  and in sanctioning some of his regime's top officials under the Global  Magnitsky Act.                                time  1330    My resolution urges the administration to do more, to target more of  Ortega's goons for sanctions, and to urge this very body to do more,  because time is of the essence.   The measure before us is simple and straightforward. It rightfully  identifies Ortega, not the Nicaraguan people, as the orchestrator of  the violence. It urges the administration to take more action against  the regime. It also demonstrates our unwavering support for the people  of Nicaragua in their support for democracy and their pursuit of  justice. It includes the call for early, free, fair, and transparent  elections overseen by domestic and international observers.   This resolution also calls upon responsible nations to stand in  solidarity with the people of Nicaragua, because their silence has been  deafening.   Today, this body is standing up for some of the most cherished values  and ideals that we hold true to our hearts, and we are unequivocally  rejecting the Ortega regime's abuses and its corruption. Today, we can  send a strong, unified, and clear message that we are watching; we are  acting; and we are supporting the aspirations of all freedom-loving  Nicaraguans.    Mr. Speaker, in my congressional district, I am so  blessed to have so many Nicaraguan Americans. In fact, one of them is  right here behind me, Gaby Boffelli, who is very proud of her  Nicaraguan heritage, and she keeps me abreast of what is happening in  Nicaragua every day.   My constituents tell me they are heartbroken about the situation.  They are heartbroken because people don't seem to be paying attention.  But they know that the United States Congress is standing with them.  Today, with this vote, we will stand ever so strongly with them.   Ortega is receiving help, as the chairman pointed out, from  Venezuela's Maduro, from Castro in Cuba, and from Diaz-Canel in Cuba.  These thugs know how to repress and kill dissidents.   Let's do the right thing. Let's not stand with the oppressors. Let's  stand with the people of Nicaragua.
