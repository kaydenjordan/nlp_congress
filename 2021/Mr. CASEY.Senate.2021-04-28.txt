 Mr. President, today is Workers Memorial Day, when we  remember all of the workers in our Nation who have been killed, who  have been injured, or who became sick on the job. On this day, we  reflect upon the losses these workers and their families have suffered,  and we also--and I believe we must--recommit ourselves to ensuring that  every worker in America is safe on the job.   On a day like today, I am remembering Pennsylvania workers--not only  the workers of today and the challenges they face in the workplace and  the challenges their families still face, especially in the grip of  and, we hope, ultimately in the aftermath of a terrible pandemic, but  we are also, of course, remembering those who came before them,  generations of workers in a State like Pennsylvania, folks who built  this country, made this country run, and helped us win World War II,  not to mention other battles, economic and otherwise.   So we are remembering those stories. I am also remembering, of  course, on a day like today a lot of stories from my home area. I live  in northeastern Pennsylvania. I live in Scranton, PA, which at one time  was the anthracite coal capital of the world, that region was. Every  family, every community seemed to have a story about one of their loved  ones--sometimes a grandfather or a great grandfather or an uncle or a  grandmother or some relative--and how they struggled in those days.   One story is not, unfortunately, atypical. This is a story about an  11-year-old boy working in the anthracite coal mines.   In those days, in order to pull the coal out of the coal mine, you  had to fill a coal car with coal, but it had to be pulled out of the  mines by a mule. I am talking about the early 1900s.   In this case, this 11-year-old boy--and, of course, it was  permissible in those days to allow someone that young to work in a coal  mine--this young kid reached down to get the straps that connected the  mule to the coal car, and then, when he was bending down to pick up one  of those leather straps, the rear hooves of the mule kicked him square  in the face.   Here is the description of what happened after that mule kicked the  11-year-old, and I am reading from an account:         [The] kick hurled him over a loaded five-foot-high coal car       and into the wall of the mine--the ``face'' of the mine, as       the miners would say.    The 11-year-old had his nose smashed.         He had an open wound from his forehead across his eyebrow,       down his nose, through his lip, and into his chin.        No ambulance was called. No paramedics came to save him.       Work didn't even stop.    Then the account goes on to talk about how the mine boss had another  young kid walk this 11-year-old out of the mine, taking the child  home--a long, perilous journey home.         Once he finally made it home, [the 11 year old's] mother       called a doctor and they laid him on the dining room table,       where the doctor sewed the long gouge in his face back       together. There were no benefits--no worker's compensation,       no safety net in place to take care of the adult worker, much       less an injured child.    That is, unfortunately, an account that was all too common in those  days. Much has changed, fortunately, but, candidly, not enough.   We mark today the 50th anniversary of the Occupational Safety and  Health Act going into effect. It just happens to be today. This is a  landmark achievement in the fight to guarantee every worker a safe  workplace. It was passed because of the tireless efforts of workers and  unions that stood up for their fellow working men and women and  demanded government action that led to the so-called OSHA Act. There  remains, of course, much work to be done to protect our workers.   Let's turn to the pandemic and our workers.   The COVID-19 pandemic has made clearer than ever the need for action  to  [[Page S2263]]  strengthen workplace protections, ensure workers can stand up and  advocate for safe workplaces.   The virus has touched every workplace in the country, presenting a  new threat to workers' health on the job unlike any we have seen in our  lifetimes.   Throughout the pandemic, millions of workers have been at risk--at  risk of contracting the virus as they did their work, having to worry  every day when they headed home about their health and, of course, the  health of their families.   The death toll from this virus, this pandemic, is staggering. More  than 570,000 Americans are dead; more than 26,000 in Pennsylvania.  These, of course, were mothers and fathers and grandmothers and  grandfathers, sisters and brothers, neighbors and friends   The disproportionate effect on people of color is also staggering-- those who are widely represented in the essential workforces that have  continued to go to work every day throughout the pandemic. This  disproportionate impact on people of color has been especially  disturbing and devastating.   The toll never should have been this high, and workers never should  have had to face the risk they faced every day during the pandemic.   To honor all of these workers and their families, we must continue to  take action to protect them on the job and ensure that workers are  never left as vulnerable as they were in the pandemic.   Now, we have made some steps--taken some steps recently. The American  Rescue Plan, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Biden,  has already been critical to helping protect workers from COVID-19. The  rescue plan provided billions to help get Americans the vaccines they  need and to ensure that frontline workers receive the supplies and  personal protective equipment they need to stay safe on the job. It  also included $100 million for OSHA to protect workers on the job. So  we can celebrate that on this celebration of Workers Memorial Day. This  $100 million in funding is essential to help defeat the pandemic but  also, in the process, to keep workers safe.   We must ensure that policies are in place to strengthen our workplace  safety laws and also to strengthen enforcement.   We must ensure that the highest standards--the highest standards-- which are informed by recent science, exist to protect workers from all  threats to their health, whether it is exposure to COVID-19 in a  grocery store or silica dust in a coal mine.   We must strengthen workers' ability, of course, to organize and  bargain collectively by passing the PRO Act, the Protecting the Right  to Organize Act. The PRO Act would ensure workers have a voice on the  job and are able to advocate for safe working conditions.   We must ensure that OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, and its sister Agency, MSHA, the Mine Safety and Health  Administration, have the authority, the resources, and the personnel  they need to protect workers every day of every year.   Our Nation's workforce has done heroic work throughout this pandemic.  One part of that workforce that has done both essential and heroic work  over the past year is our Nation's home- and community-based services  workforce, often not talked about in the debates here in Congress.   These workers are the backbone of our caregiving infrastructure, and  we know that as part of the rescue plan, President Biden--I am sorry-- as part of the American Jobs Plan the President has proposed and we  have not yet passed, but we are working on it, President Biden has  called for a $400 billion investment to be directed to invest in  seniors and people with disabilities and to support this vital and  undervalued workforce.   This great American idea to develop the best caregiving workforce in  the world--not one of the best, not second or third, the best workforce  in the world--to care for and to provide support and services to people  with disabilities and seniors--this great American idea is an idea that  is focused on that workforce, which is a workforce primarily of women  of color making only $12 an hour.   We can't say that we have the best caregiving workforce in the world  if we are not going to invest in that workforce and lift them up. The  American people want this to happen. This is overwhelmingly popular.  More than 70 percent of the American people want us to make this  investment in home- and community-based services, thereby lifting up  that workforce so that we can provide better care for people with  disabilities and seniors so they can not only survive but also thrive.   Making this investment is a vital part of raising standards and  working conditions for this essential workforce and for all workers.   Let me conclude with this, the story of the 11-year-old boy kicked in  the face in the anthracite coal mines of northeastern Pennsylvania.  That 11-year-old was my grandfather. His name was Alphonsus Liguori  Casey, and he, like a lot of young kids, started in the coal mines at  that age, at the age of 11, between--worked in the mines between 1905  and 1910. Of course, when he worked in the mines, there were no  protections--virtually none, even for a child. Thank goodness we have  made a lot of progress since then, but we still have a long way to go  to make sure that all workers in all workforces are protected in their  workplace.   We also have to make sure we are making the appropriate investments  in them to call ourselves the greatest country in the world. We can't  say we are the greatest country in the world if we are paying people  $11 or $12 an hour to do the important work they have to do every day  and want to do. It is a high calling to care for people with  disabilities and seniors.   So just like that 11-year-old boy and so many like him in those days,  we have to make sure that today's workforce is the subject of our  protection, is the subject of our attention, and is the subject of our  investment. Let's lift them up so that we have the best workforce in  the world and the safest workplaces, not only on Workers Memorial Day  but every day.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
