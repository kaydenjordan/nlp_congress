 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of The Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   There is no question that the rule of law should require medical  practitioners to treat babies born alive after a failed abortion with  the same care they would treat any baby born at that same gestational  age.   Everyone in this body should agree that it is inhumane to willingly  kill a baby who has been born alive. It's time to end this repugnant  practice.   Unfortunately, the left spread the lie that pro-life Republicans only  care about life when it's in the womb and not once it's born--However,  the bill before us is about protecting the born and alive and nearly  all of its support comes from Republicans.   No human being should be treated with such violence.   Let's pass this bill and end this horrendous and unthinkable act.
