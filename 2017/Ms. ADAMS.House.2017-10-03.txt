 Mr. Speaker, today I rise for Dr. Danielle. Here's her  story.   Dr. Danielle recently had three patients drive from North Carolina to  Washington, D.C., to access abortion care. One patient from Winston was  diagnosed with Edwards' syndrome just before 20 weeks. Edwards'  syndrome has no treatment, and it is usually fatal before birth or  within the first year of life.   Given the 72-hour waiting period in North Carolina, the patient would  have passed State limits for when she could access abortion. She had to  drive more than 6 hours to the Washington, D.C., area for her care.   North Carolina already has an awful 20-week ban. We don't need this  ban nationwide.   On behalf of Dr. Danielle and the women she helped, I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 36. Stop the bans.
