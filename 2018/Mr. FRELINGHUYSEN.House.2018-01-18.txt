 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the further consideration of  H.R. 195.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 696, I  call up the bill (H.R. 195) to amend title 44, United States Code, to  restrict the distribution of free printed copies of the Federal  Register to Members of Congress and other officers and employees of the  United States, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment  thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   I rise this afternoon to present the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 195, the Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act  of 2018. This critical legislation extends government funding through  February 16. Our current funding expires tomorrow night, and if  Congress does not pass this bill and the President does not sign it  into law before then, the government will shut down.   It is our congressional duty to prevent that from happening and to  ensure that the American people have access to government programs and  services they depend on. The additional time, just under a month, will  allow congressional leadership and the White House to come to a final  budget agreement.   This legislation includes a very limited number of technical changes  to ensure good governance. The bill also includes language to continue  the Children's Health Insurance Program through fiscal year 2023 to  help sick children from low-income families get better and to ensure  they have healthy and happy futures. Additionally, this proposal  extends several healthcare-related tax provisions.   Mr. Speaker, a continuing resolution is not the preferred way to  conduct the Nation's fiscal business, but at this point it is  absolutely necessary to avoid a costly, destabilizing government  shutdown. It is my hope that this will be the last continuing  resolution, that leadership of the House and Senate and the White House  will quickly come to an agreement on top-line spending levels and that  we can complete our appropriations work for fiscal year 2018 in short  order.                                time  1645    It is critical that we enact all 12 full-year funding bills to ensure  that our Armed Forces have the resources they need to accomplish their  missions both at home and abroad and that our government supports and  maintains programs that are important to the lives and livelihoods of  all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this critical legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman of the Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Walden), chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Barton), the vice chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee's Subcommittee on Energy.    Mr. Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to my  colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  [[Page H532]]  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), chairwoman of the Ethics  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan  an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from the great State of Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), who is the  chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we are about to face a very critical deadline in many  States, including my home State of Washington. CHIP funding will run  out.    More than 60,000 kids in my State count on CHIP and need certainty.  This funding bill reauthorizes CHIP for 6 years, the longest extension  in the program's history. Now Democrats are threatening to hold this up  again for a DACA deal.   Now, to be clear, I want a DACA deal, too, and I am disappointed that  we don't have one yet, but that is no reason to punish children across  the country. Today we are voting to prioritize our Nation's children,  and it is time for the Democrats to join us.   I also want to take this opportunity to stress the importance of  reauthorizing the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education  Program, which expired in September. These centers face a looming  deadline of January 31 to decide whether or not to recruit their July  2018 classes.   Without a long-term solution, the centers across our country cannot  make the important decisions that will affect the lives of hundreds of  residents.   Unfortunately, one teaching health center in Memphis has already made  that decision. They closed their doors earlier this year, leaving 25  residents without a place to continue their medical training and  reducing patient access to care. Although reauthorization of the  Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program was not  included in this bill, we must get this done as soon as possible.   I look forward to working with the chairman and the committee moving  forward, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this 6-year reauthorization of CHIP.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
