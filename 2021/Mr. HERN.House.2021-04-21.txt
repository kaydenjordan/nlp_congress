 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to give voice to the concern  of millions of Americans, the crisis at our southern border.   I saw it for myself. Not only are our facilities packed to 10 times  beyond capacity, but the influx is growing.   Biden revoked Trump's effective border policies and put nothing in  place to make up for it, creating the current crisis that is spiraling  out of control.   We need to send immediate aid to our Border Patrol. They need it.   But here is what Congress is doing instead:   We are voting to provide legal welfare services to people illegally  in our country while millions of Americans are denied help.   We are voting on D.C. statehood, a violation of the constitutional  function of our Capital City.   The Speaker pushed 16 bills together in an en bloc last night,  preventing Members of Congress from voting on separate pieces of  legislation.   The American people are watching what we do here. They see unserious  people doing unserious work. It is why our approval rating is so poor.  It is time to stop letting them down and do something real.                            ____________________
