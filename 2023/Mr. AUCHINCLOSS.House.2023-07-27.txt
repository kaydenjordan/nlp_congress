 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  extended processing times for passports, global entry applications, and  tax returns.   On average, Americans are waiting 2 to 4 months for passport renewals  and 4 to 6 months for global entry appointments. Many are waiting even  longer.  [[Page H4040]]    There are also 2.6 million Americans still waiting on their 2023 tax  refunds while facing hours-long wait times when calling the IRS.   Since the start of this year alone, my office has assisted with more  than 500 passport requests, nearly triple the number we assisted with  all of last year. These numbers are unacceptable. This backlog  exacerbates American citizens' frustration with Federal institutions  and undermines their trust in our government's ability to serve them  effectively.   This is not the fault of our Federal workers. They are working  tirelessly, including nights and weekends, to improve these delays, but  they don't have the resources and bandwidth that they need.   Now, House Republicans have proposed funding cuts to the IRS and the  State Department that would only worsen these delays and the backlog,  inhibiting Americans from accessing these essential services. Congress  must reject these cuts and, instead, support these agencies with  increased staffing and reliable funding.                            ____________________
