 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the irresponsible  brinksmanship being played by House Republicans with the debt ceiling.   Let me point out that inflation happens when too much money chases  too few goods. In order to stem inflation, America needs to be  producing more goods right here at home, not importing more and more of  everything and subjecting our markets to supply chain choke holds from  offshore producers and shippers that drive the prices up.   What America makes and grows makes and grows America. Supporting  products made in America makes and grows a real middle class. Why  champion more windfalls for Wall Street and powerful financial titans  that finance outsourcing our jobs going to penny wage havens? We should  reshore what Americans use, eat, and drive and reduce inflation.   Speaker McCarthy ought to stand up for America, stand with the  American people on Main Street, not with the outsourcers and scions of  finance on Wall Street who outsource our jobs.                            ____________________
