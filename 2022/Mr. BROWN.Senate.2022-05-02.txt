 Mr. President, for generations, manufacturing was the  lifeblood of communities across Ohio and throughout the country. It was  heavily unionized. The jobs paid well. It is not a coincidence that  those two things go together. We know carrying a union card means  better wages, better hope in retirement benefits, and more control over  the workers' schedule.   These jobs allowed generations of Americans to build a middle-class  life. But beginning in the seventies and eighties, we stopped making  things in this country. Look at places like my hometown of Mansfield,  OH. I went to Johnny Appleseed Junior High School, Mansfield Senior  High School. I walked the halls with sons and daughters of autoworkers  from GM and machinists of Ohio Brass and electrical workers from  Westinghouse and rubber workers from Mansfield Tire and hundreds and  hundreds of the sons and daughters of people in the building trades-- laborers and pipe fitters and carpenters and millwrights and painters  and one trade after another. Companies like Westinghouse and Tappan  Stove all closed down one after another. Go to any town in Ohio and  throughout the industrial Midwest and people can name a similar list.   We know what happened: Corporations in Ohio shut down production in  Mansfield, my hometown, or Lorain, where I was today, or Youngstown or  Cincinnati or Toledo, in search of cheaper labor, in search of right- to-work States, and in search of weaker workers' compensation or  unemployment benefit laws. They moved to Alabama. They moved to  Tennessee. They moved to Arkansas.   And then, that wasn't quite good enough. Then those same corporations  lobbied Congress for trade agreements and tax treatments. So they then  moved on to Mexico, and that labor wasn't quite cheap enough, and they  moved on to China.   Ohio has paid the price for years in the form of lost jobs and lost  opportunities. Now--and I know what the Presiding Officer has seen in  the State of Maine. You understand this. The whole country pays the  price--higher prices, supply chain delays, losing entire high-tech  industries to competitors like China.   Look where we've ended up. In Ohio, Thomas Edison invented the light  bulb. Today, 99 percent of LED bulbs are made in China.   America invented the semiconductor. Forty years ago, the U.S.  produced half of the world's semiconductors. Today it is 10 percent-- about 75 percent made in East Asia. Look what happened. During the  pandemic, companies across Ohio and the rest of the country shut down  production lines not because there wasn't demand, they shut down  production lines and laid off workers because they couldn't get enough  semiconductors.   Whether you are Ford in Lima, Whirlpool in Clyde, Kenworth in  Chillicothe, OH, or Navistar in Springfield, you need these chips.   It is why the Senate must fund the bipartisan CHIPS Act. We agreed to  authorize this program. Now it is time to move and to fund it.   At the end of January, Senator Portman and I flew to Columbus to join  Intel to announce the largest ever domestic investment in semiconductor  manufacturing. It will create 10,000 good-paying jobs. Union  tradespeople--5,000 union tradespeople--for 10 years will build this  facility. Think of the magnitude of that. As we were flying in on the  plane, I remember sitting with the Secretary of Commerce and Senator  Portman and my friend Don Graves, from Cleveland--the No. 2 guy at  Commerce.   I looked out, and I said:         Today, in Ohio, we are finally burying the term ``Rust       Belt.''    It is possible because we are on the verge of passing this historic  investment. The EU, China, Taiwan, and South Korea are all for  providing incentives to make these chips domestically. None of them-- none of them--require stock warrants as this motion would have us do.  That is why I oppose this motion. Other countries are mimicking what we  are doing. The EU, if Congress doesn't move quickly on the CHIPS Act,  is already trying to attract that business there.   In the history of the United States, the only time we have ever  required equity warrants from private companies is during times of war  or in moments of financial and global crisis. It is not a bailout; it  is an incentive. This motion to instruct conferees is well-intentioned,  but it won't work. It will make the U.S. program less competitive. It  is likely to cause these companies to make these chips overseas where  they can get the same incentives without those strings.   I understand Senator Sanders' goal. It is a goal I share. I just  spoke with the Presiding Officer, and neither of us has a particularly  favorable attitude toward what we have seen with stock buybacks and the  damage that they have done to our economy and what it has meant in the  undermining of companies' investments in their workers and in new  product lines. I have had--I don't know--6, 8, 10, 12 calls with the  Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, asking him--pleading with  him--about restricting some of the stock buybacks at some of the  largest American banks, especially during the pandemic.   As I said, I understand Senator Sanders' goal. We have got to make  sure that the jobs that are created are good-paying ones where workers  can build careers. That is why, in the CHIPS Act, we require the chips  funding go to the construction or to the modernization of U.S.  facilities to support American jobs, require chip applicants to make  commitments to workers and community investments, and require chips  projects be sustainable without additional Federal funding. These are  initial Federal investments that generate long-term, well-paying jobs.   In both the Senate and House competition bills, we also require chips  recipients to pay the prevailing wage to employees or contractors. That  is why the United Auto Workers supports this position. They support  chip funding. It is why the building trades support chips funding and  oppose this Sanders' motion.   I can tell you, from experience, if we drive these semiconductor jobs  away, the alternative is not a replacement with other similarly high- quality jobs. Ohio has had that promise too often. Drive around Ohio,  and you will see the alternative to low-wage, anti-union, big-box  stores where workers have little control over their schedules and  little power to build a better life.   It is also important to remember that this investment isn't just for  semiconductors. It will affect smaller supply companies and their  supply chains. It will affect all of the downstream industries that  rely on these chips for all kinds of productions: appliances, auto,  energy deployment. Our clean energy, independent future is going to  rely on American-made semiconductor chips.   Mr. President, I want to talk on one other motion that will be made  in the next 48 hours, on this floor, to the CHIPS Act.   We need to make more in this country. We shouldn't be taking other  actions that discourage domestic production.   I urge my colleagues to oppose a motion to instruct that supports a  broad exclusion process for 301 tariffs for goods from China. Those  tariffs are in place because of China's unfair trade practices  targeting our industrial base and Ohio jobs. The AFL-CIO opposes it.  The U.S. Trade Rep's office opposes it, and she was confirmed here in a  unanimous vote. The Alliance for American Manufacturing opposes it.  They know that any removal of these tariffs needs to be part of a  broader, strategic approach to trade policy with China.   We can't let China undermine the investments that American  manufacturers make in workers and communities here in the United  States. If we do this bill right, it will mean we will finally make  more in America. We will begin bringing back the supply chains to our  country. It will help us bury the term ``Rust Belt'' once and for all.   When you love this country, you fight for the people who make it  work. That is what the CHIPS Act is about. It is about workers. It is  about good-paying jobs. It is about increasing the unionization of  workers in this country. It will lift all boats.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S2241]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I also rise today to remember and honor the  distinguished service of James Jackson.   For decades, James devoted his time and talent to helping Congress  understand complex international trade and economic policy issues. I am  thankful to have been a beneficiary of James hard work. During the  115th Congress' when Senator Crapo and I served as chair and ranking  member of the Senate committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,  the Committee undertook a substantial effort to consider, and  ultimately enact, legislation that reformed the process for screening  foreign investment in the United States. As Senator Crapo noted, we  relied on James' thoughtful analysis and expertise throughout the  consideration of that important legislation. James briefed staff.  evaluated proposed legislative language. and provided comprehensive.  detailed analysis and reports during consideration of the bill. After  it became law, the committee continued to rely on James to evaluate the  executive branch's implementation of it.   I join Senator Crapo in offering my sincere condolences to James'  friends and family and his colleagues at CRS. They are in our thoughts  during this difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Tuesday, May 3; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Frost nomination, postcloture; further, that all  postcloture time on the Frost nomination be considered expired at 11:45  a.m.; that the Senate recess following the cloture vote on the Bhargava  nomination, until 2:15 p.m., to allow for the weekly caucus meetings;  further, that if cloture is invoked on the Bhargava nomination, all  time be considered expired at 2:30 p.m.; finally, that if any  nominations are confirmed during Tuesday's session, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:51 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, May 3, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
