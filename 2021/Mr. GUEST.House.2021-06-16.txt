 Mr. Speaker, earlier this year I had the opportunity to  join with my other Republican colleagues to visit the southwest border.  This was not a gesture, as the Vice President has referred to these  visits. It was, instead, a learning opportunity.   The conditions we saw and the stories we heard conveyed a situation  far worse than we had previously imagined. We learned that border  encounters are at a 20-year high. We spoke directly to Border Patrol  and law enforcement officers who told us that they are so overwhelmed  with the care of migrants that they are unable to execute essential  core roles of their job. We learned how drug cartels are taking  advantage of the overwhelmed system and saw the routes they use to  smuggle drugs and people across the border.   What we witnessed could only be defined as a crisis. This is why I  encourage all of my colleagues and the Vice President to set aside  political gamesmanship, visit the border, and see the crisis firsthand.                            ____________________
