 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to call upon this body to  fulfill its duty to protect the American people.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to claim that  strengthening border security is about separating families or  preventing them from immigrating to the U.S. In reality, it is about  protecting the American people by stopping the flow of dangerous  individuals across the southern border.   Department of Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen has confirmed that  ISIS has produced written materials that encourage ISIS followers to  cross our Southwest border, given the loopholes that they are also  aware of, and that, on average, her department now blocks 10 known or  suspected terrorists a day from traveling to or attempting to enter the  United States.   The four individuals shown here, one of whom had been previously  identified and flagged for insurgency/terrorism, were stopped in Panama  while trying to make their way to the U.S. Thanks to a fortunate tip  and coordination between U.S. and Panamanian law enforcement, these  individuals were stopped.   This should be alarming to every American, especially concerning the  dangerous individuals we may have missed and will continue to miss due  to our lack of robust border security.   I am proud of the job our Border Patrol and law enforcement officers  are doing to protect their country, and I urge my colleagues to do our  duty to protect the American people from dangerous individuals by  taking border security seriously and fully funding the President's  proposal for border security.
