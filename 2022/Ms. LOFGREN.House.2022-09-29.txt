 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4791) to amend section 301 of title 44, United States Code, to  establish a term for the appointment of the Director of the Government  Publishing Office.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4791         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. TERM FOR APPOINTMENT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE                     GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE.         (a) In General.--Section 301 of title 44, United States       Code, is amended--  [[Page H8229]]         (1) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``The President''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) The Director shall be appointed for a term of 10       years.        ``(c) An individual appointed to the position of Director,       by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, may be       reappointed to that position in accordance with subsections       (a) and (b).''.        (b) Application to Incumbent.--If there is an individual       serving in the position of Director of the Government       Publishing Office, by and with the advice and consent of the       Senate, on the date of enactment of this Act--        (1) the amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply with       respect to the appointment of such individual; and        (2) the term of the individual for purposes of subsection       (b) of section 301 of title 44, United States Code, as added       by subsection (a), shall be considered to have started on the       date on which the individual assumed the office of Director       of the Government Publishing Office.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of S. 4791. This bill, which was introduced  by Senator Roy Blunt, passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It would  establish a term of 10 years for the Director of the Government  Publishing Office.   Unlike the heads of other legislative branch agencies like the  Architect of the Capitol, the Comptroller General, and the Librarian of  Congress, the Senate-confirmed Director of the Government Publishing  Office has no defined term.   Now, the Government Publishing Office, or GPO, as we often refer to  it, is one of the true treasures of the legislative branch. Since it  was founded in 1861, it has grown from a modest operation to one of the  world's largest and most renowned information organizations.   Every day, GPO provides the government and public both conventionally  printed products like the Congressional Record and passports, and  digital services like eBooks, digital publishing, mobile access, and  more. It also plays a key role in continuity of government in case of  an emergency.   Over the course of the past several years, we have seen firsthand the  importance of effective leadership at GPO. The COVID-19 pandemic caused  the largest disruption to agency operations since the Civil War. But  thanks in no small part to the leadership of Director Hugh Halpern, GPO  provided top-notch, uninterrupted service to Congress to ensure that we  were able to provide relief to American families, communities, and  small businesses; and the agency did so thoughtfully and responsibly,  with the discipline needed to stay as safe as possible.   In fact, one prominent business award organization named GPO the  ``Most Valuable Employer During the COVID-19 Pandemic.''   This bill would bring the GPO in line with the rest of the  legislative branch and establish the same 10-year term for its director  that currently exists for the Architect of the Capitol and the  Librarian of Congress. As with those agencies, the Director of the  Government Publishing Office would be eligible for reappointment and,  given his track record, certainly would have earned it.   Formalizing the term of the director will ensure that the agency has  effective leadership and allow for increased transparency and  accountability. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support  this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Halpern did, indeed, work in the House of Representatives. He was  on the Republican staff, and I think it is meaningful that the chair  and ranking member of the House Administration Committee, Democrat and  Republican, feel the same way; that he has done a terrific job as  director of this office.   The term limits is not about him. It is my understanding he actually  supports Senator Blunt's bill; but it is simply to have a time where  you evaluate and then you can reappoint, just as with the Librarian of  Congress and the Architect of the Capitol.   Since I don't have additional speakers, I am going to take advantage  of a little bit of time to discuss an item that will be up for  consideration on the floor later today; and that has to do with a  proposed change to venue rules for Federal antitrust cases. It is very  arcane, which is why I think it is important to discuss the minutiae of  this.   In 1968, Congress acted to allow a senior judge panel to consolidate  cases where it would be efficient for the Court. Here is the example.  State AGs have the capacity, right now, and would in the future, to  file antitrust cases. But if you had, as they did in 1968, a  multiplicity of AGs filing a case in different States, you would end up  with different witnesses having to go through the same thing over and  over again, inconsistent rulings; and so that is why the Congress  consolidated this.   In that case, it was large, multi-district litigation having to do  with electrical equipment, and it has worked pretty well. Why we would  change it is something that has been a mystery to  [[Page H8230]]  me. The arguments in favor, I think, do not hold water.   The Administrative Office of the Courts has pointed out that the U.S.  cases are not subject to transfer under this section; and why is that?  The Department of Justice coordinates itself, unlike the separate  attorneys general.   I do think that the possibility of adverse outcomes is quite  possible. Certainly, Mr. Neguse's bill to raise fees is something I  support. I am a cosponsor of that bill. But if we reject the venue  provisions, we will just go back and bring Mr. Neguse's bill up later;  so that is what I would recommend.   I just want to say something further. This venue rule is not just  oriented toward one sector of the economy. Mr. Buck, the author,  mentioned technology yesterday, ``Big Tech'' was his words.   But this isn't about technology. It is any business that is a  defendant in an antitrust case. As I mentioned, the initiation was an  electrical equipment company.   But I think we should listen to what people say. Mr. Buck, in his  remarks, said yesterday, Big Tech is crushing conservative speech, and  that appears to be his motivation.   Well, he quotes his friend, Senator Cruz, and he says, the greatest  threat to democracy in this country is Big Tech; that Senator Cruz  agrees with that. Well, really? I mean, Senator Cruz, who voted not to  amend the Electoral Count Act that was promoted by Roy Blunt, the  author of this; who tried to overturn the election of 2020; who says  that moderating inflammatory or dangerous content is a violation of  free speech or may be a violation of antitrust.   I think that is the danger here; and I listened to Mr. Buck because  he said this is about conservative speech. So I think one potential  outcome of this is litigation that will be brought in favorable forums  to try and prevent content moderation.   If you are Infowars, and you are inciting violence, I am hoping  whatever platform you are on takes you down. That is not conservative  speech or liberal speech, that is dangerous speech, and I do hope that  we will see this for what it is.   Not every AG is a model of probity. The Attorney General in Texas  right now is hiding from process servers and has, as we know, some  other legal problems.   To suggest that every Attorney General is going to be guided by  principles of law, as we would hope the Department of Justice and many  of the AGs are, would be a serious mistake.   I am glad to have had a moment to get into this very arcane issue  because there may not be time later today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge adoption of Senator Blunt's  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1396, I call  up the bill (S. 3969) to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to  explicitly authorize distribution of grant funds to the voting  accessibility protection and advocacy system of the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands and the system serving the American Indian  consortium, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 3969 in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of S. 3969, the PAVA Program Inclusion Act.   The bill before us today is a bipartisan, bicameral piece of  legislation that makes an important technical correction in the Help  America Vote Act's Protection and Advocacy for Voting Access, or PAVA,  program to explicitly include the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana  Islands and the  [[Page H8231]]  system serving the American Indian consortium as eligible recipients of  PAVA funding.   When Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002, it made  significant changes to the country's voting process, addressing needed  improvements to voting systems and voter access identified in the wake  of the 2000 election. Since its enactment, Congress has provided  billions of dollars under HAVA to help States improve voters' access to  the ballot, including hundreds of millions of dollars in election  security funds over fiscal years 2018, 2020, and 2022 and $400 million  under the CARES Act to help voters access the ballot during the COVID- 19 pandemic.   Amongst the numerous changes made, HAVA recognized the unique  obstacles persons with disabilities face at the polls, authorizing  funding for the Protection and Advocacy for Voting Access program,  otherwise known as PAVA. The PAVA program funds activities aimed at  increasing access to the polls and the ballot for voters with  disabilities, ensuring they have access to all aspects of the voting  process, and awarding funding to eligible protection and advocacy  systems across the country.   Since HAVA's enactment, the millions of dollars in funding allocated  under the PAVA program allows protection and advocacy systems across  the country to conduct activities such as disability training for poll  workers, maintaining voting hotlines, examining polling places for  accessibility, and even more.   There are 57 protection and advocacy systems across the 50 States,  the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam,  American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,  as well as the American Indian consortium. The P&A affiliated with the  American Indian consortium serves Native Americans with disabilities in  the Four Corners region of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah.   P&As are federally mandated and protect the rights of persons with  disabilities through legally based advocacy. Unfortunately, HAVA's  definition excluded the protection and advocacy systems serving the  Northern Mariana Islands and the American Indian consortium serving the  Four Corners region. I don't think we intended that, and this bill  fixes that.   Reintroduced this Congress by our colleague, Representative Ruben  Gallego of Arizona, and our former House colleague, Senator Ben Ray  Lujan of New Mexico, S. 3969 puts the P&As serving the Northern Mariana  Islands and the American Indian consortium on equal footing with all 55  other P&As. It does so without changing the program's overall  authorization level or other elements of the program.   Fixing this oversight will help ensure all voters with disabilities,  regardless of where they live, can fully participate in the electoral  process.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by all 57  protection and advocacy systems expressing support for the bill, as  well as a letter of support from the National Disability Rights Network  and a letter from the designated protection and advocacy systems in  California and Illinois, all supporting this bill's package.                                                   January 28, 2020.      Representative Zoe Lofgren,      Chairwoman, House Administration Committee, Washington, DC.      Representative Rodney Davis,      Ranking Member, House Administration Committee, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairwoman Lofgren and Ranking Member Davis: The       undersigned 57 Protection and Advocacy (P&A) Systems write       today to express our support to amend the Help America Vote       Act (HAVA) to explicitly authorize the distribution of       Protection and Advocacy for Voting Access (PAVA) program       funds to the Northern Mariana Islands and the American Indian       Consortium P&As.        P&A systems are federally mandated, and pursue legal,       administrative, and other appropriate remedies under all       applicable federal and state laws to protect and advocate for       the rights of people with disabilities. There are a total of       57 P&As operating in every state, the District of Columbia,       Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Territories (American Samoa, Guam,       Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). There       is also a P&A affiliated with the American Indian Consortium       serving Native Americans with disabilities in the Four       Corners region of the Southwest.        In 2002, Congress passed HAVA acknowledging the unique       obstacles people with disabilities face at the polls, and       authorized funding for the PAVA program. The PAVA program       allows P&As to advocate on behalf of voters with disabilities       to ensure that they have access to all aspects of the       American voting process. PAVA program funds allow P&As to       conduct disability training to poll workers, distribute       resources on how to conduct an accessible campaign, maintain       voting hotlines, examine polling places for accessibility,       and much more throughout the year.        PAVA program funding is currently awarded to ``eligible''       P&As across the country. Unfortunately, because HAVA includes       specific language about ``states'' only 55 out of the 57 P&As       are currently eligible for PAVA program funding. The Northern       Mariana Islands and the American Indian Consortium P&As do       not receive PAVA funding since they are not considered states       and therefore have been ineligible for PAVA funding since       HAVA passed.        It was always the intent for all 57 P&As to participate in       the PAVA program. Thus, we support Congress passing       legislation that would provide a long overdue technical fix       explicitly authorizing the distribution of grant funds to the       Northern Mariana Islands and American Indian Consortium P&As.        Thank you for your work on this important topic and       consideration of a technical fix.            Sincerely,        AK, Disability Law Center of Alaska.

Hon. Zoe Lofgren,      Chair, Committee on House Administration, Washington, DC.      Hon. Rodney Davis,      Ranking Member, Committee on House Administration,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Lofgren and Ranking Member Davis: On behalf of       the nationwide network of Protection and Advocacy (P&A)       agencies we represent, The National Disability Rights Network       (NDRN) writes today to strongly urge that the full House       swiftly pass S. 3969, the Protection and Advocacy for Voting       Access (PAVA) Inclusion Act which passed the Senate       unanimously on March 30.        P&A systems are federally mandated, and pursue legal,       administrative, and other appropriate remedies under all       applicable federal and state laws to protect and advocate  [[Page H8232]]       for the rights of people with disabilities. There are 57 P&As       operating in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto       Rico, and the U.S. Territories (American Samoa, Guam,       Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). There       is also a P&A affiliated with the American Indian Consortium       serving Native Americans with disabilities in the Four       Corners region of the Southwest.        In 2002, Congress passed HAVA acknowledging the unique       obstacles people with disabilities face at the polls, and       authorized funding for the PAVA program. The PAVA program       allows P&As to advocate on behalf of voters with disabilities       to ensure that they have access to all aspects of the       American voting process. PAVA program funds allow P&As to       conduct disability training to poll workers, distribute       resources on how to conduct an accessible campaign, maintain       voting hotlines, examine polling places for accessibility,       and much more throughout the year.

The Northern Mariana       Islands and the American Indian Consortium P&As do not       receive PAVA funding since they are not considered states and       therefore have been ineligible for PAVA funding since HAVA       passed.        NDRN has expressed the crucial need for the enactment of       the PAVA Inclusion Act on multiple occasions, including in       written and spoken testimony before House committees.       Additionally, all 57 P&As signed a 2020 letter of support for       this legislation to both the Chair and Ranking Member of the       Committee on House Administration. Most recently, in a Report       of the Interagencv Steering Group on Native American Voting       was published by the White House, calling on policymakers to       ``consider revisiting that limitation, to ensure that these       entities can also equitably access HAVA funds to serve voters       with disabilities in their areas''.        It was always the intent for all 57 P&As to participate in       the PAVA program. Thus, we support the House passing S. 3969,       which would provide a long overdue technical fix to       explicitly authorize the distribution of grant funds to the       Northern Mariana Islands and American Indian Consortium P&As.        Thank you for all your work on protecting the rights of       people with disabilities to vote privately and independently.

Mr. Speaker, language making this correction has passed  the House twice this Congress in other legislation, and it should be  enacted into law.   The Senate passed this bill by unanimous consent in March, and  passing it in the House today will ensure that it will go to the  President's desk to become law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego), the proponent of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have agreement on this bill from the Senate, and that is a good  thing. I should note that we have had discussions, primarily at a staff  level, on the election observer measure mentioned by the ranking member  and Mr. Steil. We continue to evaluate the proposal, but we found a few  concerns. I will mention them now. It is not arbitrary.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 29, 2022, on page H8234, in the first column, the  following appeared: Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time. We have agreement on this bill from      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Speaker, I  yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume. We have agreement on this  bill from    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The proposed legislation does provide broad access, statutory access,  to observers, but it doesn't provide the ability of election officials  to protect private, personally identifiable information of voters, and  we think that needs to be addressed.   The same section prohibits election officials from interfering ``with  the elections administration process.'' The text doesn't give election  officials the ability to remove observers if they are disruptive, and  regrettably, we have seen across the country instances where advocates  became aggressive, even in some cases--well, I will leave it at that-- aggressive towards election officials. There has to be a capacity to  deal with that.   We haven't had a hearing or markup on this. It is possible we will.  But I didn't want to leave this just dangling out there.    I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.    Reclaiming my time. My staff indicates that there have  been discussions. Obviously, that was at a staff level. But I have  outlined what the concerns are, and I would at this point like to close  so that we can let the House get to its other business.   To go on suspension, both sides of the aisle need to agree, and I  think that is a very important provision of our procedures that will  continue, whichever party is in the majority, and that was how this  ended up. Because that bill really is not necessarily connected with  this PAVA bill. I will talk about another bill that is not connected  with the PAVA bill, and that is the venue bill I mentioned earlier this  morning.   I forgot to mention, and I put it into the Record last night, that  the Progressive Policy Institute, as well as the chamber of commerce,  opposes that venue provision. I do think the fact that Senator Cruz,  Senator Cotton, Senator Hawley, Mr. Buck and Mr. Gaetz are for it  doesn't persuade me that it is a safe measure to move forward to, even  though I very much support the Neguse bill. If this does not pass  today, I am sure the Neguse bill will come back because we do need  resources to enforce our antitrust laws. I am totally on board with  that.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will pass this bill from the Senate that  will protect disabled voters in the Northern Mariana Islands and the  American Indian consortium, that they will have the same access to  funding as all the others, and I urge support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I do  so reluctantly, because title I, raising the  [[Page H8254]]  fees for enforcement, I am for that. As a matter of fact, I am a  cosponsor of that bill. And title II, the foreign measure, I am for  that.   But title III is going to create a problem. This has been advanced as  if it is noncontroversial. That is not the case. It is complicated. Let  me try and be very simple.   In 1968, Congress enacted a provision where if there was a  multiplicity of antitrust lawsuits filed by State AGs who have  concurrent jurisdiction, a senior panel could consolidate the cases so  you wouldn't have inconsistent discovery, inconsistent decisions  outside of the various regions.   You don't need that with the Department of Justice because they do  the consolidation internally when they bring the case. That is why it  worked for the AGs, and it has worked very well for a long time.   Contrary to what some have said, this is not a tech change. This is a  venue change for all businesses, which is why I think the Chamber of  Commerce said they would score the vote.   I think we need to listen to the main proponent, Mr. Buck, on this.  Last night, during the rule debate, he said Big Tech is crushing  competition and crushing conservative speech, and that is what his  venue bill is about, to prevent moderation of speech.   Content moderation is important. We have seen, in the January 6th  Committee, a lot of material that has spread lies, that has incited  violence, and that content should be moderated. It should not be  subject to a bogus effort by State AGs to prevent content moderation  through the antitrust provision.   To claim that that would not happen, I mean, AGs can bring cases  right now without this provision--in fact, California just did against  Amazon. Fine. Go at it if you have a case. But if you don't think that  the attorney general of Texas, who is currently hiding from a process  server and facing other legal complications, wouldn't try to use this  to undermine content moderation, I think you are sadly mistaken.   That would be, I am sure, for my Democratic colleagues, not their  intent, but that would be a very sad result that would not be good for  our country.   Now, if we turn this bill down, I am sure what will happen is that  the Committee on Rules will put the first two provisions that have  broad support in our party back up, and I will happily vote for them,  to give the resources for enforcement and the like.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this measure, with great sadness  that we have been put in this spot.
