 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fallen  Journalists Memorial Act of 2019. I am proud to be introducing this  bill with my long-time friend and colleague, the junior Senator from  Ohio (Mr. Portman).   The purpose of the bill is to authorize the Fallen Journalists  Memorial (FJM) Foundation to establish a commemorative work--a  memorial--in the District of Columbia or its environs honoring  journalists, photographers, and broadcasters killed in the line of  duty, defending freedom of the press. The bill directs the Federal  government to make eligible Federal land available for the memorial.   The bill explicitly prohibits the use of Federal funds to design or  construct the memorial, and stipulates that the memorial must be  designed and built in compliance with existing federal standards for  commemorative works. Furthermore, the FJM Foundation must provide the  funding necessary for the National Park Service or General Services  Administration to maintain the memorial. The bill conforms to the  structure of other similar bills.   Across the National Capital Region, we have monuments and memorials  to honor those who have helped make our Nation and our democracy  stronger since its founding days. Currently missing from that honor  roll, however, are journalists who have sacrificed everything to gather  facts, ask questions, and report the news in the spirit of the free,  open, and transparent societies and governments that Americans--and all  people--deserve.   Why do we need this memorial? Well, according to the Committee to  Protect Journalists:  [[Page S4509]]    Worldwide, at least 1,337 journalists have been killed in the line of  duty since 1992;   each year, hundreds of journalists are attacked, imprisoned, and  tortured;   the majority of the journalists killed are murdered in direct  relation to their work as journalists; and   in 9 out of 10 cases, the killers of journalists go free.   When we think of casualties, we tend to think of war correspondents  on the front lines. in battle. Intrepid reporters and photographers and  cameramen and women put themselves in harm's way, and many have been  killed and wounded. But then we have cases like the Saudi Government's  savage dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its Consulate in  Turkey last October. That was a state-sanctioned killing. And here at  home, barely 30 miles from here, we had the horrific shooting at the  Capital Gazette in Annapolis that left five people dead and two  wounded. The attack at the Gazette offices occurred one year ago this  Friday, on June 28th. So it is fitting that we are introducing the  Fallen Journalists Memorial Act today to remember and honor the Gazette  victims, Jamal Khashoggi, and all other journalists who have been  killed in the line of duty, defending freedom of the press. The Fallen  Journalists Memorial will be a visible symbol and reminder of what is  at stake and the price people have paid.   We Americans have certain rights and responsibilities granted to us  through the Constitution, which established the rule of law in this  country. Freedom of the press is one of those most basic rights and it  is central to our way of life. This precious freedom has often been  under attack, figuratively speaking, since our Nation's founding.   Today, attacks on the American media have become more frequent and  more literal, spurred on by dangerous rhetoric that is creating an  ``open season'' on denigrating and harassing the media for doing its  job--asking questions that need to be asked, investigating the stories  that need to be uncovered, and bringing needed transparency to the  halls of power.   One year ago this Friday, a 38-year-old man who had a long-standing  spurious grudge against the Capital Gazette newspaper, made good on his  sworn threats. He entered the newspaper offices, headed to the  newsroom, and by the time he was done, he had shot and killed five  employees of this community newspaper and wounded two others.   The Capital Gazette is the local paper of record in Annapolis. It is  one of the oldest continuously published newspapers in the U.S. It  traces its roots back to the Maryland Gazette, which began publishing  in 1727 and The Capital, which dates to 1884.   This loss of life is personal to so many in Annapolis and around our  State. You need to understand that the Capital Gazette is as much a  part of the fabric of Annapolis as the State government that it covers  better than anyone in the business.   On that day one year ago, the Anne Arundel County Police Department,  the Annapolis Police Department, and the Anne Arundel County Sheriff's  Office all responded to the first 9-1-1 call within two minutes,  rushing into the offices and into the newsroom to apprehend the gunman  and prevent further bloodshed, according to Anne Arundel Police Chief  Timothy Altomare.   State and Federal law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives (A TF), and many others agencies quickly had personnel there  to support local officials in their efforts to clear the building and  meticulously investigate the scene.   I want to thank, again, all law enforcement officers and other first  responders--from the individuals who rushed into the newsroom not  knowing what danger they might encounter to those helping get others to  safety; from those gathering evidence to ensure nothing was lost in the  bustle or chaos of the moment to those diverting traffic so that people  could be evacuated and investigators could do their jobs in safety.   The swift law enforcement response undoubtedly saved lives but not  before the gunman managed to kill five people. Among them were Gerald  Fischman, 61, who was an editor with more than 25 years of service with  the Capital Gazette admired at the newspaper and throughout the  community for his brilliant mind and writing.   Most often, it was his voice and his insightfulness that came through  on the editorial pages of the Capital Gazette. Rick Hutzell, the  Capital Gazette's editor, described Fischman as ``someone whose life  was committed to protecting our community by telling hard truths.''   Rob Hiaasen, 59, was a columnist, editor, teacher, and storyteller  and brought compassion and humor to his community-focused reporting.  Rob was a coach and a mentor to many. According to former Baltimore Sun  columnist Susan Reimer, he was ``so happy working with young  journalists . . . He wanted to create a newsroom where everyone was  growing.''   John McNamara, 56, was a skilled writer and avid sports fan and  combined these passions in his 24-year career as a sports reporter at  the Capital Gazette. Former Capital Gazette sports editor Gerry  Jackson, said of McNamara, or ``Mac,'' as he went by, ``He could write.  He could edit. He could design pages. He was just a jack of all trades  and a fantastic person.''   Rebecca Smith, 34, was a newly-hired sales assistant known for her  kindness, compassion, and love for her family. A friend of her fiance  described ``Becca'' as ``the absolute most beautiful person'' with  ``the biggest heart'' and called her death ``a great loss to this  world.''   Wendi Winters, 65, was a talented writer who built her career as a  public relations professional and journalist. She was well-known for  her profound reporting on the lives and achievements of people within  the community. She was a ``proud Navy Mom''--and daughter.   As we learned the details of the shooting from the survivors, it  became clear that Wendi saved lives during the attack. She confronted  the gunman and distracted him by throwing things at him--whatever she  could find within reach. As the paper noted: ``Wendi died protecting  her friends, but also in defense of her newsroom from a murderous  assault. Wendi died protecting freedom of the press.''   My heartfelt condolences and prayers continue to go out to the  victims and their families. The surviving staff members also deserve  our prayers and praise for their resilience and dedication to their  mission as journalists and respect for their fallen colleagues. During  and after the attack, staff continued to report by tweet, sharing  information to those outside, taking photos and documenting information  as they would other crime scenes. Despite their grief, shock, anger and  mourning, the surviving staff--with help from their sister publication  the Baltimore Sun, Capital Gazette alumni, and other reporters who  wanted to lend a hand to fellow journalists--put out a paper the  following morning and they have done so every day since. This is grace  under pressure.   Fittingly, the editorial page the day after the shooting was  purposefully left blank, but for the few words: ``Today, we are  speechless. This page is intentionally left blank to commemorate the  victims of Thursday's shootings at our office.'' The staff promised  that on Saturday, the page would ``return to its steady purpose of  offering our readers informed opinion about the world around them, that  they might be better citizens.''   I want to repeat one quote from the Capital Gazette editorial page  that bears repeating: ``Wendi died protecting her friends, but also in  defense of her newsroom from a murderous assault. Wendi died protecting  freedom of the press.'' Wendi Winters and her colleagues died  protecting freedom of the press.   Here in the United States, the Capital Gazette shooting was not an  isolated incident; other journalists have been vulnerable to attack or  reprisal for their work:   a freelance photojournalist was killed in the September 11, 2001,  attacks on the World Trade Center;   in October 2001, a photo editor with the Sun newspaper in Boca Raton,  Florida, died from inhaling anthrax, a substance that was mailed to a  number of journalists across the United States;    in August 2007, a masked gunman shot and killed the editor-in-chief  of  [[Page S4510]]  the Oakland Post, a prominent African-American newspaper; and   in August 2015, a reporter and cameraman for television station WDBJ7  were shot dead during a live broadcast in Smith Mountain Lake,  Virginia.   At least 59 journalists have been murdered or killed in the United  States while reporting, while covering a military conflict, or simply  because of their status as a journalist.   While Annapolis and most of the Nation rallied in support of the  survivors of the Capital Gazette shooting, the paper reported receiving  new death threats and emails celebrating the attack. This is not right  in America or anywhere else.   Journalists, like all Americans, should be free from the fear of  being violently attacked while doing their job--both figuratively and  literally. The right of journalists to report the news is nothing less  than the right of all of us to know, to understand what is happening  around us and to us. Media freedom and media pluralism are essential  for the expression of, or ensuring respect for, other fundamental  freedoms and safeguarding democracy, the rule of law, and a system of  checks and balances.   Every one of us in this body--Democrats and Republicans--has sworn an  oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of  America. We bear the solemn responsibility of defending freedom of the  press. It is time for us to redouble our efforts both here at home and  abroad. We must lead by example. The very foundation and legitimacy of  our democratic republic are at stake. One way to start is by  memorializing those brave men and women who have died or been killed,  as the New York Times' Adolph S. Ochs put it in 1896, ``to give the  news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or  interests involved.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fallen  Journalists Memorial Act of 2019.
