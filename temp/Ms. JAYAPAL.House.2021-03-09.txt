 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the PRO Act.  I am very proud to be a lead sponsor of this transformative bill and to  represent one of the most unionized States in the country, where I have  spent two decades organizing alongside unions for decent wages,  benefits, and workers' rights.   Unions helped build America's middle class. But over the years large  corporations have deployed union-busting tactics to rob workers of  their fundamental workplace rights. That changes today.   The PRO Act will undo decades of Republican antiworker policies. It  puts power back into the hands of workers and secures the right to  organize and bargain for good wages, fair benefits, and an equal voice  on the job. The PRO Act is about democracy in the workplace. It is  about standing with the heroic workers carrying America through the  pandemic.   It is past time to pass the PRO Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters of support from the  Service Employees International Union and the Communications Workers of  America.                                                           SEIU,                                                   February 4, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of       the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), we write to       endorse the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of       2021. This important bill would strengthen working Americans'       rights to join together in unions and bargain for higher       wages and better working conditions to help create balanced,       inclusive growth, and build our economy back better than it       was before.        We are nearly one year into the worst public health and       economic crisis we have faced in a generation, with underpaid       frontline workers literally risking their lives for poverty       wages. While many have rightly called these essential workers       heroes, our country has failed to truly respect them with a       promise to protect them and adequately pay them throughout       the crisis. Too many essential workers continue to lack basic       work protections like proper PPE, paid sick and family leave,       or health care, and far too few have a voice in the workplace       and access to a union. This is most true for the Black and       brown workers who have kept us safe and fed throughout this       crisis.        Unions are the best solution to leveling the playing field       and safeguarding the health and safety of working people. In       fact, during this crisis, where workers that have been able       to act collectively and through their union, they have been       able to secure enhanced safety measures, additional hazard       pay, paid sick time, and other protections. But because of a       concerted effort to undermine unions in America over the past       forty years, just 10% of working people have a say in the       decisions that affect them at work, in their communities and       in our economy. Too many unscrupulous employers--even amidst       a pandemic--take advantage of America's outdated labor laws       to stifle the ability of working people to join together in       unions to stay safe on the job and build a better future for       their families.        The PRO Act would reinvigorate labor law to help build an       economy that works better for the millions of people who work       for a living--not just those at the top. We applaud the       bill's joint employer provision, which would ensure that       workers can meaningfully bargain with all companies that       actually control their employment. We also endorse the bill's       new standard to stop employers from misclassifying their       workers as independent contractors or supervisors to escape       their responsibilities. These changes would make it harder       for companies to circumvent basic worker protections through       subcontracting arrangements or other evasions.        We also strongly support the PRO Act's reforms banning       anti-worker state laws that supersede collective bargaining       agreements. These so-called Right-to Work laws weaken       workers' voice at the workplace, drive down wages, and       threaten the economic security of all workers--union and       nonunion alike. Furthermore, working people subject to these       laws earn $1,558 less per year than those who are not. The       PRO Act permits companies and workers to decide for       themselves whether to negotiate fair share agreements in       collective bargaining. In addition, we are pleased to see PRO       Act provisions that would deter employer misconduct by making       remedies meaningful, penalizing the most egregious       violations, limiting interference in union elections, and       facilitating first contracts with newly formed unions. The       bill rightfully removes restraints on workers' solidarity       actions across different workplaces.        In this time of crisis, working people around the country       urgently need the PRO Act's much needed reforms to make it       easier for people to join unions and hold companies       accountable. A voice on the job has never been more important       for safeguarding the health, safety, and economic security of       the working people we have relied on to get us through this       pandemic.        SEIU members are proud to support the PRO Act. We will add       any future votes on this legislation to our legislative       scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,      International President.                                   ____                                  Communications Workers of America,                                                    AFL-CIO, CLC,                                      Washington, DC, March 9, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members and officers       of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), I am writing       to urge you to vote in favor of H.R. 842, the Protecting the       Right to Organize (PRO) Act, when it comes to a vote on the       House floor this week.        The ability of working people to join together to       collectively bargain for fair pay and working conditions is a       fundamental right. But it is extremely difficult for private       sector workers covered by the NLRA to organize if their       employer opposes them doing so. Companies can intimidate       workers relentlessly, misclassify workers, gerrymander       election units, dodge accountability for violating worker       rights by hiding behind subcontractors, and more--all       completely legally. And even if they do violate the law and       illegally terminate or punish workers for union activity, the       existing NLRA is toothless and its penalties barely amount to       a slap on the wrist. Companies who illegally fire workers are       only required to pay them back pay, minus any income they've       had elsewhere in the interim.        Once workers do come together and organize, the existing       NLRA is also inadequate to protect worker rights. Companies       can easily stall indefinitely to prevent workers from getting       a first contract for years after they organize. If and when       workers are forced to go on strike to protect their       livelihoods, employers can permanently replace strikers       without consequence.        The huge surge in economic inequality over the past       quarter-century is related directly to many workers' lack of       a strong voice on the job. Over that time, wages have       stagnated for workers across the economy, while income has       skyrocketed for CEOs and the wealthiest 1%. By 2012, the       wealthiest 1% made 22.5% of national income, while the bottom       90% of families made less than half of national income--just       49.6%.        Workers who form unions have stronger protections against       discrimination and retaliation, enhanced job security, better       retirement benefits, and more effective ways of combating       practices that jeopardize their health and safety on the job.       These problems have all been magnified by the ongoing COVID-      19 pandemic.        New research confirms that workers without union       representation are less likely to have paid leave, to have       access to proper PPE at work, or to have protections against  [[Page H1141]]       unnecessary layoffs. The PRO Act would fix these problems and       re-establish workers' right to organize in this country, In       doing so, it helps combat skyrocketing economic inequality       and strengthens the middle class. Therefore, I strongly urge       you to vote in favor of the PRO Act and oppose any amendments       that would weaken the bill. CWA will include votes on this       bill in our Congressional Scorecard.        Thank you in advance for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                         Christopher M. Shelton,                                   President, Communications Workers                                                  of America (CWA).
