 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3091.   We need to address police brutality and work on police accountability  as our country continues to reckon with instances of brutality and  distrust of law enforcement officers.   Tyre Nichols, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd's legacies demand more  of us.   I am disappointed to see the exclusion of two key measures from  similar legislation introduced by Val Demings last Congress.   I offered an amendment that would disqualify an officer from  purchasing their weapon after retirement if they have instances of  misconduct or unethical behavior in their personnel file. The good- standing qualification in this bill is too subjective to accurately  protect Americans, but my commonsense amendment was not accepted, and  Republicans are not bringing it up for a vote.   We need increased police accountability and community-based ideas  around policing. We need to keep people alive, including law  enforcement, and rebuild community trust.    Mr. Chair, I hope my GOP colleagues will join me  in finding ways to create safer communities for everyday Americans  because that is what all Americans want. They want to live and work and  worship in communities that will keep them safe and build  relationships, new relationships with law enforcement that understand  and see them.
