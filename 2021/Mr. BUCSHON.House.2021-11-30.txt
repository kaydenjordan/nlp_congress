 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 550, the  Immunization Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2021.    Immunization information systems serve as a vital link between public  health officials, community providers and individuals, not only in  cases of disease outbreak or emergencies, but also during routine  vaccination efforts.   The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear that our immunization  information systems are in need of modernization.   Decisions in response to outbreaks must be based on science, and we  must ensure our States and localities have access to meaningful data to  make targeted decisions that lessen the spread and quickly reopen our  economies.   H.R. 550 would repurpose previously appropriated funds to be spent  through an existing grant program to improve and enhance the ability of  immunization information systems to securely exchange real-time  immunization record data between all public health programs.   As a doctor, I would take my patients' medical privacy very  seriously. Therefore, I want to make clear that the immunization  information systems are secure, confidential, population-based  databases, and are completely deidentified.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Kuster for her  partnership, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
