 Madam Speaker, let's be bipartisanly honest here for a  moment. We just walked out of probably the most bipartisan moment in  the last couple of years, a classified briefing with the Joint Chiefs,  the Secretary, the Secretary of State, and others.   There are things that, real-world, need to be done where Americans  are at risk. They are cut off, and they are stranded. They are now in  the situation where they are the hostages of Afghanistan because of  everything that has been allowed to transpire under President Biden.  And in this body, we are going to walk out of that classified briefing  concerned behind closed doors but do nothing--do absolutely nothing--on  the floor of the House.   I am going to say the same thing I just said a few minutes ago: What  the hell are we doing?   Let's say that again: There are Americans cut off who need our help,  and there are Special Immigrant Visa applicants cut off who need our  help right now who will be killed. We heard the descriptions of the  dangers in the briefing we just got out of.   Defeat the previous question and bring up the only thing that this  body will do in this entire week that has anything to do with what is  going on in Afghanistan. This is the only opportunity, the only thing  that is going on related to Afghanistan in this body.   That is unconscionable. How in the world is that the case?   Every time somebody tries to do something different in here, like  take the ability of States to determine their own voting rights or  other things, everybody needs to say: Stop. What the hell are you  doing? Get focused back on Afghanistan and saving Americans.
