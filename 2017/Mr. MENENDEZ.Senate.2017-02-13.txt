 Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to  President Trump's nominee to serve as Secretary of the Treasury, Steve  Mnuchin.   From his days at Goldman Sachs, on the frontlines of developing the  very products that brought our economy to its knees, to his reign as  chairman of OneWest Bank, quantified by tens of thousands of  foreclosures and qualified by years of despair, to his plan to get rich  off cash-strapped seniors, to his investments in Sears that stripped  pension benefits from low-wage-earners, Mr. Mnuchin made a career out  of exploiting the financial turmoil of hard-working American families,  never once stopping to consider the impacts of his profiteering on the  people of this country.   At every step of the way, Mr. Mnuchin's mantra has been to privatize  profits and socialize losses.   While our President spent much of his campaign railing against  Goldman Sachs and Wall Street's stranglehold on Washington, it should  be lost on no one that Wall Street has the majority vote in this  administration. With friends like Mr. Mnuchin and Gary Cohn in high  places, the country's largest and most complex financial institutions  can rest easy, knowing this administration is firmly committed to their  bottom lines. As Treasury Secretary, Mr. Mnuchin will be a chief  architect of the GOP's ``Wall Street First'' policy.   Despite his self-described humble beginnings at Goldman Sachs in the  1980s, Mr. Mnuchin was on the frontlines of developing the now-infamous  collateralized debt obligations known as CDOs and credit default swaps.   I urge my colleagues not to be fooled by Mr. Mnuchin. He was part of  the cadre of corporate raiders that brought our economy to its knees.   In its 2011 report on the great recession that wiped out nearly $13  trillion in household wealth and cost nearly 9 million Americans their  jobs, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described  Goldman Sachs' role in the crisis as follows:         Goldman engaged in securitization practices that magnified       risk in the market by selling high risk, poor quality       mortgage products.    It said:         Conflicts of interest related to proprietary investments       led Goldman to conceal its adverse financial interests from       potential investors, sell investors poor quality investments,       and place its final interests before those of its clients. .       . .''    Despite the damage they caused, Mr. Mnuchin never learned his lesson,  and, as recently as 2012, he praised these instruments, calling them  ``an extremely positive development in terms of being able to finance  different parts of the economy and different businesses efficiently.''   Now, after he left Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mnuchin started a hedge fund,  Dune Capital, which started investing in an exotic financial instrument  called life settlements, which are made up of life insurance policies  purchased from cash-strapped seniors. The investor, Mr. Mnuchin's hedge  fund, had a plan to pay the premiums on the policies until the seniors  died, at which point they would cash in on the insurance claims.   So let's be clear. Under Mr. Mnuchin's plan, the sooner seniors died,  the more money his hedge fund would make. While the markets for  [[Page S1116]]  this product collapsed before Mr. Mnuchin could cash in, we have to ask  ourselves if this is the type of leader whom we want at the helm of our  economy? Do we really want a Treasury Secretary who had a plan to get  rich off of dying seniors?   That brings us to the end of 2008 and early 2009. Wall Street had  brought our economy to the brink of collapse, and 13.2 million  Americans were facing unemployment. Home values were plummeting, having  fallen 12.5 percent in just one quarter. And where was Mr. Mnuchin? He  was negotiating the deal of a lifetime. In the darkest days of the  financial crisis, when Rome was burning, Mr. Mnuchin and his friends  were looking for stores to raid.   Boy, did they find a gem in IndyMac. He purchased IndyMac's $23.5  billion of assets for a mere $1.55 billion in March of 2009. With the  FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance entity backing, its too many loans went  south. So he had a governmental guarantee for $23.5 billion of assets  for about $1.5 billion, and he had the government's guarantee. All that  Mr. Mnuchin had to do was to agree to help homeowners struggling with  their mortgages, but Mr. Mnuchin didn't hold up his end of the bargain.  He wanted more. Apparently, the profit margins of foreclosure were just  too sweet to ignore.   After buying IndyMac and renaming it OneWest Bank, Mr. Mnuchin was  installed as chairman. But instead of working to achieve sustainable  loan modifications and workouts for struggling borrowers, as Mr.  Mnuchin had committed to doing, OneWest's business model centered on  kicking borrowers out of their homes at the first sign of default.   In April of 2011, the former Office of Thrift Supervision hit OneWest  Bank with a consent order because the bank was actually putting  homeowners on a fast track to foreclosure, robo-signing foreclosure  documents.   In a sworn deposition in 2009, a OneWest vice president admitted to  robo-signing 750 foreclosure documents a week without ever reading or  reviewing them. In 2014, an independent government review of OneWest's  foreclosure activities in 2009 and 2010 alone identified more than  10,000 homeowners, including dozens of active-duty servicemembers, who  were owed $8.5 million in damages due to the bank's foreclosure  practices.   OneWest's practices were especially egregious when it came to seniors  with reverse mortgage loans. During Mr. Mnuchin's tenure at the bank,  OneWest's reverse mortgage subsidiary, Financial Freedom, had  approximately 17 percent of the reverse mortgage shares but was  responsible for nearly 40 percent of reverse mortgage foreclosures. In  other words, Mr. Mnuchin cornered the market on focusing and  foreclosing on seniors in America. Whether it was foreclosing on a 90- year-old woman over a 27-cent--27-cent--missed payment or threatening  to kick an 84-year-old widow out of her home of 54 years, Mr. Mnuchin  was ruthless.   What did Mr. Mnuchin have to say about all of this when we asked him  during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Finance Committee? He  dodged responsibility at every step. First he blamed IndyMac for the  quality of mortgage loans; then he blamed government regulations, which  he falsely claimed forced his bank to kick people out of their homes.  If that wasn't enough, Mr. Mnuchin had the audacity to tell us that his  bank did not robo-sign documents despite clear evidence to the  contrary.   To make matters worse, Mr. Mnuchin had the gall to call OneWest a  loan modification machine. He repeatedly misled the committee that  OneWest provided more than 100,000 loan modifications when, in fact,  they modified less than one-quarter of that amount.   On top of misleading the committee, Mr. Mnuchin has been unwilling to  provide information on the number of borrowers who lost their homes  during the time that he ran the bank. We believe that number is at  least 60,000 families and seniors, but those numbers could even be  higher.   At the end of the day, this is about much more than numbers. It is  about the seniors who are barely hanging on to their homes--their only  source of wealth. It is about communities that were hit with a one-two  punch of subprime loans in the years leading up to the crisis, only to  face banks like OneWest with unrelenting foreclosure practices that  stopped at nothing until they had kicked people out of their homes.   It is about people like Sylvia Oliver of Scotch Plains, NJ. After her  employer cut her hours in 2009, like so many other hardworking  Americans at the time, she ran into difficulty paying her mortgage.  Despite the fact that Ms. Oliver found a full-time job and applied  eight--eight--times for loan modifications, Mr. Mnuchin's bank denied  each and every one of her applications. Ms. Oliver has been fighting to  save her home for 7 years. She is hanging on by a thread. Her own words  speak volumes about Mr. Mnuchin. She said:         It's been very painful and stressful not knowing if my kids       and my family are going to have a home to live in, or if it's       going to be foreclosed on. I would ask you to remember my       experience when you consider whether Mr. Mnuchin is qualified       to lead the Department of the Treasury. As the CEO and Chair       of OneWest Bank, Mr. Mnuchin had the opportunity to help       families like mine with responsible loan modifications, and       he didn't. I don't think this is a track record that anybody       should be proud of.    Ms. Oliver is right. Mr. Mnuchin's record is not only undeserving of  pride, it is shameful. While Mr. Mnuchin's business formula proved  toxic for tens of thousands of hard-working American families and  seniors, it was incredibly lucrative for Mr. Mnuchin and OneWest's  investors. He sold OneWest for $3.4 billion, a profit of $1.85 billion  over just 6 years, making around $200 million for himself. That is a  pretty nice return on investment.   While I am gravely concerned about Mr. Mnuchin's history of  exploiting hard-working Americans to line his own pockets, I am equally  concerned about his plan to unchain Wall Street. Mr. Mnuchin has made  it his No. 1 priority to roll back Wall Street reform.   As my friend Senator Brown has often said, our colleagues seem to  have contracted a case of collective amnesia about the great recession.  Just 8.5 years after the worst financial collapse in 80 years, which  put taxpayers on the line for billions in bailouts, the President,  Republicans in Congress, and Mr. Mnuchin are champing at the bit to  take down the very protections that were put in place to prevent  another catastrophe. I ask them, Have we learned nothing?   We know what this administration wants. It wants what the industry  wants. On the day the President signed his ``Wall Street First''  Executive order, Goldman Sachs' shares soared 4.6 percent, a $4 billion  gain. At the end of the day, Mr. Mnuchin is nominated to serve in a  position to ensure the financial stability of the American economy, but  his only experience is betting on the financial instability of American  families.   Not only did he profit off the backs of struggling homeowners, he  also stands to profit off of pensions he mismanaged while on the board  of the Sears company. From the time Mr. Mnuchin joined the board of  Sears, the company lost billions of dollars, including more than $8  billion since 2011 alone. Rather than invest in growth and its workers,  he decided to strip the company of its most valuable assets and keep  them for themselves and their friends.   While Sears seemed to lose in this transaction, there were some that  certainly appeared to profit. Not surprisingly, Mr. Mnuchin and his  hedge fund friends were those profiteers. As a shareholder lawsuit  contended, they gobbled up the most valuable and profitable assets, and  they saved golden parachutes for themselves to escape if the company  crashed. This might sound complicated, but it is a move that would make  Gordon Gecko from the movie ``Wall Street'' proud. Just replace  Bluestar Airlines with Sears, and fiction becomes reality. In the world  of both men, greed is good.   But this isn't a movie. It is the real world with real-life  consequences for 200,000 people who work at Sears. Stripping Sears of  $12 billion worth of its most valuable assets contributed to the  devaluation of the company, which further jeopardized the pensions of  more than 200,000 Americans. According to the most recent filing, this  pension fund is now underfunded by an alarming $2 billion after they  stripped $12 billion of its most valuable assets. These retirees, who  rely on pensions to live, who worked hard all of their lives and played  by the rules, have already  [[Page S1117]]  had their benefits cut by Mr. Mnuchin and the Sears finance board. In  fact, the pension situation has become so dire that the government,  through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or the PBGC, felt  compelled to step in to protect the pension benefits for these 200  people.   As if his past mismanagement of pensions isn't bad enough, as  Treasury Secretary, Mr. Mnuchin would oversee the decision whether to  bail out the pension. Mr. Mnuchin would have to decide whether to  protect his personal hedge fund investments in Sears, which he refuses  to divest, or to protect the Federal Government and those 200,000  retirees.   To be fair, when I asked Mr. Mnuchin about his inherent conflict of  interest during his confirmation hearing, he pledged to recuse himself  from any decision by the PBGC regarding Sears. But we have heard that  song before. Mr. Mnuchin can't avoid a conflict of interest by recusing  himself any more than President Trump can avoid a conflict by  supposedly letting his children run his businesses. The only true  firewall against a potential conflict of interest is through a full  divestiture, which Mr. Mnuchin refuses to do. As a private citizen and  executive at Sears, Mr. Mnuchin showed a total disregard for the earned  pension benefits of hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans. I  have no reason to think he will have a change of heart as Treasury  Secretary.   Not only does Mr. Mnuchin want to let banks write their own rules and  let executives profit when they cut pensions, but he also wants to cut  taxes on the rich so he and his friends can keep more of their ill- gotten gains. After helping raise millions of dollars from Wall Street  and big corporations for President Trump's campaign, they are now  expecting a big return on their investment--and, boy, do they win big  league under the Mnuchin-Trump tax plan. This ill-conceived proposal  would give large corporations, which are already earning record  profits, an additional $2.5 trillion. That is $2.5 trillion taken away  from transportation, from schools, from the middle class, and given  directly to multinational corporations. It would eliminate the estate  tax and gift taxes, giving a nearly $200 billion windfall to the  wealthiest 5,000 family dynasties in the country--$200 billion to the  wealthiest 5,000 family dynasties in the country--and 99.99 percent of  all Americans will not see a penny from this giveaway. But we know who  would benefit: Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump.   It doesn't stop there. On top of all of this, the Mnuchin-Trump  proposal would also give the top one-tenth of 1 percent--the wealthiest  of the wealthy, the corporate CEOs and hedge fund managers who make  around $4 million per year or more--$1 million back each and every  year. This group of elite earners already take home a whopping 184  times the average pay and has the same combined net worth as nearly 90  percent of all American workers. These 160,000 of the richest families  in the country have as much wealth as 144 million families in America.   I have nothing against wealthy people. I have nothing against  millionaires and billionaires. Many worked hard for their money, and  they played by the rules. I applaud their success. But I don't think  the wealthy, who are doing just fine right now, need an extra million  dollars or more than the middle class. I don't think we should be  borrowing trillions more from China just to give the top one-tenth of 1  percent another million dollars. This is fundamentally backward.   They say we can't afford to invest in infrastructure, we can't afford  to help our graduates with mounting college debt, we can't afford to  give a whole host of resources to things we think are critical to  compel our Nation to be the continuing global economic leader, but we  can afford to give $1 million away to all the millionaires and  billionaires in the country. This warped order of priorities is a  perfect metaphor for Mr. Mnuchin's school of economics: Give the rich  more and more because they know best.   Unfortunately, this theory of trickle-down economics hasn't worked in  the past and will not work now. The American people are sick and tired  of getting fleeced. They are tired of working hard every day and  playing by the rules only to fall further behind. They are tired of  losing in a rigged system.   But a Treasury Department led by Mr. Mnuchin will only deliver more  of the same: more tax breaks for the wealthiest in the country, more  borrowing from China, more income inequality. These are not the  principles Americans want or need.   In conclusion, you can tell a lot about a person based on how they  handle a crisis. When Wall Street crashed and the country plunged into  recession, where was Mr. Mnuchin? Was he warning regulators that they  were asleep at the wheel and hard-working Americans were being  exploited? Was he working to reform the broken system? No. He was  looking for stores to raid with one goal in mind: profits.   Some would like to either ignore or whitewash this past, but if we  don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. The American  people cannot afford a repeat of that past. We cannot afford a return  to the Wild West of Wall Street--when the middle class was held hostage  to the earnings reports of the biggest banks, when the cure for income  inequality was simply more tax cuts for the wealthy.   We need a Treasury Secretary who will stand up to Wall Street, not  take orders from them. We need a Treasury Secretary who understands  that the strength of our country has come and will always come from the  middle class, not from the CEOs and the hedge funds. Unfortunately,  Mnuchin is not that person.   I urge may colleagues to oppose his nomination.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Nevada.   Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I rise today, along with many of my  colleagues, to speak out against the White House nominating Steven  Mnuchin to be the next Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. President Trump  has nominated the former CEO of OneWest Bank--who before that for 17  years was a Goldman Sachs executive--to run the Federal agency tasked  with crafting and implementing U.S. economic policy. So much for  draining the swamp.   I want to start, however, by sharing the story of a good friend, Lola  Orvik, whom I met when I was attorney general of Nevada.   In 2013, Lola's mortgage on her townhouse in Henderson was  underwater. Like thousands of other Nevadans, she needed to refinance,  but five different loan modification applications had all been rejected  by her bank. Lola was desperate for a solution and on the verge of  losing her home. She received a telephone call offering help that was  too good to be true, and it was. After calling my office, she  thankfully discovered that it was a scam. I am so glad she called my  office. Our staff referred her to a new program we had created, the  Home Again Homeowner Relief Program. It is a one-stop shop to help  struggling homeowners. It helped Lola finally get a loan modification,  reduce her principal by $37,000, slash her interest rate from 5.7  percent to 2 percent, and keep the house she had lived in for nearly 20  years.   The Home Again Program helped thousands of Nevada homeowners  understand all the State and Federal housing resources available to  them. It has helped folks like Lola restructure their loans to ensure  more affordable monthly payments. That simple hotline number has gone a  long way.   Because we were there to help her, Lola got her life back. However,  not everyone was as fortunate as Lola. In fact, some families are still  trying to overcome the continuing destructive impact of the foreclosure  crisis in Nevada and across this country.   In the depths of the great recession, Lola's predicament was not  unique. Nevada was ground zero for the housing crisis. Property values  plummeted. ``For sale'' signs lined the streets. Foreclosure notices  hung on doors throughout the State. Thousands of families lived in  constant fear of losing their homes.   In 2008, Nevada had the highest foreclosure rate in the Nation, with  more than 77,000 homes getting a notice at the door saying they were at  risk for eviction. We led the Nation in the terms of foreclosure rate  for 62 straight months during the recession.   Things got so bad that by 2010, nearly 70 percent of Nevada  homeowners were underwater on their homes, meaning  [[Page S1118]]  that they owed more on their mortgages than the current value of their  property.   As Nevada's attorney general, I fought the big banks, Wall Street  institutions, and default servicing companies to secure more than $1.9  billion to help hard-working families get back on their feet. That  money helped to fund the Home Again Program.   More than just getting that money back, this was about changing the  conduct and predatory practices of the big banks when working with  homeowners. For instance, we made dual tracking an illegal practice so  that banks could no longer foreclosure on a home while simultaneously  considering their request for a loan modification and then charging  them fees every step of the way. We demanded that a homeowner have a  single point of contact within the financial institution so the  homeowner would no longer get shuffled around from person to person and  told to resubmit their loan modification application over and over  again. We demanded that the banks demonstrate that they had personal  knowledge of the foreclosure documents they filed to prevent robo- signing and unlawful foreclosures of a home.   Unfortunately, not every bank was willing to do everything possible  to help the millions of Nevadans and Americans who were suffering. Mr.  Mnuchin's OneWest Bank--formally known as IndyMac--was one such bank.  Instead of trying to help homeowners, OneWest enforced predatory and  unforgiving practices that only served to line the pockets of Mr.  Mnuchin and his co-owners.   Steven Mnuchin purchased IndyMac from the Federal Government after it  collapsed and took control of the thousands of mortgages the bank  managed. Mnuchin rebranded the bank as OneWest and went to work using  questionable foreclosure practices, like dual tracking, so he could  make more money. That is not right.   Instead of working to help these homeowners stay in their homes,  OneWest Bank, under Mnuchin's leadership, became a foreclosure machine.  The bank had one of the highest denial rates for applications to the  Home Affordable Modification Program. A judge in Wisconsin cited  OneWest's ``harsh, repugnant, shocking, and repulsive'' practices when  deciding a suit against them. Recent documents show that the company  used robo-signing to deny modification claims, proving that it did not  fairly consider loan modification applications for tens of thousands of  homeowners.   When confronted with these facts at his Senate confirmation hearing,  Mr. Mnuchin lied. He denied that OneWest used robo-signing, offered  empty excuses, and shifted blame for his company's heinous practices.  And during his confirmation hearing, Mr. Mnuchin repeatedly refused to  say how many homes OneWest foreclosed on in Nevada.   However, according to new data, during the foreclosure crisis and its  immediate aftermath, OneWest made $3 billion in profit while evicting  3,654 Nevada families from their homes. This includes 181 foreclosures  on seniors who had taken out reverse mortgages. When he eventually left  the bank, Mr. Mnuchin received a $10.9 million payout. This is on top  of the annual compensation of $4.5 million he has received since 2015,  when OneWest was bought by other investors. Let me repeat that. Some  3,654 Nevada families lost their homes because Mr. Mnuchin's OneWest  put profits over people. That is a snapshot and a statistic which does  not do justice to how much pain that caused for those families.   I want to spend some time on these accusations of robo-signing, both  because Mr. Mnuchin clearly lied and also because this was an issue I  took on when I was attorney general during and after the crash.   First, let's be clear what this is. Robo-signing is a procedure used  by mortgage companies to sign foreclosure documents without reviewing  them. This is a reckless practice used by banks to cut corners and  forge documents, to rush things along, and it caused thousands of  families to be wrongfully evicted from their homes.   Like OneWest, the banks were involved in a massive robo-signing  scheme in my home State of Nevada, and I went after them aggressively  as the State's attorney general. Nevada led the Nation in foreclosures  every month for more than 4 years.   Mr. Mnuchin's company did not care that middle-class families were  losing their homes during the crisis. In fact, during his confirmation  hearing before the Senate, he admitted:         I never wanted to be in the mortgage servicing business. I       didn't want to be in the reverse mortgage business, I wanted       to build a regional bank.    In other words, Mr. Mnuchin had to convince his investors that they  would make money--a point that Mr. Mnuchin admitted at the hearing,  saying: ``Yes, my investors made a lot of money on OneWest.''   Not only did his investors make a lot of money, Mr. Mnuchin did so as  well. Since leaving the bank, he has pocketed nearly $20 million. Mr.  Mnuchin was making millions, while thousands of Nevadans were losing  their homes and their dignity, Nevadans like Heather McCreary of  Sparks, who came to Capitol Hill last month to share her heart- wrenching story of how she applied to OneWest for a loan modification  in 2010 after she and her husband lost their jobs as a result of the  financial crisis. Despite three applications and following all  instructions, the bank kept Heather's family dangling and then suddenly  foreclosed on their home. I want to read some of Heather's testimony.  It is moving and heartbreaking and deserves to be heard by every Member  of this body.   Here is what she told us at the hearing:         In 2008, when the economy started to get worse, I was laid       off. The following year, in 2009, my husband Jack was laid       off too. Though Jack was able to find another job pretty       fast, he had to take a big pay cut--from about $25 an hour to       $8.50 an hour. Between the cut in Jack's pay and the loss in       income I experienced when going on unemployment insurance       benefits after I got laid off, we were pinched and we were       drowning financially.        However, we were determined to keep our dream home, so Jack       and I were tenacious about doing whatever we could to get       help. We sought help from the Hope Now Alliance, which is an       alliance of HUD-approved counselors who provide free       foreclosure help, and from the Washoe County Senior Law       Project.        We worked side-by-side with both organizations to do       everything required of us by our mortgage servicer IndyMac,       which later became OneWest. When we first asked for help,       OneWest gave us a short forbearance and allowed us to make a       smaller payment for several months with the goal of a       reduction in our monthly mortgage payments through the Home       Affordable Modification Program (or HAMP).        By applying for the HAMP program, we thought we were back       on the road to keeping our home. We complied 100 percent with       OneWest requirements for HAMP--we were incredibly nervous       about being able to keep our house, so we were extremely       careful to make sure we did everything we could to keep the       process going forward. Our application for HAMP was processed       and we were approved for our modification. I sent in the       signed paperwork and the first payment under the modified       payment amount along with it.        But then the process started to fall apart. After a whole       30 days, OneWest returned our personal check and told us that       only certified checks would be accepted, so they were now       voiding the modification offer. We had followed the       instructions to the letter on OneWest paperwork, crossing our       ``T''s and dotting our ``I''s. But in the end, this didn't       matter--and OneWest's rejection of our HAMP application put       us on the road to foreclosure.        We applied two more times for loan modifications over the       next six months because we were given assurances by people at       OneWest that they would approve our application. We again       complied with every request OneWest made of us, taking care       to send in extra documents whenever OneWest requested them.        But as far as I can tell, OneWest never attempted to       process the loan modification. The foreclosure went through       and we lost our home on September 10, 2010. The foreclosure       left us without a home; and finding a new rental was       extremely difficult because of our credit. Juggling the       demands of raising our twins was so hard--the foreclosure       even meant that our kids had to miss school. Eventually we       did find a new place, but we had to pay an outrageous rent,       even though it was not a good home for us at all.        It's hard to explain the shame, embarrassment, and grief       that Jack and I felt. I've cried a river of tears over this.       I really didn't think we were asking too much: We wanted to       hang on to our home for the sake of our kids, and we did       everything we could to stay in our home. And while I will       probably never know exactly what OneWest did, the outcome of       my story proves that Steve Mnuchin's company had no interest       in helping us. They wanted to foreclose because they were       focused on their profits.    Heather's story is just one of thousands that highlight just how  wrong  [[Page S1119]]  Mr. Mnuchin is to be our next Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. The  Treasury Department has the vital mission of promoting the conditions  that enable economic growth, stability, job opportunities, and the  ability to buy a car or own a home. Their actions directly affect the  lives of every American.   Our next Treasury Secretary should have a proven record of fighting  to expand economic opportunities for everyone. That is what Americans  deserve. Yet, from where I stand, Mr. Mnuchin falls far short of that  test.   President Trump's choice of Mr. Mnuchin to lead the U.S. Treasury is  a slap in the face for Nevada families like Heather's. Her story makes  it crystal clear: This is not someone who will be looking out for  working people when he implements our Nation's economic policy.   In many ways, President Trump's unfortunate choice of someone like  Mr. Mnuchin should not surprise us because in 2006 the President said  he ``sort of hoped'' the real estate market would tank, and in 2007 he  said he was ``excited'' for the housing market crash. The motive was  the same: profits.   We cannot afford to return to the misguided policies that brought us  to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Families  cannot afford to lose their homes again. But that is exactly what we  can expect if Stephen Mnuchin is confirmed as President Trump's  Treasury Secretary.   When I ran for the Senate, I promised Nevadans that I would fight for  them, that I would stand up for them and be their voice here in  Washington. Today, I am that voice, and that is why I rise with my  colleagues in opposition to the ``Foreclosure King,'' Mr. Mnuchin.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
