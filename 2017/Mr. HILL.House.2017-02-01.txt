 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 41. As you have  heard today, it has an immense cost to our economy. The SEC estimates,  as you have heard from other Members, up to $590 million per year, Mr.  Speaker. Now, think about that. That is $5 billion over 10 years. And  if we put a 10 multiplier on it, that is $50 billion of investable  capital that could be put out for productive use helping the world have  more mineral resources. Instead, it goes to this ill-advised rule.                                time  1600    In the past two decades, the United States has lost more than 50  percent, Mr. Speaker, of its public companies, in large part due to the  costs and regulatory burdens of being associated with being a public  company. Dodd-Frank's resource extraction rule piles on even more  harmful red tape for those publicly traded companies in the United  States that are global energy providers.   As this rule only applies to publicly traded companies, this  increased burden puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage. Over 75 percent  of the extracted minerals are owned by state-owned enterprises, Mr.  Speaker, that are not covered by this rule. That puts our companies at  a competitive disadvantage. It requires our companies to reveal  confidential information, putting our companies at a competitive  disadvantage.   And if, Mr. Speaker, the people want transparency, the best way to  handle that is through self-disclosure through global transparency and  accountability. There are important public policy goals, and 51  countries have entered into the Extractive Industry Transparency  Institute, which is self-reporting and publishing, by country, by  company, both public and private, these important issues about mineral  extraction.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, if it is about corruption, our friend, Senator  Proxmire from Wisconsin, long ago, in the 1970s, passed the Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act. There is no more act feared by global corporate  America than complying with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and  ensuring that our companies, our shareholders are not prone or party to  bribery.   I support this resolution.
