 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  resolution. I rise in total support of the decision to remove Qasem  Soleimani.   I have heard the use of the word ``disproportionate'' from the  Speaker. I have heard it here today on the House floor, and it is just  a shocking word to be used to describe what took place. It makes me ask  the question: At what point is it proportionate to take out a  designated terrorist who kills 600 U.S. troops, wounds thousands of  others, kills and wounds troops recently, and his proxies attack a U.S.  Embassy?   If anyone has any doubt as to what Qasem Soleimani was doing in Iraq  at the time we took him out, you can look at the IRGC's own words. The  IRGC put out a statement saying that Soleimani and companions were on  their way to ``plan a confrontation against the new scheme of the  Americans to rebuild Daesh and the Takfiri groups in order to again  disrupt Iraq's security.''   Who needs an intelligence briefing to determine that this is totally  legitimate?   On behalf of all of those Gold Star families and all the Blue Star  families, of anyone who is deployed now, anyone who is in harm's way,  if you need proof, go to Walter Reed. If you need proof, sit down with  some of these Gold Star families who lost their sons, their daughters,  their fathers, their mothers, their brothers, and their sisters because  of this designated foreign terrorist running a designated foreign  terrorist organization, who was sanctioned by the United States, by EU,  and by the United Nations.   I say good riddance.   Why are we having this debate? We should be coming together, not as  Republicans first, not as Democrats first. We should be coming together  as Americans first and voting this down.
