 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Isabel  Castano-Lugo, who will turn 112 years young on January 11. Isabel, a  supercentenarian, is one of only a handful in the Nation who has lived  through some of the brightest times and darkest chapters in our  history.   Born in 1906, in Manizales, Colombia, Isabel was one of 13 brothers  and sisters. At age 41, Isabel married and had 2 sons, Omar and Danilo  Lugo. Because of the increasing violence in her home country and the  kidnapping of her husband, Isabel began a new life with her children in  the United States in 1970, and, for 26 years, she resided in my  district in beautiful Miami Beach.   Throughout her long and distinguished life, Isabel has never ceased  placing the needs of others before her own. Isabel has served as a  strong advocate for many important issues and organizations, such as  the Jewish Community Center of Miami Beach, and has continued to serve  as a voice for the voiceless to this day.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this  historic birthday with Isabel, who is the oldest living person in the  State of Florida.                       Congratulating Coach Mark Richt     Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Mark  Richt, head coach of the Miami Hurricanes football team on being named  the Walter Camp 2017 Coach of the Year and the ACC Coach of the Year.   In only two seasons at the helm, Coach Richt has created a winning  environment at my alma mater, the University of Miami. This season, the  Hurricanes won their first ACC Coastal Division title and ended a 7- year losing streak against rival Florida State University.   Coach Richt's success on the field this past year also earned him two  notable accolades. He is the first Miami Hurricane's coach to be named  ACC Coach of the Year and only the second UM coach to receive the  Walter Camp award. Coach Richt is truly a phenomenal leader, and I am  confident that he will continue to guide UM's football program to  greater victories in the years to come.   Once again, ``congratulations,'' ``felicidades,'' to Coach Richt on  your success this last season, and ``Go Canes.''                       Congratulating Coach Jim Morris     Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Jim  Morris on celebrating his 25th and final season as head coach of the  Miami Hurricanes baseball team. Coach Morris has dedicated his life to  college baseball. He has won over 1,500 Division 1 games, the fifth  most in the history of the sport.   During his tenure, the University of Miami, my alma mater, qualified  for the College World Series more times than any other baseball program  throughout the country, and he led the team to two national  championships. Coach Morris has also been named National Coach of the  Year three times.   Coach Morris' outstanding leadership for the past 25 years has left a  positive and lasting impact on the University of Miami. I am confident  that this historic legacy will continue to inspire and will continue to  shape Hurricane baseball in the years to come.   Once again, ``congratulations,'' ``felicidades,'' to Coach Morris on  a long and distinguished career.   ``Go Canes.''  [[Page H25]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this Friday, January 12, marks the  eighth anniversary of the devastating earthquake that took the lives of  250,000 Haitians and left unimaginable destruction. Local south Florida  organizations, led by Haitian Women of Miami, will hold a silent march  at 4 p.m. this Friday to mark the occasion, walking from Northwest 62nd  Street to North Miami Avenue to the Little Haiti Cultural Center.   These past 8 years, the people of Haiti have shown incredible  resolve, even after being hit by Hurricanes Matthew and Irma recently,  and, sadly, there is still much work to be done, Mr. Speaker.   Many Haitians came to the United States after these natural disasters  seeking safety and security. Sadly, the administration terminated the  Temporary Protected Status, TPS, to these individuals, forcing them to  return to a devastated Haiti that is still struggling to rebuild.   As we mark this sad anniversary, we must reaffirm our commitment to  helping Haiti move forward, and that must start by calling upon the  administration to reverse its decision to terminate TPS for Haiti.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree  to the resolution (H. Res. 676) supporting the rights of the people of  Iran to free expression, condemning the Iranian regime for its  crackdown on legitimate protests, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 676         Whereas, on December 28, 2017, popular protests against the       Iranian regime began in the city of Mashad and rapidly spread       throughout the country, in the most significant anti-      government protests in Iran since June 2009;        Whereas the protesters have expressed numerous economic       grievances, including the regime's widespread corruption and       the Revolutionary Guard Corps' control of the country's       economy;        Whereas protesters have decried the regime's costly,       destabilizing activities abroad, including its support for       terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and the murderous Assad       regime in Syria;        Whereas reports indicate that more than 1,000 Iranians have       been arrested and almost two dozen killed in connection with       the protests;        Whereas the Iranian regime has shut down mobile internet       access and has blocked and pressured companies to cut off       social media applications used by activists to organize and       publicize the protests;        Whereas Congress has provided authority to license the       provision of communications technology to Iran to improve the       ability of the Iranian people to speak freely;        Whereas, on January 1, 2018, regime officials threatened to       crack down, with Brigadier General Esmaeil Kowsari of Iran's       Revolutionary Guard Corps stating, ``If this situation       continues, the officials will definitely make some decisions       and at that point this business will be finished.'';        Whereas Congress has provided authority to designate and       sanction elements of the Iranian regime involved in       significant corruption and serious human rights abuses;        Whereas Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij       militia have been sanctioned by the United States for       planning and carrying out serious human rights abuses against       the Iranian people, including for the cruel and prolonged       torture of political dissidents;        Whereas the regime has routinely violated the human rights       of Iranian citizens, including ongoing, systematic, and       serious restrictions of freedom of peaceful assembly and       association and freedom of opinion and expression, including       the continuing closures of media outlets, arrests of       journalists, and the censorship of expression in online       forums such as blogs and websites;        Whereas the Department of State's 2016 Human Rights Report       on Iran noted ``severe restrictions on civil liberties,       including the freedoms of assembly, association, speech,       religion, and press. Other human rights problems included       abuse of due process combined with use of capital punishment       for crimes that do not meet the requirements of due process,       as well as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or       punishment; and disregard for the physical integrity of       persons, whom authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully       detained, tortured, or killed.'';        Whereas, on December 29, 2017, the Department of State       strongly condemned the arrest of peaceful protesters and       noted that ``Iran's leaders have turned a wealthy country       with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted       rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and       chaos.'';        Whereas, on January 1, 2018, the Secretary of State for       Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom, Boris       Johnson, stated that ``The UK is watching events in Iran       closely. We believe that there should be meaningful debate       about the legitimate and important issues the protesters are       raising and we look to the Iranian authorities to permit       this.'';        Whereas, on January 2, 2018, the French Foreign Ministry       stated that ``French authorities are closely monitoring the       situation in Iran. Demonstrating freely is a fundamental       right. The same is true for the free movement of information.       France expresses its concern over the large number of victims       and arrests.'';        Whereas, on January 1, 2018, a spokesman for the Canadian       Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that ``We call on the       Iranian authorities to uphold and respect democratic and       human rights'' and ``We are encouraged by the Iranian people       who are bravely exercising their basic right to protest       peacefully. Canada will continue to support the fundamental       rights of the Iranians, including freedom of expression.'';        Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations, voted for       the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is a signatory       to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,       among other international human rights treaties; and        Whereas, in violation of these and other international       obligations, Iranian regime officials continue to violate the       fundamental human rights of the Iranian people: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--  [[Page H52]]         (1) stands with the people of Iran that are engaged in       legitimate and peaceful protests against an oppressive,       corrupt regime;        (2) condemns the Iranian regime's serious human rights       abuses against the Iranian people, significant corruption,       and destabilizing activities abroad;        (3) notes the statements of support for the protestors from       key allies and calls on all democratic governments and       institutions to clearly support the Iranian people's right to       live in a free society;        (4) demands that the Iranian regime abide by its       international obligations with respect to human rights and       civil liberties, including freedoms of assembly, speech, and       press;        (5) urges the Administration to use targeted sanctions and       work to convene emergency sessions of the United Nations       Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council       to condemn the ongoing human rights violations perpetrated by       the Iranian regime and establish a mechanism by which the       Security Council can monitor such violations;        (6) encourages the Administration to expedite the license       of communications technology to Iran to improve the ability       of the Iranian people to speak freely;        (7) calls on companies to reject requests by the regime to       cut off the Iranian people from social media and other       communications platforms;        (8) respects the proud history and rich culture of the       Iranian nation and fully supports efforts by the people of       Iran to promote the establishment of basic freedoms that       build the foundation for the emergence of a freely elected,       open, and democratic political system; and        (9) urges the President and the Secretary of State to work       with the international community to ensure that violations of       human rights are part of all formal and informal multilateral       or bilateral discussions with and regarding Iran.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel  for their swift action in putting this important and timely resolution  together.   The world has been witnessing the people of Iran taking to the  streets en masse to protest the radical regime in Tehran. They have  made it clear that the regime's policies have done nothing but harm  Iran.   We have seen large-scale protests in Iran before, most notably in  2009, but these protests are different, Mr. Speaker. This time, unlike  in 2009, America has not shied away from doing the right thing. The  administration has expressed vocal support for the people of Iran, and  it has warned the regime that we are watching how it responds.   The public discontent is palpable, and these protests have exposed  the cracks behind the regime's veneer. For decades, the hardline regime  has squandered Iran's vast resources in pursuit of spreading the  revolutionary ideology and of achieving an illicit nuclear weapons  program.   The regime's rule by fear and rule by intimidation--the human rights  abuses, the silencing of the opposition, the abuses of ethnic and  religious minorities, the restrictions imposed against women under  sharia law, and the corruption, none of these are being taken anymore,  sitting down, by millions of Iranians.   Let us not be fooled, Mr. Speaker. Rouhani is no moderate. He is an  opportunist, and he is a lifelong adherent to the regime and its  hateful ideology.   That is why this resolution is so important. We must make it clear  that we truly support the people of Iran and their aspirations for a  free and democratic society. Their protests are a referendum on the  regime, and we must make it clear to all the regime officials that they  will be held accountable for any human rights abuses in response to  these protests.   But, Mr. Speaker, we must also not lose sight of the bigger picture.  These protests are important, and it is important that we take action  on human rights abuses. But this is just one aspect of the regime's  illicit behavior, and sanctions against human rights violators is but  one tool that we have at our disposal. The totality of the regime's  nefarious and illicit activity is what the people of Iran are  protesting against, and it would be unwise for us to lose focus of that  bigger picture.   So while it is important that we stand here today in support of the  people of Iran and we make it clear that there will be consequences for  human rights abuses, we must make sure that we see the whole board here  and connect the dots, and that means, Mr. Speaker, using all the tools  at our disposal, because they are not isolated issues. They are all  connected.   So, with that, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to  continue supporting a strong response to all of Iran's illicit activity  and the use of all of the tools that we have at our disposal.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Rohrabacher), who is  [[Page H53]]  the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe and Emerging  Threats.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs' Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights,  and International Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the Committee on Homeland  Security, as well as a senior member on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Poe), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee  on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, who tells it just like it  is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), and I ask unanimous consent that  he control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman for his  years of service to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel Act,  authored by my good friend and colleague, Chairman Steve Chabot. Over  the years, Steve and I have worked closely together on our Foreign  Affairs Committee, and his commitment and leadership on strengthening  U.S.-Taiwan relations has been second to none.   We have worked to shift U.S. policy on Taiwan to a more favorable  position for our friend and ally, Taiwan, rather than an acquiescent  policy that U.S. administration after U.S. administration continued to  implement out of fear from a Chinese economic retaliation or diplomatic  retaliation or military retaliation.   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that we continue to allow China  to dictate our foreign policy when it comes to Taiwan. The Taiwanese  have been great partners for the United States, whereas China seeks to  undermine everything we do, yet administration after administration  have gone so far as to self-impose restrictions and self-impose  limitations in our dealings with Taiwan, and that includes a self- imposed restriction on allowing the Taiwanese President and other high- ranking government officials from Taipei from coming to Washington,  D.C., to meet with Congress, to meet with administration officials, to  meet with other policymakers. This is unconscionable, and this farce  needs to end.   We should have direct dialogue with the democratically elected  leadership of our ally, Taiwan, and we should not allow China or the  fear of Chinese reprisal to dictate this.   Without this, we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage. We are  harming and insulting an ally. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, we are  damaging our national security interests and giving China, in effect, a  veto over our foreign policy decisions.   That is why Mr. Chabot's bill is so important, Mr. Speaker. The  Taiwan Travel Act states that it should be U.S. policy to not only  allow visits from Taiwanese officials at all levels of the government,  but to encourage these visits, to facilitate these visits.   It also states that our own policymakers, including at the highest  levels of our government, should visit Taiwan for face-to-face meetings  with their counterparts.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is a global leader. We are a sovereign  nation. Who we choose to meet with and who we choose to recognize is  our sovereign right. We should not allow China or anyone else to impact  our decision. For far too long, America has allowed China to prevent us  from taking full advantage of our partnership with Taiwan.   The Taiwan Travel Act is an important step toward doing the right  thing for our friend and ally, and I hope that the administration will  reverse these damaging policies.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the chairman of our esteemed  committee, for the time. I urge all of our colleagues to support Mr.  Chabot's bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman for this  time, and I want to thank my Florida colleague, Ted Yoho, the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, for offering this  important bill as well as for his constant friendship and assistance to  our strong and indispensable ally, Taiwan.   His bill, H.R. 3320, directing the Secretary of State to develop a  strategy for increasing Taiwan's participation at the World Health  Organization, is an important first step, an important piece of our  foreign policy toward our ally, Taiwan.   Congress has, for years, been pushing for Taiwan to have greater  access, to have equal representation at so many institutions.  Unfortunately, as with so many other international organizations,  Taiwan's lack of observer status at the World Health Organization, or  WHO, is caused by an orchestrated and dangerous campaign by China to  constrain Taiwan's participation in global affairs.   In the case of the WHO, China is depriving the international  community from access to a wealth of Taiwan's high-level healthcare  information. Due to its superb talent, due to its data collection, due  to its quarantine and treatment facilities, Taiwan has excellent  infectious disease control capabilities. Fourteen years ago, Taiwan's  cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control was crucial in  stemming the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as  SARS.   Before the last World Health assembly in May, I wrote a letter to the  Department of Health and Human Services urging greater efforts to  ensure that Taiwan received an invitation to the summit. The Secretary  agreed with me, writing that Taiwan is an indispensable member of the  global health society and is a ``strong health partner that  demonstrated the value of its expertise and contributions to health  issues of global concern.''   Unsurprisingly, however, Mr. Speaker, China once again put its  dangerous and shortsighted policies first, using its influence with  World Health Organization member states to deny Taiwan an invitation to  the assembly.   We cannot continue allowing China to threaten global efforts to  mitigate infectious disease, and, more importantly, Mr. Speaker, we  cannot continue to allow China to bully Taiwan or to have a veto over  our own foreign policy decisions. It is time to develop new ideas and  new strategies so that we can put a stop to China's bullying and ensure  that Taiwan gains observer status at the WHO and everywhere else.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this important measure,  and, as always, I thank our esteemed chairman for the time.
