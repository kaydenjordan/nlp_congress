 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the ability to address a few of my  colleagues here on the floor of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I would note, though, here we are again, we are sitting  here at the precipice of the government funding running out. And I hear  all my colleagues talking about how great it is: We are going to come  up with some great, big omnibus bill. And I am hearing that from my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   Nobody in America wants us to plus-up more spending irresponsibly.   Nobody in America wants us to say, Oh, let's pat ourselves on the  back now. Because some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  are saying, Well, you know what? It is time now to ban Russian oil.   It is not good enough to ban Russian oil if we are not going to open  up American oil and gas. All we are going to do is provide more money  to Venezuela, more money to Saudi, more money to Iran. But yet, that is  being touted as a victory.   And some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are saying, Okay,  good. Oh, this is great. But my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle, they don't want any oil. They don't mind your gas being $4, $7,  $10 a gallon.   Don't get played. But my colleagues on this side of the aisle are  about to get played, and everybody back home is saying: What are you  going to do to stop vaccine mandates? Nothing. What are you going to do  to secure the border?   And my colleagues on this side of the aisle are going to say, Oh,  don't worry. We are going to give you more money for ICE, more money  for Border Patrol. But you know what that does? It makes it worse,  because you are funding the processing of people at our border, because  that is all Border Patrol and ICE are doing.   But my colleagues on this side of the aisle are going to say, Oh,  look at us. We did something for border security. It ain't true. It is  going to make it worse. And anybody who has been to the border, anybody  who talks to Border Patrol, anybody who talks to ICE, knows that is  true.   We are not going to get a vaccine mandate, we are not going to get a  secure border, and we are not going to get more oil and gas being  produced in America.   And then we are going to say, Great, let's have a vote and send more  lethal aid to Ukraine. And we are not even going to have a debate down  here about what we are doing in funding Ukraine, with Putin rolling  over Ukraine? All we are doing is backroom dealmaking, waiting for  somebody to drop a bill on the floor of the House, and then come down  and vote ``yes'' or ``no.''   That is a disgusting display by both sides of this body. We ought to  have a full and open debate on the floor of the House about what we are  doing in sending arms to Ukraine; how much we are spending; what it  means for our involvement; what it means for NATO; what it means for  stopping Putin.   And stop spending money we don't have. Stop funding tyranny. Stop  forcing Americans to get a jab or lose their job. Stop leaving the  border wide open. And stop selling the American people a bill of goods.  And I am looking directly at my party when I say that.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado (Mr. Buck)  for this important time talking about the horrors that have been  inflicted upon people by Vladimir Putin. Specifically, we know how much  damage he has been causing to the people of Ukraine.   More than 1.7 million--in fact, I saw a graphic just before I came to  the floor--2 million Ukrainians have been displaced, have been fleeing  Ukraine for other countries nearby.   Over 2,000 civilians have been killed, according to reports. But,  obviously, we don't know the extent of the damage and the carnage.  Thirty-eight children have been killed that we know of, but there are  probably more, and 70 wounded that we know of.   Madam Speaker, $10 billion in damages to Ukrainian infrastructure,  probably far more than that; 200 schools, 34 hospitals, and 1,500  residential homes destroyed--these are the basic numbers just coming  in. We know they are going to be far greater.   On Saturday, a family with two children, a teenage son and a daughter  who appeared to be 8 years old, and several  [[Page H1368]]  other civilians were killed by a Russian military strike at an  evacuation crossing point in a Kyiv suburb as they were trying to flee  Ukraine.   Ukraine has required men to stay to defend their country, forcing  families to make the unthinkable decision. One Ukraine woman said: ``It  is very hard to have your husband stay home. You have to choose: Save  the kids or stay with him.''   I have heard from friends and read dozens of tragic stories in the  past few days through friends of mine in Austin, Texas, who have gone  to Ukraine to help people. I have been in touch, through them, with an  orphanage in Kyiv with somewhere upward of 50 children, up to 14  infants, up near the suburbs of north Kyiv.   They are struggling. They are lacking food. They are lacking the  materials to survive. They are trying to figure out how to get to a  place where they can get to help.   We have actors on the ground trying to help them, but they can't get  to them because of what Putin is doing and not really heeding the calls  for helping people be able to get out of harm's way.    Right now, these children are completely helpless. A nurse from Lutsk  in western Ukraine who fled to Poland said the decision on whether to  stay or go was not instantaneous. When the Russian army first invaded  eastern Ukraine, she and her husband decided to wait: ``We were hoping  that the situation wouldn't develop into a full-scale invasion. But as  hours passed, it became obvious that things were only getting worse.''   The next morning, she and her 2-year-old son, Tymi, got in a car and  headed for Poland, where they waited 10 hours at the border. She said  saying good-bye to their husband and father, who stayed in Ukraine to  build barricades, was heartbreaking.   She and her son were hosted by a Polish family, Robert and Hana, an  English language university instructor and a human resources  supervisor, who live with their two children. They made it clear that  their hospitality didn't have an end date.   Alex in Kyiv is helping his friends evacuate. Sergei in Rivne is  setting up shelters for his community and providing food and supplies.  Peter in Zhytomyr packed his car yesterday and is currently taking his  neighbors to Poland.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, we are seeing Putin's propaganda tactics, as  we speak. The world is seeing it on full display. His regime is  systematically shutting down the free flow of information surrounding  this brutal war in Ukraine. The State run newspapers in Russia have  been instructed to not use the words ``invasion'' or ``war.'' Just days  ago, Putin's regime shut off Facebook access in the country.   Now, again, whatever Russians are able to see what we are saying on  the floor, this is the truth. This is the truth of what Vladimir Putin  is doing to the truth and the dissemination of information of what is  happening in Russia, what is happening to the people of Ukraine, not  the propaganda you're hearing in Russia.   Just days ago, Putin's regime shut off Facebook, as I said. The  Russian newspaper translated as ``New Newspaper'' has a brave, freedom- loving editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov--he co-won last year's Nobel  Peace Prize--who has been forced to remove all of the material on the  newspaper's website related to Russia's aggression in the Ukraine.   Think about that. That is what is happening. This isn't new. It is  his track record. He came to power because of a terrorist act that was  directed at Russia's own people.   In 1999, three apartment buildings in Moscow, Dagestan, and  Volgodonsk were bombed. Those bombings, allegedly the acts of Chechen  terrorists, gave a pretext for going into Chechnya for a second war,  thus solidifying support for Putin as head of the Security Council.   Since then, almost everyone who has raised questions about these  bombings or has attempted to investigate the cause of these bombings  has been kicked out of Russia, imprisoned, or murdered.   Those are the facts. That is who Putin is.   During his more than two decades of ruling Russia, Putin has  displayed a callous disregard for human life. He has engaged in  murderous attacks on his political opposition.   In 2004, the Putin regime poisoned Ukrainian Presidential candidate  Viktor Yushchenko.   In 2006, there was the polonium killing in London of Alexander  Litvinenko, a defector from Russia.   In 2009, Sergei Magnitsky was taken into police custody, beaten,  deprived of medical care, and he died in jail.   In 2013, Boris Berezovsky was found in his home in the United Kingdom  dead. Berezovsky had long been a critic of Putin, accused the Kremlin  of orchestrating the killing of Alexander Litvinenko, who had been  poisoned in 2006.   In 2015, Boris Nemtsov was shot four times in the back just a short  distance from the Kremlin. He was another critic of Putin.   And in 2017, the world was horrified by the daylight shooting of  Denis Voronenkov, who was murdered in Kyiv after renouncing his Russian  citizenship and criticizing Vladimir Putin. That is the truth of  Putin's brutality.    And how was he poisoned?    Is there any disagreement on the intelligence that this is  what occurred at the hands of Vladimir Putin's orders?    Right.    Yes.    That is exactly right. And I want to take 1 minute because  it merits repeating because we are sitting here in the United States of  America in the protection of our great Republic miles away from what is  happening in Ukraine, and it bears repeating that there are two million  Ukrainians right now fleeing Ukraine, fleeing their homes. We  fortunately haven't had to experience that sort of thing.   But two million people right now are fleeing their homes, dads and  husbands staying behind in Ukraine, families fleeing, seeking shelter,  thousands killed, we don't know how many, children killed, billions of  dollars of damage, destroying crops, destroying infrastructure, taking  over nuclear power plants.   And I just got a text, literally as I am standing here, from my  friends in Austin, Texas--from the wife whose husband is currently now  in Ukraine trying to help people--talking about the orphanage I talked  about in northern Kyiv. She says 51 kids are trapped; 51 kids trapped.   Do you have kids? People around here, many of us have kids. Fifty-one  kids trapped after orphanage bombed and director killed. The director  of the orphanage was killed. Running out of food. No heat or  electricity. Cold front coming. Will freeze or starve if we can't get  there soon. Fifteen infants. Special needs kids. Currently shelling of  all civilian targets being perpetrated and carried out by Putin. The  same Putin that killed a Ukrainian leader with nuclear poisoning.   This from my friend: We are pleading for someone to help us get to  the children before it is too late. And we are trying. Anybody out  there watching, we are trying to figure out how to get to this  orphanage and get them to people who can help. But that is the product  of Vladimir Putin. And if you are watching this, and if you are in  Russia or if this clip gets to you and it isn't cut off by Putin and  his thug leadership in Russia, this is the truth of Vladimir Putin.  This is what he is doing to innocent people.   And he is lying to you that these children are being put up as  somehow being a front and being put up to be put in harm's way. He is  indiscriminately bombing. He is the cause of these children being in  danger. He is the cause of this murder. He is the cause of thousands of  people getting killed, millions getting displaced, billions in damage,  and it is all because he is a thug and an autocrat, who is going after  and killing innocent people.                                time  2140     Madam Speaker, well, I appreciate my friend from Colorado's  question. And I would note in your comparison as to our experience as  Federal prosecutors, that there is no entity that is able to hold him  to account in Russia because he is running the whole show as a  dictator, and there is no free press.   In our country--as bad as the press can be--we at least hope that we  can get the truth out through the vestiges of the First Amendment and  the importance of the free press, no matter who is in the White House.  Right?    Neither you nor I shied away from criticizing the former  President of the United States, despite the fact he had an ``R'' after  his name. Nor will we shy away from criticizing this President who has  a ``D'' after his name. Why? Because we are Article I, and he is  Article II.   And the Founders gave us a free press to say we are going to have the  press holding all of us to account, and the separation of power so we  can hold the President to account. There is none of that here.    And the most important thing that we can do, in my opinion,  is do what we are doing right here. And I hope all my colleagues will  do this. And I hope everybody will unite. And I hope the American free  press will unite, and the worldwide free press will unite, to call this  out for what it is--a war criminal killing innocents for sheer power  and for sheer determination of what he wants for his own agenda, not  for any kind of honorable reasons in defending his homeland.   Whatever he is telling you and the people of Russia that this is  somehow an honorable defense of Russia, it is not. He is lying to you.  He is killing innocent people in the name of your homeland. And you  need to know that. And you need to know the truth. And you need to see  what he is doing to people.   And we, in this country, need to continue to do more. And I know we  are here to talk about Putin, and we are here to talk about this  situation of holding him accountable. And I don't want to get too  partisan here, but our country should have been doing more sooner.   We should have been listening to Zelensky. I have heard a whole lot  of applause lately for Zelensky from my  [[Page H1370]]  colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But where were we last July  when he was asking for help with sanctions?   Where were my colleagues on the other side of the aisle when my  former boss and my friend, Senator Ted Cruz, forced a vote in the  Senate on Nord Stream 2?   MIA. Partisan vote: We are not going to continue sanctions on Nord  Stream 2. We are going to go along with Biden's decision to stop  sanctions on Nord Stream 2.   Well, what do you think happens when you allow Putin and Russia to  have a complete control of the energy supply of Europe?   What do you think is going to happen when you empower a thug and a  dictator? What do you think is going to happen?   And right now today, we have a complete refusal by my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, and frankly, too many colleagues on my  side of the aisle, who refuse to say that we are, today, going to open  up American energy, liquefied natural gas, oil, and produce it in this  country to ensure that this man doesn't have the power to do what he is  doing in Ukraine.    How has the lawless authoritarian managed to regain his  power? Well, I will tell you. Europe made themselves completely  dependent on Russian energy.   And if you want a wake-up call and you want a warning shot in this  country, Russia controls 40 percent of the EU's natural gas and 30  percent of its oil. Germany buys more gas from Russia than any other  country.   They chose this. They chose fracking bans. They chose to shut down  energy freedom in Western Europe. They chose to pursue a political  climate ideology over national security and commonsense and energy for  their citizenry. And now, they are beholden to Russia. And now, we have  empowered Russia.   This stuff matters. Wars have been fought over these kinds of things,  and we just empowered an autocrat to roll over the people of Ukraine  because of the leadership of the Democrats on the other side of the  aisle. And the people in this White House are pursuing climate ideology  over national security; climate ideology over energy freedom; climate  ideology over affordable gas; and the ability for the American people  to thrive while empowering the people of Ukraine instead of a thug like  Putin.    You are exactly right. And tomorrow, we are going to be  voting on a number of things. I got to be honest with you. I am  sickened at what we are doing in this body. Instead of debating and  voting here and having a serious discussion about how we should spend  our assets to support Ukraine but be sensible about what we are doing  in policies here, we are going to have a vote on banning Russian oil.   What good does it do to ban Russian oil if you are going to buy it  from Venezuela or Iran?                                time  2150    Why don't we produce it here in the United States? It is cleaner and  it is better. We should be doing that right here. Instead, we are not  going to do that.   I am going to turn it back over because I think it is about time to  close.    Madam Speaker, I just want to remind everyone that 51 kids  are trapped after an orphanage is bombed and the director is killed. No  heat or electricity. Cold front coming. That is Putin's Ukraine. We  should be helping these people.
