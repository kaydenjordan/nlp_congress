 Mr. President, I wish to oppose the resolution of  disapproval on the stream protection rule. Each Congress has an  opportunity to promote having cleaner air and cleaner water. Our job  description shouldn't include hollowing out the protections for clean  air and clean water which previous Congresses have provided.   Clean air and clean water are vital not just to human health and the  environment, but to our economy as well. The number of premature deaths  due to poor water quality affects our economy. The number of school or  work days missed due to health problems affects our economy. The  ability of industries to have access to clean water affects our  economy.   Like many of my colleagues, I am proud to represent part of  Appalachia, in the western part of Maryland. I have enjoyed skiing,  hiking, and simply enjoying one of the most beautiful places in our  country. Recreational activities along the Appalachian Mountains depend  upon clean air and clean water. And recreation is a huge part of  expanding economic opportunities in Appalachia.   Over the years, I have met with many people directly affected by the  mining practice known as mountaintop removal, and I have worked very  hard to address their concerns in a bipartisan manner. For instance, in  the 111th Congress, I introduced S. 696, the Appalachia Restoration  Act, with the senior Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, to help  protect streams and rivers.   The stream protection rule updates 33-year-old regulations to  implement the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The update  establishes clear requirements for responsible surface coal mining that  will protect 6,000  [[Page S625]]  miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests over the next two decades,  preserving community health and economic opportunities, while meeting  the Nation's energy needs.   The stream protection rule includes reasonable and straightforward  reforms to revise three-decades-old coal mining regulations to avoid or  minimize harmful impacts on surface water, groundwater, fish, wildlife,  and other natural resources. There are a number of very positive,  reasonable, and economically feasible changes in the proposed stream  protection rule that make it an improvement over the existing  regulations.   The rule incorporates the best available science, technology, and  modern mining practices to safeguard communities from the long-term  effects of pollution and environmental degradation that endanger public  health and undermine future economic opportunities for affected  communities.   The final Rule gives regulators more tools to measure whether a mine  is designed to prevent damage to streams outside the permit area.   The rule would require companies to avoid mining practices that  permanently pollute streams, destroy drinking water sources, increase  flood risk, and threaten forests.   It would also require companies to restore streams and return mined  areas to the uses they were capable of supporting prior to mining  activities and replant these areas with native trees and vegetation,  unless that would conflict with the implemented land use.   To help mining companies meet these objectives, the rule requires  testing and monitoring the condition of streams that might be affected  by mining before, during, and after their operations to provide  baseline data that ensures operators can detect and correct problems  and restore mined areas to their previous condition.   Using the Congressional Review Act, CRA, to attack a rule that  protects people and communities from harmful impacts of irresponsible  coal mining operations, such as buried streams, floods, and subsidence,  will benefit coal companies that cut corners at the expense of the  people who live in Appalachia. And if the resolution is passed,  agencies will be prohibited from promulgating any other ``similar''  rule, unless Congress passes enabling legislation.   Opponents of the rule call it a ``job killer.'' That is myth. The  regulatory impact analysis, RIA, for the rule estimates that, overall,  employment will increase by an average of 156 full-time jobs. According  to the RIA, the rule will create more than twice as many jobs as it  will eliminate by requiring operators to perform more duties for  reclamation, including stream monitoring. Likewise, the impact on an  average household's monthly electricity bill is slight: just 20 cents  per month.   Coal miners and their families need jobs, and they need clean water.  The two aren't mutually exclusive. What they don't need is this attempt  to gut a reasonable rule designed to protect them from an environmental  disaster, which is much more likely to occur if the Senate passes this  resolution of disapproval.    Mr. President, let me thank Senator Leahy for his  comments. Ten years ago, I was privileged to be elected by the people  of Maryland to represent them in the U.S. Senate. I came to the Senate  with Senator Brown at that time. It was our first year. Senator Brown  had the opportunity to serve on the Banking Committee. I had the  opportunity to serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Today I  hold the position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that  Senator Lugar held when I first went on the committee; that is, the  ranking member of the committee.   I remember one of the very first hearings we had in the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee on resource, curse or blessing. It was a  matter of concern to every single member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, Democrats and Republicans. We saw the faces of  people from nations in Africa who had a resource wealth, but they had  the resource curse. The people were living in horrible poverty. Yet the  country had mineral wealth--gas and oil--that was being exploited but  not for the benefit of the people. It was being used to obtain income  for their leaders to funnel corrupt practices. Senator Lugar, in  October of 2008, authored a committee report of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee entitled ``The Petroleum And Poverty Paradox:  Assessing U.S. And International Community Efforts To Fight The  Resource Curse.''   We went through the regular legislative process as to how we could  deal with the circumstance that we knew the United States must exercise  leadership. As Senator Brown has pointed out the whole history and the  importance of it--and all of the details--I just want to fill in some  of the details as to how this came about because we were looking for a  way in which we could turn the wealth of a nation to its people and cut  off the corruption that it funded. The corruption was not just the  obscenity of wealth being used by their leaders--as Senator Brown  pointed out in Equatorial Guinea--it was also the fact that this wealth  that was coming to these leaders was also being used for criminal  activities, to finance illegal drug activities and to finance  terrorism.   I take issue with my friend from Oklahoma and his comments. There has  never been an effort in this legislation to affect the supply of any  source of energy here or anywhere around the world. That is being done.  The question is, Where does the money go that is being used to exploit  these resources? Do they go to the people of the country where the  resource is located or do they go for corruption? That is what we  attempted to do--Senator Lugar and I and others. I thank Senators Leahy  and Durbin, who was on the floor earlier and was one of our early  leaders, Senators Menendez and Wicker. We did this not only in the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time I was chairman of the  Senate U.S. Helsinki Commission--the Helsinki Commission, and Senator  Wicker was helping, we worked in that organization to see how we could  deal with transparency and how the American leadership could help the  international effort to end the resource curse. As a result,  legislation was authored and introduced in order to try to deal with  this issue. Senator Lugar and I authored a bill, a bill that said we  want to know where the money is going so we can track the money. We  wanted to be able, for the people of that nation, to say: We know money  is coming in now. Our leaders show us where the money is going.   That legislation was introduced. It was debated. It became part of  the Dodd-Frank law. Quite frankly, it was supported in a rather  bipartisan way, and it became law. Ever since its enactment, it has  been fought by the American Petroleum Institute. I am not sure why  because today other countries have adopted similar standards. This  information is readily available as far as the way it is compiled by  companies. Many oil and mineral companies today are supplying this  information with no complaints, no problems, but it was fought.   Tonight we are debating the use of the Congressional Review Act. It  was pointed out earlier tonight that before today, it only had been  used once since its 1996 enactment. The reason is because it is a  sledgehammer approach to dealing with issues that should be dealt with  by a scalpel, but here is the real abuse. We are using the  Congressional Review Act--which is supposed to be used when an agency  goes rogue, when they start to do things that were never intended by  Congress, were never authorized by Congress. Section 1504 was passed by  Congress, and it has taken the SEC almost a decade to get the rules  out. And we are saying they abused their power? Maybe they abused their  power by delay, but they certainly haven't abused their power with what  they have come forward with. They are carrying out congressional  mandate as they should. It was never the intent of the CRA to be used  for this type of a process. So I just urge my colleagues to recognize  that this is not the right way we should be proceeding.    In September 2009, with Senator Lugar's help, I introduced  legislation. It was bipartisan. Senators Merkley, Wicker, Schumer,  Leahy, Durbin, Feinstein, Menendez, and others joined in that effort.  The SEC was directed to develop rules on oil, gas, and mining companies  as to how the disclosures could be made on the U.S. stock exchange so  they could disclose their rights and payments made to foreign  governments. That is what we mandated. Why do we want to know that?  Because these royalties and payments were basically bribes to  government leaders because it never went to the people. It was in the  U.S. interest, not only because of how those funds were used against  our principles and not only did it finance illegal activities, but it  could have been a source for stable governments, which was important  for U.S. interests that we have stable governments. It helps us in our  foreign policy and national security. It also gives us a stable source  of oil, gas, and minerals. Investors have the right to know. They have  the right to know in what countries their companies are investing their  stockholder investments.   It was a reasonable request by Congress. One of my colleagues  indicated that it was held to be inappropriate by our courts. That was  on a process issue. It was not on a substantive issue. That  [[Page S640]]  was corrected. A new rule has come out, and now we are using a CRA in  order to block it. The rule, as it is currently worded, provides for a  reasonable period for enforcement. So it is not even going into effect  immediately because we are allowing the companies to have ample time in  order to comply with the rule.   I just want to make this point. It creates a level playing field. It  does not put American companies at a disadvantage. This is a level  playing field. Thirty countries already require this. The EU requires  this. Canada requires this. Do you want to know why they did it?  Because the United States led. We passed the law. I met with the  Europeans. I met with the Canadians. They said: This is a good bill.  You are our leaders. You are doing it. We are going to do it also so  they did it. It is in effect in these countries. Oil companies and  mineral companies have complied with it. They are fine. Guess what. It  wasn't difficult. Shell, BP, France's Total, Russian's Rosneft, Lukoil,  Gazprom--their huge giant--all have reported. It has not caused any  competitive problems. They are not losing any proprietary rights, as  has been suggested. There has been no harm done.   When I listen to the cost-benefit analysis and listen to our  distinguished chairman talk about the data is not really available, the  reason the data is not available is because we don't have disclosure.  If we get the information, then we will be able to tell exactly how we  can deal with the problems in Ghana or Nigeria or in Equatorial Guinea  or problems in so many countries where the people are hurting with some  of the worst poverty rates in the world. We will be able to find that  information out, but if we don't know what is being paid by U.S.  companies, how do you do a cost-benefit analysis? I don't know how you  could possibly do it.   I heard the numbers, the cost of compliance, and I would challenge  that. I would challenge the cost of compliance numbers because this  information is already available. Companies know where their money is  going. It is a normal business issue. I heard it is going to cost  hundreds of millions of dollars of contracts. I don't want to minimize  the cost, but as a percentage of the business they are doing, it is  minor. The benefit we get if the money can go to the people and deal  with these horrible conditions that we see in these resource-wealthy  countries, then it is certainly worth the effort. That is part of our  effort in dealing with other countries, to try to lift up the standard  of living in so many of these countries.   So when we look at, again, what is at stake--what is at stake? And  that is to allow the wealth of a country to go to its people for its  stability. I have heard my colleagues say: Well, we are not against  this. The law is still there. All we are talking about is this  regulation. Once we pass this CRA, we are going to go back to work with  the SEC and bring in a new rule. Do you really believe that? Do you  really believe that if we pass this CRA, that we are going to see a new  rule come out of the SEC? It has taken us 9 years to get to where we  are right now. Do you really believe that with the law saying that the  SEC cannot bring out a rule that is substantially the same in form,  unless authorized by a subsequent law of Congress--do you really  believe that will not be challenged in the courts with lengthy  litigation before we will ever see another rule take effect?   Let us be clear about this. I am going to continue to do everything I  can to make sure that the people of these nations get the wealth of  their country. I am going to do everything I can. I am going to work  with all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I really do believe  in the sincerity of my colleagues, that they believe in this  transparency. It is going to be tested. I am going to come back and see  where we can make sure that 1504 is enforced because if I heard my  chairman--and I respect him greatly, we work on a lot of issues  together--when the chairman says that he is going to make sure the SEC  complies with all congressional mandates--this is a congressional  mandate--and it is our responsibility to make sure the SEC complies  with Section 1504. If our colleagues pass this CRA--and I hope you  don't--it is our responsibility to make sure the SEC complies with  1504. I am going to be here urging in every way I can to make sure that  happens.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement from  Publish What You Pay, which talks about a lot of the different aspects  and myths that have been said, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Publish What You Pay United States       Myth Busting: The Truth About the Cardin-Lugar Anti-Corruption                                 Provision         The Cardin-Lugar Provision requires US-listed oil, gas and       mining companies to publicly disclose the project-level       payments they made to the U.S. and foreign governments for       the extraction of oil, gas and minerals.        The Cardin-Lugar provision is a landmark piece of       bipartisan legislation. The final anticorruption rule       implementing the Cardin-Lugar provision passed by the SEC in       June 2016 significantly advances international efforts to       curb corruption and has been applauded by investors,       companies and governments around the world. However, a great       deal of misinformation has been spread about the rule. Below       you will find evidence correcting the most glaring       inaccuracies put forward.        But before getting into the myths, here are some hard       facts.        Research concludes that increased transparency resulting       from the disclosures required by the Cardin-Lugar Rule could       lower the cost of capital for covered companies by $6.3       billion to $12.6 billion.        The international norm of resource sector payment       transparency, built on strong American leadership, is       estimated to have increased predicted global GDP by $1.1       trillion.        Investors representing nearly $10 trillion in assets under       management support of the Cardin-Lugar Rule.        Between 2011-2014 conflict linked to corruption in Libya       led to five U.S.-listed companies missing out on an estimated       $17.4 billion due to production disruptions.        Myth 1: Compliance costs for disclosure could reach as high       as $591 million per year.        Facts: The only comprehensive cost analysis submitted to       the SEC concluded that the total aggregate compliance cost to       industry in the first year would amount to $181M and would       not exceed $74 million per annum in subsequent years.        The $591 million number comes from an outdated SEC estimate       from the 2012 version of the final rule. The reason the       number is so high is because API claimed that there were       countries that prohibited disclosure and if companies were       forced to disclose they would have to hold a `fire-sale' of       all of their assets in that country--this number comes from       the assumption that every company would lose their assets in       these countries where disclosure was supposedly prohibited.       It is (1) disingenuous to quote this cost estimate from the       2012 regulation, instead of quoting form the 2016 regulation,       and (2) irrelevant because the SEC now allows for companies       to apply for an exemption if they believe disclosure is       prohibited in a country, therefore the above estimate is       wildly inaccurate.        Myth 2: U.S. companies are at a competitive disadvantage       because non-U.S. companies do not have to make the same       disclosures, and the rule applies only to public companies.        Facts: The U.S. law covers all oil, gas and mining       companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges not simply companies       based in the United States. Thus, the rule covers all       companies filing an annual report with the SEC both foreign       and domestic. This includes foreign oil majors BP, Shell, and       Total as well as leading state-owned oil companies from China       and Brazil, such as PetroChina and Petrobras. But a       significant number of foreign companies are already required       to make the same type of disclosures under the rules in other       jurisdictions.        Since the passage of Cardin-Lugar in 2010, important U.S.       allies have followed our leadership in payment transparency       and now 30 countries have adopted their own mandatory       disclosure rules for companies listed on their stock       exchanges. And while in many ways, the Canadian and EU       requirements are more stringent (and also cover private       companies), the laws in all jurisdictions have been deemed       equivalent by the SEC. Companies are allowed to submit the       same reports in all jurisdictions. These laws already cover       the vast majority of companies that compete with American       firms including Russia's state-owned companies, Gazprom and       Rosneft which are required to report in the UK.        Myth 3: The SEC rule is burdensome.        Facts: The Cardin-Lugar Provision is a reporting       requirement, which is not onerous and does not limit the       operations of oil, gas, and mining companies; the rule simply       requires companies to publicly report payments that companies       would track in the normal course of doing business The rule       is a straightforward requirement to make that data       transparent and usable by investors and citizens. Leading       global oil and mining majors such as Shell, BP and Total,       along with Russian state-owned companies, are entering their       second year of reporting under EU rules without any negative       impact or reported issue. In fact, many major companies have       publicly endorsed this type of reporting  [[Page S641]]       and have called on the U.S. to ensure our rules are       harmonized with those other markets.        Myth 4: The rule requires companies to disclose proprietary       information that could help foreign competitors.        Facts: The SEC rule requires companies to disclose payment       information; it does not mandate the disclosure of       proprietary, confidential or commercially sensitive       information by companies. Numerous companies are already       reporting under the similar rules in other markets, such as       Shell and BP, and none have reported any competitive harm       from payment transparency. However, the SEC's rule       nonetheless contains safeguards. To the extent a company       legitimately believes that disclosure will risk exposing       proprietary information, they can apply to the SEC for       exemptive relief on a case-by-case basis.        Furthermore, a competitor cannot use payment data to       ``reverse engineer'' a company's return on investment or the       contract terms of a specific project. Complex factors such as       access to technology and finance determine a company's       success in winning bids with host governments--not       transparency of payments. Extractive companies that are       covered by payment disclosure requirements in other       jurisdictions have continued to win bids.        Myth 5: This rule was not properly vetted by Congress.        Facts: The Cardin-Lugar Amendment enjoyed bipartisan       support and was subject to extensive review in both the House       and Senate, and it was unanimously supported in conference.       It is based on underlying legislation with a long       Congressional history that was the subject of multiple       hearings in both the House and Senate. In fact, the first       precursor was a Republican House resolution on oil and mining       transparency from 2006. For this reason, propositions to       repeal the rule signify an inappropriate use of the CRA. The       intent of the CRA is to address midnight rules, not rules       like 1504 that have undergone years of extensive regulatory       development.        Myth 6: The SEC rule will cause companies to lose out on       foreign contracts.        Facts: Opponents of the Cardin-Lugar anti-corruption       provision have claimed that companies could be placing       themselves at odds with legal or contractual prohibitions on       reporting in countries like Angola, China, Qatar, and       Cameroon and may subsequently lose out on business in those       countries due to the transparency rule. In the six years       since this law was passed, no company has produced evidence       that any country prohibits this type of disclosure, and       numerous submissions to the SEC have demonstrated no such       prohibitions exist. The experience of companies already       reporting under the parallel disclosure rules in other       countries likewise confirms the absence of any prohibition on       reporting; companies like BP and Shell have disclosed       project-level payments made in Angola, China, and Qatar with       no repercussions. Nor have these companies lost out on bids       because of payment disclosure requirements. Nonetheless, the       Cardin-Lugar provision contains safeguards to ensure that       companies that face a legitimate problem can apply for an       exemption from disclosure on a case by case basis.        Myth 7: The Cardin-Lugar provision has nothing to do with       the SEC or investors.        Facts: It is important to note that the SEC extractives       transparency rule is not a case of agency overreach. Congress       specifically mandated the SEC issue this rule in Section 1504       of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, and by issuing the 2016 rule the       SEC complied with the will of Congress. Both Senator Cardin       and Senator Lugar, the original sponsors of the bill, along       with Senators Leahy, Durbin, Brown, Warren, Baldwin, Markey,       Coons, Shaheen, Whitehouse, Menendez and Merkley, expressed       explicit support for the SEC's interpretation of Section 1504       during the rulemaking process.        The rule has significant benefits for investors. Throughout       the rulemaking process, investors worth nearly $10 trillion       of assets under management repeatedly emphasized their       support for payment disclosures under the rule. The rule       provides investors with critical information for assessing       risk in the often murky and unstable oil, gas and mining       sectors, with positive follow-on impacts for firms that       benefit from increased investor confidence and certainty. The       increased transparency resulting from this provision has been       estimated to lower the cost of capital for covered U.S.-      listed firms by $6.3 billion to $12.6 billion.        Myth 8: We don't need Cardin-Lugar because we have the       Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.        Facts: While the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)       remains an important statutory tool critical to fighting       global corruption, its scope is confined to bribery. Bribery       is only one tool used to facilitate corruption. All too       often, it is the legal payments made to governments that are       misused, or siphoned off to the bank accounts of a country's       corrupt elites. However, the fact that companies are already       subject to the FCPA does mean the burden of reporting       payments to comply with the Cardin-Lugar rule is minimal;       companies are already required to collect and track payment       information as part of the books and records provision of the       FCPA. In this way, the two laws work very well together in       creating a strong regulatory foundation to prevent       corruption.        Myth 9: This rule is the same as the one sent back to be       revised by the courts in 2013 and did not incorporate the       Court's or industry concerns.        Facts: The American Petroleum Institute filed suit to       challenge the original rule issued by the SEC in 2012,       despite its largest member companies claiming to support       transparency. The earlier version of the rule was vacated by       the court and sent back to the SEC in 2013 on narrow       procedural grounds, not on the substance of the rule. Since       then, the SEC has had another two years of public       consultations and internal analysis, resulting in an even       more robust record with substantial evidence supporting each       aspect of the 2016 rule. That evidence also includes the       experience of companies already reporting on their payments       under similar rules in other jurisdictions. The SEC's final       rule strikes an appropriate balance by requiring the level of       transparency Congress intended, while also accommodating       industry concerns by providing companies with the opportunity       to apply for case-by-case exemptions when they face reporting       challenges and a generous phase-in period. Reporting will       only begin at the end of 2018.        Myth 10: Sections 1504 (extractives transparency) and 1502       (conflict minerals) are the same thing/substantially similar.        Facts: Section 1504 requires U.S.-listed oil and mining       companies to annually disclose the company's major payments       made to the U.S. and foreign governments. It is simply a       financial disclosure of payments companies already track.        Section 1502 mandates that a certain set of companies using       tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold in their products undertake       supply chain due diligence and report annually to the SEC       regarding the source of the minerals used in their products       and whether the minerals are sourced in conflict areas in the       Democratic Republic of Congo.        Myth 11: The Cardin-Lugar rule poses a security risk for       American companies and their employees working abroad.        Facts: There is no evidence justifying the claims that the       Cardin-Lugar rule would have any negative impacts on       security. In fact, all available evidence points to the       contrary. The United Steelworkers explicitly argue that the       Cardin Lugar anti-corruption rule will enhance employee       safety. Generally, 1504 helps protect U.S. national security       interests by preventing the corruption, secrecy, and       government abuse that has catalyzed conflict, instability,       and violent extremist movements in Africa, the Middle East       and beyond. As ISIS demonstrated, non-state actors can       benefit from trading natural resources in order to finance       their operations; project level reporting will make hiding       imports from non-state actors more difficult, thereby       limiting their ability finance themselves with natural       resource revenues.        Myth 12: This law increases prices at the pump and takes       capital away from other business opportunities.        Facts: All of the data suggests that transparency actually       helps company balance sheets by lowering the cost of capital       and increasing investor confidence. On the other hand,       corruption costs oil and mining companies millions of dollars       every year from instability and fragility in resource-rich       countries, which contributes to increased operating risks,       waste, inefficiency, and delays. For instance, between 2011       and 2014, the conflict in Libya fueled in part by citizens'       frustration with corruption and poor governance caused five       U.S.-listed oil companies to miss out on more than $17       billion in revenues due to production disruptions in the       country.     Let me conclude, for years, Congress has been fighting to  shine a light on the billions of dollars paid by extracted companies to  foreign governments. By taking away one of the only tools we have to  shine a light on extracted payments' associated corruption, we are  sending a message to corrupt leaders around the world that the United  States does not care about corruption; that we won't hold them  accountable, and that they should continue with business as usual:  Exploiting their own people, and perhaps even funding terrorist  organizations with some of their secret proceeds. It is not in our  national interest to stop an anticorruption rule that bolsters  America's national security, advances our humanitarian and  anticorruption goals, and demonstrates U.S. moral leadership.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this resolution of  disapproval.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch
