 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the 2  million lives saved by the Hyde amendment.   For decades, Presidents of both parties, including Presidents Clinton  and Obama, have worked across the aisle to include the Hyde amendment  in the Federal budget, which is a temporary protection barring the use  of taxpayer funds to pay for abortions.   However, this year, while calling for unity, the President is pushing  for a $6 trillion budget with no protections for the unborn or for the  taxpayer who will foot the bill. This is an action where everyone  loses.   Instead of callously endangering the lives of millions of women and  children at taxpayer expense, we should be fighting tooth and nail for  their protections.   By making the Hyde amendment permanent, that is exactly what H.R. 18  will do.   That is why I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy and  Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 18 and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.
