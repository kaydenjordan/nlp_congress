 Mr. Speaker, as President Donald Trump  is set to make an announcement this afternoon regarding the failed  nuclear agreement with Iran, I want to again express my continued  opposition to this deal and thank President Trump for his  determination.   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has revealed compelling revelations  in the last week of Iranian duplicity. This was a reckless and  dangerous deal from the start. It never served the interests of  American families, and it continues to threaten the safety and security  of our allies, especially Israel.   In just 7 years, there will be nothing stopping the Iranian  dictatorship from constructing nuclear weapons as they chant ``death to  Israel, death to America'' while they oppress the Iranian people.   In addition, President Obama authorized a cash ransom of $1.7 billion  to Iran to release five innocent Americans. This deal promoted Iran's  monetary support for terrorist groups Hezbollah, Hamas, and militias  that plant IEDs to murder Americans.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
