 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for the  House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator Kaine to the  House managers:    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S702, January 30, 2020, third column, the following  appears: The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator  KAINE for the House Managers:      The online Record has been corrected to read: The CHIEF JUSTICE.  Thank you. The question from Senator KAINE to the House Managers:    ========================= END NOTE =========================            If the Senate acquits the President on article II, after he       violated both the Impoundment Control Act and the       Whistleblower Act to hide the Ukraine scheme from Congress,       what is to stop President Trump from complete refusal to       cooperate with Congress on any matter?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, in short, the consequence is  there is no constraint on this President or any other. This gets to a  point--you have heard counsel for the President repeat over and over:  Can you be impeached for asserting privileges--and, I would add, no  matter how bogus or in bad faith those assertions may be, no matter  whether they are in court today arguing the opposite of what they are  arguing before you today?   And the answer is, yes, the President can be impeached for using the  assertion of baseless claims to cover up his misconduct.   The House did not impeach the President over a single assertion of  privilege. We impeached him for a far more fundamental reason: because  he issued an order categorically directing the executive branch to defy  every single  [[Page S703]]  part of every single subpoena served by the House.   A President who issues orders like this is a President who can place  himself above the law and a system of checks and balances. He can do  whatever he wants and get away with it by using his powers to  orchestrate a massive coverup. The President's lawyers haven't disputed  that point. They can't. It is obvious that a President who ignores and  can ignore all oversight is a threat to the American people.   Instead, they have argued assertion of a grab bag of legal privileges  warranting this categorical defiance. These arguments are unprecedented  and wrong.   The first thing to note is the President's arguments conveniently  ignore the October 8 letter sent at the President's behest declaring  that the President will not ``participate'' in the impeachment  investigation.   I will not participate. This blanket defiance preceded all of the  other letters and creative OLC opinions the President relied upon. It  made clear that the rationale for blanket defiance was the President's  belief that he can declare his own innocence and make it illegitimate  to investigate him. This was not about privileges or legal arguments.  Those came later, as his lawyers rushed to justify that Congress has no  power whatsoever to enforce subpoenas against anyone.   Let's be clear. They may claim that their October 8 letter where they  said they will not participate was somehow an offer to accommodate, but  what the real condition was, was that the House simply drop the  impeachment investigation or place the President in charge of its  direction. That wasn't a real offer. That was a poison pill.   Now, what about the remaining arguments? The first point is that none  of them justify his order to defy all the subpoenas. He never asserted  executive privilege over any documents, and his remaining arguments  that absolute immunity or agency counsel not being allowed to attend  depositions have nothing to do with documents--nothing. So none of his  legal arguments even applies to his direction that every single office  and agency defy every single subpoena for documents.   And what about the total obstruction of the witnesses? Here, too, he  never invoked executive privilege. Absolute immunity obviously couldn't  apply to many of the lower level officials we subpoenaed.   The only remaining legal ground for defiance was the argument it is  unconstitutional for Congress to prevent agency counsel from going to  depositions--the fallback of fallback of fallbacks--except this rule  was originally passed by a Republican Congress and has been used  repeatedly by both Republican- and Democratic-led majorities and  committees. It can't possibly justify obstruction of witness subpoenas.  It is nothing more than a phony cover for an obstruction that President  Trump decided upon at the outset.   These arguments are, thus, incorrect on their own terms and fail to  explain this categorical order.   One final irony, even before the argument in court today: At a recent  oral argument in the DC Circuit, they made the same claim they made  today. Let's pull up slide 56. In litigation, again, to enforce  subpoenas, the judge said they can make it grounds for impeachment for  obstruction of Congress. And the President's own lawyers said  impeachment is certainly one of the tools that Congress has. We agree;  it is one of the tools that you have for when a President would use a  categorical obstruction of investigation into his own wrongdoing.   It is a tool that should be applied here. There cannot be a better  case for impeachment on obstructing a coequal branch of Congress than  the one before you where the obstruction is so complete and so  categorical.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Florida.
