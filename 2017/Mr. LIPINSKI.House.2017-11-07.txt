 Mr. Speaker, yes, there is now uncertainty about the  definition of joint employer. This uncertainty has the potential to  undermine the franchise model, which has given so many Americans the  opportunity to own a business and create millions of jobs.   But this bill goes too far in narrowing the joint employer definition  and also applying it to the Fair Labor Standards Act. We need to ensure  that workers are treated fairly and companies are held accountable, but  I am afraid this bill could weaken that.  [[Page H8577]]    While I will be voting against this bill, it is important to  recognize that there is a real issue here. We need to find a  compromise. So no matter how we vote today, I urge my colleagues to  listen to the concerns of businessowners in their districts because  their success is critical to our long-term job growth.                                time  1730
