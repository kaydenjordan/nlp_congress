 Madam Speaker, Don Young of Alaska was a fixture in this  House. He was the kind of fixture that didn't just look pretty, because  that wasn't his thing. He added immeasurably to everything else here.   He and I have been on the Natural Resources Committee for years  together, ever since I have been here. Since I ticked off Republican  leaders over the years, I was not going to end up being the chairman,  so I got to sit by him for years. That has been a real pleasure.   He was a practical man and understood the contribution that he was  making, and it was truly a massive contribution to this country, to  Alaska, to the people of America. You never had to wonder where he  stood, and I loved that about him. He didn't pull punches. He told you  what he thought, and he didn't require a lot of words to do that.   His laugh was contagious, but so was his love for America. He  dedicated his life to making this a better place for all of us. He  loved Alaska, he loved Alaskan people, and if someone tried to tell him  that, gee, the Tribal folks in Alaska would be better off if you never  drilled, he wouldn't have any of it. He would get upset at that point,  tell them they didn't know. He had lived with those people, he had been  there, he knew.   Don Young was a survivor, and though we bid farewell to his remains  today, his spirit will survive as long as there is a Capitol.
