 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to honor a good friend and  a great leader in Shasta County, Sheriff Tom Bosenko, who served 40  years with the Shasta County Sheriff's Office, 14 years as sheriff.   He has worked in nearly every division of the sheriff's office,  including patrol operations, school resource officer, SWAT, antigang  enforcement, and the canine unit. Importantly, he was at the helm of  the sheriff's office when the historic Carr fire hit last year. I can't  thank him enough for keeping order and calm in directing people in a  positive fashion during that time.   Madam Speaker, he is a four-time recipient of the Best in the North  State's Best Elected Official award.   He has worn his badge with honor, never backing down from what needs  to be done and shouldering the burden of keeping the community safe. I  saw him everywhere I went during my time visiting around in the  district there. He is a community guy.   Madam Speaker, as a motorcycle lover, I think Tom will ride his  Harley-Davidson right into retirement. He is, in retirement, still a  fierce defender of our Second Amendment rights.   Madam Speaker, I thank Tom for his unwavering service to the  community, the people of the north State, and his example. He will be  missed, certainly, but I know his successor, Sheriff Eric Magrini, will  do well under Tom's tutelage. I appreciate him, and may God bless him.                            ____________________
