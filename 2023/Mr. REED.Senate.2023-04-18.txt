 Madam President, today I am introducing the Bank Management  Accountability Act along with Senator Grassley. This bipartisan bill  will make it easier for banking regulators to claw back compensation  from directors and senior executives at failed systemically important  banks and to ban those directors and executives from future  participation in the financial industry.   We have recently experienced the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and  Signature Bank, two systemically important banks each with assets  exceeding $100 billion. Executives at these banks received exorbitant  compensation as the banks took on excessive risks. The CEO of Silicon  Valley Bank received $10 million in compensation in 2022 and sold $3.5  million of company stock in the days before the failure. The CEO of  Signature Bank received $8.7 million in compensation in 2022 and sold  millions of dollars' worth of company stock in the weeks and months  before the failure.   The government declared the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and  Signature Bank a ``systemic risk'' to the economy and stepped in with  extraordinary backstops and emergency assistance, including protecting  uninsured depositors. While these actions prevented contagion from  spreading throughout  [[Page S1213]]  the financial system, these two failures are expected to cost the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's, FDIC's deposit insurance fund  over $20 billion and have required the Federal Reserve to extend over  $143 billion in credit to their successor banks. The FDIC needs  stronger tools to prevent directors and senior executives from  enriching themselves when their risky bets destabilize the financial  sector and saddle the American people with the costs.   The bipartisan bill we are introducing aims to update the FDIC's  outdated compensation clawback authority and weak financial industry  ban authority. This bill will make directors and senior executives  think twice before engaging in risky activities by allowing the FDIC to  claw back the prior 2 years of their compensation if their bank fails.  And to ensure that directors and senior executives cannot return to  another bank and place depositors' funds at risk again, the bill would  make it much easier for the FDIC to prohibit them from participating in  the affairs of any financial company for at least two years.   Under existing law, high standards of liability significantly  interfere with regulators' ability to seek restitution from directors  and officers of failed banks and bar them from the industry. After the  2008 financial crisis, Congress established much more powerful clawback  authority. But this tool is only available when the largest banks are  unwound using a special process called ``orderly liquidation  authority'' that the regulators have never used--even for the failures  of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. That is why directors and  senior executives at large banks rarely are subject to compensation  clawbacks and financial industry bans, even if they are negligent in  running their bank and the government ultimately needs to step in with  extraordinary backstops and emergency assistance.   Our bill would apply the easier rules for clawing back compensation  from Dodd-Frank's special ``orderly liquidation authority'' to a much  broader set of banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.  It would also specify that recouped funds may not be paid out of  directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage to make sure that  they have true personal liability and skin in the game. Finally, it  would lower the standard for barring directors and senior executives at  failed systemically important banks from the financial industry. These  updates would greatly enhance the banking regulators' ability to  recover funds for the benefit of the taxpayers, to protect depositors  from directors and senior executives who have already driven a bank  into failure, and to provide powerful disincentives against excessive  risk taking.   All of our constituents deserve strong bank regulators with the  necessary tools to go after executives and directors at banks whose  failures threaten the economy. The Bank Management Accountability Act  will enhance our regulators' authorities to demand meaningful  accountability from Wall Street and Silicon Valley, which in turn will  increase confidence in our financial system. I urge our colleagues to  support this important bipartisan legislation.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I am introducing the Bank Management  Accountability Act along with Senator Grassley.
