 Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to talk about an  exceptional young person from Mainland Regional High School in South  Jersey. Bradley Ferguson of Mainland Regional High School was recently  selected as a United States Presidential scholar.   The U.S. Presidential Scholars Program was founded in 1964. Since  1964, it has honored over 7,500 graduating high school seniors for  academic achievements and contributions to their communities.   One hundred and twenty-one U.S. Presidential Scholars are honored  annually for their academic excellence and their service. I am so  excited that Bradley is representing South Jersey with his great  achievement. All the young people being honored with this award are  proof that education brings forth excellence.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Bradley for his accomplishment. I can't  wait to see whatever his future is going to hold, but we all know that  he is going to achieve greatness.                            ____________________
