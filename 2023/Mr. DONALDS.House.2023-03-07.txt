 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and commend  Fort Myers' Southwest Florida International Airport, better known as  RSW, for being ranked the number one airport in the United States of  America, according to Travel Lens U.S.A. Airport Report.   As the Member of Congress that proudly represents RSW, I am excited  to stand here today to shine light on this distinct accolade within my  district. In 2022, RSW set a record for the total number of passengers,  despite the severe impact stemming from Hurricane Ian.   To be frank, there are many reasons why a record number of Americans  are visiting and moving to southwest Florida. The inherent beauty of  RSW speaks for itself--now imagine the stunning beauty throughout my  entire district.   I can confidently say that I have the most beautiful district in the  country and the best district overall, especially considering how many  Members come and visit my district.   Finally, I want to share a few quick statistics. The average wait  time at RSW is only 16 minutes. It is second in the Nation for the  lowest amount of carbon emissions per passenger. Number three, it has  the fourth highest passenger satisfaction rating in the United States  of America.   Once again, I congratulate RSW for receiving this great honor for  being ranked America's best airport.                            ____________________
