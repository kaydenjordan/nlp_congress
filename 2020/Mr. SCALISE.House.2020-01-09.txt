 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution. If you  look at what they are attempting to do, there has been a lot of talk  about the 2002 AUMF, Madam Speaker, and I am sure, as Congress has over  the years, we will continue to have a healthy debate over what that  proper role should be of Congress as it relates to the 2002 AUMF. But  that is not what this debate is about.   When you read the resolution, in fact, just by its own name, this is  not an act of Congress. This isn't even changing the law. So if you  want to have a sincere debate over what that power should be that  Congress gave to the executive branch, then let's have that debate. But  don't try to pass some fig leaf resolution that is only intended to try  to undermine the President in the middle of a conflict with the world's  largest state sponsor of terrorism, Iran.   There is no dispute about how bad of an evil terrorist Soleimani was,  yet here you hear all of these equivocations: Oh, Soleimani was bad  person but.   Madam Speaker, how can you sit here and try to apologize for the  things that he did by saying that taking him out was wrong?   This world is a safer place with Soleimani gone. If you want to  apologize to anybody, go apologize to the families of those hundreds of  men and women in our uniform who are dead at the hands of Soleimani,  not only the people whom he had already killed but the even more  Americans whom at the very time of his death he was plotting to kill.                                time  1600    How much is enough? At what point do we say: Take him off the face of  this planet so he can't kill more innocent people? That is what was  ultimately done.   We support President Trump in his efforts at keeping America safe,  just like we supported President Obama when he took out Osama bin  Laden, another evil terrorist who had the blood of thousands of  Americans on his hands.   If we are going to be serious about keeping this country safe,  absolutely,  [[Page H104]]  there is a role for Congress to play, but you have got to support the  efforts of your Commander in Chief to carry out his constitutional duty  which he has to keep this country safe.
