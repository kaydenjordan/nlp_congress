 Madam Speaker, I rise to offer amendment 22 as a  designee of Congressman Jamaal Bowman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I first want to offer my congratulations to the  chairwoman of the committee for this very, very important piece of  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise today as the designee of Congressman Jamaal  Bowman to offer this amendment. The climate crisis is the single  biggest threat facing humanity, and if we are going to address it at  the scale needed to limit global warming to not more than 1.5 degrees  Celsius, we are going to have to work together. We are going to need  unprecedented levels of global cooperation and collaboration to meet  everyone's basic needs, including food, clean water, and keeping the  communities we call home habitable.   At the same time, we increasingly rely upon sanctions as a key  foreign policy lever. The material impact of sanctions is known to  undermine the human rights of civilians who can get cut off from access  to basic needs, often the same basic needs that are threatened by the  very climate crisis, as we see increasingly more frequent extreme  weather events.   This amendment would simply require the State Department to issue a  report in coordination with the Department of Energy on the impact that  sanctions have on our ability to be innovative in addressing the  climate crisis and economic justice. This will give us important  information as we seek to create and craft sanctions or understand the  impact of sanctions and decide not to use them.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I don't really understand--and with tremendous respect  to my colleague across the aisle--how assigning a report so that we can  get more information about the effect of sanctions on the people of a  country undermines in any way anything that we are trying to do in this  bill. In fact, competitiveness is deeply tied to whether or not we  adhere to human rights values that the United States holds very dear.  And the question of how we can be most effective in our policy is very  important to this bill.   So I really don't understand why we wouldn't want the information  that a report is going to generate unless we are afraid that it is  going to present some choice that feels very difficult to us. So I am  not sure why there would be resistance to a report that says,  Department of Energy, in coordination with the State Department, tell  us what impact sanctions have on our ability to be innovative, one of  the key goals of this bill, in addressing the climate crisis and  economic justice.   Let's not disentangle competitiveness from justice. Let's not  disentangle competitiveness from our ability to uphold our core values  as a country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer an amendment to the  America COMPETES Act section 60501.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues  to vote for my amendment to section 60501 of the America COMPETES Act,  which asks the Treasury Department to study the growth of Chinese  Government influence and illicit finance in Afghanistan.   My amendment would also require the Treasury to examine the  humanitarian impact of U.S. sanctions in Afghanistan, projected  increases in civilian deaths and refugees, and the resulting effect on  additional Chinese Government influence in Afghanistan.  [[Page H933]]    Today's New York Times published a harrowing front-page article  headlined ``Over a Million Flee as Afghanistan's Economy Collapses,''  which reports that for millions already living hand to mouth, Western  sanctions have led to life-threatening hunger across the country as  incomes have dried up and humanitarian aid has been obstructed.   After our withdrawal from Afghanistan, U.S. sanctions on the Taliban  have impacted the broader functioning of the entire Afghan Government,  including schools and hospitals, which cannot buy food for patients or  gas to heat their buildings.   The New York Times reports that, according to aid organizations,  starvation could kill 1 million children this winter. These fatalities  could far exceed civilian deaths resulting from 20 years of war.   The United States has frozen $9.4 billion of the Afghan central  bank's foreign reserves, making it impossible for the country's  financial system to function and threatening to collapse the entire  economy.   U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has pleaded for ``increased  liquidity'' to ``free up frozen currency reserves and reengage  Afghanistan's central bank'' to ``pull the economy back from the  brink.''   Former Republican South Carolina Governor David Beasley, now the head  of the World Food Programme, similarly said that unless those Afghan  central bank funds are unfrozen, ``this country will absolutely  collapse.''   A senior official at the International Red Cross pointedly asked:  ``Can the international community hold 39 million people hostage to the  fact that they do not want to recognize the authorities that are now in  place in Kabul and in Afghanistan?''   If appeals from the world's leading humanitarian and aid  organizations on the devastating impacts of current U.S. policy do not  persuade my colleagues, I ask them to consider whether Afghanistan's  economic crisis will pose an opportunity for neighboring China to  expand its influence in the country.                                time  1315    For those seeking to better understand the Chinese Government's  influence in Afghanistan and the rise of illicit financial transactions  in the country, my amendment would ensure that we have this  information.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which simply requires  additional information on the impact of U.S. sanctions on Afghanistan's  migration, mortality, financial health, and influence from the Chinese  Government.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we join the American people in telling  the President that he did the right thing by finally ending this never- ending war in Afghanistan.   However, we can't abandon the country and its people. We have to make  sure we get aid to the people of Afghanistan in the wake of our 20-year  war there.   In addition to the moral urgency of reevaluating a set of economic  policies that threaten to harm untold Afghan civilians, including 1  million children, American policymakers deserve to have a complete and  comprehensive picture of what is occurring in Afghanistan, including an  honest understanding of our own actions, their human impacts, and their  political and economic effects.   We must not be afraid to connect the dots. Indeed, this is a pre- condition to changing U.S. policy when it contributes to outcomes that  contradict our own interests and our own values. Any report on  Afghanistan's financial picture would be gravely incomplete without  also examining current U.S. policies.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
