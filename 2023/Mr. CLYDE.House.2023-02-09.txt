 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky, Chairman  Comer, for yielding.   It is no secret that crime has beleaguered Washington, D.C., for  years. Yet, in the midst of rising crime rates in D.C., our Nation's  Capital is now on track to become even more dangerous.   The D.C. Council is advancing a severely misguided bill, the Revised  Criminal Code Act, to eliminate minimum sentences and reduce maximum  penalties for numerous violent criminal offenses.   This legislation isn't just reckless. It is radical. Washington's own  Democratic Mayor Bowser vetoed the legislation telling the council:  ``This bill does not make us safer.''   Well, for once, I agree with the Mayor because eliminating mandatory  minimum sentences for all crimes except first-degree murder,  eliminating life sentences, and reducing maximum penalties for violent  crimes including burglary, carjacking, and robberies will undoubtedly  embolden criminals and threaten the safety of both residents and  visitors here in Washington, D.C.   But ultimately, the D.C. Council ignored Mayor Bowser's valid  concerns and overrode her veto.   Many have asked why, as a Congressman from northeast Georgia, I am  leading the effort to block the D.C. Council's radical rewrite of  Washington's criminal code.   It is because I care, and I would expect and hope that everyone here  in this Chamber would care, too. Congress has the responsibility and  the authority to take this action.   Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution grants Congress  the authority to ``exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases  whatsoever, over such District.''   But we don't just have a constitutional obligation to stop this soft- on-crime bill from becoming law, we also have a moral obligation to  protect America's safety and security in our Nation's Capital City.   Just 2 days ago in his State of the Union Address, President Biden  said right here in this very Chamber: ``We have an obligation to make  sure all our people are safe,'' and adding: ``Public safety depends on  public trust.''   For once, I agree with the President because all Americans deserve to  visit our Nation's Capital without facing fear or violence, and all  Americans should be able to trust public officials to implement  policies that protect their safety and well-being.   Yet, under the D.C. Council's radical crime bill, residents, small  businesses, constituents, and our own staff here on Capitol Hill will  inevitably encounter additional danger and violence.   As the President delivered his State of the Union Address on Tuesday  night, there was a shooting blocks away in the Navy Yard and a stabbing  over in Georgetown.   Earlier this week on Capitol Hill, a Capitol Hill reporter's wheels  were stolen right off his car. The same crime happened to one of my  Democrat colleagues, Congresswoman Barragan, last month.   Just last week at the Potomac Avenue Metro station, a crazed criminal  shot and killed a 64-year-old Metro mechanic, Robert Cunningham, who  heroically attempted to stop the violent criminal from shooting a woman  nearby.   Clearly, crime after crime is on the rise here in D.C., yet the D.C.  Council's bill will only make matters worse.   Combating crime is not a conservative or a liberal objective. It is  not Republican or Democrat. It is simply a commonsense one. In fact, it  has been my honor to work with a local Democrat, Denise Krepp, who  formerly served as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner here in D.C.  For years Ms. Krepp pleaded with Democrats to be tough on crime for the  sake of the residents she served, yet she was routinely ignored.   In a letter sent to this very body in December--which I shall include  in the Record--she urged Congress to introduce a resolution of  disapproval to block the D.C. Council's Revised Criminal Code Act. It  is an effort I am honored to lead and an effort that I am proud the  House will pass today.   Because we must send a clear message to the Senate, to the White  House, and to the American people that the people's House rejects soft- on-crime policies that jeopardize Americans' safety and security, I  urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yea'' on my  commonsense resolution, H.J. Res. 26.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the December 12, 2022, letter  from Ms. Krepp.                                                 December 12, 2022.      Re. B24-0416--Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022.       Rep. Pelosi,      Washington, DC.      Rep. McCarthy,      Washington, DC.      Senator Schumer,      Washington, DC.      Senator McConnell,      Washington, DC.        Representative Pelosi, Representative McCarthy, Senator       Schumer, and Senator McConnell: My name is K. Denise Rucker       Krepp and I'm an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in       Washington, D.C. I'm writing to you today to ask that you       enact into law a joint resolution disapproving the Revised       Criminal Code Act of 2022 (RCCA). The bill hurts victims of       violent crime.        Currently, convicted rapists must serve their full prison       sentence. The RCCA creates a new right to petition for early       release from prison. The D.C. Councilmembers who drafted this       provision call it proportionate, balancing the interests of       victims and those who commit the crimes.        Rape is an irreversible crime. Victims don't get to rewind       the clock and as a locally elected D.C. official I       respectfully ask that you disapprove the bill, stopping it       from becoming law.        Additionally, I respectfully ask that you conduct oversight       over prosecutions of violent crimes occurring in Washington,       D.C. At a March 2022 meeting, the U.S. Attorney for the       District of Columbia told me that he didn't know what crimes       his office prosecutes each year and that it is unreasonable       for me to expect him to know this information.        I've been a locally unpaid, no staff elected official in       Washington, D.C. for eight years. Over this period of time,       I've tracked the murders, armed carjackings, assaults,       robberies, stabbings, shootings, and rape that have occurred       in my single member district. The U.S. Attorney for the       District of Columbia has staff and resources, and it's       reasonable for him to know what crimes his office  [[Page H787]]       prosecutes. Please ask him to do so and to share this       information with you and DC residents.        Thank you.                                            K. Denise Rucker Krepp,                                              ANC6B10 Commissioner.                                time  0930
