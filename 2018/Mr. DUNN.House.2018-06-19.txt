 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Panama City,  Florida, native Major General Patrick D. Sargent for assuming command  of the U.S. Army Health Readiness Center of Excellence at Fort Sam  Houston.   I had the pleasure of meeting General Sargent last year in  Washington. He has had a decorated Army career, serving our country for  more than three decades.   He grew up in Bay County and attended Florida State University before  joining the Army in 1985.   General Sargent is board certified in healthcare administration, and  he is a medevac pilot. He has been a leader in providing healthcare to  our troops for many years.   He was in charge of all medical care in Iraq as the Commander of the  Medical Task Force Iraq. In his own words, he has worked to bring  humanity to the battlefield, and I believe he will brilliantly continue  that work in his new post.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Major General Patrick  Sargent on his new posting.                            ____________________
