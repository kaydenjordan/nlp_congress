 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 1097, I call up the bill (H.R. 903) to enhance the security  operations of the Transportation Security Administration and stability  of the transportation security workforce by applying the personnel  system under title 5, United States Code, to employees of the  Transportation Security Administration who provide screening of all  passengers and property, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 903, the  Rights for the Transportation Security Administration Workforce Act.   This critical legislation will bring equity and improve working  conditions to the Transportation Security Administration by providing  better pay, expanded collective bargaining rights, and basic civil  service protection to the agency's workforce.   The essential employees of the TSA have continued to work throughout  the pandemic, never relenting in their mission to secure air travel  despite the risks to their health. They did so before the pandemic and  continue to do so now despite enduring two decades of low pay and a  lack of basic workplace rights enjoyed by most other Federal employees.   These shortcomings have led to low morale and high turnover impacting  TSA's ability to cultivate a mature workforce that can skillfully  combat the constantly evolving threats to our Nation's transportation  systems. In 2020, TSA ranked dead last on pay satisfaction as part of  the annual Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey.   In addition, the most recent analysis done on employee turnover at  TSA shows that over a 2-year span, one in three transportation security  officers, or TSOs, quit. That analysis also revealed that in a single  year, TSA spent approximately $16 million to hire and onboard nearly  2,000 people who left just months after they got the job. This  revolving door of recruiting, training, and then losing TSOs is  unsustainable and underscores the need to find a permanent solution  that will ensure TSA lives up to its critical national security  mission. H.R. 903 would permanently move TSA under title 5 of U.S. Code  and eliminate the existing personnel management system that is the  source of many of the problems I have enumerated.   This bill will result in better pay and regular salary increases for  workers who too often live paycheck to paycheck and experience long  paths to career advancement despite years on the job. Employees will  benefit from the same collective bargaining rights under H.R. 903 that  other Federal employees have, empowering them to collaborate with TSA  management to improve working conditions at the agency.   Employees who believe they have experienced wrongful discipline could  appeal their case to a neutral party to be heard, just as other Federal  employees are able to do. It would eliminate TSA leadership's ability  to abuse special personnel authorities in ways that have historically  benefited those at the top. In other words, Mr. Speaker, people at the  top get big raises but people at the bottom get the short end of the  stick.   TSA management would still be able to remove employees from duties if  they could compromise the mission of the agency. Furthermore, just like  any other unionized Federal agency, TSA's security procedures would not  be subject to collective bargaining with the workforce.   We are fortunate to have an administration in the White House that  understands the importance of making these changes. This week, the  Biden administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy  voicing strong support for the bill and noting it is in line with the  President's budget request for 2023.                                time  1230    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration  Policy.                     Statement of Administration Policy    h.r. 903--rights for the tsa workforce act of 2022--rep. thompson, d-                          ms, and 231 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 903,       the Rights for the Transportation Security Administration       (TSA) Workforce Act of 2022. This legislation is an important       step in ensuring equitable pay for the TSA workforce and is       aligned with the 2023 President's Budget request to improve       pay for TSA employees. The Administration looks forward to       working with the Congress to enact and fund this important       legislation.     Mr. Speaker, I also applaud the Biden  administration for the steps it has taken on its own over the last year  to expand employees' access to the Merit Systems Protection Board and  explore expanded collective bargaining and increased pay for the  workforce. About a year ago, the Secretary of Homeland Security  released a memo that instructed the TSA Administrator to make progress  on improving pay, collective bargaining, and third-party appeals  rights.   Laudably, the President's budget for fiscal year 2023 includes a  historic proposal to invest in the TSA workforce in these ways. But  critically, crucially, these changes would only apply to the coming  fiscal year. That is why it is so essential to pass H.R. 903 so that  future administrations cannot turn back the clock on these frontline  aviation security workers.   We all know that the nature of an investment is that you have to put  some money in upfront and see the returns later. Unlike a typical  investment, however, we already have a snapshot into the financial  benefit this legislation would yield to workers.   Earlier this year, TSA shared with us that the passage of H.R. 903  would result in a 30 percent salary increase for the entire TSO  workforce and a 21 percent increase for Federal air marshals and other  law enforcement officers within the agency, bringing them in line with  their peers doing similar work at other agencies.   That is astounding, Mr. Speaker, on its face, and it is the least we  can do for the men and women who see us each week as we pass through  our home airports on the way to Washington, D.C.   Most Members, Republicans and Democrats, thank them for the job that  they are doing and say if there is  [[Page H4881]]  anything they can do to help, just let them know. Well, Mr. Speaker,  passing this bill would do exactly that.   H.R. 903 has 231 bipartisan cosponsors and is strongly supported by  the American Federation of Government Employees, the Air Marshals  Association, the Association of Flight Attendants, the Transport  Workers Union of America, the Transportation Trades Department, the  AFL-CIO, and the National Urban League.   I include in the Record letters of support from these organizations.                                              American Federation of                                   Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                        Washington, DC, May 6, 2022.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation       of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE), which represents       more than 700,000 federal and District of Columbia employees       in 70 agencies, including approximately 45,000 Transportation       Security Officers (TSOs) who protect the flying public, I       write to urge you to vote in support of H.R. 903, the       ``Rights for the Transportation Security Administration       Workforce Act of 2021'' when it is considered on the House       floor next week.        Passage of H.R. 903 would finally provide due process and       fair pay to TSOs by requiring full collective bargaining       rights and the GS-pay scale as is enjoyed by most federal       government workers. When the Transportation Security       Administration (TSA) was established, its administrator was       given uniquely broad authority over the workforce to set pay       and working conditions. As a result, TSOs do not benefit from       the Fair Labor Standards Act or the General Schedule pay       scale and do not have representational rights accorded by       Congress to most of the federal workforce under the Civil       Service Reform Act of 1978. Under current law, TSOs cannot       appeal adverse personnel decisions to a neutral third party,       rights that are held by the non-TSO workforce at TSA as well       as most law enforcement officers who serve elsewhere within       the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Other DHS       employees, clearly vital to our national security, can and do       appeal adverse actions not only to the Merit Systems       Protection Board (MSPB) but also to the U.S. Court of       Appeals.        When the bill was considered in the House Homeland Security       Committee, I testified in support of the legislation and       shared stories of the struggles TSOs have suffered under       TSA's separate and unequal personnel management system. They       are stories of harassment, intimidation, humiliation,       discrimination and most of all, stories of the despair TSOs       face with no neutral party to turn to. This separate system       is a failure that has fostered a toxic culture that will not       change without legislative action.        On June 3, 2021 Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro       Mayorkas directed TSA Administrator David Pekoske to issue a       new determination and bargain a new contract with the union       to ``more closely mirror the rights and benefits that are       provided to bargaining unit employees under Chapter 71 of       Title 5 of the United States Code.'' In issuing this       directive, Secretary Mayorkas acknowledged that statutorily,       the provisions under title 5 cannot be directly granted and       the TSO workforce does not have the direct right to appeal       adverse actions to MSPB. This can only be corrected in law.        In the nearly 21-year history of TSA, the Secretary's       action was both unprecedented and highly welcomed. However,       his directive makes clear this is a temporary step to provide       relief until these rights can be secured in statute. The time       is now to step up and recognize the rushed decision almost 21       years ago to allow at separate personnel system no longer       serves the employees of TSA appropriately, and thereby       extends a disservice to the American public and to aviation       security.        H.R. 903 honors TSOs' dedication to America's aviation       security by:        Statutorily repealing the TSA Administrator's authority to       maintain a separate and unequal personnel system that applies       only to the TSO workforce;        Statutorily ending the TSA personnel directives that have       allowed TSA to be the judge and jury, with no neutral third-      party review, in workforce disciplinary matters and providing       statutory access to MSPB;        Requiring TSA to follow the labor-management employee       relations statutes that provide workplace rights and       protections to most federal government employees under Title       5 of the U.S. Code; and        Putting TSOs on the General Schedule pay scale with regular       step increases, under which most federal employees' pay is       determined. While it takes 18 years to advance to the top       step in the GS system, it takes 30 years to advance through a       TSA pay band. AFGE notes that President Biden included       sufficient funds in his Fiscal Year 2023 Budget to all for       the migration to the GS system and the necessary bargaining       and MSPB rights.        I ask you to vote in support of H.R. 903 and oppose any       amendments that weaken its intent to achieve fair pay, a fair       opportunity and put an end to this failed, toxic system.        AFGE appreciates your support of our nation's TSOs and we       look forward to working with you to improve the agency and       the rights of its dedicated workforce that keeps the flying       public safe.            Sincerely,                                                 Everett B. Kelley,      National President.                                   ____                                          Air Marshal Association,                                                       May 13, 2021.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Thompson: The Air Marshal Association is       proud to stand with you in support of H.R. 903--Rights for       the TSA Workforce Act of 2021.        It is long overdue that the men and women who work to keep       our transportation system secure are treated with the respect       and dignity they have earned. Since the Transportation       Security Administration was created in the aftermath of       September 11th, 2001, TSA employees have endured a       substandard core compensation system that effectively turned       them into 'second-class federal workers'. We thank you for       championing this necessary legislation throughout the past       four Congresses, and you can again count on our enthusiastic       support.        On behalf of the Air Marshal Association Executive Board.            Sincerely,                                                    John Casaretti,      President, Air Marshal Association.                                   ____                                               Association of Flight                                         Attendants--CWA, AFL-CIO                                     Washington, DC, April 30, 2021.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Chairman, House Homeland Security Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: The Association of Flight       Attendants--CWA, AFL-CIO (AFA) represents 50,000 flight       attendants across the industry. We offer our strong support       for H.R. 903, the Rights for Transportation Security       Administration (TSA) Workforce Act of 2021.        Twenty years ago, when TSA was created, Congress wrongfully       excluded TSA agents from basic rights and protections       afforded to most federal employees. The result has been a       shameful separate and unequal system of low pay and       inadequate protections for this critical group of public       safety employees        During the pandemic, 7,787 TSA employees have contracted       COVID-19 and 16 have lost their lives to the virus. Under the       previous Administration, many TSA agents were forced daily       into close proximity with hundreds, even thousands, of       maskless passengers. Ignoring the advice and guidance of       federal health agencies and public health leaders, TSA and       the Administration permitted airports to set their own rules       for mask-wearing, denied their workers access to Personal       Protective Equipment (PPE), and never created a preventative       testing system. These constitute a profound and unacceptable       failure to address the vulnerabilities of this essential and       frontline workforce. The solution is clear. Congress must       extend to TSA personnel the equal protections and       representation long-denied under federal law.        As aviation's first responders, Flight Attendants depend on       the professionalism and expertise of the TSA workforce every       day. TSA employees need and deserve a strong voice at work to       help promote the best conditions for security of air travel.       H.R. 903 ensures full collective bargaining rights for       Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) to negotiate for       better working conditions, puts TSA officers on the General       Schedule pay scale, and provides officers with much needed       statutory worker protections against unfair labor practices.        Security is very personal for me. I remember airport       security prior to September 11, 2001. I remember the faces of       the screeners who allowed terrorists to enter Terminal C at       Logan and to board Flight 175. I remember the screeners'       faces because they were there all the time, seven days a       week, all hours of the day. I remember the sound of their       voices, their tired smiles, and the long hours they worked       for the lowest bidding security company just so that they       could provide for their own families. I often wonder how       those security agents have coped with their part in failing       to stop the most fatal attack on U.S. soil. Do they       understand they were set up to fail?        Twenty years ago, the decision to federalize airport       screening improved aviation security immediately. When AFGE       won the largest organizing campaign in the public sector in       over 70 years and gave these workers a voice at the agency,       our security improved again. My colleagues and I depend on       TSOs to keep us safe. We also depend on our union. We know       that our union has made flying safer for everyone through       constant vigilance, and by giving frontline workers--the       people who know the operation--a clear and strong voice in       the workplace. Safety and security doesn't just happen; it       happens because we demand it of ourselves, demand it of       management, and demand it of government.        The unjust decision to exclude TSA from the basic rights       and protections of federal employees has produced a workforce       that is among the lowest paid and least secure. While TSA's       diversity is a cause for celebration--55 percent of the TSA       workforce identifies as a racial or ethnic minority--this       makes their exclusion even more problematic, creating yet       another disparate treatment, another barrier to advancement       for historically-marginalized workers.        We finally note that the drive to win long-denied rights       for TSOs aligns with the goals of the newly-formed White       House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment.  [[Page H4882]]       The first goal of this landmark Task Force is to ``lead by       example by ensuring that the federal government is a model       employer with respect to encouraging worker organizing and       collective bargaining among its workforce (emphasis added).''       The moment for action has arrived.        AFA applauds your leadership and support for the aviation       workforce and pledges to work alongside you and members of       this Committee to secure the basic worker rights and       protections long denied to Transportation Security Officers.            Respectfully,                                                       Sara Nelson,      International President.                                   ____                                              Transport Workers Union                                             of America, AFL-CIO,                                        Washington, DC, May 4, 2022.        Dear Representative: On behalf of more than 155,000 members       of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), I am writing       to encourage you to support the Rights for the Transportation       Security Administration Workforce Act of 2022 (H.R. 903).        The security of our air system is guarded by Transportation       Security Officers (TSOs), working for the Transportation       Security Administration (TSA). Despite being entrusted with       the well-being of our air system, TSOs do not have the same       statutory rights as other federal employees. H.R. 903 would       ensure TSOs are guaranteed a fair wage scale, the ability to       appeal disputes to an independent third party, whistleblower       protections, and other essential collective bargaining       rights.        As anyone who has flown on a plane has seen, TSOs serve on       the front lines of aviation security and carry out an       indispensable role in protecting the safety of the nation and       the flying public. As essential personnel, TSOs are required       to report to work without pay during government shutdowns,       pandemics, and other emergencies. Despite performing vital       roles necessary for the security of our country, our TSOs are       currently among the lowest-paid members of the federal       workforce, largely because they do have historically not had       access to the same workplace protections as other Federal       workers.        All workers deserve the right to collectively bargain. The       failure to provide fair pay and standard protections for TSOs       has contributed to a workforce with low morale, high stress,       and extensive turnover. In order to keep our country safe and       provide workers with the pay and protections that they       deserve, the Transport Workers Union strongly urges you to       vote yes on the Rights for the Transportation Security       Administration Workforce Act of 2022.            Sincerely,                                                    John Samuelsen,      International President.                                   ____                                                              TTD,                                        Washington, DC, May 5, 2022.      TTD, Calls for Passage of the Rights for the TSA Workforce           Act of 2022.         Dear Representative: On behalf of the Transportation Trades       Department, AFL-CIO (TTD), I urge you to vote YES on H.R.       903, the ``Rights for the TSA Workforce Act of 2022'' when it       is considered next week.        Every day, thousands of Transportation Security Officers       (TSOs) show up to work to keep our aviation system, mass       transit networks, and large public gatherings safe and secure       for transportation workers and the general public. However,       since the creation of the TSA, its dedicated and skilled       employees have been denied many of the basic federal worker       rights and protections enjoyed by other federal workers,       including those in the Department of Homeland Security. There       is no justification for the ongoing mistreatment of the men       and women of the TSO workforce, and H.R. 903 takes critical       steps to ensure that they have the workplace rights they have       earned and deserve.        H.R. 903 would repeal the TSA Administrator's authority to       maintain the existing unequal personnel system that applies       only to TSOs, and require TSA to provide the workplace rights       and protections granted to other federal employees under       Title 5. The bill would also grant TSOs access to the Merit       Systems Protection Board--a neutral arbiter in workplace       discipline matters that nearly all federal employees have       access to, including TSA management and administrative       personnel. Finally, the bill would put TSOs on the general       pay scale with regular step increases. These reforms would       dramatically and immediately improve working conditions for       TSOs and are vital for the future success of the workforce.        TSOs have had to endure this workplace inequity for far too       long, and it is a significant factor in the low morale and       high turnover rates that confront the agency. That our       government continues to maintain this system for the       professionals who keep every American safe is simply       unconscionable. TTD calls on the House to pass H.R. 903, and       to reject any amendment that seeks to eliminate critical       components of this bill, including the provision of fair pay       and the establishment of collective bargaining rights.            Sincerely,                                                        Greg Regan,      President.                                   ____                                            National Urban League,                                                        May 4, 2022.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Urban       League, an organization with a 112-year history of advocating       for policies that promote civil rights and economic       empowerment for African Americans and other historically       underserved communities, and our Urban League affiliates in       37 states and the District of Columbia, we write to express       support for H.R. 903, the Rights for the Transportation       Security Administration Workforce Act of 2022. Ensuring that       Transportation Security Officers (TSOs)--whose service helps       keep us safe and our economy moving--receive the same rights       and protections as other federal workers is important to the       mission of the National Urban League. We urge Congress the       swiftly pass this important piece of legislation.        It is vital that Transportation Security Administration       (TSA)'s workforce be protected in the workplace and       compensated fairly in order to continue to reflect       communities they serve. Nationwide, 55 percent of the 60,000       workers at TSA are people of color. Black Americans make up       about 11 percent of the overall population but nearly triple       that (32.7 percent) of transportation screeners. Latino and       Asian Americans also make up a larger share of the       transportation security workforce than their share of the US       population and women make up over 41 percent of employees.        In spite of the fact that TSA is driving the diversity and       inclusion of people of color and women in our country's       homeland security workforce, its workers are not afforded the       protections and benefits of their counterparts elsewhere in       the Department of Homeland Security or the federal government       at large. TSOs face inequities compared to other federal       employees. They lack the rights and protections afforded to       their peers in the federal government under Title 5 of the       U.S. Code. TSA screeners do not have the same protections to       collectively bargain. Their pay scale lags behind that of       other agencies in the government and they are missing out on       the Family and Medical Leave Act protections available       elsewhere in the government. Potential whistleblowers in TSA       are not protected. Without access to an objective outside       body like the Merit Systems Protection Board or negotiated       grievance procedures, TSOs are denied the ability to appeal       adverse personnel decisions in the same way as other federal       employees. And unlike the progressive disciplinary system       applied across other federal agencies, including other       Department of Homeland Security (DHS) components, TSOs are       subject to a cumulative disciplinary system.        This is reflective of the unfair barriers to pay equity and       workplace protections people of color and women face as a       whole. Due to historic injustices such as slavery,       segregation, redlining, unequal access to government       programs, and ongoing institutionalized and systematic       discrimination, Black men on average make 87 cents on a White       man's dollar. Black women face an even larger pay gap on       average, making only 63 cents for every dollar earned by a       White man. At the same time, 80 percent of Black mothers are       the sole, co-breadwinners, or primary breadwinners for their       households. These trends track for the Latino community as       well. One cause of this disparity is that people of color are       often overrepresented in lower paying professions that yield       fewer benefits and fewer protections. Removing barriers to       success and increasing protections to match those of other       federal workers in the TSA, which employs a higher proportion       of people of color and a higher proportion of women than the       Department of Homeland Security overall, is absolutely a       matter of equity that should be addressed urgently.        It is past time this disparity is addressed. TSOs should       have the same fair pay, union rights, and treatment as other       federal workers. The Rights for the Transportation Security       Administration Workforce Act of 2022 would codify these       rights and give long overdue workplace protections to TSA       officers. The National Urban League supports this legislation       and urges you to support it as well.            Sincerely,                                                 Marc H. Morial,                              President and Chief Executive Officer,                                             National Urban League.                                                  Joi O. Chaney,       Executive Director, Washington Bureau, Senior Vice President,                                                  Policy & Advocacy,                                             National Urban League.     Mr. Speaker, the momentum we need to  vote this legislation over the finish line is there, and I hope my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle will honor the work of our brave  TSOs and the commitment they have made to them by voting for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see my colleague, the ranking member. But  let me just correct him on his correction of the gentleman from New  Jersey. A person that works in the Department of Homeland Security is  not a labor representative. The labor representative that Mr. Payne  referenced is an organized labor representative with the AFL-CIO.   The other thing my ranking member can do, he will have a chance to  vote on the President's budget. The raise for the employees is in the  budget. I look forward to that opportunity presenting itself. Our TSOs  need a raise. If we don't, the gymnastics here on the floor doesn't pay  rent, doesn't pay mortgage, doesn't pay tuition, doesn't even buy  groceries.   So at the end of the day, let's give these good folks who do a good  job an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. That is the spirit in  which this legislation is put forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, for the Record, title 5  will prevent the misconduct we have seen at TSA, such as senior  managers awarding each other over $90,000 in bonuses.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  [[Page H4887]]    Mr. Speaker, for the Record, title 5 is not a union. It is a  personnel system. It means that if you have rights as an employee of  the Federal Government, you know what those rights are. That is not a  union.   Now, for TSOs who voted to have a bargaining unit, and they chose the  American Federation of Government Employees to be their bargaining  unit, that is all. In America, people have choices. Our TSOs decided  that they wanted to have union representation, which in America, in a  democracy, is their right. I respect that right, and they have done it.   Now we have to treat them like all other Federal employees. That is  just what this bill does. There is nothing else here. It just puts them  under title 5 just like every other national security-related law  enforcement agency, and we are in good shape, so they can pay their  mortgages, they can pay their rent, they can do for their children like  other Federal employees, plain and simple. Not a big deal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa), a subcommittee chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, the policies with reference to flying on planes have  remained consistent under successive administrations of both parties,  including the Trump administration. These passengers have their  identities verified through CBP and ICE and received enhanced  screening. If the individuals are on the terrorist watch list and they  are not U.S. citizens, they are transferred to ICE for title 8  processing and detention.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the robust debate we have had today for  this legislation and amendments my colleagues will be offering that  seek to improve the bill. But you can't spend thanks. If I told a TSO,  ``Thank you for your service,'' almost to the person, they would say,  ``Then give me a raise. Treat me like all other Federal employees.''   As our country emerges from what we hope is the worst of the COVID-19  pandemic, we cannot forget about the TSOs, air marshals, and others  within TSA who never paused their work in service of our national  security.   With estimates that the number of passengers who travel through  airports in fiscal year 2023 will exceed prepandemic figures by 4.5  percent, we are again asking them to do more than ever and not pay them  any additional money. Treat them like everybody else. Passage of this  legislation will send a clear signal that we acknowledge their  commitment and agree they deserve the compensation and workplace  protection that reflects that.   In this country, you pay for what you get. Pay our TSOs what they  deserve and treat them like all other Federal employees. A 30 percent  increase is what this bill would do for our TSOs, and they deserve it.  They have earned it. I thank my colleagues for their support and urge  passage of H.R. 903.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of  House Resolution 1097, I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of these  amendments which seek to improve the work experiences of TSA employees,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I support these amendments en bloc consisting of  amendments from my colleagues from Michigan, Virginia, Indiana, New  Jersey, and New York.   These amendments, like the entire bill, requires TSA to engage its  workforce, hear employee concerns, and make improvements in the service  of our homeland security.   As we have heard today, morale and retention at TSA are alarmingly  low. This is even more alarming when considering the fact that TSA is a  majority-minority workforce, with more than half its workers  identifying as people of color. It is important that TSA employees have  a safe workplace, free of harassment, and that agency leadership  reflects the diversity of its workforce as well.   These amendments offer solutions to real problems faced by TSA  employees, such as commuting challenges at airports, as they go about  their critical mission to keep air travel secure for the American  people.   I thank my colleagues for offering these amendments, and I urge the  House to join me in supporting them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
