 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the life of Andy Morris, Jr.   Andy was the son of the late George Randall Morris, Sr., and Tami  Benjamin Gane. He grew up in a loving home and was the oldest of three  siblings.   Throughout his life, Andy was always very involved with athletics. He  was a longtime member of the Brunswick Country Club and, in high  school, was a three-sport athlete.   After high school, Andy attended Valdosta State University, and then  began his career with the creation of Skippers' Fish Camp. Skippers'  Fish Camp became a wildly successful restaurant and one of my favorite  places to eat.   Above all, Andy loved being a father to his children, Tripp and  Addie. Andy will be remembered as a loving father that always wanted  the very best for his children.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Andy and with his family.                    Recognizing First Bryan Baptist Church     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize First  Bryan Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia.   For more than 200 years, First Bryan Baptist Church has been an  important cornerstone for the Savannah community. This year, the church  is celebrating its 235th anniversary.   In fact, the First Bryan Baptist Church is considered one of the  oldest African-American Baptist churches in the United States. The  church is  [[Page H256]]  named for the original pastor, an enslaved man, Andrew Bryan.   To celebrate the anniversary, members of the congregation put on a  play that showed the history of the church's founding.   The new pastor-elect, Reverend Christopher Pittman, will be the  church's 20th pastor in its long-storied history.   Congratulations, First Bryan Baptist Church, on this wonderful  anniversary. I hope your next 235 years are as successful as your  first.                     Honoring the Service of Tom Fanning     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tom  Fanning of the Southern Company.   Tom is the current chairman of the board, CEO, and president of  Southern Company. For more than 42 years, Tom's excellent leadership  has helped mold Southern Company into the great company it is today.   Tom has been responsible for leading the Nation's new nuclear  initiative while at Southern Company. He has overseen the installation  of two state-of-the-art units in Georgia, adding more than 4,000  megawatts of renewable energy since 2012.   Southern Company is the only U.S. energy provider investing in an  all-of-the-above approach to America's energy future.   I thank Tom for his decades of service and leadership to Southern  Company, the First District of Georgia, and our country.                       Honoring the Life of Bebe Flynn     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the life of Bebe Flynn.   Bebe was born in Lenoir City, Tennessee, in 1921. While living in  Lenoir City, Bebe and her family were some of the few Catholics in  town. In fact, a priest traveled to say mass once a month in their  home. Maintaining her faith was always a strong focus for her.   After high school, Bebe attended Saint Mary's Memorial Hospital  School of Nursing in Knoxville, Tennessee, graduating as a registered  nurse in October of 1943.   In 1945, she married her childhood friend and high school boyfriend,  John Flynn.   In 2013, Bebe was the first recipient of Saint Patrick's of the  Bishop's Award for her significant contributions to the parish as a  volunteer.   Bebe and her husband, John, loved to travel in retirement, often with  retirees from Denison.   She made friends where she went and was known for always keeping an  upbeat attitude in life. She will be dearly missed by all those who  knew her.   Our thoughts and prayers are with the family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Cecil Abarr, a beloved member of Wesley Monumental United Methodist  Church, who recently passed away at the age of 93.   Cecil was born in Iowa in 1929, and upon his graduation from high  school, he enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II. After his  service, he was awarded the World War II Victory Medal.   Cecil was also a leader in the private sector, locating to Savannah  to become the president of the Branigar Corporation. In this position,  he led the development of large real estate projects, which have now  been flourishing for decades.   Despite all titles and awards he received throughout his life, he is  best known as a husband to his wife, Lou, a father to his five  children, a grandfather to 16, and great-grandfather to 21.   I pass on my sincerest condolences to his family and friends. He will  be dearly missed.                            ____________________
