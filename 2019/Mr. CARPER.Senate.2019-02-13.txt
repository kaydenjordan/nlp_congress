 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak regarding  the nomination of William Barr to serve as the next Attorney General of  our country.   First, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on the circumstances  surrounding this vacancy. I believe that every Member of this Chamber  should use this occasion to decide, ultimately, whether we believe Mr.  Barr will be the Attorney General for all Americans or whether Mr. Barr  will be the Attorney General, really, for one American.   When President-elect Trump selected then-Senator Jeff Sessions, our  colleague from Alabama, to serve as Attorney General for this country,  it brought me no joy to vote against our long-time colleague and  friend. The truth was, though, that our views too often diverged on too  many important issues that included immigration, healthcare, civil  rights, voting rights, LGBT rights, environmental protection, and more.   After considerable prayer and reflection, I reached the conclusion  that Senator Sessions would not be an Attorney General for all  Americans.   Unfortunately, during his tenure at the Department of Justice, he  went on to preside over a number of divisive policies and decisions,  including the Muslim ban, overturning protections for Dreamers and  asylum seekers, enacting a cruel policy of family separation at our  southern border, and failing to defend the constitutionality of the  Affordable Care Act in court.   I have not been shy about expressing my disagreement with these  decisions, and others, made by the Department of Justice during the  current administration. However, one area where I strongly agreed with  Attorney General Sessions was his decision to recuse himself from the  special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in our 2016  elections.   One of my core values is to figure out what is the right thing to do  and to try to do it--not what is politically expedient, not what is  easy but what is the right thing to do. After it became clear that  then-Senator Sessions provided testimony to the Senate Judiciary  Committee that called into question his impartiality on matters  relating to Russia and the 2016 election, Attorney General Sessions  recused himself from all matters related to the 2016 Presidential  election. That was the right thing to do. It certainly wasn't what our  President wanted him to do. The President has said as much repeatedly.  I should say that, maybe, he has tweeted as much repeatedly.   The President repeatedly admonished Attorney General Sessions for  doing what I think many of us believe was the right thing to do. Here  is what the President tweeted on June 5, 2018:         The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff       Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself . . .       I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and       money wasted, so many lives ruined . . . and Sessions knew       better than most that there was No Collusion!    Let me be clear, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is  not a witch hunt. It is, in fact, the unanimous opinion of the U.S.  intelligence Agencies and law enforcement community that Russia  attacked our democracy and interfered in our 2016 elections.   As a result of the special counsel's ongoing investigation, 34  individuals and 3 companies have been indicted or pled guilty to a  range of crimes. This includes the Trump campaign manager, the Trump  deputy campaign manager, Mr. Trump's National Security Advisor, and,  most recently, President Trump's longtime political advisor.   Special Counsel Mueller is a lifelong Republican who served with  distinction in the Vietnam war. I think I am the last Member of this  body who served in the Vietnam war, but he served there with real  distinction. He served with distinction as our FBI Director following  the September 11 attacks. He is not conducting a partisan witch hunt.  He and the team he leads are striving to find out the truth and, in  doing so, help us prevent future attacks on our democracy.   I believe we should be doing everything in our power to allow Special  Counsel Mueller and his team to conduct and complete this investigation  free from political interference and partisan games.   During the years I was privileged to serve as chairman of the  Homeland Security Committee, Bob Mueller was the head of the FBI. I had  a chance to work  [[Page S1313]]  with him and to get to know him. My wife and I know his wife. He is  among the finest people I have ever known in the military, outside of  the military, in government service, and outside of government service.   Unfortunately, President Trump does not view political independence  as a prerequisite for the job of Attorney General. Instead, he tends to  view political independence as a disloyal act, an offense for which one  should be fired. Just ask former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates.  Just ask former FBI Director Comey, whom I also came to know well  during the time I served on the Homeland Security Committee, including  as its chairman. Just ask former Attorney General Sessions.    Recall with me, if you will, after the November election, President  Trump fired Attorney General Sessions and named the Attorney General's  Chief of Staff, Matt Whitaker, as Acting Attorney General. This was a  curious decision, as well as a legally questionable decision. Why would  the President go outside the line of succession at the Department of  Justice? I fear it is because of Mr. Whitaker's public comments  regarding the Mueller investigation.   Mr. Whitaker previously likened the special counsel's investigation  to a ``fishing expedition,'' and a ``witch hunt'' and implied that  following the truth ``could be damaging to the President of the United  States and his family--and by extension, to our country.''   Really? Could he have been serious in saying that getting to the  bottom of all this could be damaging to the President of the United  States and his family and, by extension, to our country?   Another President, a long time ago, Thomas Jefferson, used to say  these words: If the people know the truth, they won't make a mistake.   Those are hardly the views of our current President. It saddens me to  say that.   Despite publicly expressing these views that clearly call into  question his impartiality, Mr. Whitaker did not recuse himself from the  Mueller investigation when he assumed of the role of Acting Attorney  General, even though he received a recommendation to recuse himself  from ethics officials at the Department of Justice.   Mr. Whitaker's staggering unfitness for the job is a big part of the  reason why my initial reaction was positive when President Trump  nominated William Barr to be our Attorney General. After all, Mr. Barr  previously served as Deputy Attorney General and Attorney General  during the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush, someone I  revered. I think many of us revered him.   By all accounts, Mr. Barr is a well-qualified nominee, someone who  has been a fine public servant throughout many years of public service.  I strongly believe that we need Senate-confirmed leadership at the  Department of Justice. I want to make it clear that during normal  times, I might be inclined to support Mr. Barr's nomination. In fact, I  probably would.   But these are not normal times. These are extraordinary times. In  addition to firing the Attorney General and the FBI Director for their  views on the Russia inquiry, President Trump has reportedly asked those  around him why he didn't have an Attorney General who is looking out  for his personal interests. According to reports, the President has  said, ``Where's my Roy Cohn?'' during moments of crisis. For those who  may not know Roy Cohn, he was President Trump's personal lawyer and  fixer, who pushed legal tactics to the limits and also served with  Senator Joe McCarthy during a very dark period in our Nation's history  and a very dark period in this Senate's history.   This is how President Trump views the role of Attorney General--not  as a lawyer to defend the rights of all Americans but as a fixer who  will look out for him. Moreover, in his State of the Union address last  week, President Trump highlighted what he sees as ``ridiculous,  partisan investigations.'' He went on to say: ``If there is going to be  peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigations.''   It is against this extraordinary backdrop that we must ask ourselves:  What are Mr. Barr's views on Presidential power, and what are his views  on the investigation led by Robert Mueller?   As it turns out, we don't have to guess what the answer is to that  question. In an unsolicited 19-page memo that Mr. Barr sent to Deputy  Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and President Trump's personal lawyers,  Mr. Barr shares his views, and they are clearly hostile to the special  counsel's investigation.   In a memo entitled ``Mueller's Obstruction Theory,'' Mr. Barr raises  doubt about the special counsel's ability to follow the truth while  going on to defend President Trump's actions and even suggesting that  the President has the power to limit the scope of this inquiry.   In that same memo, Mr. Barr states that the special counsel's  investigation into obstruction of justice may do ``lasting damage to  the presidency.''   I believe that reasonable people can disagree, as I frequently did  with my friend, former Senator, and then-Attorney General, Jeff  Sessions.   It is clear to me, however, that despite whatever your views may be  toward the special counsel's investigation, the views expressed in his  memo not only warrant Mr. Barr's recusal from the special counsel's  investigation, but they cry out for it.   Attorney General Sessions did the right thing when confronted with a  similar decision. However, despite expressing these biased views from  President Trump's own personal lawyers, Mr. Barr says he will not  recuse himself from the special counsel's investigation if he is  confirmed. To make matters worse, Mr. Barr refuses to commit to making  the special counsel's final report public.    Earlier, I asked for us to consider whether Mr. Barr will be the  Attorney General for all Americans or whether Mr. Barr will be the  Attorney General for one American. That one American happens to go by  another name, Individual 1, which is the legal moniker given to  President Trump in the Southern District of New York for directing his  personal attorney to violate Federal campaign finance law.   Like Mr. Whitaker's public comments prior to his elevation to Acting  Attorney General, I fear that Mr. Barr's memo may have been an audition  for the job and that his selection may not have been a coincidence.  During his Senate hearing in 1989, Mr. Barr plainly stated that the  Attorney General ``is the President's lawyer.''   Colleagues, these are extraordinary times for our Nation. We must  make it clear to the American people that the Attorney General is not  the President's lawyer. We need independence at the Department of  Justice now more than ever. While I hope I am wrong--very wrong--it is  my belief that Trump used this appointment as an opportunity to protect  himself rather than to protect the constitutional rights of all  Americans.   Ultimately, for all of these reasons I have laid out, I have  concluded that despite his earlier service to our Nation--distinguished  service in many instances--Mr. Barr does not, in this instance, meet  the standard that is necessary to be the Attorney General for our  country now.   Sadly, on that note, I yield the floor.
