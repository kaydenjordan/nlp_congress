 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the Articles of  Impeachment against President Trump.   As Chairman Nadler must recall, exactly 21 years ago today, I spoke  on this floor in opposition to the impeachment of President Clinton.  And 21 years ago tomorrow, I voted against all four Articles of  Impeachment against President Clinton.  [[Page H12143]]    Today's Articles of Impeachment against President Trump are an  assault on our Constitution and the American people. To impeach a  President for a phone call for which no crime is charged, never mind a  high crime, and asserting his constitutional prerogative as a President  is a clear abuse of power by the Congress. It sets a dangerous  precedent of weaponizing impeachment to undo the solemn decision of the  American people.   Madam Speaker, President Trump and I grew up in the same borough of  New York City, and today, I am proud to stand with President Trump and  urge a ``no'' vote on these horrible Articles of Impeachment. I  strongly urge a ``no'' vote.
