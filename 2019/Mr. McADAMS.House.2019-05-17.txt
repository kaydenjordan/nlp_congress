 Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask Mr. Cicilline if he  will engage with me for the purpose of a colloquy.    I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, I want to confirm and clarify in our debate  today that H.R. 5 does not change our Nation's longstanding First  Amendment right to free religious exercise, speech, and association.  [[Page H3944]]    I understand that houses of worship will not be affected in their  religious observances by the public accommodations provisions in H.R.  5. The current exemption in title II of the Civil Rights Act remains in  place, so chapels, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of  worship will continue to have legal certainty to practice their  religion, conduct services, and affiliate with fellow members of their  religion, as well as engage and welcome others not of their faith in  their houses of worship for religious activity or faith practice, as  they do now.    To also clarify, is it your understanding nothing in  H.R. 5 compels a clergy member to perform a religious ceremony in  conflict with their religious beliefs?   That is, faith groups can continue to perform marriages, blessings,  baptisms, and other practices for their own members and consistent with  their beliefs, consistent with their First Amendment rights, correct?
