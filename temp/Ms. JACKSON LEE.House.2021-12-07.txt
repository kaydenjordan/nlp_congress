 Madam Speaker, if there is one thing that we have  heard so often, it is doctors who have sacrificed during this period of  the pandemic, who have maintained their offices. We often hear in  public settings and private settings about the cuts that they are  expecting and how much it will undermine the work that they do, their  offices' expenses.   I am very glad that, rather than talking, the Democrats are working  together to ensure that the Medicare sequester payments will not occur  and that we will protect against that, as we will do for the farmers.   But here is the point: The pandemic continues. Doctors in private  practice are trying to survive. This is a crucial decision and relief  that is long overdue.   I want to be able to say to my physicians that Democrats care. And I  hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will do as much  acting on doctors and medicine and healthcare as they will talking.   Tonight, we need to act to provide the safety net for these  physicians. I support this legislation, supporting the healthcare  providers during this COVID-19 pandemic.    Will the gentleman yield?    I thank my good friend. I will take 15 seconds. You  can't provide for the doctors if you don't provide an increase in the  debt ceiling. You know that.   We have to pay our bills, and paying the doctors and making sure that  they are protected includes doing the action that we are doing. Join us  in doing that.  [[Page H6933]]
