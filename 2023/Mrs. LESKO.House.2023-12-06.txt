 Madam Speaker, do we live in Communist China?   Really, do we live in Communist China?   I can't believe that the Biden administration first wants to ban gas  stoves--we had to do legislation to prevent that. Now, they want to ban  67 percent of the manufacturing of regular gas-powered cars by 2032.  That is insane.   President Biden and my Democratic colleagues claim they are for the  middle class. They always say: We are for the middle class. Well, no,  they are not because who can afford these electric cars?   It is the people with a bunch of money. That is who can afford it.  Not the middle class. Not the lower class.   I am in strong support of this bill to prohibit and prevent this  radical regulation against common Americans.
