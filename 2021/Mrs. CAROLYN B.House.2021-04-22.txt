 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 330, I call up the bill (H.R. 51) to provide for the  admission of the State of Washington, D.C. into the Union, and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 51, the  Washington, D.C. Admission Act.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  and my dear friend, Congresswoman Norton, for her years of dedicated  leadership on this bill. She is not only the author of the bill, but of  this moment in history.   Today, for the second time in 2 years, the House will vote to  overturn the wrongs of over 200 years of political repression in the  District of Columbia. We will vote to honor the most fundamental  principle of this Nation--that all people have a right to full and  equal representation in their government.   Our Nation has not always lived up to its promise of full and equal  representation, but that has not stopped those dedicated to equality  from fighting to ensure that all people are fully represented in their  government.   This fundamental right is denied to the more than 712,000 Americans  living in the District of Columbia. For more than 200 years the  District has been fighting for equal rights. Despite 86 percent of its  residents voting for statehood in 2016, Congress has still not acted to  ensure that the District shares in the blessings of liberty promised by  the Founders in the U.S. Constitution.   The United States is a republic, but the people of its Capital lack  representation. The United States is the only democratic country that  denies both voting rights in the national legislature and local self- government to the people of its Capital. That is wrong and violates  everything we stand for as Americans.   The District pays more in Federal taxes than 21 States and more per  capita than any State. Think about that. It pays more than nearly half  the States in this country, yet D.C. residents have no vote in  Congress. That is wrong.   Unfortunately, so far Republicans have opposed our efforts to ensure  equality for District residents. But let me be clear what Republican  opposition is really about: partisanship. They would rather deny voting  rights for hundreds of thousands of American citizens than even  consider the possibility that Representatives from the new State could  possibly be Democrats. Think about that argument. They are willing to  violate the core principles of our democracy merely because the new  State might elect Representatives from a different political party.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge every Member in this House to vote  ``yes'' on H.R. 51, and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes  to the distinguished gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms.  Norton), who is the author of this bill and moment in history.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, in this historic  moment, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the first female Speaker of the House in  history.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), chairman of the  Government Operations Subcommittee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify that this should be a bipartisan  issue. Republicans used to support voting representation in Congress  for D.C. residents.   Then-President Eisenhower called for equal political rights for D.C.  residents in three State of the Union Addresses.   Then-President Nixon said: ``It should offend the democratic senses  of this Nation that D.C. residents do not have voting representation in  Congress.''   In 2007, then-Representative Mike Pence said on the floor: ``The fact  that more than a half a million Americans living in the District of  Columbia are denied a single voting representative in Congress is  clearly a historic wrong.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), the chairman of the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties  Subcommittee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield an  additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, under the Admissions Clause of the Constitution,  Congress has the authority to admit new States. That is why all 37 new  States have been admitted by simple legislation. No State has ever been  admitted by a constitutional amendment.   The Republicans want D.C. to use an admissions process that has never  been used in the history of this country.   The District Clause of the Constitution gives Congress authority over  the Federal District and establishes a maximum size of the Federal  District, 100 square miles. It does not establish a minimum size.   H.R. 51 would maintain a 2-square mile Federal District.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the senior chief deputy  whip.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), a champion for  equality and the 51st State and House majority leader.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, how much time  remains on each side?    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), the chair of the Financial  Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   The gentleman describes this, as many on the other side, as a  political issue, a power grab. He cites all these other political  actions, but the real power grab is denying 712,000 taxpaying American  citizens the right to vote. That is the power grab.   This isn't about politics. It is a fundamental voting and civil  rights issue. And it is outrageous that Republicans would play partisan  politics just to block 712,000 Americans from having full equality in  our democracy.   Every American deserves a voice in their government, not taxation  without representation, fundamental beliefs in our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), the chair of the  Joint Economic Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how  much time is remaining on both sides?    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens), chairwoman of the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's Subcommittee on Research  and Technology.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished  constitutional scholar.    MALONEY of New York,  [[Page H2089]]  Messrs.
