 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Today, I come to the floor to pay tribute to the  President pro tempore of the United States Senate. He is the longest  serving Senator currently serving in this institution, and he is my  friend from Vermont, Senator Pat Leahy.   As many of you know, the Senator from Vermont also happens to be a  talented photographer. His photos have been published in the New York  Times, USA TODAY, and elsewhere. Senator Leahy has also appeared in  front of the camera in Batman movies. But this shutterbug was bitten by  the political bug, and he certainly made his mark in Vermont politics.   At age 34, he became the youngest and very first Democrat elected to  the U.S. Senate from the Green Mountain State, and today, he is  Vermont's longest serving Senator, having put his name on the ballot  two dozen times during his political career.   A year ago in November, my friend and colleague announced that he  would not seek reelection to a ninth term. At the Vermont statehouse,  he happened to be there to announce his very first Senate campaign. It  was at the Vermont statehouse that he did that, and Pat, at that time,  recalled the words of Edmund Burke, the Dubliner who served in the  House of Commons during America's Revolutionary War. The words that  Burke imparted to the electors of Bristol in 1774 inspired Pat Leahy's  approach to public service.   Burke said:         Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but       his judgment.    Burke also said a representative ought to have ``the most unreserved  communication with his constituents.''   Now, in my mind, that still is the essence of representative  government.   Although we serve on different sides of the aisle, find ourselves on  opposite sides of the ideological spectrum, and hail from different  regions of the country, Pat and I are called to serve our constituents.   Pat Leahy and I have battled together in the trenches countless times  over the years. He is a worthy adversary and, countless times, a  trusted legislative ally. It takes grit; it takes grace; it takes  gravitas to score victories and stick to the courage of one's  convictions.   Indeed, Pat and I have more in common than might meet the eye. He is  a dyed-in-the-wool liberal from New England, with a law degree from  Georgetown. I am a Midwestern conservative and lifelong family farmer.  As Senate colleagues, we share an abiding respect for this institution  of the Senate. We value bipartisanship. For decades, we have earned the  public trust of the voters of Vermont and Iowa. That tells me that  Vermonters and Iowans prioritize hard work and constituent service.   At his announcement last November, Pat shared that he and his wife  Marcelle made the decision together and that it was, to quote his  words, ``time to put down the gavel.''   First, I want to say how much Barbara and I cherish our friendships.  Barbara and I celebrated 68 years of marriage last August 22. Two days  later, Marcelle and Pat celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary.  Barbara and Marcelle are both cancer survivors and have developed a  close friendship over these many years. These wives are strong and  resilient and use their voices to advocate for early detection and  treatment to save lives. Now, I can only speak for myself--and I  believe my friend would agree--the unconditional support of Marcelle  and Barbara have made us better men and then better Members of the U.S.  Senate.   As I mentioned, Pat and Marcelle arrived at their heartfelt  decision--made in partnership--to, using his words, ``put down the  gavel.'' As you can see here from this photograph, Chairman Leahy  certainly knows how to wield a gavel. He has had plenty of practice. In  his nearly half century of service, Pat has chaired all of these  committees: the Agriculture Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the  Appropriations Committee. This photo was taken in 2015 when then- Chairman Leahy presented me with an engraved gavel as I prepared to  take the helm of the Judiciary Committee. By the size of this gavel he  is firmly holding in his hands, I am awfully glad that Senator Leahy  and I get along so well. Although we don't always see eye to eye on  politics, we have found common ground on issues that matter. We respect  each other's views and values and build consensus based on mutual  trust.   We have served many years together on the Agriculture Committee.  Senator Leahy added tens of thousands of acres to the Green Mountain  National Forest and is one of the few people on Earth who can explain  Federal milk marketing orders--and, boy, did he go to bat for the  Northeast dairy farmers.   Senator Leahy has cultivated expertise in Foreign Affairs that is  recognized here at home and around the world. He has leveraged his  leadership to help ban the export of anti-personnel land mines and  secure justice for war victims.   For years, Senator Leahy and I partnered together to strengthen the  Freedom of Information Act and also the very important whistleblower  protection laws.   We have worked together to root out fraud and protect national  security with reforms to the EB-5 investor visa program.   We share a fierce commitment to securing our States' fair shares as  champions of small, rural States in America.   From broadband to infrastructure, to the opioid crisis and pandemic  relief, Senator Leahy and I have rolled up our sleeves and put in the  work to ensure the people of Iowa and Vermont don't get short-ended.   For decades, Senator Leahy and I have served together on the Canada- U.S. Inter-Parliamentary Group to advance bilateral economic and trade  issues.   In May of 2000, we held our annual conference on the steamboat Delta  Queen along a route from Memphis to New Orleans. I cochaired the  committee discussing international trade, and Senator Leahy cochaired  the panel on international affairs.   In May of 2011, our group met with international partners in Belgium  and traveled to Russia, where Senator Leahy gave a very important  speech on the judiciary and the rule of law, and then to Ireland to  advance in all of these places diplomacy, peace, and prosperity.   I have enjoyed working together to forge fruitful relations around  the world.   As I reflect on our years of service together here in the U.S.  Senate, some observers might actually suggest times sure are different  than when we first came to Washington. Pat was elected to the U.S.  Senate in 1974, the same year that Iowans elected me to the U.S. House  of Representatives--at that time, the only Republican in the Iowa  delegation. Despite the partisanship and polarization that is defining  civic life this year and for the last few years, I have great hope for  America.   Senator Leahy and I share an abiding fidelity to uphold the promise  of America. I am honored to have served these many years in Senator  Leahy's company.   Vermonters placed their trust in Senator Leahy's judgment. They  counted on his vote, his voice, and his leadership to represent their  values, and Senator Leahy has delivered.   Barbara and I wish Pat and Marcelle joyful days ahead in each other's  company on their farm, and we wish them that for many, many years to  come.   Godspeed to my friend from Vermont.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
