 Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of H.J. Res. 27. This  resolution will overturn Joe Biden's latest attempt to expand the  Federal Government's jurisdiction and regulate every aspect of our  lives.  [[Page H1229]]    The decision to return to the 2015 WOTUS rule puts burdensome  regulations that will devastate small businesses, manufacturers,  farmers, home and infrastructure builders, local communities, water  districts, and everyday Americans across my district in Colorado and  the entire country.   In short, the EPA's job-killing WOTUS regulation expands Washington  bureaucrats' jurisdiction over ditches and navigable waters,  threatening property rights and water rights for our communities. Rural  Colorado runs on water, and this unconstitutional regulation will harm  our way of life.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and chairman of the House  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Sam Graves, for his great  work to protect private water rights. We all want clean air, we all  want clean water, and we know that we do it right without bureaucrats  getting in our way. I support this legislation.
