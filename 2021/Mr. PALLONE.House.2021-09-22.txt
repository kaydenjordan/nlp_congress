 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and his team for  including several important amendments to this year's National Defense  Authorization Act, and that includes my amendment that requires a  report from the Department of Defense addressing instances where U.S.  security assistance is given to foreign military units known to have  committed gross human rights violations.   This amendment specifically focuses on the section 333 Building  Partner Capacity Program, which has sent enormous sums of American  taxpayer dollars to authoritarian and human rights-abusing regimes.   A prime example of the program's problematic nature is the $100  million given to Azerbaijani President Aliyev's regime in fiscal years  2018 and 2019. As Azerbaijan was still receiving equipment and training  from the U.S. military, they began a deadly attack against Nagorno- Karabakh, or Artsakh, on September 27, that led to the death of  thousands and the displacement of so many more.   Passage of this amendment sends a clear signal that the United States  takes seriously its democratic norms and commitment to peace by  ensuring oversight of our security assistance. I hope it leads to  future restraint from aiding and tolerating similar regimes in the  future, especially when their actions are aimed at destabilizing a  fellow democracy.
