 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier this week, Apple unveiled its  latest innovation, the Vision Pro. It is a mixed-reality headset that  the company claims will blend together our virtual and physical worlds.  Now, if you have seen this device, you might think it looks like an  overpriced pair of ski goggles, but the implications for this  technology are remarkable.   Think about how far we have come in a few short decades. Thirty years  ago, hardly anyone owned a cell phone, and even fewer were familiar  with the concept of the World Wide Web; but, since then, everything has  changed. We have gone from clunky desktop computers to smart phones and  smart watches and now a headset that will transform your living room  into a virtual playground--a virtual playground. Think about that. You  can share it with just about anyone in the world--anyone--even  potential sexual predators.   And therein lies the problem. In the face of an unprecedented wave of  technological innovation, one thing has remained the same: Our Nation's  online safety laws are stuck in the last century. Over the past three  decades, Congress has given tech and social media companies free rein  to police themselves, and they have failed. Now our children are paying  the price for these failures. It is time for Congress to step up and  protect them.   Today, more than one out of three teenagers say they use social media  ``almost constantly.'' That is by design. Big Tech giants and online  platforms, powered by advanced algorithms, are capturing the minds and  eyeballs of our kids and grandkids. And the more our children scroll,  the more these platforms rake in profits.   Now, of course, social media can benefit everyone, including young  people. They can learn new skills and hobbies and really connect with  valuable friends. But as most parents, grandparents, and public health  experts will tell you, social media has a dark side.   Last month, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued an extraordinary  warning--the first of its kind--to parents across America. Dr. Murthy  said that social media can ``have a profound risk of harm to the mental  health and well-being of children and adolescents.'' From anxiety and  depression to body image issues, social media is exacerbating the youth  mental health crisis in America.   But there is another far more disturbing part of this story because,  when it comes to online platforms like Instagram or TikTok, only a few  taps and clicks stand between our children and online predators who  hope to exploit them. Just yesterday, the Wall Street Journal published  a report on what they described as a ``vast pedophile network'' that  has been thriving on Instagram for years--years. According to the  report, Instagram not only hosts photos and videos of children being  sexually exploited; it actively promotes the despicable content to  other users.   Predators even connect with one another through a set of grotesque  hash tags that I will not repeat on the Senate floor, and the worst of  these predators try to target new, unsuspecting victims and persuade  them to share explicit images of themselves.   Let me tell you about one of the victims. His name was James Woods.  Last year James, who, at 17, was getting ready to graduate from high  school, died by suicide after being targeted in a scheme known as  ``sextortion.'' In James' case, he was contacted through Instagram by a  user claiming to be a young woman. The conversation quickly turned  sexual, and the user asked James to share explicit images of himself.  Unfortunately, he complied.   Moments later, he received another message, this time with a threat:  Send me $6,000, or else those images will be sent to everyone you know.   James was terrified. He tried to reason with this predator by sending  him a $100 gift card, but the threats continued. He received 200  messages in a single day, some threatening to hurt him or kill his  family. One message read: ``You might as well end it now.''   Soon after, James' father arrived home and discovered his son's  lifeless body. James had his entire life ahead of him. He was a star on  the school track team. He hoped to pursue a career in law enforcement.  But now he is gone.   You would think that Instagram, the platform through which James was  exploited, would bear some responsibility--some responsibility--for  this horrifying tragedy. After all, this predator used Instagram to  contact James, solicit explicit images, and then threaten his life. But  you would be wrong. Under our existing laws of the United States-- namely, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, written nearly  30 years ago--platforms like Instagram have near total immunity from  being held legally accountable for this type of atrocity. That has to  change.   Earlier this year, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I  pledged that we would take vigorous action to hold Big Tech accountable  and stop the online exploitation of children. As part of this effort, I  introduced a bill, the Stop CSAM Act. CSAM stands for ``child sexual  abuse material.''   This legislation would create a civil remedy against any online  platform that facilitates the exchange of child sexual abuse materials.  In other words, if the Stop CSAM Act were law today, James' parents  would be able to take legal action against Instagram for failing to  fulfill their basic responsibility to protect their customers.   Importantly, my Stop CSAM Act is one of five pieces of legislation  that has been reported out of the Judiciary Committee during this  Congress to stop the exploitation of children online. Every single one  of these pieces of legislation was reported from the Senate Judiciary  Committee by a unanimous vote--all five.   Mr. President, you personally, and my colleagues, take a look at the  members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. That is the most amazing  display of political extremes--right and left and center, for that  matter--that you will find in Congress. All members of the committee  voted in favor of these five pieces of legislation to protect our kids  from what is going on on the cell phones across America.   We had testimony from parents--one sad story after another of  children who, because of sextortion, bullying, harassment, goading,  took their own lives. The mothers sat in the front row, each holding a  color photo, a school photo, of their kids. With tears in their eyes,  they begged us to do something to protect these kids and to protect  America from this exploitation.   When I read about tragedies like the death of James Woods, it is  clear: We shouldn't waste another minute. I believe that we should call  this measure to the floor of the Senate immediately. There is no reason  to wait. In fact, there is a danger if we do.  [[Page S2017]]    Let's see if the unanimous opinion of the Senate Judiciary  Committee--Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals--can  bring us to a bipartisan conclusion now. Wouldn't the American people  be happy to hear that, that finally the Senate came together on a  bipartisan basis to protect innocent children from sexploitation, from  these child sexual abuse materials, and from the sort of situation that  James Woods faced, the harassment, with no accountability for the  social media platform?   We need to move quickly to do this. There is no excuse. Let's not  wait on some other measure. These are five good, strong bills that will  say to the social media industry once and for all: You bear  responsibility for what goes on. And when you are responsible for it,  you can be held accountable in a court of law.   Parents and victims can't do this on their own. They have learned  that over and over. They need someone to help, and that would be the  U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives and the President. I  hope every Member of the Senate will join us in protecting our kids  from this new world of threats.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate will vote to confirm  Molly Silfen to the Court of Federal Claims. Ms. Silfen is an  experienced litigator and public servant who is highly qualified to  serve as a judge on the Court of Federal Claims. She earned her B.S.  from Yale College and her J.D. from Harvard Law School. After beginning  her legal career in 2006 as an associate attorney at Finnegan,  Henderson, Farabow, Garrett, and Dunner, she clerked for Judge Alan D.  Lourie on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit from 2008  to 2010.   During her time in private practice, Ms. Silfen handled patent and  trademark issues for both individual patent owners and major companies.  She performed a significant amount of pro bono work as well, including  representing a veteran seeking benefits from the Department of Veterans  Affairs.   Ms. Silfen joined the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as an  associate solicitor in 2013 and remains there today. In her work with  the USPTO, she regularly briefs and argues appeals before the Federal  Circuit and other Federal courts of appeals. She has argued 23 appeals  before Federal courts of appeals and has served as counsel of record in  five merits cases before the Supreme Court.   While with the USPTO, Ms. Silfen has also been detailed to the Civil  Division of the Department of Justice and to the Senate Judiciary  Committee as part of former Senator Leahy's staff on the Subcommittee  on Intellectual Property.   Ms. Silfen's extensive experience at all levels of the Federal  judicial system, along with her commitment to public service, will make  her an exceptional addition to the Court of Federal Claims. I urge my  colleagues to join me in voting for her confirmation.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray)  and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily  absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
