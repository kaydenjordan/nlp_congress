 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge passage of my amendment  which supports the Army's unfunded requirements request for improved  munitions precision.   The continued development of missile cooling technology, which  releases a refrigerant at predetermined temperatures, maintains the  integrity of missile electronics when fired. This improves flight  control, extends range, and provides greater targeting precision.   My amendment improves current and future missile systems, furthering  our ability to reach every corner of the world in defense of our  Nation.   As we grapple with threats from adversaries such as North Korea,  Russia, and Iran and execute our counter-ISIL campaign, our military  deserves the greatest technological edge so that our troops never find  themselves in a fair fight.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this important  amendment to maintain America's military technology superiority as our  servicemembers bravely safeguard our Nation.
