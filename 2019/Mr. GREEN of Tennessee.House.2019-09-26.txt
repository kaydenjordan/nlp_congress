 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3710, the Cybersecurity Vulnerability  Remediation Act. This bill enables CISA to develop important mitigation  protocols for vulnerabilities existing in outdated software and  hardware through collaboration with public- and private-sector  entities.   This important legislation, introduced by Ms. Jackson Lee of Texas,  helps ensure that we maintain security in our networks.   I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  doing so.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption to the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2589, the Unifying DHS  Intelligence Enterprise Act.   In December of 2003, I had the unbelievable opportunity to fly with  our Nation's elite special operations aviation unit, the Night  Stalkers, in conjunction with our Army's tier I counterterrorism unit  in the capture of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It was the highlight  of my Army career.   Whether it was on missions in Iraq or hunting Osama bin Laden in  Afghanistan, I realized that having a systematic way to gather,  process, analyze, and disseminate intelligence information was critical  to our success on the battlefield. That experience encouraged me to  introduce this bill back in May so that DHS can best fulfill its very  important mission to keep America safe.   This bill requires the Department's chief intelligence officer, or  CINT, to establish a homeland intelligence doctrine for the Department,  and it requires the CINT to maintain a dedicated staff.   In the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, the  Department was established to consolidate 22 existing Federal agencies  and reshape the domestic intelligence and counterterrorism structure of  the U.S.   Over the years, DHS has matured and refined its intelligence  enterprise. Significant improvements have been made, but there is not  yet complete unity among the various intelligence offices within all  the component agencies.   In 2016, the House Committee on Homeland Security released a  comprehensive review of the Department's use of intelligence to counter  terrorist attacks. They recognized that DHS, ``has improved its ability  to protect the homeland against terrorist threats over time, but major  gaps remain.'' They prescribed over 30 recommendations to the  Department for improved intelligence sharing.   The goal of H.R. 2589 is to ensure all of the component entities at  DHS are speaking the same language, using the same trade craft, and  disseminating their products to the appropriate stakeholders, which  include both intelligence communities and State and local partners.  This legislation will help professionalize the DHS intelligence  enterprise by establishing a shared intelligence doctrine.   Across DHS, dedicated border and immigration agents are gathering  information on individuals seeking to enter the United States. Threats  to transportation systems and critical infrastructure are gathered and  assessed, and real-time cyber threats to the government and private  networks are analyzed.   The incredible differences in the agencies of the Department create  natural barriers to information flow. Given this diversity of missions,  it is vital that component intelligence offices are working together,  sharing information, and vetting that information against intelligence  community holdings.   As a former member of the Army special operations task forces, I know  the value of synchronized intelligence processes in order to connect  the dots and successfully carry out a mission. This bill also  authorizes the continued dedication to providing staff to the chief  intelligence officer ensuring that this distinct mission continues to  provide the value necessary to support the intelligence enterprise.   I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  doing so.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, there is bipartisan support for  a professional, coordinated Department of Homeland Security  intelligence architecture.   I want to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Rogers for  supporting this legislation and bringing it to the floor. It is time  for DHS to be able to function with the same precision in the handling  of intelligence information as our warriors in the Department of  Defense, and I am honored to have the opportunity to help them do so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3691, the TRANSLATE Act.  TSA has an important mission to protect air travel and is responsible  for the security of nearly 440 Federalized airports. Across these  airports, TSA screens more than 2 million passengers a day.   To accomplish this mission, TSA relies on materials like signs,  websites, and videos to communicate screening information to passengers  and airport employees prior to their arrival at TSA checkpoints.   H.R. 3691 requires TSA to develop and implement a plan to identify  languages other than English that are primary  [[Page H8020]]  languages of travelers at major airports and determine steps to improve  communication in those languages at those same airports.   Also included in the plan will be steps for TSA to improve  communication with individuals that are hearing and vision impaired or  may experience other barriers to understanding TSA's communication.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Titus for her work supporting  TSA's mission to secure air travel. I urge support of the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers for this, and  I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I am fully in support of this bill. Again, I want to  just give accolades to the gentlewoman who put it together and  recognize that this is fantastic, and we need to get it done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3675, the Trusted  Traveler Reconsideration and Restoration Act of 2019.   This bill, sponsored by my colleague, Representative   John Katko,  seeks to ensure the rights of travelers who have erroneously had their  trusted traveler status revoked.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Katko for his leadership on this  bipartisan bill, and for Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Rogers'  commitment to bringing this bill to the floor today.  [[Page H8021]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, I reaffirm my support for the  bill. I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3694, the Helping  Families Fly Act, sponsored by my friend and colleague from Arizona,  Representative Lesko.   H.R. 3694 requires TSA to implement a number of reforms aimed at  improving the travel experience for pregnant women and families with  young children, including specific assistance by TSA officers at  checkpoints and new training for officers.   Representative Lesko's bill will ensure that TSA works closely with  transportation stakeholders to make pregnant travelers and families  aware of screening procedures and options for assistance.   This good-government bill recognizes that TSA is oftentimes seen as  the face of the Department of Homeland Security, screening more than 2  million passengers a day. As such, it is incumbent upon the agency to  ensure its services are working for all travelers.   H.R. 3694 will improve the passenger experience for pregnant women  and families with young children. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on  the bill. I renew my support for the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3722.   The opioid epidemic continues to devastate communities across this  Nation. Approximately 115 Americans die every single day from an opioid  overdose. Opioid abuse doesn't discriminate. It touches people from  every age group, race, class, gender, background, and economic status.                                time  1430    Some Americans become addicted after taking doctor-prescribed doses  for an injury or a surgery, while others try them in illicit forms and  become dependent.   Another disturbing trend we are seeing is illicit drugs being laced  with fentanyl, which is 100 times more powerful than morphine,  frequently leading to accidental overdose.   We have seen estimates concluding that more than 2 million of our  fellow Americans are addicted to opioids, and, as a physician, I have  seen lives devastated, families disrupted and often destroyed as the  addict's behavior drives them to horrific acts.   As we work to confront this epidemic, we must prevent  overprescription, stop the illicit flow into the United States, and  treat those Americans who have become addicted.   This bill would authorize a joint task force within the Department of  Homeland Security to organize opioid interdiction efforts across  multiple components and agencies in a unity-of-effort campaign. It  would also leverage domestic and international partners to provide a  multifaceted approach to tackling the issue.   Most illicit opioids are produced in China and smuggled by mail,  where vulnerabilities in the postal system are exploited. U.S. Customs  and Border Protection is also seeing increased traffic from Mexico with  opioids hidden in vehicles and cargo entering through the U.S. ports.   The joint task force approach to the opioid epidemic is effective  because it fosters information sharing and exchange between all  relevant stakeholders to combat the opioid epidemic.  [[Page H8024]]    While there are no quick or easy solutions to this epidemic, H.R.  3722 is a step in the right direction. I support this bill, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers for  the bill. I renew my support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3246, the Traveling  Parent Screening Consistency Act, introduced by Representative Van  Taylor.   As many of us can attest, the life of a parent with young or infant  children can be quite stressful, particularly while traveling.  Screening by the Transportation Security Administration at airports can  make this even more stressful with inconsistent screening requirements  for the essentials like formula, breast milk, deionized water, and  juice.   This bill seeks to address any potential inconsistency in screening  requirements by requiring the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a review to determine if TSA needs to update or revise its  protocols for screening and information sharing.   In addition to this determination, the GAO will also assess how  passengers' complaints are monitored for trends and will include  recommendations for how TSA can improve its practices for screening  these items.   I would like commend Representative Taylor for his work on this  legislation that addresses an issue brought to him by one of his  constituents and is, likely, experienced by many new parents.   H.R. 3246 will be a tremendous benefit to the passenger experience  for new families, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Taylor).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on  the bill. I renew my support. I recommend my colleagues support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3526.   The men and women in uniform at U.S. Customs and Border Protection  are tasked with an incredibly important mission. Every day they protect  our Nation from transnational criminal organizations, human  traffickers, and terrorists who wish to exploit vulnerabilities at our  Nation's borders. To execute this critical mission, CBP has developed a  cadre of subject matter experts who are well-versed in counter criminal  network operations. These experts work tirelessly at our seaports,  airports, and land border crossings honing their skills, stopping the  flow of illicit goods and people, and creating actionable intelligence.   Given that CBP is uniquely positioned on our Nation's front line, it  is alarming that the CBP does not have the authority to participate in  counterterrorist network activities both domestically and  internationally. CBP lacks the statutory authority to assign personnel  to such specialized details and liaison assignments with a national  security force.   H.R. 3526 corrects this deficiency by giving the commissioner of CBP  the statutory authority to assign personnel to these specialized task  forces and collaborate with appropriate Federal, State, local, and  Tribal entities to disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal  organizations and foreign terrorist networks.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3526 will lead to enhanced information sharing and  an increase in intelligence-driven enforcement operations. I encourage  my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers on this bill.  I renew my recommendation that my colleagues support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3106, the Domestic and International  Terrorism DATA Act, introduced by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson). I almost got up, Mr. Speaker, when you said, ``the gentleman  from Mississippi,'' because I happen to be in a small town just a few  miles away from where the chairman lives.   H.R. 3106, as amended, passed with bipartisan support during the  Committee on Homeland Security markup in July. I thank the gentleman  from New York (Mr. King) for developing the amendment in the nature of  a substitute, which passed unanimously, and broadened the scope of the  bill to cover all forms of terrorism.   A central lesson from the September 11, 2001, terror attacks is that  government cannot have a siloed approach to homeland security threats.  The importance of a broad ideological focus was stressed again during a  Committee on Homeland Security hearing on global terror threats held on  September 10, 2019.   There is bipartisan agreement on the need for more reliable public  reporting on both domestic and international terror threats to the  homeland.   The report mandated in the legislation requires the Department of  Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the  Department of Justice to produce an annual report for 6 years on a  number of investigative aspects of domestic and international  terrorism. Access to reliable data will help policymakers and the  public assess trends, emerging threats, and available resources.   The threat from international terrorism also remains high. Hundreds  of U.S. citizens were radicalized by ISIS and sought to travel to the  battlefield to carry out attacks in the homeland.   Mr. Speaker, 18 years after the horrific 9/11 terror attacks, both  al-Qaida and ISIS remain intent on targeting the United States. We were  also recently reminded by the direct threat posed by Iran when a  Hezbollah operative was arrested last week in New Jersey for allegedly  plotting attacks against the United States.   The broad range of ideologically based hatred and societal obsession  with violence has left scars across the country. Obtaining a  comprehensive threat picture and reliable data is essential for  developing legislation and determining what additional resources may be  necessary.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson)  for his willingness to work with us to ensure that the reporting  requirements in the bill track all forms of terrorism. I strongly  recommend that my colleagues support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my support for the  bill. I ask my colleagues to support it, and I thank, again, the  chairman and the ranking member for great collaboration that made this  an excellent bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.    I am in its present form.    Mr. Speaker, many of us made the trip this  summer to Normandy to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day  landings. It was an amazing opportunity.   Standing among the rows of crosses and Stars of David in the U.S.  cemetery, I was reminded of the sacrifices of our incredible American  warriors.   Standing there ignited my memory of 24 years of wearing the uniform.  I was reminded of my driver when I was a young second lieutenant. He  was 4 foot 11 and had a heart the size of his home State of New York. I  recalled my radio telephone operators, both from California. When I was  a commander in the 82nd Airborne Division, they stuck to me like glue  and would try so often to sneak food in so that we could eat while we  were all rigged up in our airborne gear before an airborne operation.   Of course, my friends from the war flashed into my mind. I will never  forget watching the flag-draped coffin of a fellow Army Ranger carried  into the back of a C-17 in Bagram, Afghanistan for his last trip home.   Our veterans deserve everything that we can give them. However, in  the past few years, despite improvements in the VA electronic health  records system, problems and delays still remain. For example, the very  benefits that Congresswoman Underwood in this bill advances for illegal  aliens flooding across our southern border, our veterans don't have  those benefits. Let me say that again: This bill, without the amendment  I am asking this body to consider, advances healthcare services to  illegal aliens before it does to our American heroes.   The VA Secretary testified before Congress that it will take his  department 10 years to fully deploy this new system.   Mr. Speaker, I have the deployment schedule for the VA from their  website, and I will include this in the Record at a later date.   Mr. Speaker, this timeline states that our veterans will not get an  interoperable electronic health record at all VA healthcare facilities  until September 20 of 2027.   VA medical facilities serving veterans in Virginia won't get it until  2024. Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and New England won't be  fully operational until 2026. It won't be until 2027 that VA medical  facilities in Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois are fully operational.  Veterans in my home State of Tennessee won't benefit from interoperable  electronic health records until 2023.   Yet, without this amendment, without my amendment, we are going to  give it to illegal aliens within 90 days.   Mr. Speaker, these are the same men and women who, when they raised  their right hand and took that oath, wrote a blank check for America,  for every person in this room, that was cashable, redeemable, all the  way up until their life, their very life.   I think our constituents across this great country would find it  appalling that we are about to give this health record system to  illegal immigrants before our veterans receive it.   All this amendment does is ensure that our veterans get this service  first. If you vote against this motion to recommit, you are giving an  electronic health medical record to illegal aliens before our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
