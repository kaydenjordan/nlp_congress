 Madam President, I rise today in strong support for  the confirmation of California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, to  be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services.   I am absolutely confident that Mr. Becerra has the knowledge, the  experience, the skills, and, just as importantly, the values and  principles required of this job--a job that will play a key role in  beating the coronavirus and tackling the urgent issues of equity and  affordability now facing our healthcare system.   I am especially confident in my assessment of Xavier Becerra because  I have known him personally for years, both as a former colleague and  as a  [[Page S1599]]  friend. I first met then-Congressman Becerra in the House of  Representatives, where he served for over two decades with myself and  the Presiding Officer and others, and where he was a champion for the  healthcare rights of the American people, working overtime to make sure  that every American had access to quality, affordable healthcare.   We served together in the House Democratic leadership, and we served  together on the House Ways and Means Committee. So I have had an  opportunity to see his legislative talents up front and also to witness  his love of service to our country.   We worked together to halt a number of proposals that maybe some of  our Republican colleagues here in the Senate were pushing for,  including the proposal that continuously appeared in the House  Republican budget to voucherize the Medicare Program. One of the former  Speakers of the House wanted to essentially provide seniors on Medicare  with a voucher and send them out into more of a private marketplace. It  would have ended up putting our seniors more at risk. So together we  did battle that idea.   We served together on what was known as the Congressional Joint  Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, also known as the  ``supercommittee,'' and known to some as the ``not-so-super  committee.'' I saw him work to try to achieve agreements on some of the  biggest challenges facing our country, but, like him, we both agreed  that we weren't going to do that at the expense of protecting Medicare  for seniors, protecting Medicaid as an absolutely essential healthcare  safety net for tens of millions of Americans, and we were not prepared  to provide more tax cuts to the very wealthiest of Americans.   It is in that last effort where Xavier Becerra, I think, really  distinguished himself in the House, when it came to the issue of equity  and healthcare. I know the Presiding Officer knows well the battles we  all went in together in the development and passage of the Affordable  Care Act, and it was that that really defined Mr. Becerra's legacy in  the House.   He championed the Affordable Care Act from the very start. He helped  both to write and to pass this landmark law that now helps tens of  millions of our fellow Americans, and after leaving the Congress, he  led the charge to defend the Affordable Care Act against the Texas case  before the Supreme Court of the United States.   Now, I know a lot of our Republican colleagues have also spent years  fighting the Affordable Care Act. We have seen that play out here in  the U.S. Senate within the last couple years. But the reality is the  Affordable Care Act is very important to the overwhelming majority of  the American people who support it and is an essential lifeline to  quality, affordable healthcare for tens of millions of Americans. And  it is that that Mr. Becerra fought to pass and which he has fought to  defend against constant attacks in the courts.   There is no question that Xavier Becerra fights for what he believes  is right, as he should, but that has never prevented him from working  across the aisle to get things done. As the attorney general in the  State of California, he has repeatedly partnered with Republicans to  solve the pressing issues facing our fellow citizens.   He builds bridges every day and has worked across party lines to  expand access to COVID-19 treatments, to confront the opioid crisis,  and to address the dangers of vaping and smoking among our Nation's  youth.   His record shows that Attorney General Becerra fights for what is  important to the people he represents, not the party he belongs to, and  he has demonstrated it by example time and time again with his ability  to bridge deep divisions, even during this time of division. I know  that he will fight hard for each and every one of our fellow citizens  and will not look to see whether somebody is a Democrat or a Republican  or from some other party. What he cares about is making sure he is  looking out for the healthcare of every American.   And, at this moment, everyone in this country stands to benefit from  an effective leader at the helm of the Department of Health and Human  Services. Our most pressing task is to contain the spread of COVID-19  and to defeat COVID-19. That requires clear messaging on public health  measures. That requires accelerating the distribution of vaccines and  treatment and testing and making sure we do all of that in an equitable  way. That means safely guiding the opening of our schools, and we all  want our students to get back to school as quickly as possible and as  safely as possible.   As the attorney general of California, he has led one of the largest  departments of justice in the country, and, in that capacity, has stood  up for strong consumer and worker protections throughout this pandemic  and before, and I trust that he will continue to do so for all  Americans as Secretary of HHS, if confirmed.   We know that this public emergency and health crisis has been a blow  to our country. It has also laid bare the fault lines in our healthcare  system in terms of racial inequities, inaccessibility for underserved  communities, and underinvestment in our public health infrastructure.  These issues, of course, predated COVID-19, but we must tackle them  with renewed urgency as we emerge from this crisis.   Mr. Becerra is equipped to root out these disparities, both because  of his knowledge and skill and expertise but also because of his lived  experience. Xavier grew up in a working-class Latino family. He knows  the communities that are hurting most because he has lived in those  communities. He would bring to this important office not only his  expertise and skill but the empathy and the compassion needed to help  those most in need.   Like most of us, Mr. Becerra is also guided and motivated by what  makes him most proud: his family. At his confirmation hearing, he spoke  movingly about his wife and his children, who are all a part of all  that he does. And he spoke about his parents, who traveled to this  country from Mexico seeking a better life, with nothing more than, in  Xavier's words, ``their health and their hope.''   It is that health and that hope that propelled Mr. Becerra into a  life of public service, and it is that health and that hope that will  animate his leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services,  should he be confirmed by this Senate.   He was brought up in a family that believed in and sought the  American dream, and he has spent his life fighting to make that dream  real for families across this Nation. He believes, as I believe, that  that mission requires us to care for the health and safety of each and  every one of our fellow citizens, and I have full confidence that he is  up to the task.   Colleagues, I urge us to confirm the nomination of Xavier Becerra to  be the next Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.    Mr. President, I rise today to support the  confirmation of Isabel Guzman, a dedicated public servant and  successful small businesswoman, to lead the Small Business  Administration.   Small businesses are a cornerstone of Maryland's economy, creating  jobs, driving innovation, and anchoring communities. Isabel Guzman's  extensive leadership experience serving at SBA under the Obama  administration and running her own small businesses positions her well  to support our small business communities as we finish the fight  against the COVID-19 pandemic and address the unique challenges faced  by women- and minority-owned small businesses across Maryland.   In her new role as SBA Administrator, she will inherit an economic  crisis compounded by a mismanaged pandemic that has devastated the  small business community from retail to restaurants and bars to sole- proprietorships. She will be charged not only with administering  critical small business relief programs, including the Economic Injury  Disaster Loan Program and the Paycheck Protection Program, but also  with building back better to shape the environment for a thriving small  business community. I look forward to working closely with her to  ensure that we build an inclusive economy that encourages and supports  local entrepreneurs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 8 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
