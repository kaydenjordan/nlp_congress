 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7776, the  James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2023.   First off, the bill is a win for servicemembers, providing a 4.6  percent pay raise, increased funding for basic housing allowances, and  improved women's healthcare.   The bill also authorizes a range of critical provisions to address  strategic challenges from China and Russia.   We provide $6 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative, $800  million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and $225  million for the Baltic Security Initiative, all of which is much-needed  support for Ukraine and our NATO allies and partners.   As chair of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee, I  am proud of the bipartisan work of our subcommittee members, including  historic reforms to the defense intelligence enterprise, Special  Operations Forces, and our approach to the issue of civilian harm.   The bill authorizes up to $50 million to support NATO Special  Operations Headquarters, an effort that will improve relationships  among Special Operations Forces of NATO countries.   It also establishes an oversight framework for information  operations, ensuring that Congress is notified no later than 48 hours  after DOD approves a new military information support operation, and  the bill delivers on our commitment to address civilian harm.    Mr. Speaker, it requires the establishment of a civilian  protection center of excellence and provides $25 million to implement  the civilian harm mitigation response plan.   Finally, and more importantly, I thank my subcommittee ranking  member, Trent Kelly, for his contribution to this bill and his strong  bipartisan work.   I also thank my subcommittee staff, Shannon Green, Craig Greene, Will  Braden, and Patrick Nevins, and, of course, my MLA Michelle Shevin- Coetzee and defense fellow Charlie Juhl.   Mr. Speaker, it is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.
