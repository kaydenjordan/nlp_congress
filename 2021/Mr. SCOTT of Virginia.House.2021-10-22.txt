 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  716, I call up the bill (H.R. 3110) to amend the Fair Labor Standards  Act of 1938 to expand access to breastfeeding accommodations in the  workplace, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 3110, the PUMP for  Nursing Mothers Act.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, today the House has an opportunity to pass H.R. 3110,  the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers Act, or  the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, a bipartisan bill that would  strengthen workplace protections for nursing mothers.   Nursing mothers should have a clear right to break time and a clean,  private space to pump breast milk at work. As we have heard from health  experts and worker advocates across the country, these basic  accommodations ensure that nursing mothers can balance their work,  their health, and the health of their babies.   Regrettably, many nursing mothers still do not have these  protections. Under current law, millions of workers--including  farmworkers, transportation workers, and teachers--are currently  excluded from Federal protections for nursing employees.   The nursing mothers who are covered by existing law have limited  recourse when their rights are violated.   To close these gaps, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act expands  existing protections for nursing mothers for nearly 9 million employees  who are currently left out. It provides nursing workers with access to  meaningful remedies when employers fail to provide appropriate time and  pumping space.   Importantly, this bill includes an amendment to clarify that  congressional employees are covered by these protections and to address  safety concerns by including airline crew members break time to pump  during a flight.   No working American should be forced to choose between going to work  and staying healthy, so we must take this urgent step to support  nursing workers and strengthen our economy.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy in support of H.R. 3110.                     Statement of Administration Policy     H.R. 3110--PUMP FOR NURSING MOTHERS ACT--Rep. Maloney, D-NY, and 8                                 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.       3110, the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for       Nursing Mothers Act. No new mother should face unfair       treatment in the workplace because their employer refuses to       provide them with reasonable break time and private, clean       space needed to adequately express breast milk while at work,       forcing them to choose between their health and the health of       her child, and earning a paycheck. Yet millions of new       working mothers, disproportionately working mothers of color,       face this challenge every day.        Congress recognized the importance of ensuring that workers       are able to have the time and space they need to express       breast milk by passing section 4207 of the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act, also known as the 2010 Break Time       for Nursing Mothers Act. The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act       would ensure that millions of working mothers previously       excluded from the 2010 Break Time law are protected. By       closing this gap, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act will       ensure millions of nursing mothers have a clear right to pump       at work. Without these protections, nursing mothers face       serious health consequences, including risk of painful       illness and infection, diminished milk supply, or inability       to continue breastfeeding.        H.R. 3110 is a bipartisan bill that would also require       employers to pay an hourly employee for any time spent       pumping if the employee is also working. The legislation       would ensure that nursing mothers have access to remedies       available for other violations of the Fair Labor Standards       Act. Finally, the PUMP Act also gives employers flexibility       to identify solutions that work for their specific business       environment. For example, the bill requires employees to       inform their employers about inadequate space to express       breast milk 10 days before filing suit for violating the       requirement.        The Administration encourages the House to pass this       bipartisan, commonsense legislation and looks forward to       working with the Congress to fill the gaps in the law so that       all new mothers who choose to breastfeed are guaranteed the       workplace protections they deserve.    Madam Speaker, I urge support of the  legislation and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), chair of the  Oversight and Reform Committee and the lead Democratic sponsor of the  bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. Herrera Beutler), the co-chair  of the Maternity Care Caucus and the lead Republican sponsor on the  bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Washington.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood), the co-chair of the Black  Maternal Health Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the co-chair of the  Maternity Care Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Civil Rights  and Human Services Subcommittee of the Committee on Education and  Labor.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters  in support of the bill from the AFSCME and the Association of Flight  Attendants-CWA.          American Federation of State, County and Municipal             Employees, AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, October 21, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to vote yes on the PUMP for       Nursing Mothers Act (R.R. 3110). This bill prioritizes both       the physical and economic needs that new mothers must balance       upon returning to work. It strengthens federal employment       standards that protect working women who need break time and       a private space, other than a bathroom, to express breast       milk.        The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) currently requires       employers with more than 50 employees to provide a space for       mothers to either nurse or express breast milk. Covered       employers must also provide reasonable breaks for workers to       nurse. An estimated 8.65 million women of childbearing age       are excluded from these nursing mother protections because       they are not covered by wage and hour standards under the       FLSA. Current law also lacks broader enforcement mechanisms       for workers denied these protections.        H.R. 3110 improves current protections by:        Expanding the number of nursing workers protected by the       law.        Extending the duration of the protections from one year       after the child's birth to two years after the employee gives       birth or begins providing breast milk for a nursing child.        Limiting undue hardship exemption to employers with fewer       than 25 employees, rather than employers with fewer than 50       employees under current law.        Clarifying that banned workers can seek legal and equitable       relief for their employer's failure to provide them with the       needed break times and private space to express milk.        We urge you to stand with working women and their families       by voting to pass H.R. 3110.            Sincerely,                                                Bailey K. Childers,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____    Written Statement of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA),   AFL-CIO Before the United States House of Representatives--September                                  27, 2021         Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, and Members       of Congress: The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA)       AFL-CIO submits this letter to the U.S. House of       Representatives in full support of the Providing Urgent       Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R.       3110).        AFA represents nearly 50,000 Flight Attendants at 17       airlines. Our union has advanced the Flight Attendant       profession for 75 years, beating back discrimination and       improving wages, benefits, working conditions, and aviation       safety, health and security in the aircraft cabin. When the       profession began Flight Attendants could not be married or       pregnant, among other discriminatory conditions of       employment.        For years, AFA has identified the need for federal       protections for nursing Flight Attendants because none exist.       In 2010, the Break Time law, which amended the Fair Labor       Standards Act (FLSA) to require that employers provide       reasonable break time as well as a private place other than a       bathroom to express milk provided a monumental step in the       right direction. However, millions of nursing mothers were       unintentionally left out of this important piece of       legislation. The PUMP Act finally rectifies this oversight       and includes Flight Attendants.        In 2021, AFA conducted a survey of almost 400 Flight       Attendants to understand their perspective on pumping and       expressing breast milk during the course of their work day.       An overwhelming majority (86 percent) of Flight Attendant       respondents indicated that they faced significant obstacles       pumping while on and off duty, as well as in between flights.       As a result, 75 percent of Flight Attendant respondents       decided to quit pumping and expressing breast milk before       they planned to because it was too difficult to find the       time, a private location, a clean environment, and access to       cold storage for their milk.        We support the PUMP Act because it will alleviate many of       these obstacles for nursing Flight Attendant moms to ensure       they have the right, along with the privacy, to pump and       express milk. We realize this is a complex issue for Flight       Attendants who work in an unconventional workplace. However,       we can and should do better to support these nursing mothers       in the workplace.        We urge all members of Congress to vote in support of H.R.       3110, the PUMP Act.            Thank you for your consideration,                                                     Steve Schembs,             Director of Government Affairs, Association of Flight                                               Attendants-CWA (AFA).     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, it has now been more than a decade since Congress  passed critical protections to guarantee nursing workers break time and  private space to express breast milk at work.   As we have heard today from Members on both sides of the aisle, these  protections are essential to protecting the health of nursing workers  and their  [[Page H5809]]  families, yet nursing workers are continuing to suffer from gaps and  weaknesses in the Federal law.   The need to address these gaps is even greater today as our economy  recovers from COVID-19. Millions of workers, particularly working  mothers, are looking to re-enter the workforce after being forced out  of their jobs during the pandemic.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act would provide workers with the peace  of mind that they will not have to choose between returning to work and  protecting themselves and their babies.   Madam Speaker, we have an opportunity to deliver on our promise to  help all workers recover from the pandemic, stay safe, and succeed in  their careers. This legislation will strengthen existing law, improve  the lives of nursing workers across the country, and help our economy  get back on its feet.   We know this program works because the provisions in this bill are  already law on the Federal level and in several States, without the  kind of problems that have been suggested that might happen--those have  not occurred under present law--and without any explosion of lawsuits.  These provisions are already law, and there have not been lawsuits.   The substitute offered by the minority does not expand to as many  mothers as this bill does, and it would actually roll back some  protections they already have.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney) and the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms.  Herrera Beutler) for their leadership on this bipartisan legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the PUMP for Nursing  Mothers Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
