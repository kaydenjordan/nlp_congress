 Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 50th  anniversary of Chez Panisse, the pioneering home of farm-to-table  cooking in Berkeley, CA.   Chez Panisse was founded in 1971 by Alice Waters, then a young  Montessori teacher. She felt that by strengthening her community's  connection to seasonal foods and local growers, she could foster new  ideas and connections. At the core of the new restaurant was a sense of  social responsibility and limitless communal potential.   Guided by Alice Waters' ideals, Chez Panisse spurred a movement of  slow food and local eating, showing that sustainability could ground a  gourmet menu. Alice Waters mentored countless young chefs on her staff,  many of whom went on to open restaurants, found companies, or write  cookbooks of their own. Today, the style pioneered at Chez Panisse is  known as California cuisine.   And Alice Waters never lost sight of the principles that inspired  her. To commemorate the restaurant's 25th anniversary in 1996, she  launched the Chez Panisse Foundation, which supports organic gardening  and culinary education in schools. Thousands of schools across the  world now benefit from the curriculum developed through her Edible  Schoolyard Project.   Chez Panisse is an icon of the California culinary scene, offering a  testament to the fruits of eating locally and sustainably. I  congratulate Alice Waters and all the staff of Chez Panisse on this  remarkable anniversary and send my best wishes for the decades to  come.                            ____________________
