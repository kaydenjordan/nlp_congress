 Mr. President, I rise to mark the new security  cooperation agreement through the Department of Defense's State  Partnership Program between the Minnesota National Guard and the  Kingdom of Norway, which will be celebrated in Minnesota on Saturday,  February 4, 2023. This partnership will provide a key avenue to deter  aggression and assist in both of our nation's national security while  broadening and deepening our long-standing relationship.   Norway has been critical to Minnesota's heritage and culture ever  since the first Norwegian settlement was established in Spring Grove  back in the early 1850s, a few years before Minnesota officially became  a State. Today, Minnesota is the proud home of more than 860,000  Norwegian Americans. Some of our most beloved Minnesotans have been of  Norwegian ancestry, including my late friend and mentor, Vice President  Walter Mondale. At the end of last year, we had the honor of welcoming  Her Majesty Queen Sonja to Minneapolis to celebrate the opening of  Norway House's new Innovation and Cultural Center.   In addition to our cultural heritage, Minnesota and Norway share a  strong, time-tested military relationship. In 1973, Norwegian Home  Guard's Major General Herluf Nygaard invited the chief of the National  Guard, Major General Francis S. Greenlief, to visit their Home Guard.  What came out of that meeting was the Norwegian Reciprocal Troop  Exchange, also known as NOREX.   Through this program, members of the Minnesota National Guard and the  Norwegian Home Guard have gotten the opportunity to participate in  field training exercises with an appropriate emphasis on winter  tactical training. For Minnesota guardsmen, it has meant skiing through  the mountains of Norway and sleeping in tents and snow shelters. For  Norway's soldiers, it has meant winter training at Camp Ripley. Every  participant is taken in as a guest by a local family, making NOREX a  true cultural exchange.   For 50 years, the program has strengthened the militaries of both our  nations while fostering goodwill and lifelong friendships. This new  State Partnership Program brings with it the opportunity to build on  that progress while offering reassurance to our friends throughout the  globe and deterring our foes. This partnership will promote and deepen  trust, familiarity, and interoperability between Minnesota and Norway.   Norway is one of Minnesota's best friends around the world. They have  stood with us. We have stood with them. And we will continue to stand  together. Our friendship is unshakeable. Our progress toward initiating  this new State Partnership Program is a testament to that.                            ____________________
