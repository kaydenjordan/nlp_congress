 Madam Speaker, we are here today because for the  victims of Uvalde, it is too late; for the victims of Parkland, it is  too late; for the victims of Sandy Hook, it is too late; and for the  victims of Columbine, it is too late.   Constituents from my district are still reeling from recent gun  violence incidents. We all saw the images of people running desperately  away from the shooter at the subway station in Sunset Park. I am tired  of watching again and again my constituents suffer from horrific acts  of gun violence.   This legislation is a necessary step to prevent gun violence from  happening in our schools, places of worship, grocery stores, malls, and  public transportation. Moreover, it imposes stronger regulations on  those who can buy these weapons of war.   Congress cannot be too late anymore. Enough is enough.
