 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3400.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I am most pleased to be here today to  manage consideration of this appropriations bill package. This includes  the fiscal year 2019 bills for the Subcommittee on Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies; Financial Services and General  Government; Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies; as well as Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies.   To distill it down, this evening we are taking up Interior, Financial  Services, Ag, and THUD--or Transportation Housing Development. The  opportunity to move forward with a package of appropriations bills, all  of which have moved through our committee with strong support, is a  good place to be.   I have long believed that a return to regular order, where we vote  these appropriations bills out of committee with bipartisan support,  and then bring them to the floor, as we are doing this evening, is  important for our process.   I think all Members of the Senate should have an opportunity to  debate appropriations bills and offer amendments. We haven't had this  opportunity for some years prior to this. The occupant of the Chair, a  member of the Appropriations Committee, knows we have been without  process when it comes to our appropriations bills. It is now time for  us not only to return to regular order but to allow other Members of  this body who do not sit on the Appropriations Committee the  opportunity to weigh in on these priorities.   I am particularly pleased, as chairman of the Interior Appropriations  Subcommittee, to be on the floor today. This is actually the first time  the Interior bill has been before the full Senate since fiscal year  2010. Fiscal year 2010 was the last time we saw an interior bill on the  floor, so this is kind of a significant day for us. If this weren't  such a dignified setting, I would say that deserves a round of  applause. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.   It is an important example of the commitment both sides have made to  create an environment where we can work through the tough issues on a  bipartisan basis. That was exactly what we saw within the full  committee--working through the subcommittee, working through the full  committee, and now being able to bring these measures to the floor.   I will defer to the chairmen of the relevant subcommittees to discuss  the specifics of each of their bills as we move through consideration  of this appropriations package. But I wanted to take a little bit of  time this evening to share some information about the Interior  appropriations bill for my colleagues.   I also want to thank and acknowledge the good work of my ranking  member on the committee, Senator Udall. He has been a good partner to  work with. Both of us recognize this is not everything we would have  wanted it to be, but it was a good, collaborative, well-worked process.   Within Interior, we have a very broad scope of responsibilities. We  have the oversight for all of the major Federal land management  agencies. We have the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land  Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Forest Service, the  Environmental Protection Agency--all very significant accounts. We also  have a side in Interior that many of my colleagues forget but that  rests within Interior, and that is the oversight for our budget for our  Native peoples, our American Indians, and Alaskan Natives. We provide  funding in this measure for essential Indian health, education, and  resource management programs through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and  the Indian Health Service.    There is funding for cultural institutions. Again, this is an area  that people don't necessarily think that Interior has our role here,  but we have oversight of the budgets for the Smithsonian Institution,  the National Gallery of Art, the National Endowment for the Arts, and  the National Endowment for the Humanities. It is a pretty broad  spectrum here.   The Interior appropriations bill provides $35.85 billion for fiscal  year 2019. This is $600 million more than last year. I wish to thank  Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy. The increased allocation that  we saw for the Interior bill was really important as we assembled this  bipartisan bill. This additional funding allowed us to provide program  increases that were necessary. In fact, they were absolutely necessary.   There are fire suppression accounts. We know we are in the midst of  fire season. It is bad and most likely getting worse. We have been able  to provide an additional $500 million for fire suppression.   We also provide an additional $109 million for contract support costs  in Indian Country. These are obligated expenses from the Federal  Government to those who provide for those services in Indian Country.   We also provide $115 million for staffing costs that are associated  with new healthcare facilities that are operated by IHS or by Tribes.  Again, it is under compact agreements.   Some would look and say that this is a significant bump, but I would  direct colleagues' attention to how we allocated that. Again, it is in  accounts where we are obligated either by compact or, in the instance  of fire suppression funding, it recognizes that we are dealing with the  inherent unpredictability and the dangers of fire.   The fiscal year 2019 Interior bill adopts a similar approach to the  enacted fiscal year 2018 Interior bill. We rejected what we felt were  unwarranted decreases that had been proposed in the budget, and we make  investments. We make investments in the highest priorities,  particularly infrastructure improvements and investments for our land  management agencies and within Indian Country and also infrastructure  investments in wastewater and drinking water improvements.   We have recently celebrated the 100th anniversary of our National  Park Service. Last year, we provided a significant increase for our  national parks construction program. It was the largest percentage  increase ever, but we build on that in this measure, recognizing the  significant work, the significant maintenance, and the backlog that our  National Park Service faces. We have an obligation. So addressing it  has been a priority in this bill.   In the two main agencies that deliver services for the Indian  community--this is the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health  Service--we restored proposed cuts in critical program funding. We  increase funding for the IHS facilities program for construction,  maintenance, and sanitation facilities improvement. We provide  substantial funding for the BIA to help with the construction of Indian  schools, irrigation systems, and public safety facilities.   For both accounts, we provide fully estimated levels of contract  support costs, and we maintain an indefinite appropriations account  structure so that if the costs are higher than estimated, we are not in  a situation where we are robbing Peter to pay Paul--taking from one  account within IHS to fund the other. We are addressing that bad  practice that we have seen previously.   Also, within Indian Health Service, we provide additional resources  for grants to Tribes for combating the opioid crisis. We know full well  that we are facing a crisis throughout the country, but in so many of  our Native communities on our reservations, the situation is  particularly dire.   We had a lot of conversation on this floor about wildland fire  management and how we end the practice of what we call ``wildfire  borrowing,'' which is, effectively, waiting to see how much fire  suppression costs are going to impact us. If it was a particularly bad  year, you would take funding from other accounts within the Forest  Service, whether it was prescriptive management programs or whether it  was recreational permits. We know that we needed to end this practice  of fire borrowing, and we have worked to do that previously.   Within our appropriations bill, on the wildfire management programs,  we provided a total of $4.35 billion for the Department of Interior and  the Forest Service. We fully fund the 10-year average for firefighting  costs, and we provide $900 million in additional suppression funds  above the 10-year average, based on the recent catastrophic seasons and  our latest forecasting models. You hope to get that number right, but  this new path that we are on for how we deal with wildfire suppression  cost is an important one.  [[Page S5124]]    A big priority in this body is for conservation and making sure that  we are doing right by our lands, and we have included $425 million for  the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This is equal to the enacted  level.   Within that account, we are generous to the stateside program. We  have, in my view, tended toward greater acquisition on the Federal side  over the years. I think that is a direction that was not what LWCF was  intended to do. We have been working to make sure that we don't have  the inequity and the disparity between the State side and Federal side.    We also provide additional funding for recreational access and the  American Battlefield Protection Program. I think we took a very  commonsense approach to the EPA's budget. We focused resources on  programs that do very specific and concrete things to help with that  mission set, if you will, of the EPA, and that is, basically, to  improve the quality of the environment for the public--clean water and  clean water.   The bill does provide additional funding to States that have  delegated responsibility for environmental programs through State- specific grants. It provides an increase above last year's level for  the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State  Revolving Fund. These are the SRF funds. They help to facilitate the  critical water infrastructure in communities across the country. I  think there is great recognition that this is an area where we can  always do more.   The WIFIA Program, which leverages Federal funds for water  infrastructure projects, receives $63 million. When you take the WIFIA  funds and you combine this with the SRS, the bill really does give the  EPA a very strong suite of tools to improve the quality of life for  people around the country.   We provide for additional funding for PILT funding, and $500 million  is the fully estimated amount needed for this program in 2019. We  maintain the subcommittee's commitment to help local communities  improve county roads, maintain public safety, and provide funding for  schools using funding from the PILT Program.   As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, when we think about  all of the things that are under the purview of Interior  appropriations, we also did right by our ``Smithsonians'' by ensuring  that our arts are appropriately funded as well.   I will stand before you and tell you that there are a lot of things  that I wish we could have included in this measure, but we have stood  down, if you will, as appropriators, working with my colleague and  friend the ranking member. We do not include new policy provisions that  were not in the fiscal year 2018 enacted bill. We didn't do it. Members  know that because they came to us asking if we could include things,  but we said it is important to our process going forward.   Working with Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy and, again, my  ranking member, Senator Udall, we assembled a package that advanced  unanimously out of the committee. I think that is also historic. To  have an Interior appropriations bill move unanimously through the full  committee is pretty significant. I suggest to you all that this package  that we have assembled warrants the support of the full Senate.   I wish to express again my appreciation for the good working  relationship that I have with Senator Udall. He has a great team.  Rachael, Ryan, and Melissa have been great. We have fabulous folks on  my side, with Leif, Nona, Emy, and Chris. They work hard. They work  very hard. I think they have done a good job in helping to shape this  bill so that it reflects priorities of Members on both sides of the  aisle.   Again, I am very pleased to be on the floor to consider these  important bills. I look forward to working through this process with  all of my colleagues. I think the leader has made it clear that he  wants to complete action on this package expeditiously. So I ask  colleagues to review the bills that we have in front of us, not just  the Interior bill but the full package as well. Get on it, and get us  your amendments. The quicker we can process amendments, the quicker we  can clear them on both sides and arrange for the votes that they may  require.                        Confirmation of Robert Wilkie    Mr. President, if I may, I know my colleague and my ranking member is  here to say just a few words. He can say as many words as he would  like, and I welcome that. But if I may beg the Senator's indulgence and  ask for just a few more moments, I wish to comment on the nomination of  Robert Wilkie, if I may.   About an hour ago or half an hour ago, the Senate confirmed Robert  Wilkie of North Carolina as our Nation's 10th Secretary of Veterans  Affairs. He comes to this position after having served with great  distinction as a Senate staffer. He was on the National Security  Council and was Assistant Secretary of Defense, as well as Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and interim Secretary  of the VA. His father, who passed away last year, was a U.S. Army  veteran, and Mr. Wilkie has served as a U.S. Naval Reserve intelligence  officer. He has great qualifications and strong qualifications for the  position that Mr. Wilkie will soon assume.   I am sure that he has no illusions about it. We certainly don't. This  is a hard job that he has in front of him--a very hard job. The VA has  yet to fully recover from the series of events that are collectively  known as the Phoenix scandal. The Choice Program has been a mess from  its very inception, in my view. It continues to frustrate so many  veterans.   Yes, we all acknowledge that there have been improvements in the  Veterans Benefits Administration, but claims processing still takes way  too long, and proving a claim remains a sore point. Then, to make  matters worse, our veterans and the field staff are stressed by  persistent reports of fatigue and infighting within the VA central  office. Some of these reports are as current, as fresh as last week.    You think about the folks out there. When you are in the field,  really nothing good comes out of dysfunction from the central office.  The media accounts that are out there are suggesting that the  dysfunction is, unfortunately, reaching new heights.   This is a tough time for our new Secretary to enter. He comes into  this position with a mess of old baggage to deal with, and that is  before he even begins to implement new initiatives like the VA MISSION  Act and the modernization of VA's IT infrastructure.   I am sure it is fair to say we want this Secretary to succeed.  Alaskan veterans certainly want the Secretary to succeed. I imagine we  all want the new VA Secretary to succeed.   I think success at the VA means one thing, and that is how we serve  our veterans. We know the sacrifices they have made to our Nation. They  deserve timely, high-quality, caring service.   They do not deserve to fall victim to the kind of internal infighting  that has plagued the VA, and, by all accounts, continues to plague the  VA.   I think that as I look to how success will be achieved for Mr. Wilkie  in his new position, it is going to be all hands on deck; everyone  committed to the mission, ready to get to work to get the VA back on  track. That is really job No. 1.   That, to Mr. Wilkie, I would suggest, means working with your career  staff to achieve the mission. We have been doing that in Alaska. Now,  it has not always been good. There was a time when Alaskan veterans  wanted a card that would allow them to get their care anywhere. They  wanted to get out of the system.   Now I hear all the time, in Alaska, that our veterans want to get  their care from the VA. We all know not all VAs around the country are  equally situated. Perhaps the Alaska VA works better than some, and  there may be reasons for that.   I think one of the reasons is, we are seeing that the career staff in  Alaska cares about our veterans. We have had our problems. We have had  some significant problems at the top. There have been changes in the  VA's senior leadership in Alaska, but we called the problems out. We  brought attention to them, we demanded change, and change occurred.   Today, we have a leadership team that, by all accounts, is doing some  pretty strong work for Alaska's vets. One of the reasons that I think  we are doing well is our senior leadership team works in close  collaboration with the career staff. They are represented by the  American Federation of Government Employees Local 3028. I know  [[Page S5125]]  this because my staff and I meet with management and labor periodically  throughout the year. Management knows I am going to get the straight  scoop from labor, and labor knows that, in my view, it is all about  service to the veterans. No exceptions, no excuses, I just want it  straight. Both sides know I expect them to be collaborating, to be  working together. Both know I measure the quality and the quantity of  collaboration in the oversight of VA's service delivery in Alaska.   That is why I have been especially disturbed by the VA's recent order  restricting the amount of official time the duly elected  representatives of the VA's workforce can spend on collaboration. They  call this official time. I would suggest, this is that time working  with management to make the VA more effective. I would suggest this is  a shortsighted decision. I am especially concerned that it is being  implemented by acting personnel on the very eve of our new Secretary's  swearing in.   We also learned this morning, Government Executive magazine reports  that there is chaos on how this is going to be implemented. When you  think about the things this new Secretary needs, or our veterans need,  they don't need more chaos. We don't need more chaos in an organization  as complex as the VA.   Working to ensure that there is a level of flexibility in operations,  our managers have a certain amount of freedom to keep a system if it is  working. If it is not working, we have got you, but if you think about  how important this is, especially in the VA where labor is defined to  include the physicians, the nurses, the highly trained technologists,  we know full well that these are professionals with very portable skill  sets who can take their experience elsewhere at a moment's notice. We  certainly see that in my State where those skill sets are in high  demand.   We recognize Mr. Wilkie will inherit enough problems on day one. He  has to come into the Department; he needs to win the hearts and the  minds of those who do the work; and a workforce that is upset, in my  judgment, is the last thing he needs.   Now, some may remember that I was skeptical about the VA  Accountability Act, which short-circuited the process for terminating  underperforming VA personnel.   We were told, at the time, this would enable the VA to replace  underperforming managers. Instead, it seems we are seeing some pretty  strong evidence that it is being used to terminate individuals at the  very lowest level. I am concerned that what we may also be seeing is  this is an effort to terminate whistleblowers and others who challenge  the bureaucracy in service to our veterans. I am concerned about that.  I have raised that before; I will raise it again.   I think we all agree it is time to bring the VA into the 21st  century. Collaborating with labor on the quality of product is a whole  lot better than maintaining the contentious top-down, by-the-book,  litigious workplace.   I sincerely hope our new, and I hope transformative, Veterans Affairs  Secretary will take a lesson from the best labor management  relationship practices in the private sector; seek them out, put them  to work on day one, even if that might mean reversing some of the well- meaning or maybe not so well-meaning reforms that have been undertaken  on the eve of his confirmation.   The VA is a people-oriented business. The VA is nothing without its  people. I give my free advice to our Secretary-designate. Your career  people work at the VA to serve our veterans first. Sadly, I think many  are confused about whether they enjoy the support of their senior  leaders in Washington.   These are some sobering words to greet our new Secretary as he takes  on a very important responsibility, but I hope we are all working  together, all working forward to ensure that Mr. Wilkie goes down in  the VA's history as a good, strong leader. I offer my best to him as he  moves forward.   I am pleased again to begin the kickoff for this appropriations  package, and I look forward to engaging in debate of good issues and a  good, positive result at the end.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the ranking  member on the Appropriations Committee again. We don't get to the place  where we are today or to a level of consensus without getting a lot of  good, hard work done. I appreciate his commitment in working through it  and the relationship we have built. So thank you. Thank you very much.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
