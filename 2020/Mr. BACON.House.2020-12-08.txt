 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to retired  Lieutenant General Robert C. Hinson, U.S. Air Force, the founding  executive director of the National Strategic Research Institute at the  University of Nebraska, who recently announced his retirement at the  end of this year.   General Hinson retires after more than a half century of highly  distinguished service supporting the missions of the Department of  Defense, commercial industry, and the University of Nebraska.   General Robert Hinson's leadership and dedication to the principles  of freedom have been indispensable for America's national security  interest. He began his career by enlisting in the United States Air  Force. After spending 1 year as an administrative specialist, he  received a commission from Officer Training School in 1971.   General Hinson retired after 33 years of exemplary Active-Duty  military service. Over the course of his career, he distinguished  himself as an outstanding military leader commanding  [[Page H6915]]  many units, including the 529th Bomb Squadron, the 99th Operations and  Maintenance Group, the 99th Tactics and Training Wing, the 28th Bomb  Wing, the 45th Space Wing, and the 14th Air Force.   General Hinson later rose to positions of great responsibility,  serving as the vice commander of Air Force Space Command at Peterson  Air Force Base in Colorado, and then later as a deputy commander of the  United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska.   General Hinson is a command pilot with more than 3,000 flying hours,  primarily flying in bomber aircraft, to include the B-52, FB-111, and  the B-1.   He received many prestigious awards and decorations during a long,  selfless military career that included 25 moves for his family.   General Hinson continued to support the national security of the  United States upon his retirement from the Air Force, serving 9 years  as the vice president of government programs and corporate lead  executive at Northrop Grumman.   Continuing to answer the call of his country, General Hinson then  became the founding executive director for the National Strategic  Research Institute at the University of Nebraska. With vision,  tenacity, and leadership, he created the great team that established  this Department of Defense, University Affiliated Research Center,  known as UARC, at the University of Nebraska. Sponsored by U.S.  Strategic Command, the National Strategic Research Institute became the  first UARC supporting a combatant command.   NSRI provides scientific-based solutions across the threat spectrum  and across multiple domains. With an intense mission focus, General  Hinson has been the driving force, creating a trusted research  institution which, today, is recognized globally for deepening U.S.  strategic and operational understanding of 21st century national  security challenges.   General Hinson led a team of 75 professionals, working from offices  and laboratories across the University of Nebraska's campuses and near  customers in the National Capital and Space Coast regions. During his  tenure, NSRI has collaborated with more than 350 Nebraska University  researchers and students, serving 44 customers across DOD and the  Federal Government, while executing over $300 million in Federal  research funding.   In addition to his prolific and military and civilian careers,  General Hinson continued contributing to his community, serving on the  board of directors for several organizations, to include the STRATCOM  Consultation Committee, the STRATCOM Strategic Advisory Group's Bomber  Task Force Panel, the Strategic Air Command, and the Air and Space  Museum. He also served on the Offutt Air Force Base Advisory Council  and The Peter Kiewit Institute Board of Policy Advisors.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank General Hinson for being a mentor  of mine when I commanded the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base back in  2011 and 2012.   Mr. Speaker, this Nation owes a debt of gratitude to this outstanding  warrior who firmly believes in service before self and excellence in  all he did. I thank General Hinson for his nearly 50 years of  outstanding public service and wish him and his family all the best as  he begins the next chapter of his life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the conference  report to accompany the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense  Authorization Act.   For the past 59 years, Congress has passed the NDAA on a bipartisan  basis for one simple reason: Politics must never, ever stand between  the American people and the security of our country. This record of  bipartisan unity is unrivaled in our history and a testament to what we  can do when we come together to ensure that the needs of our Nation are  met.   As a conferee, I can proudly say that this bill wisely balances the  differences between each Chamber and puts America's security first.   Let me say at the outset that I am in agreement with the President's  concerns about section 230 and the need to deny broad immunity to tech  companies that abuse legal protections to censor voices that do not  share their particular political viewpoints.   However, as important as this issue is, it falls outside the  jurisdiction of this bill and deserves its own debate and a separate  vote so that every Member of Congress is on record where they stand.  For Members considering to vote ``no'' because of this issue, ask  yourself: Do you think you will get a better bill in 2 months? The  answer is no.   I wish to commend the outstanding leadership of Chairman Smith and my  friend Mac Thornberry for navigating this bill through conference.  Under their leadership, this legislation will continue the readiness  recovery we began 4 years ago.   It will fully fund modernization of our strategic nuclear deterrence.  It ensures America's military advantage well into the future with  necessary investments in air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace. It  directs the Secretary of Defense to establish emergency medical surge  partnerships with Federal, State, and local entities, universities, and  private healthcare providers to prepare for future pandemics. It keeps  the faith of our servicemembers and military families.  [[Page H6922]]    This bill also provides long-overdue support and relief to veterans  suffering from toxic exposure. As an airman who deployed four times, I  served with many who were exposed to burn pits and now suffer from  tumors in their lungs. This bill grants presumptive benefits for  veterans suffering from these illnesses and requires the VA to fast- track disability statuses.   So this conference report provides our servicemembers the tools they  need to defend America. On the 60th consecutive NDAA, I am proud to  have helped craft this bill, and I thank the statesmanship of Mac  Thornberry, whose name it bears.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''                                time  1245
