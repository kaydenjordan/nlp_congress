 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues across the aisle are  shamelessly trying to make this into a veterans' issue. It is an NRA  bill plain and simple, and they are just trying to put lipstick on a  pig. If they cared so much about veterans, then they would have voted  for the PACT Act, but they didn't seem to worry that much at that  point.   Over the years we have seen the gun industry circumvent existing laws  by developing new and advanced accessories to increase the power and  lethal capabilities of certain firearms.   From bump stocks to auto sears to pistol braces, these unnecessary  accessories serve the primary purpose of making guns more deadly.   Unfortunately, we have seen this play out in events so tragic that we  just have to refer to them by their first name and people know what we  mean: Pulse nightclub, Sandy Hook, Nashville, the October 1 shooting in  my district, and others; every time every precious life was taken with  the help of one of these accessories.   Time and time again, we have reminded our Republican colleagues of  these facts, yet they offer nothing but thoughts and prayers and then  proceed to try and expand access to guns and conversion devices.   Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on this.
