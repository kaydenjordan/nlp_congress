 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I  rise to honor the life of Jack Shifrel, a distinguished Army veteran,  former Broward County Public Schools school board member, fierce  veterans' advocate, and most importantly, my friend for 30 years.   Mr. Shifrel served as president of the Broward Veterans Coalition and  was always on the front lines in responding to the critical needs of  our community. He worked tirelessly to make sure the men and women who  served our Nation maintained their dignity and well-being.   Jack was an indomitable civic force and had a lifelong passion for  politics, serving 10 4-year terms as a Democratic Party committeeman in  Broward County.   He was a passionate advocate for the underserved, a defender of civil  rights, and someone who helped make Broward County a kinder, more  compassionate community.   He was a dear friend and embodied the best of what it means to give  back to your country and your community.   Although Jack is no longer with us, his legacy lives on through  veterans that he served with, and the countless individuals whose lives  he changed for the better.   Jack Shifrel was one of a kind, a selfless, compassionate, and  tireless advocate for others in Broward County. He was a patriot in the  truest sense, and will be profoundly missed, but never forgotten.                            ____________________
