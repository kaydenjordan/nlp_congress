 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Lindsey Bordas, a senior at Philipsburg-Osceola High School.   Recently, Lindsey accepted a fully qualified appointment to the  United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Lindsey is a  leader in the classroom and in her community. She is her senior class  salutatorian and class president.   Lindsey is also an active member of her school's fly-fishing club and  her church youth group. Her determination and drive will make her an  excellent addition to the military academy, and I am confident she will  rise to the occasion and excel during her education and in her service  to our country.   I would like to thank Lindsey for her commitment and her willingness  to serve, and I wish her all the best in this exciting new chapter.                            ____________________
