 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Boy Scouts of  America Leatherstocking Council. For more than 100 years the Boy Scouts  of  [[Page H8065]]  America have molded young boys into men of character, compassion, and  commitment.   Last week, I had the honor of attending their annual leadership  dinner, where four of our local Eagle Scouts--Nathaniel Degear of  DeRuyter, Devyn Guy of Middleburgh, Paul White of Clinton, and Gannon  Frisbee of Downsville--were honored as finalists for the Eagle Project  of the Year. The four finalists represented more than 120 new Eagle  Scouts, who gave over 2,500 hours in service to our community.   It was an honor to finally present Gannon Frisbee with the Eagle  Scout Community Service Project of the Year Award. Gannon began his  project intending to upgrade lighting and wall decor at a local  American Legion.   Soon after beginning his project, Gannon realized the building's  structural integrity was at risk. Gannon worked tirelessly to repair  the walls and the floor of the American Legion. His project was  critical in ensuring that the American Legion was able to return to  normal operations.    These young men offer us a glimpse into the Boy Scouts' outstanding  tradition of service and commitment to community. They are truly a  testament to the strength and the potential of America's next  generation of leaders.                            ____________________
