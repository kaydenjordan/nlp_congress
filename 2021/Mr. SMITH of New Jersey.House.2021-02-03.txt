 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks on the topic of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, before yielding to my good  friend and colleague, there are a number of Members who will be making  their way over here. We do have an important caucus going on, on the  Republican side, and that caucus is very intense; but we will have  Members coming.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler), my good friend and colleague, who has been a big leader in  the pro-life movement.    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for  her remarks.   Madam Speaker, tonight is really an appeal--an appeal to my  colleagues. It is a cry for survival and justice for unborn baby girls  and boys. Unborn children need the President of the United States and  all of us to be their friend and advocate, not powerful adversaries.   In his inaugural speech, President Biden said: ``The dream of justice  for all will be deferred no longer.'' He spoke of ``a cry for survival  from the planet itself. A cry that can't be any more desperate.''   I--we--believe the dream of justice for all cannot be achieved if an  entire segment of society is legally ignored and legally discriminated  against because of where they live, in their mother's womb, and how  small and unbelievably defenseless they really are.   We know the President understands this. He gets it--or at least he  once did. Years ago, then-Senator Biden wrote to a constituent  explaining his support for a law against funding for abortion, and he  said it would ``protect both the woman and her unborn child.''   Senator Biden said, ``I have consistently, on no fewer than 50  occasions, voted against Federal funding for abortions.'' He went on to  say, ``Those of us who are opposed to abortion should not be compelled  to pay for them.''   My colleagues on the floor and Americans all across the country agree  with that. Those of us who are opposed to abortion should not be  compelled to pay for them. According to public opinion polls, most  Americans,--60 percent, according to the most recent Marist Poll--agree  that taxpayers should not be compelled to fund abortion.   Madam Speaker, lives have been saved by the Hyde Amendment. More than  20 peer-reviewed studies show that more than 20 million people are  alive today in the United States because of the Hyde Amendment, with  almost 60,000 children spared death by abortion each and every year.   Madam Speaker, over 2 million people who would have been aborted,  instead, survived because public funds were unavailable to effectuate  their violent demise; and their mothers, instead, benefited from  maternal and prenatal healthcare and support. As we all know, the  science of human development has not changed and, thanks to ultrasound,  unborn babies are now more visible than ever.   As we all know--my wife and I are grandparents--with each new child  our children given birth to, our daughters and daughters-in-law, the  first pictures we see, the first pictures we put on the refrigerator  are ultrasound pictures. The first movies we see, the videos are of  that ultrasound of that child sucking his or her thumb, doing  somersaults, having great activity that will be great activity when  they are born, as well.   Madam Speaker, it was Abby Johnson who quit as a Planned Parenthood  director in Texas when she was told she had to assist in an ultrasound- guided abortion. And when she saw that child in realtime literally  ripped and shredded and then sucked out of the womb by the suction  machine, she walked out of that abortion clinic and has never gone  back. She is now a very powerful and articulate spokeswoman for the  right-to-life cause. Her book ``Unplanned,'' I recommend it. It is a  book that changes hearts. She was on the other side for years, so much  so that she was the director of a Planned Parenthood clinic. Yet when  she saw the deed itself, the dismemberment of that child, she walked  out, and walked out forever.    The same goes for guys, abortionists like Bernard Nathanson, who  said, Once you see that ultrasound--and he was one of the founders of  NARAL, a very large abortion rights organization. He said, ``I have  come to the agonizing conclusion that I presided over 60,000 deaths.''  And he, too, became a pro-lifer. An ultrasound and prenatal surgery  where the babies were treated as patients, not as a being, to be  extinguished or exterminated changed his mind.   Madam Speaker, growing numbers of Americans are shocked that the  methods of abortion include dismemberment. They include the literal  decapitation of this helpless child. And, of course, drugs like RU-486  starve the baby to death before he or she is then forcibly expelled  from the womb.   Madam Speaker, the multibillion-dollar abortion industry is very  clever, and they cleverly market to savagery of choice while going to  extraordinary lengths to ignore, trivialize, and cover up the battered  baby victim.   Madam Speaker, abortion violence must be replaced with compassion and  empathy for women and for defenseless unborn babies. We must love them  both. Birth is an event that happens to all of us. It is not the  beginning of life. That child is just as vibrant before birth as after,  just too big to continue inside the womb.  [[Page H316]]    Sadly, more than 62 million babies have been killed by abortion in  the United States since Roe v. Wade, a loss of children's lives that  equates with the entire population of Italy. I truly believe that  someday future generations of Americans will look back on us like we  look back on people who did other things in previous centuries, in  years back, and wonder how and why a society that prided itself on  human rights could have effectuated and enabled the loss of so many  defenseless babies--62 million and counting.                                time  1815    Madam Speaker, last week, President Biden overturned the Protecting  Life in Global Health Assistance policy, the Mexico City policy. His  executive order forces--forces--U.S. taxpayers to fund organizations  that promote, lobby, or perform abortions on demand in foreign  countries.   Americans overwhelmingly oppose using U.S. foreign aid to subsidize  abortion. The Marist poll just last week found that more than three in  four Americans, 77 percent, oppose using tax dollars to support  abortions in other countries--77 percent. Let's use those tax dollars  to combat AIDS, to help people with malaria.   I am the author of the reauthorization of the PEPFAR program, the  AIDS program that is now in effect. It was originally sponsored by our  good friend and colleague Henry Hyde, and George W. Bush, it was one of  his greatest achievements. That is where our foreign policy dollars and  foreign aid dollars need to be spent, on nurturing. There is nothing  benign about dismembering an unborn child or giving poisons that  effectuate their death.   Among other pro-abortion executive orders, on January 29, the  President announced steps to resume funding to the U.N. Population  Fund, even though that agency has supported China's forced abortion  policy for decades.   Madam Speaker, I have chaired hearings, 66 of them, on human rights  in China over these many years. I have been here 41 years. I can tell  you that China treats its unborn and its women in the most horrific of  ways. One child per couple, now two children per couple, where coercion  is used to enforce it, has led to massive, massive losses of life and  to broken women. The U.N. Population Fund has been right there,  cheerleading, supporting, aiding and abetting these crimes against  women and children.   Finally, Madam Speaker, by reason of their age, dependency,  immaturity, inconvenience, or unwantedness, unborn children have been  denied justice. When the President calls, we all want justice. And they  have been rendered legally persona non grata. Yet, their cries for  survival, using the President's words, can't be any more desperate than  they are.   These children need the President of the United States to be their  friend and advocate, not another powerful adversary. They need us to be  their friend and advocate and not powerful adversaries.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), my  good friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for  his leadership and bill, which will save lives.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Hinson), a  new Member but a Member who has secured an important post in the  Appropriations and the Budget Committees.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her very powerful statement and her leadership, which I know is going  to be greatly appreciated.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs.  Harshbarger), my friend who is a new Member. She is on the Education  and Labor Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, and she is a  pharmacist.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for her  statement, and I look forward to working with her going forward in this  Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), a  member of the Ways and Means Committee, the lead sponsor of the  Protecting Individuals With Down Syndrome Act, which prohibits  abortions based on Down Syndrome.    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for  his leadership on that bill and his leadership on the issue of  protecting defenseless lives for many years.   Madam Speaker, some Members are making their way over from our  caucus, but I just want to say a couple of points before closing.   Years ago, a friend of mine by the name of Jean Garton, who was the  head of Lutherans For Life, was preparing a speech, a lecture. In that  lecture, she had a few slides of unborn children, just beautiful slides  of that life before birth. But she also had a couple of slides that  spoke truth to power. It was of what the abortion actually looks like,  mangled bodies, dismembered children.   While she was preparing that talk, it was late into the evening. One  of the children walked in, and out of the mouth of babes comes truth.  That child said: Mommy, who broke the baby?   Abortion breaks babies. It hurts women, and we need a reappraisal in  this Congress, in legislatures, where they are not supportive of the  right to life.   As I said earlier, we will look back someday and say: How could we  have allowed it, particularly in the age of ultrasound, where we speak  so often of the importance of science?   Babies need help, growth, nutrition, and they certainly need  protection legally from this assault on their lives.                                time  1830    Again, I thank my colleagues for participating. I have a number of  Members who are submitting statements in the Record.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs.  Boebert).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) for that very passionate defense of life and  the passionate and beautiful story of life.   Madam Speaker, we know that Dr.   John Joyce is on his way.  Congressman Joyce should be here momentarily.   Madam Speaker, I just want to point out one final thing. I just want  to point out to my colleagues that we know that this is a difficult  time for the pro-life movement in this Chamber. I have been here when  we have had majorities and when we have had minorities. Based on what  we think are the votes, we probably are in the minority right now. But  I have to tell you, Madam Speaker, that any victory that results in  more child deaths is a Pyrrhic victory. It is no victory at all. These  children deserve our respect and our love, and the mothers as well, not  the violence of abortion.   I would point out, too, that we do face these enormous challenges. I  have been in the movement for 48 years. So I can say this with some  sense of knowing the people who make up the pro-life movement. We love  those who disagree with us. We respect even those with whom we  fundamentally disagree, even when it is not reciprocated.   It is all about respect from womb to tomb and for each other. So as  the debates heat up and as we go through this session of Congress, we  will, with respect, hear you. We disagree fundamentally because we do  believe that it is a truth and a fact that these children are deserving  of respect. So I want you to know, Madam Speaker, this will be a very  rough couple of years for the pro-life movement in this House.   It has happened before. I was here when Bill Clinton had majorities  in both Houses and when Barack Obama had majorities in both Houses. But  we will persevere and we will never quit because these children's lives  are worth it.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), who  is a member of the Agriculture Committee and the Education and Labor  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  statement.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Joyce), who is a member of the Homeland Security Committee and the  Small Business Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for  his comments and for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, one of my friends now for quite a long time has been  the niece of the late Dr. Martin Luther King. Alveda King is her name.  Dr. King used to be pro-choice. Very strongly so. She actually had two  abortions. Then she became pro-life. And she has become passionately  pro-life not just for the babies, but maybe even more so for the women.   She has said:         How can the dream of my uncle, Martin Luther King, survive       if we murder the children?    She speaks and reaches out to women who are post-abortive with such  compassion, as do so many organizations and women; to women who have  the abortions, to help them, to love them, and to care for them.   Alveda King is an example to be followed. Like her uncle and his bold  and tremendous civil rights leadership, she argues--again, she is the  niece of Dr. King--that this is the new civil rights movement and we  need to protect and provide legal protection for these innocent unborn  babies.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin). Dr.  Brian Babin is a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Dr. Babin  is the sponsor of H.R. 28, Protecting Life in Crisis Act.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.                            ____________________
