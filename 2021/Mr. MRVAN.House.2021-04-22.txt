 Madam Speaker, as a proud father of two daughters,  Genevieve and Scarlett, I was honored to join my colleagues last week  in voting to support the passage of H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act.  It is deeply regrettable that despite the enactment of the Equal Pay  Act in 1963, there remains serious wage gaps based on gender.   According to the American Association of University Women, in the  First District of Indiana, a woman earns just 63 cents for every dollar  that a man earns for performing the same job.   There must be equal pay for equal work, and I am pleased that the  House has taken action to right this wrong.   I encourage our Senate colleagues to move forward with addressing  this  [[Page H2093]]  wage gap so that every individual, regardless of gender, can receive a  fair wage for work they do.                            ____________________
