 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the service  and dedication of a distinguished Delawarean with a track record of  putting service before herself. She is a thoughtful friend, not just to  me, but to hundreds of Delawareans up and down the State.   Ronni K. Cohen of Claymont, DE, is a well-known educator and civic  leader in Delaware and recently retired after 50 years of public  service. She taught thousands of students--children and adults-- financial planning, problem-solving, entrepreneurship, and so much  more. A Delaware school official once described Ronni as ``one of the  most dedicated teachers that I have ever met.''   In total, Ronni spent 33 years in the classrooms of Delaware's  Brandywine School District and in 2000 was recognized as Teacher of the  Year by the Delaware Department of Education. She was an economics and  entrepreneurship teacher at elementary schools like P.S. duPont,  Marguerite H. Burnett, and Claymont. During her time with her third,  fourth, and fifth graders, Ronni instilled in them an industrial spirit  and deployed hands-on lessons about the crucial role that finances play  in our everyday lives.   Ronni earned many accolades during her career, including the Delaware  Chamber of Commerce Superstars in Education Award, the Small Business  Administration Women in Business Champion Award, the Consortium of  Entrepreneurship Education Leadership and Advocacy Award, the Delaware  Library Partnership Award, and a Freedoms Foundation Leavey Award for  private enterprise education.   In 1992, Ronni and her principal opened the first bank within a  Delaware public school. This innovative program, in partnership with  Wilmington Trust, expanded to 20 other schools across Delaware.   In 2001, when the Delaware Financial Literacy Institute--DFLI--was  born, Ronni was the obvious choice to lead it. This not-for-profit  organization set out to promote financial education through its  Delaware Money School and help individuals gain a better understanding  of the consumer marketplace while providing them with the necessary  instruments to improve their financial health.   For the next 17 years, Ronni served as DFLI's executive director. She  taught classes while recruiting a battalion of volunteer instructors to  multiply the efforts of the Delaware Money School. Under her  leadership, thousands of adult students completed DFLI coursework and  gained the knowledge they needed to take control of their financial  futures.   Ronni also served on the Governor's Task Force for Financial  Independence and the Delaware General Assembly's Joint Committee on  Financial Literacy. In 2016, when the State was developing its  financial literacy standards for K-12, she was hand-picked as  cochairperson of that committee.   From ``EconoM&Mics'' to ``Purses to Portfolios'' and ``Investing for  Your Future,'' Ronni's unique classes have impacted many Delawareans  over the years and made our state stronger and more prosperous.   ``Ronni Cohen is a remarkably effective educator. She took her  prodigious skills to a different platform by helping tens of thousands  of Delawareans take control of their personal finances,'' said former  Governor Jack Markell. ``Ronni is beloved in the Delaware Money School  community--and for a good reason. She gave fully of herself to improve  other peoples' lives. Ronni leaves a remarkable legacy of achievement  and contribution. I love Ronni Cohen!''   Mr. President, Ronni sees all Delawareans as lifelong students, and  she always ensured that her students and mentees had the proper tools  to build strong and stable financial futures. Her legacy is one of a  teacher who consistently went to extraordinary lengths to make sure  herlessons made ``cents.''   Ronni Cohen, from all of your schoolchildren, your adult learners,  your neighbors, and your state, please accept our sincere thanks and  gratitude. Thank you for dedicating 50 years to public service--and on  behalf of our entire state, I wish you a happy, fulfilling retirement.  Thank you.                            ____________________
