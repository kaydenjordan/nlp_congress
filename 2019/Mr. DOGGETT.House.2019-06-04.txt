 Mr. Speaker, ``Does anybody really want to throw out  good, educated, and accomplished young people who have jobs, some  serving in our military? Really?''   ``They have been in our country for many years through no fault of  their own, brought in by parents at young age.''   Those were the words of a President Trump tweet on September 14,  2017, but, unfortunately, Donald Trump is a man of his last tweet.  Later, when a bipartisan group of Senators went to meet with the  President and present a viable bipartisan plan, he flew into a racist  rant and refused to act.   Only because of Federal court orders, consistently rejecting the  Trump administration arguments, do our Dreamers have any protection  today.   I have visited personally with these young people: a nurse, a  teacher, a county prosecutor, a key person in a small business, many  students. They are contributing to our communities, and America is  stronger for their presence. They are Americans in every sense except  for the documents that allow them to fully participate.    Mr. Speaker, if protection for our Dreamers is  terminated, all of us will lose.   A coalition of Texas businesses has estimated that Texas, alone, will  lose $6 billion in economic activity every year.   Mr. Speaker, let's provide our Dreamers the certainty of a clear path  to citizenship. Let's recognize them as the full-fledged Americans they  certainly are.
