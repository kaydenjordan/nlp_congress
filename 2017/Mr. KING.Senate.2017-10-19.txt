 Mr. President, I rise not in opposition to the amendment  but to compliment the Senator for bringing this issue forward. I intend  to support the amendment, but I just want to make the point that this  is a broader issue in that we are going to have to address the child  and dependent tax credit.   One of issues is making it refundable so the tax credit is available  and useful to lower income families, who are the hardest hit by high  child care costs, and also making it available to those families who  use these funds to care for perhaps an aged relative or an injured  relative.   I agree with the amendment, and I support it, but I think we need to  make the point that there is more work to be done. I have introduced a  bill with Senator Heller, Senator Burr, and Senator Collins on this  subject, and I look forward to bringing that forward for consideration  at an appropriate moment.   I urge support for Senator Rubio's amendment.
