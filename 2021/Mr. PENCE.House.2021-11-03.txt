 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Mississippi, for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2220.   As a champion of this legislation last Congress, we must continue to  work toward giving the GSA the ability to negotiate a discounted or  fixed price option on government leases like it happens in the private  sector.   With our Nation's real infrastructure broken, which is too often  ignored by this Congress, I am committed to getting a commonsense  option like this one across the finish line.   H.R. 2220 will save billions of taxpayer dollars, reduce government  waste, and free up money to invest in our crumbling roads and  infrastructure.   Innovative, free market solutions like this bill have the potential  to save $5 billion taxpayer dollars by bringing fair market practices  to Federal real estate.   Hoosiers and all Americans deserve an efficient government that can  meet our 21st century infrastructure needs.   By passing this bill, we are enacting real, commonsense  infrastructure legislation that has bipartisan support across the  aisle.
