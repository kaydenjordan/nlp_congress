 Mr. Chairman, I speak in opposition to this amendment  because it puts American security at risk. Plutonium pits, a key  component of nuclear warhead production, have not been regularly  produced in the United States since 1989.   We are forced to refurbish our existing stockpile of warheads to keep  up with the demand. We can only do that for so long because the  components degrade. Russia and China are ramping up their capacity to  produce new nuclear weapon components. We need to show our adversaries  we are capable of maintaining a strong and modernized nuclear  deterrent.   In fact, Speaker Johnson yesterday reiterated, ``Peace through  strength.'' We have a statutory obligation to manufacture at least 80  plutonium pits annually by the year 2030 just to maintain our national  defense goals.   H Canyon at Savannah River Site is a critical component. It is the  last of its kind in the Nation to help the disassembly and assembly  process. This amendment is misguided.   Mr. Chairman, I would invite the gentleman from California to  actually come down to South Carolina and visit the Savannah River Site  because I have been told you haven't. You are talking about something  you don't even really know about just because you want to cut funding  away and you don't like nuclear weapons.   The plutonium pit project at Savannah River Site in South Carolina  will be responsible for producing over half of the minimum annual  requirement. We must continue to support Savannah River Site to  maintain a dominant nuclear force in the world, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.
