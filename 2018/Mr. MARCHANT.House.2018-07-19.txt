 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1001, I call  up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 119) expressing the sense of  Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States  economy, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 119, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank leadership for bringing this resolution to the  floor for consideration. I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 119, which  would express the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be  detrimental to the U.S. economy.   This resolution will send a clear signal to the American people that  we oppose policies that would drive up energy prices for families and  for businesses. A standalone carbon tax generally would have such  detrimental effects on the economy and would be an unwarranted and  transparent grab for revenue.   The adverse economic effects of such a tax would be felt throughout  the economy, falling hardest on the most vulnerable: the young, the  poor, the elderly, and those living on fixed incomes.   An Obama administration proposal in 2016 for a $10 tax on every  barrel of oil would have translated into an increase at the gas pump of  approximately 25 cents per gallon for every American consumer.  Similarly, a standalone carbon tax would increase the price of  gasoline, natural gas, home heating oil, and electricity.   American families would feel the pain immediately when they buy gas  or diesel to get them to their jobs every day. American families would  also feel the pain when they turn on the lights or adjust the  thermostat in their homes every day.   The cost burden of a carbon tax also would, correspondingly, increase  the price of everything consumers buy every day--in short, everything  from a carton of milk to a pair of shoes, to a bicycle, to an  automobile.   The price increases on goods with fixed demand that would result from  such a tax would directly harm millions of Americans whose incomes mean  that they must budget carefully in advance to afford just the basic  necessities of life.   In addition, a carbon tax would hit at a time when the industries  that it targets are just now recovering from a very damaging economic  period of our lives.   With a reformed Tax Code built for growth and rollback of burdensome  regulations, American businesses and their workers are finally making a  comeback, and we are seeing great optimism about our economic future.  Now is not the time to debate placing additional burdens on industries  that are trying to help us keep the lights on.   This resolution makes clear that we oppose policies that would drive  up energy prices, damage the U.S. economy, reduce the American GDP, and  hurt American jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), who was an original cosponsor of this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).   (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    I yield the gentleman from Illinois an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  [[Page H6569]]    For many years now, Republicans in Congress have been clear: A new  stand-alone carbon tax will raise consumer costs and hurt the economy.  It is not a solution to any challenge but, rather, it would create  additional challenges.   If American businesses and workers in industries are targeted by a  carbon tax, they will suffer economically under such a policy. They are  just now recovering from the recession that we went into, and they are  just now, because of the tax bill that was passed this past year, just  now beginning to see a brighter economic future. We should not debate  putting new obstacles in front of them at this time.   Together, we should be focused on working to advance policies that  hold down energy costs, improve the U.S. economy, its GDP, and create  jobs. That is what we did last year, and that is what we are doing  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
