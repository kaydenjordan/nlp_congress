 Mr. President, I rise to discuss a true bipartisan  victory along with my friend and colleague, the leader of our Senate  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. I hear a lot of people  say that bipartisanship is all too rare these days, but in our  committee, it is our bread and butter.   Specifically, I thank my partner and friend, Chairman Pat Roberts. He  is the only person to have written a farm bill as both the chair of the  House and Senate Agriculture Committees. Kansas is fortunate to have  such a champion, and all of American agriculture owes him a debt of  gratitude for his persistence, doggedness, and tenacity. Maybe it is  his Marine training, but he never gave up on this bill even when  negotiations got tough. Maybe I could be an honorary marine. He also  knows that to do anything big, it takes a team approach. Thanks to his  commitment to bipartisanship, we were able to achieve a real historic  victory.   This summer, Chairman Roberts and I made history by passing our  Senate farm bill by 86 votes, and I am pleased to say we beat that  record this week by passing the final bill by 87 votes--the most ever.   One of the reasons I love my work on the Agriculture Committee is  that the work we do truly affects everyone. From the well-being of our  children to the viability of rural America, to the health of our lakes,  rivers, and streams, to our access to the most abundant, most  affordable, safest food supply in the world, the farm bill impacts all  of us.   I like to say it is our rural economic development plan for the  country, and that has been true since the very first one in the 1930s.  In the wake of the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano  Roosevelt signed the first farm bill to get agriculture and our economy  back on track.   Over the past 80 years, the role of the farm bill has evolved  alongside our agricultural and rural economy. In the 1970s, nutrition  assistance was linked to the farm bill for the first time, marking a  major step in strengthening the connection between our farms and food.  In the 1980s, we saw the first ever conservation title, demonstrating  the critical role of preserving land, water, and wildlife while  supporting working farms. In the 1990s, thanks to the leadership of my  friend Senator Patrick Leahy, we recognized evolving consumer  preferences through the creation of the National Organic Program. There  is, of course, the landmark 1996 farm bill, in which then-House  Chairman Roberts first left his mark, tackling one of the biggest  challenges in farm policy--reducing the incentive for farmers to plant  for payments rather than for markets.  [[Page S7569]]    In 2008, I was proud to author the creation of the first-ever  specialty crop title, recognizing fruit and vegetable growers and local  food systems for the first time.   In 2014, we made major reforms to commodity programs, streamlined our  conservation title, and made specialty crop research and clean energy  programs a permanent part of the farm bill. Each of these changes  represented a leap forward in farm and food policy and progress to  broaden the farm bill to support every corner of America and American  agriculture.   The momentum toward recognizing the diversity of our farm and food  economy has truly accelerated over the past 15 years. Now, in every  title of the farm bill, you can find policies that reflect the wide  variety of things we grow and how we grow them.   I am proud to say that this farm bill has continued the trajectory of  progress to diversify American agriculture. From expanded crop  insurance to historic assurance for urban farmers and improved coverage  options for our dairy farmers, this bill helps all types of farms, all  sizes of farms, and farmers in every region of the country.   In order to cultivate the next generation of agriculture, we made  permanent investments to support veterans, socially disadvantaged and  beginning farmers, and we expanded agricultural market opportunities so  that our farmers can make a living.   Historic investments in organic farming help producers tap into one  of the fastest growing sectors of agriculture. New, permanent support  for international trade promotion will help our farmers sell their  products abroad. Streamlined, permanent investments for farmers  markets, food hubs, and local food processing will help our farmers  sell to their neighbors.   While we know the farm bill supports our farmers, it also supports  our families. We protected access to food assistance and said no to  partisan changes that would take away food from those who need it most,  while still working to improve access to healthy food and improving the  program's integrity. I hope the administration takes note of this and  does not try to push forward with regulations that conflict with the  farm bill's bipartisan approach to protecting food assistance.   We continue the farm bill's legacy as one of the largest investments  in land and water conservation. This bill maintains conservation  investments and rejects harmful provisions that would jeopardize  drinking water and public lands.   Instead, we focused on successful conservation partnerships that will  actually grow funding by leveraging nearly $3 billion in new private  investment over the next decade.   We also lift up our small towns and rural communities and celebrate  what makes them great places to live and raise a family. By making  strong investments in rural water infrastructure and high-speed  internet, we help revitalize rural America and grow opportunities.   These important priorities have been 80 years in the making, and  there are a number of people I would like to thank for working hard to  continue the legacy of this farm bill.   Of course, I want to thank my leader, our Democratic leader, for his  leadership and support throughout this process; the majority leader,  who made sure this bill moved quickly on the Senate floor and was an  active participant in the Agriculture Committee, as well; and, of  course, my partner, Senator Roberts, who stayed true to our commitment  to deliver a bipartisan bill.   I want to thank our counterparts in the House, Chairman Conaway and  Ranking Member Peterson, for their hard work throughout this process,  and all of our colleagues in the House and Senate who supported this  bill with historic votes in the House and the Senate.   I also want to thank my incredible staff, who have worked so hard for  almost 2 years to bring this farm bill to the finish line: my committee  staff director, Joe Shultz and deputy staff director and policy  director, Jacqlyn Schneider, who both led this process; our legal team,  led by our chief counsel, Mary Beth Schultz, and our fellow, Ward  Griffin; our amazing commodities and livestock team, Mike Schmidt and  Kyle Varner, for supporting our farmers, with the help of farm bill  veteran, Susan Keith, and our fellow, Riya Mehta; on team conservation,  Ashley McKeon and Rosalyn Brumette, who protected our land and water,  with the help of USDA detailee, Lindsay White; our forestry and  environmental expert, Sean Babington, who preserved wildlife habitat  and public lands; Katie Naessens, for her work to support the  innovative future of agriculture, with the help of Dominique Warren;  our rural development and energy expert, Kevin Bailey, for creating  opportunities for our small towns; Katie Bergh, who led our work on  trade and food aid to help our farmers feed the world.   I would like to thank, as well, my staff in my personal office: my  chief of staff, Mike VanKuiken; legislative director, Emily Carwell;  deputy chief of staff, Anne Stanski; my senior aide, Krystal Lattany;  my communications director, Matt Williams; ag press secretary, Jess  McCarron; and the rest of the communications team, Miranda Margowsky,  Nirmeen Fahmy, and Amy Phillips Bursch; my State team, led by Teresa  Plachetka, and our Michigan ag expert, Kali Fox.   I want to thank everyone on Senator Robert's team, especially James  Glueck and DaNita Murray, true professionals who exemplified how to  lead a farm bill conference.   We spent a lot of time together, and I say to the Senator: I know you  spent a lot of time with Joe and Jacqlyn on our team. I think at the  end, we were working as one team, and that is something I am very, very  grateful for.   I also thank Jessie Williams--as the chairman has said--Amanda Kelly,  Bobby Mehta, and everyone who worked behind the scenes on the Ag  Committee.   I also appreciate our floor staff, those in the leadership staff  office who are so important, and CBO. Of course, I say thank you to all  of the members of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee  and their staffs.   With a lot of hard work by a long list of very talented people, this  Congress has passed a strong bill that supports the 16 million jobs in  America that depend on agriculture and our food economy.   I look forward to the President of the United States signing this  bill into law as soon as possible.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to someone  whose passion for service is literally out of this world.   As a payload specialist, Bill Nelson spent 6 days orbiting our planet  aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia.   When he looked down on Earth, he didn't see blue States or red  States.   Instead, he saw green land, blue oceans and lakes, including some big  ones in Michigan, and a whole wide world worth protecting.   A decade and a half later, Bill Nelson was sworn in as U.S. Senator  for Florida.   His previous experiences in space, as a U.S. Army captain, as a State  legislator, and in the U.S. House of Representatives have shaped every  decision he has made since then.   I remember Senator Nelson's swearing-in, because it was my first day,  too, and we have been serving together ever since.   Senator Nelson has been such a forceful advocate for technology--no  surprise given his time at NASA--and for protecting consumers.   He has fought every day to do right by our seniors, keeping Medicare  and Social Security strong, working to eliminate the Medicare Part D  ``donut hole,'' and expanding access to home healthcare.   He has been a strong voice for protecting our environment,  particularly from oil drilling, an issue close to the hearts of people  in both Florida and Michigan.   One of my favorite memories of Senator Nelson actually took place in  Michigan, during a 2016 codel.   Senator Nelson came to Michigan to tour our Coast Guard installations  as ranking member on Commerce.   He got the full tour: Station Grand Haven, Air Station Detroit,  Station St.  [[Page S7580]]  lgnace, Air Station Traverse City, and even the CGC Mackinaw.   That is a heavy icebreaker that helps keep Great Lakes channels and  harbors open during the cold winter months.   It is something he doesn't get a chance to see very often in Florida.   Well, I don't remember exactly how it happened, but Senator Nelson  decided to challenge a member of the Coast Guard, who was in his 20s,  to a pull-up contest.   If you guess that the young guy lost, you would be right.   That is when I decided never to settle disagreements with Senator  Nelson by challenging him to an arm-wrestling contest.   I think I speak for many of us when I say that I will miss working  with Bill.   Bill has always believed that there is more that unites us than  divides us.   Perhaps that is the perspective he gained looking down from space.   His passion for public service shines through in everything he does.   On a personal note, I would like to thank him for taking such good  care of my snowbird constituents during the winter months.   Bill: Thank you for your hard work, leadership, and lifetime of  serving Florida and our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to someone  who has spent her entire career making life better for the people of  Missouri and the people of this country.   If I had to describe Senator Claire McCaskill using one word, I think  I would choose ``fighter.''   I think most Members, on both sides of the aisle, would agree with  me.   As the first woman elected Jackson County prosecutor, she fought for  crime victims and created some of the first drug courts and domestic  violence units in the country.   As State auditor, she fought to ensure that the State of Missouri  spent taxpayer dollars wisely.   During her 12 years representing Missouri in the Senate, she has  fought every day to keep government accountable, protect consumers,  strengthen our national security, and expand access to healthcare.   I have been especially honored to partner with her on this last goal.   We worked together to make sure that pharmacists can tell their  patients the lowest price at the pharmacy counter and to protect  Americans from junk insurance plans.   We have fought to keep American manufacturers competitive and to end  unfair trade practices that hurt our companies and our workers.   I have been inspired by her work to end sexual violence, particularly  in our military, and to ensure that families affected by the opioid  crisis get the help they need to recover.   I will always remember the trip we took together to the Middle East.   In Jordan, we saw firsthand the challenge of responding to the Syrian  refugee crisis and spoke with refugees themselves.   That is classic Claire: ensuring that the government is doing its job  while also watching out for the most vulnerable.   Perhaps that skill has been on display best during oversight  hearings, when Claire has made great use of her skills as a former  prosecutor.   I know that I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of her  questioning.   I am going to miss working with her. However, I am glad we haven't  heard the last of Claire.   Just follow her Twitter account, and you will see what I mean.   Senator McCaskill: Thank you for keeping government honest,  protecting the most vulnerable, and always putting the people of  Missouri first.   Most of all, thank you for always, always being a fighter.                            ____________________
