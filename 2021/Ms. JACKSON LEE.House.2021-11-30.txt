 Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud support of H.R. 951  ``The Maternal Vaccination Act.''   I would like to thank Congresswoman Sewell for introducing this  legislation.   This bill establishes a national campaign to raise awareness and  increase rates of maternal vaccinations and calls for the CDC to  consult with various stakeholders to carry out this campaign.   In addition, the CDC must focus on increasing vaccination rates among  communities with historically high rates of unvaccinated individuals.   The CDC must also make publicly available any materials and resources  developed for the campaign.   In addition, H.R. 951 would instruct the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention to broaden a public awareness campaign on vaccinations  to include pregnant and postpartum individuals and require the campaign  to disseminate vaccine information to providers and facilities that  provide obstetric care.   The bill would also authorize an additional $2 million annually from  2021 through 2025 for the vaccination awareness campaign.   This bill would put pregnant women at the focus of the fight to  combat COVID-19.   As the Chair of the Congressional Coronavirus Task Force, I have used  every means possible to sound the alarm about the seriousness of the  COVID-19 virus.   On February 10, 2020, I held the first press conference on the issue  of COVID-19 at Houston Intercontinental Airport.   I then held a second press conference on February 24th to continue  efforts to raise public knowledge of the impending threat.   On February 26th, I wrote the Chair and Ranking Member of the  Committee on Homeland Security requesting to be briefed by Acting  Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf regarding the preparedness of  the Department of Homeland Security to address a possible pandemic.   On March 19th, I announced an innovative partnership with United  Methodist Medical Center (UMMC) to open the first drive-through  Coronavirus Test Screening facility in the Greater Houston area, which  proved beneficial to everyone in the Greater Houston area, as with  UMMC's help we have opened multiple sites that are located within high- risk communities in the Greater Houston area, to reduce the need for  travel to get access to COVID-19 testing.   Since the start of this pandemic, I have sought to proactively  address the critical issues and concerns tied to the COVID-19 virus.   As I stated at the beginning of this pandemic, ``We must not panic,  but prepare.''   I am pleased to see that this bill is not a panic-induced response,  but a well-thought-out proposal to further protect our citizens.   When pregnant women get vaccinated, they not only build their immune  system to the virus, they also create antibodies for their unborn  child.   Throughout history the vaccination of pregnant mothers has shown to  be beneficial when it comes to viruses like tetanus, influenza,  pertussis.   With this bill we can help newborn children who have not yet  developed their immune systems fight off a deadly virus such as COVID- 19.   This also gives mothers piece of mind that they'll be safe as they  advance in their pregnancy.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud support of H.R. 951, the Maternal  Vaccination Act.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        November 30, 2021, on page H6681, in the third column, the  following appeared: This also gives mothers piece of mind that  they'll be safe as they advance in their pregnancy.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of H.R. 1550,  the ``PREVENT HPV Cancers Act of 2021.''   I would like to thank my colleagues Congresswoman Kathy Castor and  Congresswoman Kim Schrier for introducing this important legislation.   The ``Promoting Resources to Expand Vaccination, Education and New  Treatments for HPV Cancers Act'' or the PREVENT HPV Cancers Act has the  ultimate goal of preventing HPV-related cancers.   Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common virus that causes six  types of cancers, leading to nearly 36,000 cases of cancer in the  United States every year, according to the CDC.   Nearly 42 million people are currently infected with HPV in the  United States.   The HPV vaccine provides safe, effective, and lasting protection  against the HPV infections that most commonly cause cancer.   This vaccine is so effective that the World Health Organization  established a goal of total eradication of cervical cancer--and this  legislation can be part of our nation's commitment to reaching that  goal.   This vaccine can help prevent these cancers, and it is the goal of  the PREVENT HPV Cancers Act to increase vaccination rates.   HPV-related cancers disproportionately affect individuals who are  living on a lower income, have lower education levels, and are from a  racial or ethnic minority group.   Increased public awareness and immunization initiatives would help  improve vaccination rates in these underserved communities.   More comprehensive research on the HPV vaccine, as authorized in the  PREVENT HPV Cancers Act, would also help better identify these  disparities and ways to address them.   There is rampant societal mistrust and vaccine hesitancy, and while  immunizations are one of the greatest public health tools we have, they  work best when there is widespread use.   This legislation will spread awareness so that more people will be  vaccinated against HPV, and fund research to help stop the largely  preventable deaths caused by HPV linked cancers.   When we have the tools to prevent cancer, we should without a doubt  utilize them.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of H.R. 1550, the PREVENT HPV  Cancers Act of 2021.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        November 30, 2021 on page H6684, in the first column, the  following appeared: When we have the tools to prevent cancer, we  should without a doubt utilize them.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 550, the  ``Immunization Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2021,'' which will  improve our public health infrastructure and expand information-sharing  between state and federal governments, as well as public and private  health care providers, to ensure vaccines are being administered  effectively and efficiently across all states and territories.   Mr. Speaker, public health agencies work every day to prevent disease  and viruses, promote health, and prepare for and respond to both  emergency situations and ongoing challenges--but they cannot do so  without the ability to access the best available data and share  information with other experts, and the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted  this fact.   As the Chair of the Congressional Coronavirus Task Force, I have used  every means possible to sound the alarm about the seriousness of the  COVID-19 virus.

I am pleased to see that this bill is not a panic-induced response,  but a well-thought-out proposal to further protect our citizens.   The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a number of challenges for public  health information systems, but worst among them is the limited  capacity of existing state Immunization Information Systems.   The importance of these systems cannot be understated: they allow  providers to keep vaccines and supplies in stock, prevent over--or  under--vaccination, remind patients when they are due for a recommended  vaccine, and identify areas with low vaccination rates to ensure  equitable distribution of vaccines.   However, states lack modern, comprehensive information systems that  can meet the challenges of COVID-19 and future public health threats  through the secure exchange of real-time immunization data.   Consequently, many state systems struggled to accommodate additional  demand, implement new functionalities, onboard immunization providers,  support interoperable exchange with health care partners and enable  timely reporting of immunization data to federal partners.   These issues are exactly what this legislation seeks to address.   Through H.R. 550, HHS will develop a strategy and a plan to improve  immunization information systems and designate data and technology  standards for use in these systems.   Additionally, HHS will award grants to health departments and other  government agencies to improve their systems contingent upon meeting  designated standards.   As the vaccine rollout continues and the time for boosters is upon  us, immunization data systems will be a critical tool in the success of  these efforts, and they are in need of modernization.   That is why I rise in ardent support of H.R. 550, and that is why the  bill has strong bipartisan backing.   Lastly, I want to thank Congresswoman Kuster and Congressman Bucshon  for introducing and shepherding this bill.

Lastly, I want to thank Congresswoman Kuster and Congressman Bucshon  for introducing and shepherding this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2364, the  ``Synthetic Opioid Danger Awareness Act'', which will require several  federal agencies to provide education and training related to synthetic  opioids, including fentanyl and its analogues.   The CDC reports that more than 93,000 Americans died from drug  overdoses in 2020, an almost 30 percent increase from 2019.   Regardless of income, race, gender, education, or other demographics,  America's opiate problem has morphed into a full-blown public health  crisis.   Synthetic opioids contribute greatly to this drug crisis and are a  serious threat to fire fighters and emergency medical responders who  are susceptible to encountering these deadly substances.   Increased rates of opiate usage impact the types and volume of calls  the fire service responds to and the dangers they encounter when they  arrive on the scene, both of which stretch already limited resources  even thinner.   A 2021 Statista study found that nearly two-thirds of all fire  department responses are for medical aid.   When firefighters or EMS personnel come in contact with opioids-- either through direct contact or secondary contamination--this creates  a unique, and often unknown, risk for these individuals because many  opioids can be ingested either by skin contact (namely fentanyl) or via  inhalation, making it challenging to help the victim.   Firefighters must be properly trained on how to safely respond to  these life-threatening emergencies in a way that both helps the victim  and minimizes risk to their health and safety.   The Synthetic Opioid Danger Awareness Act would require the National  Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to produce training  materials to prevent exposure to synthetic opioids for first responders  and others who are at high risk of exposure.   In addition, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration will be required to disseminate the mentioned training  materials to ambulance transport personnel, local sheriff deputies, and  other first responders and individuals in high-risk occupations.   H.R. 2364 would also direct the CDC to conduct a public education  campaign that raises public awareness of the dangers of synthetic  opioids and explains the services available, with respect to opioid  treatment.   The health of American citizens is one of the most pressing issues  facing this country.   Continuing education on fentanyl and synthetic opioids is essential  for ensuring the health and safety of fire fighters and paramedics.   Passing the Synthetic Opioid Danger Awareness Act is a step towards  ensuring the health and wellness of American citizens and reducing the  impact synthetic opioids impose on American communities.   I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and I thank Congressman Andy  Kim for introducing such an important piece of legislation.    Madam Speaker, I have been in the House for a very  long time, and I have grown to love the dignity, the power, and the  respect of this body, not for individuals but for the respect of the  United States of America.   On November 17, 2021, a Member of the House from Colorado called  another Member the jihad squad member from Minnesota. These words have  continued on. It is in the Congressional Record. It was when we were  leaving for a beautiful reflection of thanksgiving. So the words were  not pulled down.   Over the past couple of days, it has been one attack after another,  such as in an elevator: I thought this person, this Member from  Minnesota, was a terrorist.   Don't we understand that the world watches this body?   Besides those words having needed to be taken down, and they were not  at that time, the world wonders: Is America viewing the more than 1  billion-plus Muslims around the world, obviously, every one as  terrorists; the mothers and fathers, the doctors and lawyers, the  countries that we seek to interact with, to collaborate with, and to be  developing into democracies those that are not?   It is outrageous when we use this place with such discourse or when  we have a medical doctor who says the Omicron is used by Democrats. It  is outrageous.   Let us act as if God we trust, and let us act as if there is dignity  in this place. Let us act as if we are leaders for the world.                            ____________________
