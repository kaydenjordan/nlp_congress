 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Harper for the opportunity to  speak on this very important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Jackie Speier, a Democrat from  California, and Barbara Comstock, a Republican from Virginia, for  providing leadership on this issue. I am delighted to join them.   Mr. Speaker, there can be absolutely zero tolerance for sexual  harassment, bullying, and intimidation in the workplace. I don't care  if you are a professional athlete, in the media business, in the  entertainment business, or certainly in the people's House here in  Congress, there can be zero tolerance for this sort of behavior.   It is about time, Mr. Speaker, that the legislative branch join the  executive branch in making sure there is mandatory training to try to  prevent this from happening and end it right now. I salute  Congresswoman Speier and Congresswoman Comstock for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, my only child is a millennial. The last thing I want to  worry about is my son going to work and being intimidated or harassed  such that he can't do his work.   My mother, who is now 89, had a terrific career in the healthcare  business. She was a nurse. She could not have had a career in nursing  had she showed up at hospitals and nursing homes being scared about a  work environment.   Finding and preventing sexual harassment, intimidation, and bullying  wherever it is is a no-brainer for Members of Congress. I am asking,  Mr. Speaker, everybody in this Chamber, whether Republican or  Democrat--and, yes, on the other side of the dome in the Senate, also-- to please, let's pass this resolution, starting in the House. It is a  first step to change the internal rules to eliminate this anywhere on  Capitol Hill.
