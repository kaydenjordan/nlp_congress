 Madam President, in May of 2013, one of my constituents,  Bob Evans from Lawrence County, was placed on the kidney transplant  list. His particular kidney ailment was hereditary, meaning family  members who might have been a match could not donate. So Bob was left  waiting for someone--someone--to step forward.   Unbeknownst to Bob, an acquaintance, Ray Lindsey, quietly went to get  tested. Now, Ray took several days off work, traveling 3 hours round  trip to Indianapolis to see if he would be a match. He was. And only  then did Ray tell Bob what he had been up to. In the summer of 2014,  Ray donated a kidney, and he saved Bob's life.   Yesterday, Ray, one of the most selfless people I have ever met,  passed away after a courageous battle with cancer.   Ray was a humble and unassuming family man with a sense of humor. On  his Facebook page, he called himself a ``part-time hillbilly.'' Ray  worked hard and, by the way, didn't get any compensation whatsoever for  the weeks he had to take off while recuperating from surgery.   Ray's sacrifice has made a lasting impact on public policy. His story  impacted and informed my interest in organ donation policy. I  introduced the PRISE Act to incentivize new breakthroughs in kidney  disease treatment options. In 2018, the Trump administration created a  similar program called KidneyX.   We know Ray saved one life, but his story and selflessness impacted  potentially thousands more.   Bob, by the way, is still going strong today, 8 years after the  transplant surgery.   Ray was a man of deep faith, and I can think of no better tribute to  Ray than words found in John, chapter 15:   [[Page S1795]]              My command is this. Love each other as I have loved you.       Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for       one's friends.    Ray lived those words, and I and countless others are going to miss  him deeply. I offer my condolences to all who loved Ray, including his  wife Debbie, three children, and eight grandchildren. Ray's incredible  life and impact will never be forgotten.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
