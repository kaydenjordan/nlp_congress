 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize one of my  constituents, 100-year-old World War II veteran Daniel Lawrence Holihan  of Staten Island, New York, who tomorrow will be awarded the Bronze  Star from Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro for his heroic  achievement.   In January, the members of the VFW Post 7172 on Staten Island, led by  Captain Timothy Forsyth, contacted my office about a veteran who they  believed should be recognized for his achievements on Iwo Jima in  February of 1945 as a member of the Underwater Demolition Team  Thirteen.   Five days before the historic battle of Iwo Jima, the USS Barr was  ordered to the eastern side of the island where Team Thirteen was  ordered to erect a navigational light on Higashi Iwa, an islet about  4,000 yards offshore.   Despite the heavy artillery fire of the enemy, 3 officers and 15 men  assigned to the task, including Petty Officer Daniel Holihan, were  miraculously successful in carrying out their mission without a single  casualty. These men worked tirelessly for 5 days to clear the water's  edge and make way for the historic battle of Iwo Jima.   Petty Officer Holihan, along with several other enlisted members of  his team, was initially recommended for the award of the Bronze Star  Medal; however, because Mr. Holihan was transferred to the East Coast  at the end of the war, he was not able to participate in the  presentation of this prestigious award.   Earlier this year, I wrote to the Secretary of the Navy highlighting  Mr. Holihan's contributions and asked that his service receive the  honor it deserves from our grateful nation. In response to my request,  tomorrow, Secretary of the Navy Del Toro will award Mr. Holihan the  Bronze Star for Valor for his heroic actions and his selflessness.  [[Page H2553]]    I, like those who I represent in New York's 11th Congressional  District, am very proud and grateful for Mr. Holihan's service to our  great nation and the bravery that he displayed nearly 80 years ago.   As we head into Memorial Day weekend to honor those who did not  return from war, those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, I also want to  give thanks to our servicemembers like Daniel Holihan who were willing  to give their lives, but thankfully returned home.                      Deadly Fentanyl Must be Controlled     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the HALT Fentanyl  Act. This is the Drug Enforcement Administration's top legislative  priority.   If we do not take action to permanently schedule fentanyl-related  substances, we will see many fentanyl-related substances becoming  street legal, we will see law enforcement lose their authority to seize  these extremely lethal drugs, we will see drug traffickers continue to  be empowered to push these deadly drugs on our children, and we will  see our U.S. Customs and Border Protection lose their authority to  seize these substances crossing the border.   In 2022, last year, more than 109,000 people died from fentanyl  overdoses, with the majority coming from illicit fentanyl and fentanyl- related substances. It is the number one killer of young Americans aged  18-49.   In addition to that, it is important to note that the DEA has  announced results of a years-long national operation, Operation Last  Mile, which specifically targeted fentanyl traffickers run by the drug  cartels operating right here in the United States.   According to the Department of Justice, there are two cartels who use  multicity distribution networks, violent local street gangs, and  individual dealers across the U.S. to drive addiction.   The DEA's operation led to the arrest of over 3,300 individuals and  the seizure of nearly 44 million fentanyl pills, more than 6,500 pounds  of fentanyl powder, more than 91,000 pounds of methamphetamine, 8,500  firearms, and more than $100 million. The fentanyl powder and pills  seized alone equate to nearly 193 million deadly doses of fentanyl  removed from our communities across the United States.   It is so incredibly important that we not only pass the HALT Fentanyl  Act to keep DEA having the tools they need to do their job, but we also  pass House Republicans' border security package. We know that the drug  traffickers are raking in $13 billion a year from human trafficking and  drug trafficking over our southern border.   According to the DEA, the Mexican criminal organizations are now the  most prominent wholesale-level heroin traffickers in the DEA Chicago,  New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Washington field division areas of  responsibility; and they have greatly expanded their presence in New  York City.   We must pass our border security bill in the Senate, and we must pass  the HALT Fentanyl Act here in the House and in the Senate, as well.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, once again we are seeing a policy from  President Biden and the Democrats where they say one thing, and they do  another.   How many times have you heard the President talk about made in  America? How many times have you heard the Democrats talk about buy in  America? Yet here we are seeing another policy that does just the  opposite. It hurts American manufacturers. It hurts American jobs. It  is giving an advantage to not just a competitor, but an adversary.   Mr. Speaker, we support energy diversification. We support clean  energy, but we want it to be American energy, and we want it to be done  by American workers in manufacturing right here in the United States of  America. We want to support our domestic solar manufacturers, not  further discourage them from investing in manufacturing here.   Instead, we see the Democrats put forward another policy that instead  of supporting American labor, it supports Communist Chinese slave  labor, and we know this is often linked to the genocide of the Uyghur  Muslims. If you are going to use Chinese slave labor, then at least  have them pay a fair tariff, at least have them follow the same rules.  Don't put forward a rule that allows them to circumvent tariffs.   As you know, last year an American solar manufacturer petitioned the  Commerce Department to review whether Chinese producers were  circumventing tariffs on imports from China by shipping their products  through Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.   Lo and behold, in December of 2022, President Biden's own Commerce  Department made a preliminary determination that circumvention is,  indeed, happening through all of those countries.   That is why we must support the American worker today. We must  support manufacturing in America, and override this veto of a  resolution that, quite frankly, passed with bipartisan support here and  in the Senate, as well.   Look, this is an opportunity for us to stand with American energy  producers. Like I said, we support clean energy, we support  diversification, but we want it to be made here in America using  [[Page H2575]]  American products, supporting American jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to urge my colleagues to support this joint  resolution to override the President's veto and do the right thing. We  are not going to allow the President to get away with this, to  constantly say made in America--he supports American workers, he says,  but then again, he puts forward another policy that does the exact  opposite. It hurts American people and is supporting the Communist  Chinese Party instead.
