 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember the  extraordinary life of Sheriff Reuel Todd. Sheriff Todd, affectionately  known by everyone in Oswego as Moe, was a loving husband, father, and  grandfather, who passed away on August 21, 2023, but not without making  an indelible impact on our community.   Sheriff Moe Todd's lifelong dedication to service began on June 29,  1974, when he joined the Oswego County Sheriff's Department. With  unwavering commitment and relentless determination, he climbed the  ranks, becoming a sergeant, a criminal investigator, and eventually the  undersheriff in 1984. His tenure culminated with his election as the  sheriff of Oswego County in 1998, a role he fulfilled with honor and  distinction for an impressive 20 years.   Throughout his career, Sheriff Todd was laser focused on the safety  and well-being of his colleagues and the communities he served. He was  a tireless advocate for everyone in the Oswego County Sheriff's  Department, fighting hard for essential equipment, training, and fair  pay for his team. His unwavering commitment to their safety and success  was evidence of his character and leadership.  [[Page H6811]]    In 2022, the Oswego County legislature recognized his exceptional  service to our community by dedicating the Oswego County Public Safety  Building in his name, a fitting tribute to his enduring legacy. I was  honored to be in attendance with a very huge crowd, all confirmation  that his compassion and his excellent service to his community was  appreciated by so many.   Moe and his beloved wife, Valerie, shared 55 years of marriage. He  was not only a loving husband, but also a devoted father to his son,  Michael, his daughter, Jolene, and proud grandfather to Kaitlynn. His  family meant the world to him, and he always found time for family  dinners, ball games, school activities, holidays, and precious moments  with all of them.   Moe coached baseball and softball, demonstrating his strong interest  in investing in the growth and development of young athletes and future  leaders. He was always ready to lend a hand for fundraisers and  community events, embodying the spirit of selflessness. Moe had a  unique ability to connect with people from all walks of life, treating  everyone with the same respect and kindness, regardless of their  background or circumstances. His honest and very frank demeanor--and,  yes, he was very frank--and a wonderful sense of humor was appreciated  by everyone he met.   In 2021, Moe faced one of his greatest challenges when he was  diagnosed with ALS. Yet, even in the face of this relentless and cruel  disease, he displayed incredible strength and resilience. He never once  complained or engaged in self-pity. Instead, his first thoughts were of  others facing the same struggle. Moe and his family organized the  annual ``Stronger with Moe'' chicken barbecue, with all proceeds going  to the ALS Association of Upstate New York to support families  struggling with ALS. His determination to help others, even while  suffering from this agonizing disease, was truly inspiring.   Tragically, Moe lost his battle with ALS on August 31, 2023, but his  legacy of kindness, compassion, and service will live on in the hearts  of all who knew him. As a tribute to his memory, his family will  continue the ``Stronger with Moe'' chicken barbecue, ensuring that his  spirit of helping others endures.   Today, as we honor and remember Moe, let us take inspiration from his  life, let us strive to embody the values he held dear--humility,  compassion, and a commitment to making our communities better for  everyone. Moe's life reminds us that the impact we make on others  through small acts of kindness, or a lifetime of service is what truly  matters in the end.   May God bless Moe, his family, and the community he served and loved  so deeply.               Mike Woodward, Champion for Wetland Conservation     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to Mike  Woodward, a resident of Oakfield, New York, whose dedication to  conservation has left a lasting impression on our community for many  generations to come.   Mike started his path in the conservation field in the 1970s when he  attended his very first Ducks Unlimited dinner. There he was inspired  to partner with Ducks Unlimited to champion wetland protection. He was  committed to the cause of wetland protection for almost 50 years. Mike  served on the national Ducks Unlimited board, where he was better able  to enhance his impact and improvements to wetland conservation.   Mike Woodward's influence extends far beyond his own achievements, as  his passion for conservation has touched the lives of his children and  grandchildren and left an indelible mark on their values and  priorities.   Today, I rise to proclaim that Mike Woodward is recognized as a  champion of wetland conservation. Mike's legacy of unwavering  dedication and visionary leadership has inspired others to embrace the  same cause and thus will ensure a better future for conservation  efforts and the preservation of our natural world.                  Honoring the Life of Anthony Mazurkiewicz     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 3838, bipartisan legislation that honors and remembers the  life and legacy of Rochester, New York, fallen police officer, Anthony  Mazurkiewicz. Officer Mazurkiewicz was killed in the line of duty on  July 21, 2022.   This bill would rename the post office facility in his hometown of  Avon, New York, in his honor. I thank my cosponsor, Congressman  Joe  Morelle, for joining me in this bipartisan and important effort.   Officer Mazurkiewicz began his law enforcement service in 1988,  receiving multiple awards throughout a career that spanned nearly 35  years. Beyond the badge and uniform, Officer Mazurkiewicz was a loving  father, a devoted husband, and an amazing friend. He exemplified  excellence in law enforcement.   We will never forget Officer Anthony Mazurkiewicz' sacrifice. This  legislation honors his incredible legacy, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.   I thank his lovely widow so much who has given me this beautiful  plastic band that honors and remembers his life and legacy.                                time  2045             Honoring Wayne Central School Teachers and Students     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a very tragic  occurrence but yet something with a great ending, with bus crash  heroes, as we call them in Wayne County.   On September 27, in Wayne County, New York, a Wayne Central schoolbus  carrying 22 students and 3 staff was traveling north on the road back  toward school when tragedy struck.   Three courageous staff members, driver Deb Hibbard along with  teachers Maureen Doyle and Lori Sozio, took immediate action in  protecting their students after a harrowing accident due to the  carelessness of a driver behind the bus.   As the bus came to a stop, Deb noticed smoke billowing from the front  and, without hesitation, urged everyone to evacuate. In a matter of  moments, all three staff members sprang into action to ensure the  safety of each and every passenger.   In the midst of the chaos, two students, Brody Constable and Colin  Schrage, who were seated at the back of the bus, displayed remarkable  bravery as they aided the remaining students and staff off the rear of  the bus, a 5-foot drop, allowing them to move away from the fire.   Due to the quick actions of these heroes, within just 1 minute of the  collision, all 25 passengers were safely evacuated.   By the end of the second minute, the entire bus, including the  passenger compartment, was engulfed in flames.   The selflessness and heroism of Brody, Colin, Deb, Maureen, and Lori  in the face of immediate danger serve as an inspiration to all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I also send many thanks to the emergency servicemembers  in the local fire departments of Lincoln, Ontario, Walworth, as well as  Wayne and Williamson ambulance service, who were promptly on the scene.   We commend and honor all of these heroes for their unwavering courage  and dedication to the safety of others.              Recognizing Paramedics Karen Gavin and Matt Devine     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize paramedics Karen  Gavin and Matt Devine of the Lockport Fire Department for heroically  saving the lives of a mother and her baby this past March.   Dispatchers received a report of a pregnant woman who was in distress  and bleeding heavily. The ambulance arrived in less than 5 minutes.  Gavin and Devine immediately began to administer treatment and prepared  the patients for transport.   While en route to the hospital, the woman went into labor and began  to give birth prematurely. As this happened, the paramedics immediately  stopped the ambulance, called for backup, and jumped into action.  Employing years of training, they were able to safely deliver the baby  and protect the mother's life.   Today, both the mother and child are home and healthy due to the  heroic and expert actions of Karen Gavin and Matt Devine of the  Lockport Fire Department.   This story is a perfect example of the hard work and expertise of our  first responders, who have answered the call to serve our communities  and those in need.   Mr. Speaker, I thank paramedics Karen Gavin and Matt Devine and the  Lockport Fire Department for their  [[Page H6812]]  compassionate and dedicated service to our community.                    recognizing laurence ``sparky'' rector     Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish Laurence J. Rector a happy  belated 100th birthday. Laurence, a World War II veteran, commonly  known as Sparky, began his education in Mexico, New York, at Mexico  Academy and from there earned his bachelor of science degree from  Ithaca College in 1948. He then continued his education at Syracuse  University, St. Lawrence University, and Oswego State University.   Sparky began his service as a corporal in the United States Army in  1942 and was honorably discharged in 1945. During his service, he  completed three major campaigns, earning him three battle stars, two  amphibious landings, and the Purple Heart for wounds sustained in  combat.   Sparky lived an active and inspired life. He loved sports and was  involved in numerous sports associations and coached track, basketball,  cross country, tennis, and baseball, creating a lasting impact on the  children he worked with and on our communities.   On behalf of Congress and all of New York-24, I wish Sparky a happy  belated 100th birthday and thank him for his honorable service to our  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 49 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, December 12, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
