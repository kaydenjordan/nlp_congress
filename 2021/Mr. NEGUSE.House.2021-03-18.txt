 Mr. Speaker, I had prepared remarks, but I cannot let the  minority leader's remarks go unanswered.   Some of my colleagues are aware of this. I was born in Minority  Leader McCarthy's district, in Bakersfield, California. My parents came  to this country 40 years ago as refugees. Because of the incredible  freedoms and opportunities that our wonderful country has to offer, we  have been able to live the American Dream. How dare he denigrate a  majority that is working to ensure that that dream remains secure for  thousands of Dreamers.   In his district, in my district, across the United States, young  people who live in fear, young people who have known no other country  but the United States as their home, that is what this bill is about.   Let's pass H.R. 6. Let's ensure that these Dreamers are treated the  way they should be, as Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you as the son of refugees. My parents  came to this country nearly 40 years ago in search of the American  Dream. Their ability to offer my sister and I countless freedoms and  opportunities and the fact that just one generation removed I can stand  in this chamber as a member of Congress, is powerful proof that that  dream still exists.  [[Page H1519]]    It is our duty to ensure that access to that dream remains  attainable, for the 800,000 young Dreamers currently living in the  shadows, for immigrants serving our communities on the frontlines of  this pandemic--all while living in tremendous uncertainty and fear.   This bill will codify what we already know to be true, that their  home is here.   We must pass H.R. 6. We must pursue the dream and the promise that is  embedded in our great nation.   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.
