 Madam Speaker, I thank Madam Chair for the kind remarks,  as well as my friend, Congressman Fallon, for those kind remarks about  my predecessor.   It is with a great deal of pride that I get to hear Ron Wright's name  spoken on the floor in order to support this renaming. So I rise to  address the House in support of S. 3825, designating the United States  Postal Service facility located at 3903 Melear Drive in Arlington,  Texas, as the Ron Wright Post Office Building.   I thank Senator Cornyn for authoring this bill, as well as my friend,  Senator Cruz, for cosponsoring.   Congressman Ron Wright dedicated his life to the people of Texas.  While starting his career working for Ceramic Cooling, it did not take  him long to begin serving his community.   In 2000, he was elected to the city council in Arlington, Texas.  During that time, he served as Congressman Joe Barton's district  director and later, as his Chief of Staff. From there, he was appointed  Tarrant County Tax Assessor Collector, where he served from 2011 to  2018, before beating me and getting elected to Congress.   Congressman Wright was a pillar in the community that he served, and  there is not an event in Tarrant County in which his name is not  mentioned today.   So I thank Ron for all that he has done for the people of Texas and  for the people of the United States. We will all miss Ron; and I hope  that Susan, his bride, and his children and grandchildren will take a  great deal of pride in the fact that this will be named after him. He  was a gentleman and a gentle man, and we will all miss him.
