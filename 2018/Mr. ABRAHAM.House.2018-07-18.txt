 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the Fish and Wildlife Service regularly  enters into cooperative agricultural agreement with farmers to plant  and raise crops on farm fields on national wildlife refuge land. Those  agreements require that the farmers leave a portion of that crop  standing over the winter in order to provide cover and forage for  wildlife. In the spring, those farmers plow up everything and start all  over again.   In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service began to prevent farmers who  entered into these agreements from planting GMO seed. This action was  not based on facts, it was not on rules, and this action is harmful to  both wildlife and to the farmers who are providing that food and cover.   GMO crops are proven safe. They use less water. They use less  pesticides. They use less fertilizer, and they feed much of the world,  both humans and animals.   Wildlife groups like Ducks Unlimited support this amendment, and I  ask for your support, too.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I just ask that my colleagues support this  commonsense amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
