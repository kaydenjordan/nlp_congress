 Mr. President, tomorrow will mark the first anniversary  of one of the darkest moments in our Nation's history. One year ago  tomorrow, a mob attacked this building. A mob of Americans, incited by  a sitting U.S. President, was determined to prevent the peaceful  transition of power that is the hallmark of our representative  democracy. A mob of Americans savagely attacked and overwhelmed the men  and women of the U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police  departments, smashed their way into this sacred space, and disrupted  the joint session of Congress fulfilling its constitutional duty to  count the electoral college ballots awarding the Presidency to Joe  Biden.   January 6, like December 7 and September 11, is a date which will  live in infamy.   I refer to the U.S. Capitol as a sacred space because it is so much  more than a building where the Senate and House of Representatives meet  and conduct business. It is the embodiment of our ideals, our  aspirations and hopes, not just to Americans but also to all of  humanity.   In the 1960 essay on ``national purpose'' for the New York Times and  LIFE magazine, Archibald MacLeish wrote:         There are those who will say that the liberation of       humanity, the freedom of man and mind is nothing but a dream.       They are right. It is the American Dream.    Insurrectionists desecrated this sacred space and everything it  stands for, including liberty, self-government and the rule of law. The  Architect of the Capitol can measure the damage they did to this  building in millions of dollars. The damage they did to our moral  standing in the world is inestimable.   I want to take this moment to acknowledge and pay tribute to the  thousands of people who work in Congress or cover it for the press and  continue to suffer from the trauma of January the 6th. I am talking  about the brave police officers who protected us. They engaged in a  battle that one officer described as ``medieval.''   And 140 of them, including Metropolitan Police Department officers,  suffered physical injuries. One of them, Officer Brian Sicknick, died.  I imagine all the officers who defended the Capitol bear the  psychological scars of the attack.   Four officers--Howard Liebengood, Jeffrey Smith, Gunther Hashida, and  Kyle DeFreytag committed suicide in the aftermath. But I am also  talking about the staff who work here in the Capitol, in the Senate and  House Chambers: the doorkeepers, the Parliamentarian's office, the bill  clerk, the Congressional Record staff, the floor and cloakroom staff,  and so many others. Many of them had to shelter in place. They had to  barricade themselves in offices, hoping the police would get to them  before the insurrectionists did.   I am talking about the committee and legislative staff in our DC  offices and back in our State and district offices, who watched the  attack in horror and disbelief and feared for the safety of their  friends and colleagues, who answer the phones and hear death threats  and obscenities.   I am talking about the food service workers, custodial staff, and  other Architect of the Capitol and Sergeant at Arms employees who were  caught in the mayhem and then immediately went to work cleaning up the  mess, repairing the damage, and providing other essential services, all  in the midst of a raging pandemic.   I am talking about those reporters who documented the insurrection at  great personal peril after Donald Trump spent the previous 4 years  calling them the enemies of the people and openly encouraged his  supporters to attack them at his rallies.   Congress could not function without this community of patriotic and  hard-working Americans. This community is hurting. On New Year's Day,  the Washington Post ran an article entitled ``Shaken by the Jan. 6  attack, Capitol workers quit jobs that once made them proud.'' ``Quit  jobs that once made them proud''--what a terrible thing, what a loss to  our Nation.   The danger our Nation faced on January 6 has not dissipated. As the  New York Times editorial board stated a few days ago, ``the Republic  faces an existential threat from a movement that is openly contemptuous  of democracy and has shown that it is willing to use violence to  achieve its ends.''   The leader of this movement, of course, is Donald Trump. The  organizing principle is the Big Lie that Democrats ``stole'' the  election. The mindset is what historian Richard Hofstadter called ``the  paranoid style in American politics,'' which ``produces . . . strivings  for evidence to prove that the unbelievable is the only thing that can  be believed.''   The response to nearly nonexistent voter fraud is to engage in  massive voter suppression. The objective is not election reform; it is  election repeal.   It is important to understand that the insurrection on January 6 was  not a spontaneous event. As Ed Kilgore wrote in a New York magazine  article entitled ``Trump's Long Campaign to Steal the Presidency: A  timeline,'' ``The insurrection was a complex, years-long plot, not a  one-day event. And it isn't over.''   Rightwing media personalities and QAnon conspiracy followers  feverishly and cynically stoke the movement for their own gain. Elected  Republican officials, fearful of Donald Trump's wrath or eager to curry  favor with him, enable it.  [[Page S41]]    In 1950, Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine issued her  ``Declaration of Conscience'' in response to another authoritarian  bully, fellow Republican Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin. Senator  Smith was no fan of the Truman administration, but she said the  following:   [T]o displace it with a Republican regime embracing a philosophy that  lacks political integrity or intellectual honesty would prove equally  disastrous to the nation. . . . I do not want to see the Republican  party ride to political victory on the Four Horsemen of Calumny--Fear,  Ignorance, Bigotry, and Smear. I doubt if the Republican party could do  so, simply because I do not believe the American people will uphold any  political party that puts political exploitation above national  interest. Surely we Republicans are not that desperate for victory.         I do not want to see the Republican party win that way.       While it might be a fleeting victory for the Republican       party, it would be a more lasting defeat for the American       people. Surely it would ultimately be suicide for the       Republican party and the two-party system that has protected       our American liberties from the dictatorship of a one-party       system.    I urge my Republican colleagues to follow the example of Margaret  Chase Smith. There is nothing conservative about advocating force over  the rule of law. There is nothing conservative about pledging loyalty  to a man over upholding the U.S. Constitution.   I understand that many Americans are disinclined to believe that the  President of the United States would blatantly lie to them, but it is  exactly what Donald Trump has been doing since he claimed that millions  of people who voted illegally cost him the popular vote majority in the  2016 election. In fact, his lies go back even further, to his vile  birther claims about President Obama.   We have the opportunity and the imperative for a course correction to  save our Republic, and that is to restore, expand, and protect voting  rights.   The Senate must consider S. 2747, the Freedom to Vote Act, and S. 4,  the bipartisan John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   On multiple occasions, Senate Democrats voted unanimously just to  begin considering these bills to protect people's right to vote, which  has come under sustained assault. Each time we have tried to proceed to  these measures, every Republican Senator has voted to sustain a  filibuster. Senate Republicans put gridlock and partisanship before the  rights of voters. They are blocking the Senate from having a chance to  consider options and amendments and do what the Founding Fathers  intended us to do: debate and legislate.   Within the next few days, our Republican colleagues in the Senate  will have yet another opportunity, a chance to do the right thing. Many  Senators have worked diligently to come up with compromise legislation  that still preserves the essential elements of S. 1, For the People  Act, that the House of Representatives has already passed.   And President Biden is absolutely correct that we need to enact  voting rights legislation to repair the damage the Supreme Court did to  the Voting Rights Act. President Biden rightly calls efforts to limit  ballot access across the country as a 21st century Jim Crow assault. He  warned Americans that the Republican efforts to restrict voting rights  as a result of their selfish challenge of the 2020 election results  represent ``the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil  War.''   In many States, Republican legislatures and Governors have responded  to the falsehoods of the 2020 election by restricting voting  accessibility. Donald Trump's Big Lie has directly led to  disenfranchisement and suppression of the right to vote of millions of  Americans.   I urge my colleagues and my fellow American citizens to reflect on  the state of our democracy and the rights we hold so dear. A blatant  attempt to falsify an election and persistent efforts to deny the  American people access to the ballot box has eroded American democracy  to a dangerous level and undermined the freedom and liberty that so  many Americans have fought to defend and advance.   After elections are over and we win, we celebrate. We celebrate the  fact that we have garnered the support of the majority of the voters.  If we don't win--I think many of us have been involved in campaigns  where our candidates have not been successful--we go to work and try to  attract more voters in the next election so we can celebrate a victory.  That is what participation in a free society is all about. That is what  democracies are about.   And repressive, autocratic regimes never accept the will of the  people so they look at ways in which they can undermine the voting  record, what the voters want, and the voters' will.   We should all celebrate the record number of people who cast their  ballots in the 2020 Presidential election. More Americans cast their  votes for the Presidential candidate than ever before.   After the election, both Democrats and Republicans conducted numerous  reviews at the Federal, State, and local levels. Those reviews verified  the simple fact that there was no widespread corruption or election  fraud; that the will of the people prevailed; and Joe Biden and Kamala  Harris were duly elected.   Congress and Vice President Pence counted the electoral votes for  President and Vice President and did their duty under the Constitution  on January 6, notwithstanding the armed insurrection at the Capitol.   But that did not stop Donald Trump from promoting the Big Lie, and  that, in turn, has prompted Republican-led States to make it harder for  people to cast their votes. The Brennan Center has pointed out that we  are in the middle of the worst assault on voting rights since Jim Crow.   So what are these laws doing? They are making it more difficult for  people to register to vote. They are making it more difficult to vote  by mail. They are making it more difficult to vote in person.  Republicans apparently believe that demographic trends will prevent  them from winning elections so they are surgically attacking the voting  rights of people--mostly people of color--they believe will not vote  for them.   We have States that have 100 percent voting by mail. There has been  no indication of fraud in voting by mail. But now, some States have  shortened the time for requesting mail-in ballots, making it more  difficult for individuals to vote by mail. They are making it more  difficult for people to deliver their ballots by limiting the  availability of ballot drop boxes, all because they think that will be  utilized more by people who will not vote for them.   The Republicans in charge of these States want to make it harder for  people to vote in person too--stricter signature requirements, reducing  the number of places where people can vote, purging voter rolls simply  because a person didn't vote, and the list goes on and on and on; all  of these making it more difficult for people to register to vote or be  eligible to vote who are more likely to vote for their opponents. Some  of these States are even opening up the possibility that election  officials can substitute their judgment for the will of the people.   The Freedom to Vote Act provides a basic Federal floor on protecting  the right to vote. The legislation includes commonsense items such as  automatic and online voter registration, uniform early voting, same-day  voter registration, voting by mail and drop box standards and uniform  national standards for voter identification.   The Freedom to Vote Act ends political gerrymandering by creating  nonpartisan redistricting commissions, requires voter-verified paper  ballots and reliable audits, and ends the dominance of Big Money in  political systems by increasing disclosure and transparency.   S. 2747 includes two provisions I authored: First, it includes the  Democracy Restoration Act, which deals with laws that many States  passed at the end of the Civil War that are still on the books that  disqualify a person convicted of a felony from voting for the rest of  his or her life. The definition of ``felony'' can be quite general in  many States so the impact of these laws fall disproportionately on  people of color, which was its intent. There are States where one out  of five Black Americans have been disqualified from voting because of a  felony conviction, even when that individual has served his or her  sentence and has returned to society. We need to remove that  disqualification on voting.  [[Page S42]]    I am proud that S. 2747 also includes my Deceptive Practices and  Voter Intimidation Prevention Act. Spreading false or misleading  information or intimidating the electorate remain regularly employed  and effective methods to keep individuals, particularly Black Americans  and racial minorities, from voting. Advancements in communications,  including the rise of social media platforms, have made it easier for  bad actors to use these strategies. My provisions prohibit individuals  from knowingly deceiving voters about the time, place, eligibility or  procedures of participating in a Federal election. It criminalizes  intentional efforts to hinder, interfere with, or prevent another  person from voting, registering to vote, or aiding another person to  vote or register to vote.   The late John Lewis of Georgia was a dear friend and a former  colleague. We first won election to the U.S. House of Representatives  on the same day. Representative Lewis recalled an important lesson that  he learned from the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., when he said  that ``each of us has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up, and  speak out. When you see something that is not right, you must say  something. You must do something. Democracy is not a state. It is an  act. And each generation must do its part.''   Well, we need to follow Congressman Lewis' admonition. We can do our  part by passing the bipartisan John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement  Act, S. 4. Congress has a historic and bipartisan tradition of coming  together across party lines to safeguard and strengthen the right to  vote, which is the bedrock of our democracy.   Congress passed and the States ratified the 15th Amendment after the  Civil War, which declared that ``the rights of citizens of the United  States to vote should not be denied or abridged by the United States or  by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of  servitude.''   The 15th Amendment also states that Congress--Congress--has the power  to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.   That is exactly what the Senate is trying to do with the John Lewis  legislation. The bill would restore key provisions of the Voting Rights  Act of 1965 that the Supreme Court severely weakened in its Shelby  County v. Holder decision.   Fifty-seven years ago, Congress designed the Voting Rights Act to  protect equal access to elections for all eligible Americans and passed  the measure to respond to widespread disenfranchisement--particularly  of racial and language minorities--between the post-Civil War period  and the 1960s.   S. 4 would require the Federal pre-clearance for certain changes to  voting laws and procedures. It would block changes that restrict the  right to vote, particularly changes that disproportionately  disenfranchise minority communities. The bill would allow plaintiffs  and the Justice Department to bring lawsuits that deny or abridge the  voting rights of minority voters and restore legal tools needed to  enforce nationwide, permanent Federal bans on voter suppression efforts  targeting minorities.   We cannot pass voting rights legislation as long as the Senate  Republicans continue to filibuster even just to proceed to S. 2747 and  S. 4. Inaction on voting rights is not an option as we prepare for our  2022 elections, which must be free and fair so that the American people  have faith in our elections and their outcomes, particularly after the  insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6.   We need to change the filibuster rule. As President Biden just said  before the holidays, ``If the only thing standing between getting  voting rights legislation passed and not getting it passed is the  filibuster, I support making the exception of voting rights for the  filibuster.''   I agree with President Biden. We cannot take action to safeguard  voting rights if we don't start right now. States are already drawing  their 2022 political boundaries to comply with population changes from  the 2020 census, and we cannot start our work unless my colleagues  allow us to proceed to this issue on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   I urge my colleagues not to filibuster the right of the U.S. Senate  to start the debate on protecting voter integrity, where each Member  will have the opportunity to debate the issue and offer amendments.  Many Senators have offered suggestions about how we can improve these  two voting rights bills. Collectively, we have a chance to come  together for the American people, something they elected us to do.   We will not reach a consensus if we cannot even proceed to the bills.  I will support changing the Senate rules, returning the Senate to its  historic role of debating and voting on critical issues.   Voting rights legislation needs to be debated in the Senate and voted  upon by a majority vote in the U.S. Senate.   Our noble experiment representing democracy is in grave danger. Let  us come together and protect the integrity of the Senate, respond to  the threat we saw on January 6 of last year, and take up and pass  voting rights legislation.   I yield the floor.
