 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to recognize a great  American patriot, Captain Steve Banta, call-sign ``Slash,'' who will be  retiring this week from his post as commanding officer of Naval Air  Station Corpus Christi.   A 1991 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, where he earned a  bachelor's degree in engineering, Captain Banta completed primary naval  aviation training with the VT-27 Boomers at NAS Corpus Christi, and was  designated a naval aviator on March 18, 1994.   His sea duty included deployments on various cruisers, destroyers,  frigates to the Mediterranean, Arabian Gulf, Caribbean, Southeast  Pacific, and other areas. During his deployment as maintenance officer  with HSL-44 Detachment Four, they were the first in the fleet to test  the Hellfire missile.   On September 11, 2001, he was deployed on the USS Carl Vinson with  Carrier Group Three. During the first 4 months of Operation Enduring  Freedom, he coordinated the daily schedule of more than 40 helicopters  in 16 different aviation units. In 2009 and 2010, he served as  commanding officer of the world famous HSL-48 Vipers. During his  tenure, they earned multiple awards for tactical and retention  excellence.   Captain Banta's shore duties includes tours as a Seahawk helicopter  flight instructor, as an analyst in the Pentagon for the Navy's role in  Operation Enduring Freedom, and as the lead country program director  for Afghanistan with the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.   He earned a master's degree in national security strategy at the  National War College in 2011.   Captain Banta assumed command of Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on  June 26, 2014. During his tour, improvements in infrastructure, program  management, and quality of life resulted in numerous awards, including  Department of Defense Fire Department of the Year, Fire Department  National Accreditation, SECNAV Gold Award for Energy and Water  Management, and CNO Shore Safety Award. The Wingspan Newspaper was  ranked number one in the Navy, and the base was on the A-list for  outstanding customer satisfaction in family housing, and more.   Captain Banta has been an invaluable asset to the Navy, south Texas,  and the United States. I wish him and his wife, Sarah, a Corpus Christi  native, best of luck as he moves into civilian life and begins his new  job as executive director of the USS Lexington Museum on the Bay. Thank  you, Captain Banta, for your service.                            ____________________
