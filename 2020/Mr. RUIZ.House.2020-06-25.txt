 Mr. Speaker, the recent killings of George Floyd, Breonna  Taylor, and Rayshard Brooks by police officers have highlighted the  anguish and injustices that Black communities have experienced for  generations; have shook our Nation to its core; and made evident,  starkly, the racial injustice in our Nation.   As we watch the unrest, as we hear the pain, it is imperative we ask  ourselves: What are we doing about it?   It is more important than ever that we have the difficult but  necessary conversations to address racially targeted excessive use of  force and racial profiling by police who do not follow their own  professional code of conduct. There must be dialogue. There must be a  humble willingness to listen, reflect, and come together to make  change.   In the last few weeks, that is exactly what we have done in my  district, in California's 36th. Over the past few weeks, I held  listening sessions and roundtables to elevate the voices and  experiences of leaders in the Black community. They shared their  stories, perspectives, and recommendations for change.   I also convened an important dialogue between African-American  leaders and our local police chiefs. Our local police chiefs have come  to the table with open ears and a willingness to be part of that change  that we seek.   These conversations were impactful and productive. We outlined next  steps, steps like banning choke holds, expanding the use of body  cameras, increasing transparency and accountability, increasing  community engagement, and annual mental health wellness checks for  police officers.   I am encouraged by the progress, and I look forward to the hard work  that will lead to real change in our community, change that will move  our community and Nation from internalizing despair to externalizing  hope and action for change.                          Supporting ACA Enhancement     Mr. Speaker, as an emergency physician, I have seen the  faces of failed healthcare policies. I have looked into the eyes of the  suffering when they couldn't afford care. I have cried with families  who have lost a loved one, knowing it could have been prevented with  routine care if only they had health insurance.   Even now, I have gone into hard-to-reach and high-risk communities  and personally conducted COVID-19 testing, watching the health  inequities and disparities play out in real time, seeing  disproportionately higher rates of transmission and deaths in low- income, uninsured, Latino, farmworker, and the homeless communities.   As a physician and humanitarian, I find it unconscionable, repulsive,  that during a global pandemic, while millions are infected by COVID-19  and millions more are unemployed and struggling economically, that the  Trump administration is actively working to repeal the Affordable Care  Act through the Supreme Court.   Repealing the ACA would be a disaster, leading to millions of  families facing financial hardships and many, many more deaths from  COVID-19.   Repealing the ACA would eliminate protections for people with  preexisting conditions, the very same conditions that render a person  more likely to die from COVID-19.   Repealing the ACA would take away health insurance from millions of  Americans who, for the first time, have health insurance because of the  Medicaid expansion.   It is precisely during this time that we must work to expand  healthcare access and make it affordable, which is what H.R. 1425, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act, would do.   It is precisely now that we need to lower healthcare premiums for  middle-class families, encourage States to expand Medicaid, strengthen  protections for preexisting conditions, and lower the cost of  prescription drugs.   I support this bill for the people, and I will continue fighting for  the people to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for the  people.                            ____________________
