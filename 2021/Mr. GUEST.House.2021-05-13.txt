 Mr. Speaker, the men and women of law enforcement live by  a creed that sets them apart from all other professions. Unfortunately,  that creed, to serve and to protect, often places them in harm's way.   While Scripture does not speak directly about law enforcement, we see  that Christ said, ``blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be  called children of God.''   The peacemakers we honor today are not only law enforcement officers,  but they are mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters. They are leaders  who face danger on a daily basis to help transform their communities to  be better places to live and to worship and to raise a family.   Their service, their love of fellow officers, their love of  community, and the sacrifice of law enforcement must not be forgotten.  That is why I am proud to join Congresswoman Julia Letlow from  Louisiana to introduce the resolution expressing support for  recognizing National Police Week. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that over  90 of our House colleagues have joined this effort.   The men and women of law enforcement will always be remembered as  heroes.                            ____________________
