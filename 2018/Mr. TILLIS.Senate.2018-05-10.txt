 Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, I started the first  of what will be a weekly speech to bring attention to what I think is a  travesty of justice occurring in Turkey.   I wish to speak about a pastor, a Presbyterian minister from North  Carolina, who has lived in Turkey for about 20 years and who has done  his very best to respect the laws of Turkey and to bring the Word to  people who want to hear it.   Unfortunately, he has been swept up in a coup. He has been swept up  in the emergency powers of Turkey. He has been in prison for 580 days.   I went to Turkey about 6 weeks ago to visit Pastor Brunson in prison  because I heard that after being in prison for about a year and a  half--and for much of that time in a cell that is designed for 8 people  and had 21 people in it--he was then indicted. I heard he was afraid  the American people were going to read that 62-page bogus indictment,  with some of the flimsiest charges we could imagine--charges that  wouldn't keep someone overnight in an American jail--that have kept him  in prison for 580 days. About 2 months ago, he was indicted, but he  said to his wife and friends, he was afraid the American people would  read that indictment and turn their backs on him.   So it was important for me to travel over there and tell him face-to- face in that Turkish prison that is the last thing that is going to  happen. We are going to continue to work every day he is in prison. I  am going to come to the Senate floor, and other Members are, every week  for as long as he is illegally in prison, and we are going to make sure  the American people and the Turkish people know what is going on and  send a very clear message to the leaders of Turkey that this is an  unacceptable way to deal with a NATO ally. It is a horrible way to deal  with somebody who is only guilty of standing up for a church in Izmir.    It is a small church. Actually, the seating area down below, maybe if  it was packed, could hold 150 people. It opens up to a street. It is in  a residential area. They let anybody come in. They open their windows.  They actually talk with the police about security matters so they know  what is going on, but it is just a small church, and all he was trying  to do is provide aid and comfort for those who want to seek it.   Every once in a while, he would go to Syria or other parts of Turkey  to try to provide aid and comfort to those who need it, Syrian refugees  or anyone else. Part of the charges are actually related to that. If  you provide aid and comfort, food, to a Kurdish person, in Turkey  today, you may be considered a terrorist or a coup plotter. That is  what he has been charged with.   In my second trip, I spent 12 hours in a Turkish courtroom to hear  every word of the testimony from secret witnesses--whom Pastor Brunson  didn't get to face--about the horrible things he did. One of the  charges was that one night a witness saw for 4 hours a light on in one  of the rooms in the church. Here is the problem with that charge: That  is the room. It doesn't have a window. So unless they had x-ray vision,  there is no possible way they could have observed that, but it became  weighty testimony in the courtroom.   It is a kangaroo court. I want to continue to say, if you don't know  ``kangaroo court,'' there is the definition. It is just a trumped-up  theater that bears no resemblance to anything you would ever see in  American jurisprudence.   Let me give another idea of the level of absurdity of the charges.  Pastor Brunson's daughter posted how much she enjoyed a meal with  friends. It turns out the prosecutor thought this particular meal was  something that was enjoyed by people who participated in the Gulen  movement, and therefore her father must somehow be associated with the  coup attempt. These are actually serious discussions going on in a  Turkish courtroom.   I wasn't able to make it back to Turkey on Monday. I understand that  basically the same thing happened, but it got worse. On Monday, when  Pastor Brunson and his defense attorney had asked that 10 other  witnesses testify on his behalf, they weren't allowed to testify  because they were suspects. They weren't convicted. They apparently  have been charged or considered to be charged, but in Turkish  jurisprudence standards, to be suspect is enough to prevent you from  actually helping defend someone who is on trial for a 35-year sentence.   He has been in prison for 580 days. He has lost 50 pounds. He is  struggling to keep his wits about him, and he and his wife are doing an  extraordinary job. This is a miscarriage of justice.   I believe, today, as I said in a speech 2 weeks ago, and I will say  it again: Don't travel to Turkey right now. If you are thinking about  making a trip to Turkey, make sure you don't eat this meal--and, for  goodness' sake, if you do, don't post how much you enjoyed it because  you may be considered a Gulenist. Don't take a picture with friendly  people on the street whose ethnic origins you don't know because they  may have you associated with somebody who is suspected of plotting a  coup. That is the reality of Turkey today.   I can't guarantee the safety of North Carolinians because I have yet  to actually speak with people in their state department and their  foreign ministry who actually understand the absurdity of what is going  on in Turkey today.   I hope we can get back to a better position, but until this man is  released, and others who have been falsely charged are treated fairly,  I am going to have to come to the Senate floor each and every week we  are in session to make sure the American people know what is going on  in Turkey and to make absolutely certain that people like Pastor  Brunson who are in prison know they have people in the U.S. Senate.   In fact, 66 Senate Members have signed a letter--that is a big lift  in the U.S. Senate to get any 66 Members to agree on something--to send  a very clear message that we are watching, and there will be  consequences if this man is wrongfully imprisoned and could potentially  spend the rest of his life in Turkey.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with  my friend and colleague from Oklahoma.    Mr. President, with that approval, I will pass it over  and thank Senator Lankford for his hard work--he has been aware of this  issue from day one--and collaboration on it.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Lankford.   I went to Turkey when I was speaker of the house in North Carolina  and led a delegation there about 7 years ago, spent 9 days, met with  business leaders, and met with President Erdogan. I came away with a  great deal of optimism--as a matter of fact, so much optimism, I hosted  a delegation from the mayor of Kayseri, who is now a Minister in the  Turkish Government, to talk about how North Carolina and Turkey could  build stronger economic ties. We both have textile and furniture  industries. It looked like a great opportunity, but, as Senator  Lankford said, the Turkey of today bears no resemblance to the Turkey I  visited about 7 years ago, to the Turkey I visited just a few weeks  ago.   I would like to be talking about how we help Turkey take the fight to  terrorist organizations threatening their homeland. I would like to  work more with Turkey, as we have this week, to identify ISIS leaders,  detain them, and make that region safer.   I would like to be a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee-- and sit right next to Senator Sullivan--fighting for additional NDAA  provisions that underscore our commitment to our NATO ally in Turkey,  but now I am at a fork in the road, and right now I only have one  position to take; that is, to put Turkey on notice for their bad  actions as a NATO ally and for their bad actions toward American  nationals in the country of Turkey.   So I am with Senator Lankford, Senator Shaheen, and other Senators.  When we do our markup on the national defense authorization, instead of  talking about how we strengthen our relationship for their part in  manufacturing the Joint Strike Fighter and what is the timeline to  actually have our NATO ally have Joint Strike Fighters, F-35s, within  their military base, now I have to start talking about whether they  should have it at all. I have to start talking about what are the  implications of a Russian missile defense system in a NATO country,  with all the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets that  come with it. I have to start talking about what the future of our  relationship is with a nation that is, for the first time in NATO  history, holding American hostages--a NATO ally. I have to take  [[Page S2607]]  things in a different direction. It is my responsibility, as the co- lead of the Senate NATO observer group, as the Senator of a State who  has had a citizen in prison for 580 days. I have no choice.   I thank the Presiding Officer for the time today. I will be back next  week, and I will be back every week until we see justice served for  Pastor Brunson.   I yield the floor.
