 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7776, the James  Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act.   Providing the authorities and resources our warfighters need to  defend our Nation and defeat our adversaries is the greatest  responsibility that we have in this Congress. We fulfill that  responsibility with this NDAA.   We put our servicemembers first, providing a 4.6 percent pay raise  and expanding benefits for military spouses and families.   To counteract the effects of record inflation on our military  families, this bill increases housing allowances and lowers prices at  commissaries, which offset the skyrocketing costs for rent and food;  and it expands eligibility for low-income military families to receive  additional allowances to cover basic needs.   This bill also ends the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The mandate has  been needlessly forcing out thousands of talented and experienced  servicemembers. I am pleased that we have reached an agreement on this.   This bill is also focused on ensuring our warfighters are the best  equipped and trained in the world.   We increase funding for readiness, reversing cuts in military  construction and housing projects; expanding training availabilities  for servicemembers; and improving the safety of the ships, aircraft,  combat vehicles, and facilities where our warfighters serve.   We also divest of over $6 billion in the legacy systems that do  little or nothing to deter China, or our other adversaries.   We reinvest those savings in emerging technologies, such as IA,  quantum computing, hypersonic weapons, and autonomous systems. These  are the technologies we need to ensure our warfighters prevail in  future battlefields. The threats against us are rapidly evolving.   H.R. 7776 is laser-focused on preparing our military to counter  threats from China and our other adversaries. It makes critical  investments in new systems capable of surviving in contested  environments.   It includes provisions that will further harden our supply chain and  industrial base against filtration from China; and it reaffirms our  support to allies in the region, especially Taiwan.   Finally, it strengthens our European alliance, as these democracies  face grave threats from that crackpot in the Kremlin.   I am very proud that we have, once again, come together in a  bipartisan, bicameral fashion to fulfill our constitutional duty and  produce a fiscal year 2023 NDAA. I urge all Members to support it.   Also, like the chairman, I thank our staff for doing an incredibly  good job of helping pull this together. I couldn't have a better  partner in running this committee than Chairman Smith. So I thank him  very much for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1215     Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I will concur with my friend and colleague from California. You are  going to be missed, not only as a member of our committee but as a  Member of this body. We have been fortunate to have had the privilege  of serving with you.   Similarly, I would like to recognize my friend and colleague from  Missouri, who is also going to be sorely missed. She has been a very  valuable member of our committee for a long time and a leader on our  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I do want to say, I am going to  miss the gentlewoman from California. She has been a great member of  our committee and has really championed some important issues that she  just addressed. We will miss her.   I do want to respond to her last remark and make a point. There is  nothing in this bill that authorizes leave and paid travel for  servicemembers to get an abortion. There is no policy in place in the  Department for this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi  (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly agree with Mr.  DeFazio on those icebreakers. It is just inexcusable that we don't have  that capability.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the balance of my  time until the chairman is ready to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I want to close by thanking Chairman Smith. There is no better  partner that I could have, and I am grateful for his leadership.   I also want to thank Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Inhofe. As many  know, Jim Inhofe is retiring at the end of this Congress. Throughout  his decades of service, he has been a consistent champion for our men  and women in uniform. It was very fitting and appropriate that we name  this year's NDAA after Jim Inhofe.   Finally, I thank our staff on both sides of the aisle for their  tireless work on this product. I thank the staff of legislative counsel  and the CBO for their tremendous contributions, as well.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the 81st anniversary of the devastating  attack on Pearl Harbor. In its aftermath, we built the strongest  military in the world with a mission to protect the greatest Nation on  Earth. This bill before us today will ensure our military can continue  to carry out that sacred mission.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
