 Madam Speaker, I thank the manager of the  legislation and chairman of the committee for this important  legislation.   The Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act is extremely  important. As we all know, this bipartisan bill will bring about an  enhanced ability to serve the community.   The CSBG moneys are particularly important not only to rural areas  but to urban areas. They are important as they relate to many issues,  such as in my community dealing with overcoming disasters. Those  dollars are utilized to ensure housing.   I include in the Record an article entitled, ``Black communities are  last in line for disaster planning in Texas'' and an article entitled,  ``5 years after Hurricane Harvey, many in Houston are still waiting for  help.''                  [From the Washington Post, May 12, 2022]     Black Communities Are Last in Line for Disaster Planning in Texas         Houston.--Lawrence Hester worries every time it rains.        During heavy storms, water overflows the dirt drainage       ditch fronting his yard and the bayou at the end of his       block--flooding the street, creeping up his front steps,       pooling beneath the house, and trapping his family inside.        ``We are always underwater here,'' said Hester, 61.        And yet, the state of Texas allocated none of the $1       billion in federal funds it received to protect communities       from future disasters to neighborhoods in Houston that flood       regularly, according to an investigation by the U.S.       Department of Housing and Urban Development.        HUD has now found the exclusion of those majority Black and       Hispanic urban communities to be discriminatory. The state       ``shifted money away from the areas and people that needed it       the most,'' disproportionately benefiting White residents       living in smaller towns, the agency concluded.        Houston has faced seven federally declared disasters in the       last seven years and suffered an estimated $2 billion in       damage from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. That storm devastated       Kashmere Gardens, where Hester has lived his entire life. The       floodwaters from Harvey deposited black mold throughout       Hester's home and left his daughter chronically short of       breath.        The state, which is appealing HUD's findings, denied       discriminating, saying the Texas General Land Office       administered the federal grant program based on HUD approval.        The situation in Texas illustrates the challenge facing the       Biden administration, which has pledged to focus on racial       equity but is struggling to protect low-income communities of       color from the growing threat of climate change. Even after       HUD's finding of discrimination, the agency said it does not       have the power at this time to suspend the rest of the $4.3       billion in disaster mitigation money awarded to the state       under criteria approved by the Trump administration.        ``What is happening here with these federal dollars going       through the state and not one dime coming to the City of       Houston post-Hurricane Harvey is absolutely crazy, and it       cannot be justified,'' said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner.       ``What do I say to the people in Kashmere Gardens when these       storms keep coming, and we are not putting in the       infrastructure that they desperately need to mitigate the       risk of future flooding?''        Black and Hispanic communities in northeast Houston,       including Kashmere Gardens, are especially vulnerable to the       more frequent storms and catastrophic flooding expected due       to climate change, according to the Federal Emergency       Management Agency. Many of the residential streets lack curbs       and gutters--common storm drainage infrastructure in       predominantly White neighborhoods in Houston--and rely       instead on open ditches dating back to the 1930s.        ``Sometimes we can't get out because the water is so       high,'' said Jackie Spradley, Hester's wife. ``You're       literally trapped until the water starts to subside.'' She       can't get to work. Their 12-year-old daughter can't get to       school.        The whoosh of traffic and trains permeates the triangular       neighborhood of modest single-family homes penned between two       highways and two sets of railroad tracks. During large       storms, runoff from impervious highway surfaces flows onto       residential streets.        Piles of trash--old tires, mattresses, furniture, home       insulation--accumulate for weeks in the drainage ditches       along many streets, blocking water from flowing through the       ditches to the bayou. Silt and other debris clog many of the       culverts beneath narrow driveways and footpaths spanning the       ditches. In the summers, standing water breeds mosquitoes.        The city of Houston had hoped to use $95 million in federal       grants to upgrade Kashmere Gardens' storm drainage       infrastructure. The proposed improvements, including       converting some of the ditches to a curb and gutter system,       would have removed the flood risk to nearly 1,400 properties.        But without the money, the city shelved those plans.        Hester's daughter Ashlei was 7 years old in 2017 when       Harvey floodwaters breached their family room, lapping at the       legs of the card table on which the family played dominoes.       Her cough worsened, and doctors prescribed four different       medications for asthma. She was hospitalized in 2018 for       more than a week. But doctors still did not know what was       causing her illness.        It wasn't until December 2019, more than two years after       Harvey, when Hester and his wife discovered the black mold       that was making their daughter so sick. A city inspector       recommended that the house be condemned.        ``I was so ashamed,'' Hester said. ``We didn't have nowhere       else to go.''        His mother had purchased the home in 1960, paying the       mortgage with wages from her job flipping burgers 16 hours a       day. Hester was born in the house months later.        He had stayed in the house after Hurricane Alicia flooded       the home in 1983. And after Ike in 2008. Even after Harvey,       Hester stayed, hoping to someday pass the three-bedroom       ranch-style home onto his daughter.        But Hester, who is on disability for herniated disks in his       back and neck from his years as a long-haul truck driver, and       his wife, who sells insurance, never had the money to       adequately repair the storm-ravaged roof and mold-covered       walls.        Hester said the city informed him after Harvey that he was       ineligible for funding to fix the home because of unpaid       property taxes.        ``It's not just about the storm drainage,'' Hester said.       ``It's about everything.''        Hester said that the rainbow-hued oily waters he had       splashed in while playing in the drainage ditches as a child       had been polluted with cancer-causing creosote used to treat       wooden railroad ties and utility poles. A 2019 state health       department investigation confirmed elevated cancer rates       among residents in the southern end of Kashmere Gardens,       located near two Superfund sites. Residents fear that       flooding will carry toxic deposits into their yards.        Hester's mother had died of cancer. So had his father. And       one of his brothers. ``Cancer is killing the whole       neighborhood,'' said Hester, who is too afraid to visit the       doctor about his own health problems.        Federal disaster mitigation grants are supposed to improve       the inferior flood infrastructure in lower income       communities. But the HUD investigation found that competition       rules set by the Texas General Land Office unfairly favored       smaller towns with less urgent needs and where residents are       more likely to be White and less likely to be lower income.        The state knowingly adopted scoring criteria that       prioritized lower-density areas and excluded communities that       HUD designated as the most impacted by disasters from half       the grants, HUD said.        ``Because the criteria had these unjustified discriminatory       effects, their use failed to comply with HUD's regulations,''       the agency found.        No other state adopted Texas' method of distributing the       funds, according to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal       Opportunity. The agency concluded that without Texas's       discriminatory criteria, nearly four times as many Black       residents and more than twice as many Hispanic residents       would have benefited from the grants.        The General Land Office said in its April 1 appeal that the       state ``does not discriminate, and the projects it has funded       help minority beneficiaries across Texas.'' The state said       more than two-thirds of residents in communities that       received awards are Black, Hispanic or Asian. The state       pointed out that its plan was approved two years ago and       characterized HUD's new objections as ``politically       motivated.''        In addition to Houston and surrounding Harris County, the       General Land Office denied grants to the predominantly Black       and Hispanic cities of Port Arthur, Beaumont and Corpus       Christi as well as Jefferson and Nueces counties--all of       which experienced significant flooding from Harvey, according       to the civil rights complaint. Texas Housers, a nonprofit       focused on housing in low-income communities, and Northeast       Action Collective, a grassroots advocacy group of Houston       residents, filed the complaint with HUD last year.        Instead, funds were steered toward inland, Whiter       communities that were far less severely impacted by       hurricanes and used to fund routine infrastructure, the       complaint said. That includes $17.5 million for a new       community center in Caldwell County that is supposed to       double as an evacuation center; $10.8 million to install a       sewage system in the 379-person town of Iola; $6 million for       a new sheriff's department radio tower and radios for       Gonzales County; and $4.2 million for a 2,000-foot-long road       in Bastrop County to connect a Walmart parking lot and a Home       Depot, justified as an alternate path for emergency vehicles       in case the adjacent freeway is clogged with hurricane       evacuees from the Gulf Coast 161 miles away.        ``These mitigation funds are a strategy to undo the       systemic racism of the past, but that's not what we're seeing       Texas interested in at all,'' said John Henneberger, co-      director of Texas Housers. ``This is a test of how serious       HUD and the Biden administration are in enforcing civil       rights.''        HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development, which       oversees disaster mitigation aid, wrote to the Texas General       Land Office in March expressing ``grave concerns'' over the       distribution of the first round of  [[Page H4946]]       grants. ``The State has not identified a plan to protect       communities while guarding against competition criteria that       could disadvantage minority residents,'' HUD wrote. If a       voluntary resolution cannot be reached, HUD said it could       refer the matter to the Department of Justice for       enforcement.        But advocates worry that could come too late for       communities like Kashmere Gardens.        While HUD said it cannot stop the state from awarding the       rest of the grants ``due to prior decisions,'' it would begin       monitoring how the money is distributed and warned it could       claw back the funds if necessary.        ``Texas has a history of sending money to those who are       politically connected,'' said Shannon Van And, a professor of       urban planning at Texas A.M. University whose research       focuses on hazard reduction and housing. She noted that       racial disparities occurred with the distribution of disaster       funds after Hurricane Ike in 2008.        Civil rights advocates say HUD has the authority to suspend       Texas's ability to spend federal grant money; it has done so       under previous administrations. But Sara Pratt, former deputy       assistant secretary in HUD's fair housing office who is now       representing Texas Housers as an attorney, said there is       longstanding division among HUD staff over enforcing civil       rights violations when making funding decisions.        ``There is deep disagreement internally,'' Pratt said.       ``The secretary's job is to resolve disputes like this.''        HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge declined to comment because       the Texas investigation remains open, HUD spokesman Michael       Burns said.        ``Her commitment to civil rights and fair housing is well       documented and unwavering, and she is committed to ensuring       that all HUD funds are used in compliance with all relevant       laws and program requirements,'' Burns said.        In response to widespread criticism over how the first $1       billion in Harvey disaster grants was distributed, Texas now       plans to allocate $750 million to Harris County. Houston is       due to receive an additional $9 million out of $488 million       that the state plans to send to the Houston-Galveston region.        City officials point out that the $9 million amounts to       less than one tenth of the cost of its proposed improvements       to Kashmere Gardens.        In Kashmere Gardens on a recent morning after a       thunderstorm inundated streetside drainage ditches,       bulldozers and dump trucks worked to widen and deepen Hunting       Bayou to absorb runoff from future storms.        The work is a small portion of a $2.5 billion flood       protection bond that Harris County passed in 2018. The bulk       of the bond money was directed to wealthier neighborhoods       because the county expected to receive federal disaster funds       for poorer ones, according to county commissioner Rodney       Ellis.        But without money to upgrade the ditch system to drain       storm water from neighborhood streets, it's unclear if the       bayou expansion will be effective.        ``This is the Texas two-step in Houston. You have to get       the water from the neighborhoods to the bayous. And then you       have to get the water from the bayous to the Gulf of       Mexico,'' said Ellis, who represents the area.        Residents, too, remain skeptical.        ``It's a wait and see situation,'' said Dorothy Wanza,       another Kashmere Gardens resident whose street turned into a       river during Harvey and flooded her home with more than a       foot of water. The experience left the 80-year-old so       traumatized that ``every time it rains, I get the hell out of       dodge.''        She spent the previous night fully dressed, prepared to       evacuate to one of her children's homes. ``The ditches       overflow, and once they are full, the water comes back on       you,'' Wanza said.        On the other side of the bayou, Hester said the city had       recently cleaned out part of a ditch lining his street for       the first time he could recall in more than a decade. Dirt       and bricks still block some of the culverts.        ``Right up under there, look,'' he said, pointing beneath       the concrete walkway leading from the street to his front       yard. ``It's stopped up on both sides.''        He nodded farther down the street to another culvert:       ``That whole drain hole was flooded.'' He and his next door       neighbor had removed as many bricks as they could to move the       water through. ``If we don't do things around here, ain't       nothing going to get done. I have to go around here and try       to help, and I'm in bad shape myself.''        Hester limped around the perimeter of his home and pointed       two feet up the siding where Harvey floodwaters had reached--      a reminder of the catastrophe he says he failed to protect       his daughter from.        A nonprofit had removed the mold inside when it fixed up       the house in 2020, installing new cabinets, a new roof and       laminate flooring.        But the entryway still slopes. The floor joists need to be       repaired. The porch is lopsided, its wood rotted.        Hester is stooped from years of pain. Yet he remains intent       on doing what he can to make things right.        ``It's not my life I'm worried about. It's my daughter's,''       Hester said. ``I'm half dead.''                                   ____                         [From Grist, April 14, 2022]   5 Years After Hurricane Harvey, Many in Houston Are Still Waiting for                                    Help         In Billy Guevara's neighborhood on the northeast side of       Houston, people get nervous when it rains. Old ditches strain       under the deluge of a Gulf storm, and mud and water fill the       streets. Guevara, a writer who is blind, once had a seeing-      eye dog that would navigate around the ankle-deep puddles and       lingering muck. ``It became unsafe because I ended up having       to walk almost in the middle of the street,'' he said. ``It       stays there for days.''        Guevara is a member of the Northeast Action Collective, a       community group pushing the city and Harris County for       equitable investments in flood control. He says drainage in       his neighborhood of Lakewood is outdated: ``It cannot handle       the type of rain that we see now.'' When Hurricane Harvey hit       in 2017, homes across many of northeast Houston's Black and       Hispanic neighborhoods flooded, swamped under 30 inches of       rain in what was the country's costliest disaster that year.       Under the rush of water, one of the walls in Guevara's home       began to bulge out.        Years after Harvey, little aid has made it to the people of       Houston. The federal government budgeted some $9.3 billion so       that communities could not only rebuild, but also better       prepare for the next storm. But city and regional governments       have delivered little of those funds, and a state agency's       ``competition'' has held back aid that the Department of       Housing and Urban Development designated for post-Harvey       mitigation, money which would have helped upgrade drainage       systems. As a result, low-income communities like Guevara's       have been left out of much-needed infrastructure       improvements.        Without their fair share of aid, communities struggling to       rebuild will be just as vulnerable when the next storm comes,       advocates say. These obstacles also expose weaknesses in       HUD's recently created mitigation program, which aims to help       reduce risks from future climate disasters.        Hurricane Harvey flooded nearly 100,000 homes in Houston,       inflicting $16 billion in residential damage. Guevara had       growing mold, damaged floors, and a leaking pipe. With a       small FEMA grant and the help of local nonprofits, he was       eventually able to repair his home.        But today, thousands in Houston still wait for funds to       rebuild. Disaster recovery aid through HUD often comes with       significant delays since the program is ad hoc, requiring       Congress to approve spending for each disaster. In 2018, HUD       allocated $5 billion to Texas through its Community       Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program, which is       designed to help with long-term rebuilding.        HUD had sent the money to the Texas General Land Office, or       GLO, the state agency run by George P. Bush, grandson of       former President George H. W. Bush, which is responsible for       public lands, mineral rights, and the Alamo historical site,       as well as disaster recovery. In turn, the state agency gave       Houston's share to the city, but didn't entirely relinquish       control, continuing to oversee how funds were doled out. The       city and state agency squabbled over how to run things, and       when HUD began an audit of the program, the fight escalated,       eventually making its way to the Texas Supreme Court. In       October 2020, the feud ended with the state seizing control       of the program.        All the while, many residents remained in dangerous living       conditions, stuck in homes with leaking roofs and mold-filled       walls, said Becky Selle, a codirector at the grassroots group       West Street Recovery. It's unclear whether those waiting will       ever get assistance. In January, when HUD published its       audit, only 297 of nearly 8,800 applicants had received       funds. (The state has until August 2025 to use the money.)        The struggle to access federal aid extended far beyond       homeowner's assistance. Harvey was among the first disasters       for which HUD's Community Development Block Grant Disaster       Recovery program made money available for mitigation projects       like widening bayous, upgrading water and sewer systems, or       buying out flood-prone homes. This marked a major shift:       While disaster recovery funds had to be tied to damage from a       specific disaster, the $4.3 billion mitigation fund could be       used to improve conditions, making communities safer.        Houston and Harris County accounted for more than half of       Texas' damage from Hurricane Harvey, but when the GLO       released its spending plan in December 2019, city officials       feared Houston wouldn't get its fair share.        Because there weren't enough funds for every proposed       project, the state's land office set up a competition in       which jurisdictions would apply for a slice of the $1 billion       in the initial round. HUD identified 20 mainly coastal       counties, including Harris County, that were most distressed       by Hurricane Harvey and would be eligible for funds. The land       office then expanded the list, adding counties that fell       under the umbrella of the original FEMA disaster declaration       in 2017. That more than doubled the list with more rural,       inland counties like Milam, 200 miles from the coast.        When results from the competition came out last May,       Houston didn't get a cent. The city's requests for $470       million worth of projects, like flood control in the       majority-Black neighborhoods Sunnyside and Kashmere Gardens,       were rejected. So was the $200 million watershed improvement       plan for the flood-prone Halls Bayou, which is surrounded by       some of Houston's poorest neighborhoods. ``For the State GLO       not to give one dime in the initial distribution to the city       and a very small portion to Harris County shows a callous       disregard to the people of  [[Page H4947]]       Houston and Harris County,'' Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner       said in a state1nent at the time.        Instead, funds largely went to smaller, whiter, inland       towns. They went to drainage upgrades in Rockdale, a two-hour       drive northwest of Houston, and sewage improvements in Nixon,       a small town outside San Antonio that emerged from Harvey       unscathed and sheltered evacuees fleeing the storm. ``The       more that we're giving this money to inland counties and       jurisdictions, we are actually taking away from where we       truly need the money and where the money was originally       intended to assist communities,'' said Julia Orduna, the       southeast Texas regional director at Texas Housers, a low-      income housing group.        After the snub, the city of Houston hoped for a second       chance when the Houston-Galveston Area Council, a regional       council spanning 13 counties, planned to deal out its own       pool of the funds. But in February, the council granted just       2 percent of its $488 million to the city, which represents       around 30 percent of the council's population.        According to the council, Houston and Harris County didn't       need much more than that because the GLO planned to grant the       county a direct payment of $750 million--a promise only made       after the first competition received intense criticism. But       that wasn't a fair consideration, according to Mayor Turner,       since that grant had yet to be approved.        Last June, the Northeast Action Collective and Texas       Housers filed a civil rights complaint with HUD, alleging       that the GLO discriminated against Black and Hispanic       residents. In a recent letter sharing the findings of its       investigation, the federal agency sided with the       organizations, saying the competition ``substantially and       predictably disadvantaged minority residents, with       particularly disparate outcomes for Black residents.''        A major issue, according to HUD, was that the state agency       split the competition in two. Half the funds were reserved       for counties that the federal government had identified as       hardest hit by Harvey--where Black and Hispanic residents       were most likely to live--while the other half went to more       rural, inland counties included on the state's expanded list,       which tended to be whiter.        At minimum, HUD required that half of the funds would go to       communities on its list of hardest-hit counties. While the       state agency met that requirement, dividing the competition       in two also meant awards to those counties would be capped at       50 percent. But those counties represented 90 percent of the       population in the entire competition, amounting to much less       money available for Black and Hispanic residents.        After the winners were announced in May 2021, GLO       spokeswoman Brittany Eck backed the results in a statement to       the Houston Chronicle. ``It is important that Texas inland       counties are resilient as they provide vital assistance to       our coastal communities during events such as asset staging,       evacuations, sheltering, and emergency response/recovery,''       she said.        The competition favored smaller communities. A flood       control project in Houston's mostly Black and Hispanic       neighborhood of Kashmere Gardens, HUD's letter explained,       would have helped 8,845 residents. But Houston's total       population is 2.3 million, so the project scored less than 1       out of 10 points because it would help only a small       percentage of residents. On the other hand, the city of Iola       applied for a wastewater project that all 379 of its       residents would gain from. It scored 10 out of 10, and the       project was funded.        In an email to Grist, Eck accused the federal agency of       ``blatant political theater.'' She said GLO has complied with       HUD's requirements, and now it's being faulted for not       ``going above and beyond'' to benefit even more minority       residents than it already has. Eck said the land office is       appealing HUD's findings.        ``GLO did not engage in discrimination, and HUD's       allegations amount to nothing more than unlawful attempts to       `second-guess' GLO's open and transparent competition       process, which was approved by HUD,'' Eck said.        When the state agency's spending plan was still a draft,       Madison Sloan, director of the disaster recovery and fair       housing project at Texas Appleseed, a public interest justice       center, sent a letter detailing concerns that its scoring       system would divert money from the hardest-hit areas. ``I       don't want to deny that communities all over the state need       mitigation,'' she said. ``But when you look at where the       damage was, where people are most vulnerable, it is the       coast. What this represents is a missed opportunity to do       some really largescale, meaningful mitigation on the coast       that's going to protect a lot of people.''        These problems aren't limited to Houston. Along the coast,       other cities hit hard by Hurricane Harvey, like Beaumont,       Corpus Christi, and Port Arthur, lost out in the competition.       In Port Arthur, where the poverty rate is twice the national       average, floods propelled by nearly 50 inches of rain       devastated the housing stock. Decades of underinvestment have       eroded residents' ability to recover from disasters, said       Michelle Smith, marketing director at the Community In-Power       and Development Association, Inc., an environmental justice       group in the city. Some decided to leave Port Arthur entirely       because ``they had nothing to come back to,'' she said. So it       stung when the city's proposal for a $97 million drainage       project was rejected.        Without these funds, communities that were poorly equipped       for Harvey are just as vulnerable to the next storm. ``This       is an ongoing thing,'' Smith said. ``With each hurricane, we       continue to suffer because we're not able to recover. The       little bit that we can salvage is then taken away again and       again and again.''        Sloan thinks the whole situation exposes fissures in HUD's       mitigation program. It's largely up to states to decide how       to divvy up funds, but studies are needed in advance to       ensure fair distribution, she said. That doesn't just benefit       the vulnerable; it could make the coast, as a whole, more       resilient.        ``Funding to areas where vulnerable people of color live is       going to benefit plenty of white people, plenty of higher-      income people who also live in those areas,'' she said. ``In       this case, in general, equity means everyone wins.''        After backlash followed the first competition, the state's       land office announced that it would give the remaining funds       to regional bodies like the Houston-Galveston Area Council to       distribute--the same entity that offered Houston a minuscule       amount of federal aid. ``The GLO's solution to not doing a       second competition was pushing the responsibility to local       jurisdictions,'' said Orduna, who felt the new plan does not       rectify HUD's allegations of discrimination.        There will be other storms to come, and Congress will       eventually allocate more money to rebuild from them. When       that happens, Billy Guevara, of the Northeast Action       Collective, worries all the talk and reports will have been       just that. ``That's our biggest fear,'' he said. ``Being       overlooked again.''     Madam Speaker, my amendment is extremely important.  Very quickly, it deals with accountability and performance improvement.  These are the objectives of my amendment.   My amendment also deals with making sure, through a GAO study, that  CSBG has performed well; which programmatic activities, services, and  other uses of funds were the most effective and had the greatest  positive impact; which administrative, organizational, structural, and  operational strategies and tactics that were deployed were most  successful; how much of the CSBG funds were allocated to States for  distribution to and use by community action agencies; and whether these  grants retained by each State exceeded the percentage of such funds  that were allowed to be retained.   In effect, the GAO would be conducting a performance audit of this  program to position it for a fresh start by determining the extent to  which these funds reached their intended beneficiaries. Many times,  minorities, though it was directed for them, are disadvantaged because  of the agency.   Finally, the net result will be transparency and improvement so that  others will be served and helped. I thank you for including it in the  amendments en bloc.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5129, the ``Community  Service Block Grant Modernization Act of 2022.'' I applaud Leadership  for bringing H.R. 5129--which has strong bipartisan support--to the  Floor for consideration and votes.   For decades, the Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) has fueled a  wide range of anti-poverty programs, activities, and services across  the country. It has been profoundly beneficial, improving countless  lives by helping Americans who are most in need of an assist, enabling  them to rise up and access the path to a better quality-of-life.   H.R. 5129 not only provides a long-overdue reauthorization of the  program; it also improves the CSBG in many ways, including by adding  systems that will enhance the program's transparency, accountability,  and evaluations in the future.   Accountability and performance improvement are also the objectives of  the Jackson Lee amendment, through additional mechanisms. My amendment  would direct the Comptroller General of the GAO to study how the CSBG  has performed over the past ten years, focusing on:   which programmatic activities, services, and other uses of funds were  the most effective and had the greatest positive impact on individuals  and communities that the CSBG was designed to serve;   which administrative, organizational, structural, and operational  strategies and tactics that were deployed by states were the most  productive, efficient, and successful, such that they should be  considered as ``best practices'' for replication by other states going  forward;   how much of CSBG funds that were allocated to states for distribution  to, and use by, Community Action Agencies and other eligible entities  were not fully disbursed by states to those intended recipients; and   whether CSBG funds retained by each state exceeded the percentage of  such funds that were allowed to be retained by the state for  [[Page H4948]]  administrative and other permissible purposes, the amount that was  retained in excess of what was allowed, and to what other uses those  funds were applied or to what other account were they transmitted.   In effect, the GAO would be conducting a ``performance audit'' of the  CSBG program to position it for a fresh start, citing its strengths and  shortcomings, and making recommendations that will help states optimize  their efforts in the years ahead.   By determining the extent to which CSBG funds reached their intended  beneficiaries and fulfilled their intended purpose, we will see which  states have been conscientiously administering the program, which could  help calibrate future strategies to structure and monitor the program.   The net result is that the GAO study and report provided by the  Jackson Lee amendment will provide transparency and accountability to  the program's recent past performance. The findings will enable the  program, and the states that administer it, to learn from the past,  adjust their programs to maximize results, and revitalize their efforts  for each state's next chapter of CSBG performance.   Thank you, Madam Speaker, for bringing this very important bipartisan  legislation to the Floor today.   I urge all my colleagues to support the bill, including the Jackson  Lee amendment and the entire en bloc amendment.
