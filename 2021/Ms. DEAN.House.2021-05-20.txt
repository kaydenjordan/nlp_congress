 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor my  constituent and friend, Denise Burstein. Denise passed away on May 13  due to complications related to ALS.   She was a loving wife, mother, grandmother, and community leader. She  was a woman of diverse passions and talent, an avid knitter, quilter,  radio operator, and I recently learned that she had a black belt in  karate.   She devoted her life to helping others, working as a school speech  and language therapist and continuing to help children even after her  retirement.   She was first to volunteer, whether it was as a local committeeperson  with the Boy Scouts, coaching, training therapy dogs, or, after her  diagnosis, helping spread awareness of ALS.   To know Denise is to know her husband, Frank. They are two parts of a  single smile, wonderful hosts whose brunches are the places to be for  friendship, politics, and delicious food.   I join Denise's family, friends, and wider community in mourning the  loss of an incredible woman. I am better for having known her.                            ____________________
