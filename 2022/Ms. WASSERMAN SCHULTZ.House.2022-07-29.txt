 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  assault weapons ban to reclaim our streets, churches, schools, and  synagogues.   Assault weapons are killing machines and the weapon of choice for  mass murderers. In my own county, in Parkland, a lone teenager  slaughtered 17 people by himself all because he had an assault weapon.  This deranged individual tragically, brutally killed and then  overturned the lives of those families and forever changed our entire  community.   But this is no isolated case. Similar mass murders haunt Las Vegas,  El Paso, Buffalo, Uvalde, Orlando, Pittsburgh, and too many other  communities for me to list here today.   No parent should fear seeing a child off to a mall, movie theater, or  school knowing that a killer wielding a weapon designed to kill as many  people as possible and as fast as possible may lie in wait for them.   We need a whole-of-government solution to this health epidemic,  including enforced ammunition background checks.   Let's take these killing machines off our streets and end this fear  that one person with one assault weapon in one moment can tragically  tear countless lives apart.   Republicans take note: the Supreme Court clearly allows limitations  on weapons in their decisions. Repeating a falsehood doesn't make it  true.
