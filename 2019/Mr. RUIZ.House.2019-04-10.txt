 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill to help  working Americans access quality, affordable healthcare.   Last month, I introduced the bipartisan Medicaid Services Investment  and Accountability Act, which has already unanimously passed the House  and Senate. With the President's signature, this bill will help parents  coordinate care for a sick child and protect seniors from going  bankrupt to pay for their loved one's in-home care.   My bill will also address skyrocketing prescription drug costs by  preventing pharmaceutical companies from cheating State Medicaid  programs.   As an emergency physician, I know that timely access to care is  critical to helping every family live a full, healthy, and productive  life. We must put patients first.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the President to sign this important bill into  law immediately.                            ____________________
