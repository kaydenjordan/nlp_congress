 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to echo the rising  chorus for a fifth coronavirus bill and to applaud three vital  provisions addressed to the special circumstances of the District of  Columbia in that bill.   Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats have taken needed initiative  in introducing the HEROES Act to get ahead of this virus, instead of  chasing it.   The first four bills have proven themselves. Jurisdictions following  the CDC guidelines, like the District of Columbia, are seeing deaths  decrease. Across the country, careful reopenings are occurring. To be  sure, scientists are warning of prolonging the virus unless there is  more social distancing and masking, because that is far from universal.   But my Republican friends have called for a pause. Of course, we have  seen unprecedented spending, but this is an unprecedented virus. The  virus has shut down the entire world.   I am pleased that Republicans may be declaring the end of their pause  barely a week after House passage of the HEROES Act. Yesterday, the  Senate majority leader said Congress will probably have to pass a fifth  bill. Thank you, Senator McConnell.   President Trump said--and I am quoting him--``I think the United  States will need another round of stimulus.''   They may be following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who  said more is needed for the economy shortly after the April report  showed a 14.7 percent unemployment rate.   Mr. McConnell only wants to fund increased losses due to COVID-19,  whatever that means. But tailoring the next bill based on whether  COVID-19 or something else caused the losses would require an inexact  calculus that itself could bog down the next bill, particularly what I  regard as the most essential part of the HEROES Act, $1 trillion for  State and local government.  [[Page H2287]]    This is the government, State and local government, that is closest  to the people. This is the government that funds first responders and  healthcare workers in local hospitals. This is the government that  funds the workers who pick up your garbage twice a week. This is the  government running on fumes.   So are the American people who need another cash payment, an  additional $1,200 per family member, up to $6,000 per household, and  other essentials like unemployment benefits and housing benefits, a 15  percent increase in nutrition programs. People have got to eat during  this crisis.                                time  1015    I also have been able to get included in the HEROES Act a trifecta of  provisions that the District must have, beginning with the $755 million  in retroactive funding Republicans in the Senate removed from the CARES  Act by treating the District for the first time in American history as  a territory, when we have always been treated for what we are, a State  for funding purposes, and, of course, the D.C. statehood bill has  enough cosponsors to pass this very year.   We have always received State-level funding because we pay the  highest Federal taxes per capita in the United States. The HEROES Act  also includes money for State, county, and city funding, the first time  the District has ever had to break down its funding. The District is a  unique jurisdiction in the United States because it operates at all  three levels.   The HEROES Act also authorizes the District to participate in the  municipal liquidity facilities funding of the Federal Reserve, if that  should become necessary. The $3 trillion HEROES Act sent to the Senate  last week is a marker. It will probably not be enough, as large as it  is, to contain this virus. But, at a minimum, it should get us started  on sensible negotiations.   Time, Mr. Speaker, is not on the side of the virus. Let's beat it  with the HEROES Act.                            ____________________
