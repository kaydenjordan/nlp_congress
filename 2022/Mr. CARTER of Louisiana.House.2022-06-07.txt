 Mr. Speaker, in Louisiana, we know the  awesome power of the water. We also know that it is the lifeblood of  our Nation's economy and environment.   The Army Corps of Engineers is the Federal department that most  supports water management, ecosystem restoration, and flood control,  critical issues in my region.   The Water Resources Development Act is the mechanism Congress uses  for these authorizations, and it is a critical policy for my district.  As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am  proud to have worked to include important updates for my district in  WRDA, such as instructing the Corps of Engineers to continue paused  ecosystem restoration on the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet; authorizing  $136 million for St. John, St. Bernard, St. James, St. Charles, and  Plaquemines Parishes for comprehensive treatment facilities and water  infrastructure.   And on a personal note, the final version included my amendment to  improve safety features along the banks of the Mississippi River, an  important move after the recent tragic drowning of three children in  Algiers in my district.   As we work to untangle supply chains and navigate climate change, we  can't delay critical water management projects. I urge the favorable  passage of the WRDA act, H.R. 7776.
