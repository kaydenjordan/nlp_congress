 Mr. Speaker, before I launch into the major subject  matter of this evening, I want to call attention to the horrific fires  that have occurred in California over the last month. It is extremely  early in the fire season. Normally, fires of the size that we have seen  in California during the month of August occur in late October/ November.   Climate change is real, and what we are seeing is a 365-day-a-year  fire season in California. In my own district of Lake County, the  largest fire ever in California's history is still burning, mostly  under control, but it will probably burn for another month until the  rains come.   Just to the north, in the Redding, California, area, more than 1,000  homes were lost and 4 people lost their lives. We saw last year the  huge fire that occurred in southern California, in the Santa Barbara- Ventura County area, followed by horrific mudslides that, again,  claimed the lives of dozens of people.   My heart goes out to all the victims of the fire, and my gratitude,  along with the gratitude of the communities of California, goes out to  the brave firefighters and first responders who met the challenge of  these very fast moving, very, very dangerous fires.   It should bring to the attention of all Americans the need for us to  address  [[Page H7814]]  the new issues that confront our Nation as a result of the ever-warming  climate and, also, the need for this Congress to carry on what is now  in place in law, and that is to allow the U.S. Forest Service to have  two accounts: one account for fighting fires and a separate account for  managing the forests.   The health of our forests is in doubt. As one of my colleagues often  says, we can take the trees out in an orderly way and remove some of  the vegetation, providing the necessary firebreaks and forest  thinnings, or it will come out in a fire.   Now, if I might, Mr. Speaker, go to the other subject matter that I  would like to spend a few minutes on.   I often start my Special Order hours with some words from a very  well-known American, a fellow who had four terms as President of the  United States. If you haven't figured it out already, it would be FDR.   In the past, as I have used this to set the tone and to set the value  of my conversation, or the values of my conversation, I didn't really  appreciate how pertinent these words would be here in September, the  day after Labor Day, of 2018.   So I want to draw your attention to what FDR said in the 1930s. He  said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the  abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for  those who have too little.''   I want to say that again, because this really should be our goal. It  should be the principle value of our legislative process here.   ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the  abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for  those who have too little.''   So, what to make of this. Yesterday was Labor Day, a tradition that  goes back to the 1880s, when there was a real crisis, when there was  child labor, where there were no workplace safety laws, where there was  the advent of what became known as the robber barons and the era of the  golden few.   Yesterday, Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, wrote an op- ed laying down some thoughts that all of us ought to pay attention to.  He said that working people are crying out for change that would bring  about a political system that lifts up our voices, an economy that  treats us fairly, and a society that values labor.   He also said a few other things. He said: ``For decades, corporate  interests have been hell-bent on chipping away at our most fundamental  rights and freedoms. They have corrupted our public institutions and  rigged the economy to work for the few at the expense of the many.''   Well, it seems as though he may have been channeling FDR, and it  wouldn't surprise me that he would.   In December, Congress passed and the President signed the largest tax  scam in America's history. Our friends on the Republican side sold the  tax bill to the American public as relief for middle-income families.  President Trump went further to say that working families could expect  a $4,000 to $7,000 raise due to the lowering of tax burdens on  companies.   I should repeat that: President Trump said that working families  could expect a $4,000 to $7,000 raise due to the lowering tax burden on  companies and corporations. Hmm.   Let's test those words. Let's test those words against what has  happened since December of 2017 when the largest tax scam in the  Nation's history actually passed. So, what have the workers of America  found? The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor has  shown that workers' real wages, accounting for inflation, have  decreased slightly since the signing of the tax bill.   This means that the average worker's salary buys less today than it  did before December 2017. By the way, that tax bill cost the Federal  Treasury, that is, reduced the tax receipts to the Federal Treasury, by  nearly $2 trillion over the next decade. Well, not the next decade. We  are now 9\1/4\ years ahead. Two trillion dollars.   All that sold on the premise that the wages for working Americans  would increase. No. Didn't happen. Not likely to happen. There were  some modest increases in wages, but they have been negated, wiped out,  by rising inflation.   Since the great recession of 2009 and '10, there really was real wage  growth, adjusted for inflation, every year until the current year. Now,  undoubtedly, there are some here in Congress--and perhaps  the President--who would point out that some corporations have actually  used their windfall for employee bonuses.    Let's just take a look at what that windfall is. Yes. Here it is.  Well, I'm afraid this number is wrong. We now know it is actually going  to be close to a $2 trillion reduction in taxes.   So where is it going? Well, let's see. Mr. Speaker, 83 percent of all  of that near $2 trillion winds up in the hands of the top 1 percent and  American corporations. Everyone else can share 17 percent of that  number, $2 trillion.   So, how many Americans saw a windfall as a result of the tax cut, as  promised by the President, the $4,000 to $7,000 bonus coming to you as  a result of the tax bill? Well, there are 155 million employees in  America, doing every conceivable kind of work, including some of the  folks here in the dais behind me.   Only 6.8 million of the 155 million actually received wage increases  or bonuses since the passage of the tax scam. Their 5.9 million  employers, a very generous 411 of the 5.9 million employers, provided  their employees with a bonus or a significant wage increase.   Publicly traded companies across America are spending 101 times more  money on stock buybacks, $712 billion in the first 8 months of 2018,  than employee raises or bonuses, which are $7.1 billion. Shall I say  that again? Probably ought to. Publicly traded companies have spent  $712 billion on stock buybacks and $7.1 billion on bonuses and raises.  Interesting.   The New York Times reported on this on July 13, and the headlines  read, ``Paychecks Lag as Profits Soar, and Prices Erode Wage Gains.  Corporate profits have rarely swept up a bigger share of the Nation's  wealth, and workers have rarely shared a smaller one.''   I suppose, if I wanted to play economist, I would put up something  like this: How is corporate America spending their tax cut, the Trump  tax cut? Well, here you have--oh, this was April. This blue line, that  was April.   In April, corporate stock buybacks were $238 billion, in April of  2018. We are now in September. That was April. Mr. Speaker, $238  billion in stock buybacks, $6.5 billion for bonuses and wage increases.  We are now in September, 4 months later, and stock buybacks are $712  billion, a number that I said just a moment ago; and wages and bonuses  have increased $7.1 billion. Half a trillion dollars. A half a trillion  dollars of the stock of the tax cut has been spent, increased, from  April to September.   No doubt in everybody's mind why the stock market is roaring ahead.  There has been $712 billion spent on buying back stocks since January  1, 2018. That is three-quarters of a trillion dollars. No wonder the  stock market is roaring ahead. Unfortunately, the wages of Americans  have actually, in real dollars, declined.                                time  2000    A few other things for those of you who like to play economist. You  have to love these graphs. The employee pay as a share of the national  income, in 1970, it was about, I don't know, 66\1/2\ percent of the  total wealth of the total national income that was for wages. Here we  are in 2018, and it has fallen to 62 percent.   Well, how about corporate profits as a share of national income?  Well, in 1970, it was down here around 9 percent of the total national  income that was corporate profits. Here we are in 2018, and it is 13  percent.   We would say that would be wonderful for corporations, if somehow  that corporate wealth would actually be shared with employees.   Now you can kind of understand why Mr. Trump was so agitated on Labor  Day yesterday when he was talking about income inequality.   There is one other way to see this, and let me put this up. This is  corporate tax rate, individual and corporate income taxes as a  percentage of all the Federal revenue. That is all the tax revenue the  Federal Government collects.   Well, let's see, way back in 1934, about 10 percent. Both corporate  and individuals paid about the same  [[Page H7815]]  amount, and that went on until 1939, 1940, and then it began to shift.  In that period of time, since the 1940s, early 1940s, until today,  corporate taxes, as a share of the burden of taxes paid in America, has  declined from 40 percent in 1939--that was the build up to World War  II--to, well, somewhere down around 7.8 percent today. Pretty good for  corporations. Pretty good for people who own stock.   Who does own stock? Eighty-four percent of U.S.-traded stock is owned  by the top 10 percent of Americans. Whoa, now that is an interesting  statistic.   So the stock market roars as more and more of the tax cut is poured  into stock buybacks, and the benefit goes to the top 10 percent of  Americans.   We ought to pay attention to that. Oh, by the way, individuals have  continued to pay more and more of the total burden of funding our  Federal Government. All of this is a result of tax policy over time.   So what are we going to do about this? Before I go to what we are  going to do about it, let me just pick up one more thing. Do you  remember all the talk about bringing American corporations back to  America, end the offshoring? Surely, you remember that. Well, I  remember the talk here on the floor. The great tax bill is going to end  the offshoring of American jobs. We are going to Make America Great  Again. We are going to bring American corporations back home.   Well, it didn't happen. Why didn't it happen? Well, because the way  the law was written, there is actually greater incentive today to  offshore jobs than there was prior to the great tax scam of December  2017. American corporations can actually have a lower tax rate by  offshoring, by investing offshore.   I am sure you remember the great ballyhoo about Harley-Davidson. They  were concerned about the President's tariffs and said that they were  going to manufacture their motorcycles in Europe as a result of the  tariff on steel and aluminum. Well, there is another known issue about  Harley-Davidson. They utilized the tax break given to American  corporations for offshoring jobs to open a facility in Thailand after  the tax bill was passed.   They laid off 800 workers in their Kansas City facility and opened a  new facility in Thailand. They not only did that, but what did they do  for the remaining workers in America? Well, if those workers happened  to own Harley-Davidson stock, I suppose they did okay, because Harley- Davidson decided to spend $700 million to buy back 15 million shares.   Interesting the way in which tax policy actually works, to the  benefit of whom? Hardworking American families? No. The top wealthy  Americans? Yes.   What did FDR have to say about all this? This isn't ancient history.  This is America today. This is America today, and we ought to pay  attention to what FDR has said when he said American progress is not  whether the wealthy do better, but, rather, whether the working men and  women of America, the poor, the people who are struggling to put food  on their table, the people who are trying to get their kids an  education, trying to deal with the ever-increasing cost of higher  education, FDR said it very clearly when he said it is our test, that  we are judged by what we do for those who have little.   So here we are today. Here we are just days ahead of a new election  in which this issue is going to address every American. This election  is going to be about whether the policies so starkly laid out here in  the tax legislation, the policies of adjusting the American wealth so  that those who have much get more versus those who are working day in  and day out are struggling just to stay ahead and failing to do so.   There is a stark difference here in policy. Let there be no doubt  that, for us, as we go into this election, we go into this election  keeping firmly in mind that our task is to provide A Better Deal for  the people, A Better Deal for the people of America.   The wealthy have done fine. The top 10 percent are doing terrific. We  are not against them, but we are for the people. We are for the working  men and women of America who are trying to put food on their table, pay  rent as housing prices soar, as rental rates go through the roof,  working men and women in the families of America who are struggling  every day just to keep up with inflation, and far too many not able to  do so.   Yes, there is no doubt that, in America today, the unemployment rate  has dropped. Yet, there are still millions of Americans who have not  been able to get into the labor market, who have not been able to  adjust to the changing economy of America, who are unable to have the  skills to fit into that new economy, who are on the outside.   But I will tell you this: We care about them. We think it is our  responsibility to care about every American, not just the wealthy, as  some do in this hall, but every working man and woman and for those not  able to work.   So we offer A Better Deal for the people, and I am just going to lay  out four specific issues in the next remaining minutes.   First of all, it is about healthcare. I came to this Congress in 2009  with the determination to work for a healthcare system that provided  quality insurance for every American. We made a major step toward that,  not because I arrived but because the American public was crying out  for a quality health insurance program.   Too many Americans were on the outside. Too many people were excluded  because they had a preexisting condition. Too many Americans couldn't  afford it, and more and more American companies were eliminating  healthcare insurance as part of the benefits.   So we, the Democrats, without one Republican vote, put forward the  Affordable Care Act. And guess what? More than 20 million Americans  within 3 years had insurance that wasn't previously available to them,  and it was a good insurance policy.   All the while, from January 2011 to this moment, our Republican  colleagues have been trying to reverse that progress. More than 60  different bills passed the House of Representatives in those years that  would eliminate the basic health insurance for 27 million Americans.   That was their policy. That is not ours.   Our policy is to provide universal health insurance for every  American. We have not given it up. We have seen erosion in the years  with the new President who rails against insurance for everybody. And  we see specific programs put forward by our Republican colleagues to  carve away protections for those Americans who have preexisting  conditions.   How cruel is that? How wrong is that, that this Nation would set up a  system that would remove the protection that has been in the law since  2010, the protection that insurance companies cannot discriminate in  the provision of insurance because of preexisting conditions?   What is a preexisting condition? For a young female, it is that she  might get pregnant. Yes, they consider that a preexisting condition,  being a female. You have high blood pressure? That is a preexisting  condition. You had measles or chickenpox in the past? That is a  preexisting condition. It goes on and on and on.   I know this issue. I was an insurance commissioner elected in  California to protect Californians from the abuses of insurance  companies, and I saw time after time after time insurance companies  discriminating, harming individuals, terminating their health insurance  because they forgot to write down that they had chickenpox as a child.   Now here we are in this era of Trump, this era where, once again, the  majority and the President would impose upon Americans, once again,  insurance discrimination. You have a preexisting condition? Good luck.  We are going to fight that.   As we have seen the wages of Americans stagnate under the pressure of  insurance and the pressure of the tax scam, as we have seen that, we  have also seen the inevitable increase in the cost of prescription  drugs. Who does that hurt? The super wealthy? The 10 percenters who  have done so well in the last year? Or does it hurt everyday working  Americans?   I will tell you this, it is our plan to put in place policies that  would give the Federal Government the opportunity to negotiate prices  for prescription drugs so that Medicare and Medicaid recipients don't  have to endure  [[Page H7816]]  the enormous out-of-pocket costs associated with that and to give other  Americans who are not yet of that age the opportunity to be able to get  their prescription drugs at a reasonable price just as the rest of the  world, or at least that part of the world that has advanced economies,  is able to get.                                time  2015    What about education?   I was back home in my district, as were all the rest of us over this  last month. How many times did I hear from parents whose children are  about to graduate from high school, saying they can't afford it, that  they can't afford to go to college. And if they do, they will be  saddled with such student debt that they will never be able to buy a  home. They will spend the first 10, 15 years of their postgraduate life  paying off the student loans.   This is not a small matter for Californians. This is not a small  matter for citizens of every other State. It is an epidemic in America,  the cost of higher education, the burden that is placed upon young men  and women who are struggling to get an education, having to go out and  get a student loan just to be able to continue, and then paying that  off in the years ahead.   It occurred to me somewhere along the way that, as I received the  inevitable mail about refinancing my home mortgage, maybe students  ought to be able to refinance their student loan. But, oh, no, not in  America. You can refinance your home mortgage, but you can't refinance  your student loan at a lower rate? That is wrong.   So I, and others, have introduced legislation that would at least  allow for a refinancing of student loans at a lower rate. But that is  not enough. That is just one piece of a solution to a problem that is  endemic and an epidemic in America.   We are going to spend $1 trillion in the next decade rebuilding every  one of our nuclear bombs and our basic mechanisms to deliver those  bombs. What if we spent like one-tenth of that on allowing American  children to get an education without being saddled with a student loan  for the first 10 to 15 years of their postgraduate life, to be able to  have a free community college education the first 2 years? Some States  are trying to do that, New York among them. Why not the Federal  Government?   But, oh, no. The Secretary of Education is going exactly the other  direction, trying to eliminate the protections that were put in place  by the Obama administration to protect students from loan scams, from  bogus education programs, such as the Trump real estate education  program. Did I mention that loudly enough? Such as the Trump real  estate program.   So his Secretary of Education wants to allow him, when he terminates  his career as President, to go back and rebuild the scam that harmed  thousands of Americans and, along with that, maybe many, many more.   American families need to be concerned about what is going on here.  For the people, are our policies for the people?   I was traveling across California in my district, 200 miles one side  to the other, the great Sacramento River Valley, more levees than  anywhere in America, including Louisiana. The roads are filled with  potholes. The levees are in need of repair. The airports are crowded.  We just heard a lot about that in the previous session.   The bridges are collapsing, not just in Italy, here in America. I  think we have some 60,000 bridges that are in need of serious repair. I  noticed one of them across the river here in Washington, D.C., under  repair, and that is good for Washington, D.C. But what about, I don't  know, Missouri? What about our infrastructure?   We have lead contamination in the communities of Michigan and other  contamination in the water of cities in California. We have shore lines  that are collapsing. We have water lines that are not working properly.   American infrastructure was built decades ago and has not been  repaired in the intervening years, and we have a $1 trillion backlog  just to keep pace.   Travel to Europe, travel to China, travel to other countries, Japan,  and others, and you will see modern infrastructure, but not in America,  not in America.   So what are we going to do about it? I will tell you what we want to  do about it on our side of the aisle. We want a real infrastructure  program, not a bogus one like ones proposed earlier this year by our  President, but a real, solid infrastructure program that has real  money, that has the real opportunity to be able to rebuild our existing  infrastructure to bring about what we have called for, for more than a  decade: good repair of all of it, whether it is a water system,  sanitation system, a levee, a highway, or an airport.   That is what we want to do, and we want to build the infrastructure  for tomorrow.   We know that international trade is going to increase. Well, maybe  not. Maybe I have to change that, given the trade war that is now  underway, brought to us by the President. So we will see how it turns  out.   But right now, maybe we are not going to see an increase in  international trade as tariffs are imposed. But maybe that will pass,  and we will get back to fair trade, real opportunity to grow our  economy by trading internationally. To do that, we are going to need  better ports. We are going to need better infrastructure to move goods  into and out of the ports. We need to have deeper ports. All of these  are infrastructure projects.   How are we going to do it? Well, I suggest that we are going to do it  with a real infrastructure program that has real money. If we were to  go back to one of those charts I had there that showed the share of  American corporations, their share of the total tax revenues is  declining, decade by decade, to the lowest level since the imposition  of a corporate tax rate.   We are going to try to retrieve some of the mistake that was made in  the tax bill of December 2017, retrieve some of those incentives that  were in the bill, replace those incentives with real legislation that  encourages American corporations to bring those profits back into  America.   I bring to your attention a bill that Mr. Lloyd Doggett of Texas has  put forth, a bill that would terminate the unfair, unjustified  provisions of the 2017 tax bill that encourages further investment by  American corporations overseas. Reverse that. Bring that money back  home.   If we were to pair that with another bill by Mr. Delaney, we would  see the opportunity for a rea infrastructure program, setting up an  infrastructure bond and banking program where we can use that money  coming back into America from the kind of tax reform that Mr. Doggett  has put forth and Mr. Delaney has put forth to build our  infrastructure, having American corporations that enjoy the benefits of  this Nation pay their fair share and not hide their profits overseas,  as so many have done and will do even more because of the tax program.    A final point about our program, which we call A Better Deal for the  People, America knows the level of corruption that is taking place here  in our Nation. They hear it; they see it on television. There has  never--well, ``never'' is a long time. In the memory of living  Americans, there has never been such a corrupt administration as we  have today: EPA Director; questions raised about the Commerce  Secretary; people resigning left, right, and center, just ahead of the  cops; and, of course, the President.   We need to pay attention to this. It erodes the foundation of our  democracy. Campaign financing, Citizens United, is allowing secret,  dark money to invade our election process.   We don't know the full extent of Russian involvement. We know  hacking. We know that they are out there using social media. We don't  know the full extent of foreign money coming into our election. We are  not ever likely to know, under the current laws, because there is  secret money allowed in our democratic process, eroding the very nature  of our democracy. Maybe some of it is foreign. There is evidence that  it is. Maybe--no, not maybe. We know about millions coming into the  campaign.   There is not a Member in this House of 435, less those who have left  for various issues of corruption, not one of us wakes up in the morning  without concern that secret money, millions, will be dumped into their  campaign in the 65 days, 62 days until the next election.   We don't know. We can't know. It is out there. It is wandering around  out  [[Page H7817]]  there, millions upon millions of dark money, secret money. It could  land on any of us. Given what I have been saying about the President,  it may land on me. Fine, we will deal with that.   This is a problem. It is a problem for America when that kind of  money buys elections, buys candidates, buys Members of Congress and  more.   Citizens United and all the rest needs to go. We need to know who is  financing me, financing my colleagues here. We need to be able to  report that so that the people can make up their minds what they want  to do.   I will give you one example, and then I think I have said enough for  the night. There was an election in California a few years ago that had  Pacific Gas and Electric, one of the major corporations, utilities-- well, the largest in the Nation, trying to carve a special favor for  itself, eliminating all competition. They got it on the ballot. They  collected signatures, got it on the ballot.   They were required, under California law, to disclose where the money  came from in support of their campaign and all of the ads, all the  television, all the written mailers and so forth paid for by PG&E.   The opposition to this, which was basic citizen groups, said that  this is wrong. There were editorials written. Maybe $20,000, $30,000  was spent opposing PG&E's effort. It went down 2-1 for one simple  reason: PG&E was required to disclose that they were paying for the  ads, and people go, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. So disclosure works.   Unfortunately, Citizens United and a couple of other decisions have  made it impossible for the American people to know who is financing  Members of Congress, Senate, President, so forth.                                time  2030    So, here we are. A better deal for the people, healthcare,  infrastructure, jobs, wages, corruption. You are going to hear a lot  about this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), who  is joining me this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so very much.   124 Labor Days for the working men and women of America. We should  keep that in mind, and certainly I know the gentlewoman will and I, and  I am sure my colleagues, at least on the Democratic side of the aisle,  will also.   Mr. Speaker, I want to end once again with FDR:   ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the  abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for  those who have too little.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
