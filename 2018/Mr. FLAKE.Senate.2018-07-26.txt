 Madam President, who wants to eat bugs for lunch? I am  hearing crickets, even among the pages here.   Now, there is a reason for that, but the National Institute of Food  and Agriculture at the USDA is spending more than $1.3 million to  support cricket farming in the development of bug-based foods for human  consumption. This sounds like a headline straight out of The Onion, but  it is not. It is your hard-earned taxpayer dollars being used to try to  develop a taste for crickets and other bugs.   This initiative is trying to determine which bugs taste best, which  bugs are most nutritious, and the best methods for farming bigger,  tastier crickets.   Now, while the USDA has no plans to inspect cricket farms and the FDA  has ``no special rules for edible insects'' at this time, multiple bug- based companies have received Federal funds to research and develop  techniques to put bugs in your food.   For example, Bugeater Labs--I am not joking here--Bugeater Labs of  Nebraska has received $100,000 of taxpayer money--this is a grant--to  identify the most edible insects. With support from the USDA, Bugeater  is testing bug-based pasta, ramen, and macaroni noodles.   Now, to get bugs into the food, the crickets are ground into a powder  and mixed into pasta dough. Bugeater hopes to secure another $600,000  in Federal funds to cover the cost of developing and manufacturing a  commercial-ready product made from bugs.  [[Page S5399]]    Now, separately, All Things Bugs of Georgia--I am not kidding. Again,  that is a real company--has received nearly $1.3 million for reducing  the cost and improving the efficiency of farming crickets as food  ingredients. They currently produce and sell cricket powder with ``mild  aroma, neutral flavor, and minute particle size that can be added to  recipes.'' Four pounds of crickets are required to produce 1 pound of  powder. A pound of cricket powder produced by All Things Bugs, which  boasts ``the most affordable wholesale price,'' sells for about $35 a  pound. By comparison, the average retail price for 100 percent ground  beef is about $3.80 a pound.   The United States has more than 2.5 billion pounds of beef, pork,  poultry, and turkey being stockpiled. This is a record level. Clearly,  a new source of protein is not needed and, in this case, likely not  wanted.   In fact, the CEO of one of these cricket cuisine companies said  yesterday:         Realistically, as much as we wish people would behave       differently, Americans won't buy significant amounts of       insect protein. If most were asked to volunteer to eat a bug,       the response would be--    As we heard here--         crickets.    With, I should note, the annual commemoration of Pioneer Day in Utah,  I think I can speak for many of my own ancestors, who nearly starved  thanks to swarms of crop-destroying crickets, when I say inspect-based  food development will not be stomached well by taxpayers.   Today I am proposing an amendment to end the Federal agriculture  subsidies for farming of insects and to prohibit spending taxpayer  dollars to develop bug-based food for human consumption. I can't  believe it takes an amendment to do this kind of thing. It is my  understanding it is being included in the manager's amendment and will  likely succeed if it is.   I would just say this is not going to balance the Federal budget, but  at a time when the Office of Management and Budget is projecting  trillion-dollar deficits in 2019 and beyond, how can we pay money and  have grants of over $1 million to pay companies to try to get people to  eat bugs? It doesn't pass the laugh test, and people simply have to  have more faith in their government than that.   I hope this amendment will pass. I hope we aren't forced to eat  crickets. That doesn't seem like anything anybody wants to do, and we  shouldn't be forcing taxpayers to pay for it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
