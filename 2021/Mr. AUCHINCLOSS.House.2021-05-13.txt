 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of investing in  our infrastructure with bold strokes and smart policy. We have a once- in-a-generation opportunity to provide mobility for all Americans. We  must harness it.   Making our economy more sustainable, productive, and fair means  upgrading the way people from all backgrounds and ZIP Codes access  jobs, goods, and services.   As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am  working with my colleagues to expand access to reliable and convenient  buses, provide grants for on-demand transit to fill transit deserts,  and build complete streets that ensure pedestrian safety, encourage the  use of bicycles and other micromobility with protected lanes, and  improve the handling of stormwater. Transportation is about bridges,  ports, and roads, yes, but it must foundationally be about connecting  people to jobs and services across all modalities. I look forward to  advancing these priorities in forthcoming legislation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Congress passed the American Rescue  Plan, a tremendous investment to support millions of workers without a  paycheck and behind on bills. As we begin work to build back a stronger  economy post-pandemic, we must ensure that consumers are protected from  bad faith debt collectors.   The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was enacted in 1977, almost 45  years ago. Since then, much has changed, including the way we  communicate, how we purchase goods, and the credit products we use.  Chairman Waters' bill, the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement  Act, provides much-needed updates to the FDCPA to fit the needs of  consumers today, not in 1977.   This legislation includes my bill, the Non-Judicial Foreclosure Debt  Collection Clarification Act, which closes the gap in the FDCPA so that  homeowners facing non-judicial foreclosure proceedings are protected  under the law. The FDCPA sets procedures for the way that debt  collectors interact with consumers to protect their rights and their  privacy. This includes ensuring that debtors aren't paying more than  they owe, that their debt information won't be shared with their boss,  and that they will not be harassed by collectors. These protections  should not be limited to foreclosure proceedings that take place in a  courtroom.    The legislation we are considering today includes other necessary  consumer protection bills, like Congresswoman Dean's Fair Debt  Collection Practices for Servicemembers Act, which would prohibit debt  collectors from threatening a servicemember's rank to collect a debt,  and Congresswoman's Pressley's bill, the Ending Debt Collection  Harassment Act, which would prohibit debt collectors from contacting  consumers electronically without consent.   We cannot rebuild an economy that works for everyone without  protecting consumers. Making sure borrowers are treated with dignity  and protected from unwanted and unnecessary practices is an important  step to ensuring economic fairness moving forward. I am proud to  support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I reject the amendment from the ranking  member, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I reject it because it  undermines the premise of the chairwoman's bill. The premise of the  chairwoman's bill is not prudential underwriting as a core premise of  our economy which, of course, we need. It is not about payments for  goods and services  [[Page H2292]]  which is obviously a pillar of the United States system of business.   It is about fairness. It is about fairness in the allocation of  credit and fairness in the collection of debt.   What the chairwoman has put forward and what the amendment from the  ranking member would undermine is a bill that recognizes that people  should not be punished for circumstances outside of their control. They  should not be precluded from accessing credit for something that  happened to them that they did not wish upon themselves, and that they  had no volition in doing.   For example, this bill would ensure that medical debts do not  prohibit people's access to credit. The senior Senator from my home  State of Massachusetts famously demonstrated that medical bankruptcies  were plaguing the middle class and the working class in this country.  Indeed, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has reported that  medical debt has a significant impact on consumer credit. After  Americans undergo lifesaving treatment, they should not have to worry  about the impact of a necessary medical procedure that they will have  to stay at home to convalesce will have on their ability to then  restart their life, start a business, or care for their family.   H.R. 2547 seeks to give consumers time to fully recover until they  are able to pay their bills. Nobody chooses to get sick, Mr. Speaker,  and being sick should not show up on your credit report as you seek to  access credit in the future.   This bill is also about fairness in how we collect debts. There, of  course, should be payments for goods and services, but there does not  need to be and there should not be harassment.   As a former marine officer, it deeply concerns me that servicemembers  who need to concentrate on the mission at hand might be distracted,  and, indeed, might even be demoted for debts outside of their control.
