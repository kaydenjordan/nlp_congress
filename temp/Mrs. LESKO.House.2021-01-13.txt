 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution. At  a time when our country needs unity, it is concerning that my  Democratic colleagues have chosen to begin impeachment proceedings  against a President with just 7 days left in office. All legal  challenges have been exhausted. Congress has certified electors over  objectors, and Joe Biden will be the next President of the United  States.   President Trump has indicated he will peacefully transfer power to  President-elect Biden next week.   So why pursue impeachment just 1 week before he leaves office?   I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they  have to impeach the President because he is too dangerous to stay in  power, yet they know that it is impossible for the Senate to remove him  before his term expires.   So what is the point?   Madam Speaker, this move sets a dangerous precedent for our Nation.  If Congress is going to impeach a President, it must only be done after  intense debate and deliberation, not rushed through in the 11th hour to  make a political point. This impeachment attempt is dangerous for our  country and has far-reaching implications for our future.
