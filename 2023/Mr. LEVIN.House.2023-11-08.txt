 Mr. Speaker, this week, President Biden announced more  than $16 billion in Federal funding for the Northeast Corridor, the  busiest in the United States, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure  Law.   While that is a very admirable and needed effort, I would like to  call attention to the LOSSAN Corridor, the second busiest rail  corridor, which runs right through my district. It is the only rail  link between San Diego and Los Angeles.   The integrity of the LOSSAN Corridor is arguably at greater risk than  any other corridor in the country. It runs along the Pacific Ocean and  has repeatedly closed due to climate change-induced sea level rise,  collapsing bluffs, and eroding beaches. That has cost our economy  millions of dollars per year and impacts my constituents' ability to  get where they need to go.   The LOSSAN Corridor is the busiest State-supported route for Amtrak,  which is currently facing 64 percent funding cuts in the Republican T- HUD appropriations bill.   This is the wrong approach. We must invest in Amtrak and associated  infrastructure. I will continue to advocate for the Biden  administration to invest in the LOSSAN Corridor so California can get  its fair share of resources.   Mr. Chairman, I thank my partners in California, and especially  Governor Newsom, for continuing to fight for this historic investment.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding  time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to address our country's urgent need for a  Supreme Court code of ethics. Over the past year, we have seen  troubling reports of Justices receiving lavish gifts from political  donors with connections to cases before the Supreme Court and who stand  to benefit from rulings.   This is unacceptable and unethical, and it has undermined public  trust in the institution. It is time for the Supreme Court to adopt and  abide by a judicial code of ethics.   Currently, all Federal judges must abide by a code of ethics except  for Supreme Court Justices. That must change.   I introduced an amendment to the Financial Services and General  Government appropriations bill that would withhold $10 million in  funding from the Supreme Court until the Justices adopt a code of  ethics.   This amendment, which I introduced with Congressman Hank Johnson,  would have restored public confidence in this institution.   It would have helped to solve one of the many problems our voters  sent us to Washington, D.C., to fix--the corrupt power of money and  politics in our judicial system.  [[Page H5557]]    Sadly, Republicans on the Rules Committee would not even consider my  amendment in order. We must do better.
