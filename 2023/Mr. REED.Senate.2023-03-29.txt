 Madam President, I understand that there is a vote  scheduled at 5:45, and in order to clarify the voting procedure this  evening, I would initially ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my remarks and the following Senators be permitted to speak  for five minutes each prior to the scheduled vote.   I also presume that Senator Tuberville will speak while he reserves  his right to object; is that correct? So you do not need time?   In that case, I ask unanimous consent for Senator Lee, Senator  Hirono, Senator Bennet, and Senator Marshall to be granted 5 minutes  each prior to the scheduled vote.    Madam President, I rise to discuss the promotions and  appointments of general and flag officers in the United States  military, including several appointments to lieutenant general and vice  admiral.   These are officers who would hold positions of particular importance  and responsibility to the Nation. The promotions of these military  leaders were reported out of the Armed Services Committee over the past  2 months.   There have been no substantive objections raised against these  nominations. For the benefit of my colleagues who may not appreciate  the nature and volume of military promotions and nominations considered  by the Armed Services Committee, last year, the Committee considered  and the Senate confirmed nearly 20,000 military officers, including 656  general and flag officers.   The Senate confirmed 20,000 nominations through bipartisan unanimous  consent because the tradition of the Committee and of the Senate is to  consider military nominations as apolitical and thus process them in a  timely and respectful manner so our troops do not experience delays in  their promotion or appointment or in their pay and benefits.   Moreover, the sheer volume of nominations we consider means we cannot  subject them to the ordinary political gamesmanship we see with  civilian nominations.   The senior Senator from Alabama has made these promotions a political  matter. He and he alone placed a blanket hold on these officers,  unrelated to their qualifications, because of a policy disagreement  with the administration that these officers played no part in deciding.   This, in my view, is a profound assault on the professionalism of the  men and women of the armed services.   The vast majority of these officers were selected by promotion  boards, which are panels of military officers who decide promotions  purely on merit, considering the skill, talent, and the military's  collective assessment of their potential to lead in the grades for  which they have been nominated.   Blanket political holds on military officers, in an attempt to  overturn a civilian policy decision, sets a dangerous trend for our  military, our political process, our Nation, and this Senate.   The senior Senator from Alabama placed his hold on February 16th, and  as a result, not a single general or flag officer nominated in this  Congress has been confirmed.   Let me repeat that.   Due to the senior Senator from Alabama's hold, not a single general  or flag officer has been promoted.   As the Senator's hold moves into its third month, we will quickly  reach a critical mass of backlogged nominations, if we are not already  there, that will imperil our national security, degrade unit readiness,  and place undue, and undeserved, hardships on military families.   It may not be his intent, but he is effectively accomplishing what  our adversaries could only dream of: denying our military of its  leadership and degrading our ability to fight and win the Nation's  wars.   The bottom line is that military promotions are not a political  matter and they are not toys for political gains, and military officers  are not tokens in such a game. They are not hostages to issues that are  determined by civilian authorities.   An administration's civilian nominees may be fair game, and they have  been repeatedly, but not professional military officers. That has long  been the Committee's and the Senate's tradition and practice.   And I want to turn to some specific claims made by the Senator from  Alabama. He has asserted a number of times that the Department changed  the law or that DOD somehow lacked authority. That simply isn't true.   To be clear, under its new policy--and this is with respect to  reproductive rights for female soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and  guardians--the Department of Defense will provide administrative leave  and paid travel if a member of the military or their dependent is  stationed in a State or country that does not provide the healthcare  needed.   The Department has broad statutory authority to provide travel  benefits to servicemembers and their dependents, and it does so  routinely, including for the provision of healthcare services. I am not  aware of any assertion from anyone knowledgeable of the law and of the  Department's actions that the Department does not have the authority to  do this. Indeed, to the best of my knowledge, no serious lawyer has  made this argument, and there has not been a single lawsuit filed on  this matter.   These policies are, again, travel and administrative leave policies.  They do not violate the Federal prohibition on DOD paying for  noncovered reproductive health services. Such reproductive health  services will still be paid for by members and dependents out of their  own pockets. These policies merely facilitate the provision of health  services for servicemembers and dependents who may be stationed in an  area that does not provide the needed healthcare, including overseas  locations.   Further, the senior Senator from Alabama has publicly stated:   ``If Democrats are so worried about the nominations, then they can  bring them up for a vote. We have more than enough time to vote on  nominees.''   Setting aside the deeply troubling implication that certain Members  of the Republican Party do not care enough about our national defense  to ensure that senior military leaders are in place in a timely manner,  it would take several months of constant attention on this floor just  to move through the current batch of general and flag officers that are  presently on the Senate calendar. And this is not even accounting for  all the nominations still to come.   If we took this path, this Senate would be consumed entirely by  nominating and confirming military officers ad infinitum, unable to do  anything else.   And there are currently 184 general and flag officers, including 11  to be promoted to lieutenant general or vice admiral, subject to this  political hold.   And let me highlight just three to show you the impact and the  consequences of these holds.   One nominee is nominated to be Commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet. It  is the largest of the Navy's deployed fleets and has responsibility for  the Indo-PACOM area of operations.   And I hear constantly in the Committee and elsewhere on the floor:  The Chinese threat--we have got to do more. We just listened to a long  diatribe about TikTok and how dangerous it is.   I think what might be more dangerous is not having a confirmed leader  for this fleet in the Pacific able to move out immediately to any type  of threat coming from the Chinese.   In addition, the Commander of the Navy's 5th Fleet is responsible for  the naval and combined maritime forces in the Indian Ocean, Persian  Gulf, Arabian Sea, and it is under the overall command of U.S. Central  Command. And we hear every day--we heard it just recently--about how  the Iranians are taking advantage of us. They say we are not responding  strongly enough.  [[Page S1038]]    Well, how effective will our response be if we are not quite sure who  the Commander of this fleet is? We have got a nominee, but the officer  is not confirmed. We have an officer who may have to leave for another  assignment. This causes readiness problems, morale problems, and  undermines the military that we all seem around here to suggest is our  primary concern.   Another one: the U.S. Military Representative to NATO, who is the  senior uniformed representative to NATO during a time when NATO is  critical to our support of Ukraine, therefore, against Russia.   And, again, my colleagues would stand up and say: We have got to do  more for Ukraine. We have to make sure they get the support they need,  through coordination with NATO. We have to do all these things, but we  really don't need anyone in Brussels to help with military advice and  assistance. We will just ignore that.   These are just three examples, and I would like to look ahead because  this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.   Within the next 8 months, we expect the Department to nominate  approximately 650 general and flag officers, including 80 three- or  four-star nominees, all of whom will come through the Armed Services  Committee and require Senate confirmation.   These include the nomination of the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff. By law, General Milley will retire in September. If this hold  persists, then we will be without a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff.    We also expect nominations for the service chiefs of the Army, the  Navy, and the Marine Corps. The Chief of Staff for the Army, the CNO of  the Navy, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps are scheduled to  retire.   If this hold persists, we will not have leadership in the Army, the  Navy, and the Marine Corps, and that would be devastating to readiness,  to morale, to the whole history of our government in which we move  nominees based on merit, not as political hostages.   We are also talking about major combat commands--Cyber Command. Does  anyone have to talk about the relevance of Cyber Command? Again, we  just listened to a long, long discussion about cyber security and the  stealing of information and governmental interference with that. Cyber  Command is the key actor from the Department of Defense standpoint in  all of those efforts. And, frankly, without a Commander of Cyber  Command, I think the TikTok issue sort of diminishes in importance.   We also have SPACECOM and NORTHCOM. They are responsible for the  defense of the United States so that we do not find ourselves here at  home devastated by any type of attack, which, today, includes cyber,  missile, hypersonics--all those possibilities.   There are also three Deputy Commanders who are coming on--CYBERCOM,  CENTCOM, and AFRICOM.   So what you can see is, if this policy continues or this practice  continues, we are wiping out the leadership of the Department of  Defense and doing an extraordinary disservice to the men and women who  wear the uniform of the United States.   We have always treated military nominations appropriately, as beyond  the political fray, and we must continue to do so for the good of the  service and all those who take the oath, and their families, too,  because no military member serves alone. The families serve with him or  her.   Now, I believe in a very strong military based on constitutional and  professional values. We must not inject political theater into this  process.   If we do not have a coherent, organized leadership at the Department  of Defense, then we are putting our troops at risk. That is quite  simple, and, to me, it is unacceptable.   With that, I would ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider the following nominations en bloc:  Calendar Nos. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88,  89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104,  105, 106, and 107; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc; the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; and that no further motions be in  order to any of the nominations; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative  session.    Mr. President, first of all, the notion that we can simply  start confirming these officers is patently absurd. There are 184  nominations that are on hold now. We anticipate another 650 general and  flag officer nominations throughout the remainder of this year.   Because we get very little cooperation--in fact, none at all--from  the Republicans, we average about three nominations a week--Senator  Durbin knows this well--because we have to wait, during quorum calls,  to exhaust the hours necessary before we can take the final vote. So we  would be working many months, just on this batch of 184, to confirm  these officers. And then when we add 650 additional nominations--and  they will keep coming and coming--that is absolutely preposterous. It  is impossible. So that is not an answer to the problem.   He mentioned Senator Duckworth. Senator Duckworth held nominations  for 3 weeks. She was not trying to change the policy of the Federal  Government under the Trump administration. She wanted factual  information whether President Trump had had politicized the military by  interfering with Colonel Vindman's promotion. That is the exact  opposite of what the Senator from Alabama is doing. He is holding  everybody's nomination as a political action, just like President Trump  was trying to do with Colonel Vindman, as reciprocation and as  retaliation.   We had a hearing on recruitment at the request of the minority. What  are the issues there? The issues are that we have a 3-percent  unemployment rate. One of the most significant issues facing the  military services is the low percentage of individuals who are eligible  and interested in military service.   The issue of whether or not this policy affects recruiting, I think,  was refuted by the Senator when he has indicated that he expects 4,000  people to take advantage of this policy. Well, that is not a trivial  number. And I would suspect women considering the  [[Page S1040]]  military would think hard, regardless of their moral position. They  would not like to be in a place where they cannot get access to  reproductive care. Twenty percent of the military are women. It is  going to have an effect on women. Just look at the polling across the  United States about Roe v. Wade versus the Dobbs decision, and I think  you will find that there is a significant number of women who are  concerned.   So this is very simple. We are either going to politicize and  completely ignore military nominations, using military officers as  hostages for political decisions, or we can return to tradition and  confirm expeditiously. And one final point, this issue will be  considered in the usual order because during the Armed Services  Committee markup, I presume there will be amendments on both sides that  will be considered fairly, and this issue will be addressed, as it  should be, in the context of the National Defense Authorization Act.   What the Senator of Alabama is doing is damaging the military of the  United States, perhaps catastrophically, if he continues this policy  for many more weeks. That is not appropriate.   With that I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I am introducing the Protection from  Abusive Passengers Act, a bill that is aimed at eliminating the rash of  violence and abuse that is occurring on commercial flights across the  country. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Representatives  Eric Swalwell of California and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who  are introducing companion legislation in the other body. The goal of  our bill is to send a clear signal that individuals who engage in  serious abusive or violent behavior on an aircraft or at an airport  security checkpoint will be banned from flying.   In the last few years, we have seen an extraordinary increase in the  number of cases of violence and abuse against crewmembers and airline  passengers. In 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration received 2,456  reports of ``unruly passengers.'' Those complaints led to 831  investigations, a record 567 enforcement actions initiated, and a  historic $8.45 million in proposed fines. That makes 2022 one of the  most violent years in air travel since the FAA started tracking  incidents in the mid-1990s, second only to 2021. While the numbers are  trending down, we are still seeing some extraordinary dangerous and  violent behavior.   In April 2022, the FAA proposed a record $81,950 fine against a  passenger who tried to open the cockpit door on an American Airlines  flight from Dallas to Charlotte, struck and threatened multiple flight  attendants, and continued to attempt to assault the crew and other  passengers once restrained.   The FAA also proposed a $77,272 fine against a passenger on a Delta  flight from Las Vegas who ``attempted to hug and kiss the passenger  seated next to her; walked to the front of the aircraft to try to exit  during flight; refused to return to her seat; and bit another passenger  multiple times.''   Just this month, the Department of Justice reported the arrest of a  passenger for allegedly attempting to open an emergency exit door while  aboard a United Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Boston. During the  incident, the passenger attempted to stab a flight attendant with a  broken metal spoon, hitting the flight attendant on the neck area three  times. Video of this disturbing assault went viral and was widely  reported on.   In any setting, these actions would be shocking and unacceptable but  on an airplane, such behavior also represents a danger to all  passengers. Clearly, the existing regime of civil and criminal  penalties have not been enough to deter this upsurge. We need to send a  signal that such type of behavior will not be tolerated.   The Protection from Abusive Passengers Act would require the  Transportation Security Administration to create and manage a program  which bars passengers who are fined or convicted of abusive behavior  and physical violence from flying. Transparency and notice will be  provided to banned individuals, including guidelines for removal and  opportunities for appeal. The bill would also permanently ban abusive  passengers from participating in the TSA PreCheck or Customs' Global  Entry Programs.   The bill provides appropriate fairness and due process by ensuring  that only individuals who have been assessed civil or criminal penalty  for abusive and violent behavior will be included on a list of banned  fliers. The bill also requires the TSA to explain how it will maintain  its list of banned fliers, provide an explanation of how long an  individual may be barred from flying based on the severity of the  offense, and set guidelines for an individual to appeal and seek  removal from the list of banned fliers.   I believe this bill strikes the appropriate balance of assuring  fairness and transparency while sending a strong signal that violent  and abusive behavior will not be tolerated. I am pleased that the bill  is supported by both airline industry leaders and labor unions,  including Air Line Pilots Association; Association of Flight  Attendants, CWA; Association of Professional Flight Attendants;  Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO; Transportation Trades  Department, AFL-CIO; Communications Workers of America, CWA; American  Airlines; Delta Airlines; and Southwest Airlines. I hope that my  colleagues will join me in supporting this important bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN:   S. 1061.
