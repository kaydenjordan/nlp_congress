 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent,  Dixon Police Officer Mark Dallas, for his heroic actions during the  shooting incident at Dixon High School last week.   On the morning of Wednesday, May 16, a student opened fire inside  Dixon High School. Without hesitation, Officer Dallas chased down the  student and returned fire. He disarmed the shooter and took him into  custody.   The swift, decisive actions by Officer Dallas demonstrate the  difference between a job and one's calling. His fearless sacrifices are  core to who Mark is and who God called him to be.   As more details emerge surrounding the shooting incident, one thing  is certain: Officer Dallas is an American hero. He stepped into harm's  way to prevent a terrible tragedy and saved countless lives. He  heroically protected the students, including his own son Josh, the  faculty and staff, and the entire Dixon community.   Mr. Speaker, it is the men and women of our law enforcement, like  Officer Dallas, who embody the very best of who we are as a nation. The  courageous service of America's finest is truly the thin blue line  between order and chaos.   On behalf of the 16th District of Illinois, I thank Officer Mark  Dallas for his bravery and heroism, for his steadfast commitment to  protection and serving, for being a role model to so many, and for  making us all Dixon strong.                            ____________________
