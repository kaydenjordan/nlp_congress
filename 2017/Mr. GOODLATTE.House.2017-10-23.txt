 Mr. Speaker, although the power of Congress to  investigate is not set forth in any particular clause in the  Constitution, congressional investigations trace their roots back to  the earliest days of our Republic. In fact, what is thought to be the  first congressional investigation occurred in 1792, when the House  appointed a select committee to investigate the massacre of American  troops under the command of Major General Arthur St. Clair. The  resolution authorizing that investigation stated that the committee  shall ``be empowered to call for such persons, papers, and records, as  may be necessary to assist their inquiries.''   Upon learning of the investigation, President Washington assembled  his cabinet to seek their counsel. His cabinet, which included Thomas  Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, unanimously concluded that the House  had every right to conduct its inquiry and request papers from the  President. President Washington directed that the relevant papers be  provided to the House and the War and Treasury Departments provided  voluminous records to the committee.   Unfortunately, not all congressional investigations are met with the  cooperation the first investigation received. Rather, sometimes  Congress and its committees must rely on another inherent power derived  from the Constitution to investigate effectively--the congressional  subpoena power.   As the Supreme Court has observed, although ``there is no  [constitutional] provision expressly investing either house with the  power to make investigations and exact testimony . . . the power of  inquiry--with process to enforce it--is an essential and appropriate  auxiliary to the legislative function. . . . Experience has taught that  mere requests for information often are unavailing . . . so some means  of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed.''   That means of compulsion is often a subpoena issued by a  congressional committee backstopped by a civil action filed in federal  district court. In recent years, the House and its committees have  pursued two such civil actions, including one filed by this Committee,  to enforce compliance with congressional subpoenas.   The legislation we are considering today, the Congressional Subpoena  Compliance and Enforcement Act, codifies and strengthens the existing  civil enforcement mechanisms thereby reinforcing the powers granted  Congress in Article I of the Constitution. This legislation creates a  statutory framework for compliance with and enforcement of  congressional subpoenas through a few targeted changes to federal law.   First, the bill puts in place a statutory requirement that recipients  comply with congressional subpoenas. Second, the bill statutorily  requires subpoena recipients to provide a congressional committee with  a privilege log if they assert a legal privilege as a reason for  withholding subpoenaed materials. Finally, the bill provides that  congressional subpoena enforcement cases are to receive expedited  review in the federal courts and that a congressional committee may  request that a subpoena enforcement case be heard by a three-judge  panel of the district court, with direct appeal to the Supreme Court.   While it is true that some of what is addressed by the bill is  currently covered through negotiation with subpoena recipients and is  recognized in the precedents of courts in the D.C. Circuit, the current  statutory requirements related to compliance with and enforcement of a  committee subpoena are limited. Indeed, the existing civil subpoena  enforcement statute only covers the Senate and does not apply to Senate  subpoenas issued to the Executive Branch. It is time that we put in  place a statutorily created, expedited civil enforcement mechanism for  congressional subpoenas. Relying on the existing framework to enforce  congressional subpoenas has proved to be an inadequate means of  protecting congressional prerogatives.   I thank Mr. Issa for introducing this legislation and urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. This bill is a  necessary step to strengthen Congress's ability to exercise its Article  I legislative powers.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 4010, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
