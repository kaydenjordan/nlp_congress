 Madam President, I have serious philosophical disagreements  with many of the judicial nominees put forth by this administration,  but I believe Mr. Menashi is especially unfit to serve on the Federal  bench. His record indicates an inability to serve as a fair and  impartial judge. And so I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to reject his nomination to a lifetime appointment on the bench.   Steven Menashi's public record demonstrates a deep contempt for a  wide spectrum of Americans, and particularly some of the most  vulnerable amongst us. In his own writings and as editor in chief of  the Dartmouth Review, he has directly expressed or condoned disturbing  views on issues such as LGBT rights, racism, and student aid.   Even if we were to cast these sentiments aside, Mr. Menashi's recent  work in the Trump administration provides ample evidence that he is  unfit for a lifetime appointment to the bench. Consider his performance  as acting general counsel at the Department of Education. Mr. Menashi  oversaw the rollback of regulations designed to protect students and  taxpayers from predatory for-profit institutions of higher education.   More egregiously, Mr. Menashi wrote the memo outlining the  administration's scheme to provide only partial debt relief to students  defrauded by for-profit colleges--a scheme that a Federal judge ruled  violated Federal privacy laws. Under this scheme, the Department of  Education used data that was collected to hold institutions accountable  for providing education leading to gainful employment to further punish  their victims. The Department has still failed to comply with the  court's orders, resulting in the Secretary of Education being held in  contempt.   Mr. Menashi supervised the legal work on the administration's  proposal to rewrite the rules dealing with sexual assault and sexual  harassment on college campuses. The administration's own analysis  concluded that the new rules would dramatically reduce the number of  sexual assault investigations.   Mr. Menashi worked on the rule rolling back efforts to address  disparities in the discipline of students of color and those with  disabilities. In March, a Federal court ruled that the Department had  engaged in an illegal delay and had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.   During Mr. Menashi's time at the Department of Education, the  administration argued that it was appropriate to use Federal education  funds to purchase guns for schools.   Also consider Mr. Menashi's time as a White House counsel where he  helped Stephen Miller in crafting some of the administration's most  draconian immigration policies. While he was an advisor, the White  House cut refugee admissions to a historic low, effectively banned  asylum for refugees traveling through Mexico, and threatened to end  birthright citizenship.   His views and work experience call into question how his personal  biases would color his rulings, and whether he has the judicial  temperament and political independence necessary to serve on the  Federal bench. This is not the kind of legal judgment that deserves a  lifetime appointment to the Federal judiciary.                          Senate Legislative Agenda    While the Senate has spent considerable time and hours on Mr.  Menashi's nomination, one can't help but notice the fact that the  majority leader seems to scrupulously avoid calling up votes on  legislation that would help working Americans and working families.   I hear from my Rhode Island constituents every day about countless  pressing issues that the Senate should be debating and voting on. We  could be considering an infrastructure bill that would provide robust  investment to enable the rebuilding of our crumbling roads, bridges,  schools, and other critical infrastructure. We could be working to  increase Pell grants and lower the cost of college.   I think every Member of this body would agree that another vital  issue that we hear often from our constituents about is the need to  address skyrocketing prescription drug costs. According to Families  USA, nearly 3 in 10 American adults--nearly 80 million people--have not  taken required medicine due to its costs. In fact, addressing  prescription drug costs alone would go a long way toward bringing down  healthcare costs overall.   There are dozens of proposals from Senators on both sides of the  aisle that would help to address this issue. Yet Republican leadership  has refused to allow any debate on prescription drug prices or on  healthcare costs more broadly this year. Something I, and many of my  colleagues, have proposed numerous times would be to require Medicare  to negotiate drug prices with  [[Page S6591]]  the drug companies to ensure seniors and taxpayers get the best price.  The Department of Veterans Affairs already does this. While there is no  silver bullet in solving rising drug costs, this would be a commonsense  first step in the right direction.   There are also more than 250 bills passed by the House that Majority  Leader McConnell refuses to bring up and that have been left in the  legislative graveyard. Let me repeat that. More than 250 bills are  awaiting action here in the Senate. The House is doing its part to look  out for the people's business, and the Senate should follow suit.   These include the Enhanced Background Checks Act, which would expand  the national firearms background check system to include virtually all  gun transfers, and block the illegal sales that currently happen  through gun shows and private transfers. They include the  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which is the primary  law to provide services for victims of domestic violence, sexual  assault, and stalking. They include the American Dream and Promise Act,  which would provide a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients, TPS  holders, and those with DED. That's Deferred Enforced Departure.   Furthermore, Republicans continue to block Democratic-led efforts to  pass commonsense election security legislation. This is despite warning  after warning from our intelligence and national security agencies that  Russia undertook an unprecedented effort to interfere in our 2016  elections and that the Russians are actively working to do it again in  2020.   Instead of elevating someone with an extreme record like Mr. Menashi  to one of the highest courts in the land, we should be debating and  voting on legislation that will protect healthcare, expand educational  opportunity, secure our elections, fully fund the census, and prevent  gun and domestic violence--in addition to many, many other important  priorities.   The majority has refused to allow the Senate to vote on and address  the pressing issues that Americans care about. And this body is failing  to get its appropriations work done on time. So I urge the majority  leader to end this partisan paralysis and let the Senate get to work on  issues that can improve the lives of Rhode Islanders and all Americans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
