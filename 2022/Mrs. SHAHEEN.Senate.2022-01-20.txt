 Mr. President, on Monday, our Nation celebrated the  life and legacy of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Like many Americans, it  was a day of self-reflection for me. While leading a bipartisan  delegation to Ukraine, I had a front-row seat to a nation struggling to  hold on to its democracy in the face of a potential outside attack.  This comes at a very poignant moment in America's history when we were  reminded of the strength and fragility of our own democracy.   One year ago, a violent mob fueled by false claims of widespread  election fraud stormed the U.S. Capitol. This was the most significant  assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812. Although State and  Federal judges ruled against efforts to overturn the results of the  election, this lie of election fraud has continued to propagate. And  now, those who didn't like the 2020 election results are trying to  rewrite the rules.   Since the 2020 elections, Republican State lawmakers have passed an  unprecedented number of bills to erode the authority of state and local  election officials. These new laws would strip secretaries of state of  their authority, allow partisan ballot reviews, and even make local  election officials criminally or financially liable for technical  errors and actions, such as proactively sending out absentee ballot  applications.   In total, 19 States have passed regressive laws that make it harder  to vote and, in some extreme cases, may even allow Republican- controlled legislatures to overturn the results of a legitimate  election by using false claims of voter fraud. In New Hampshire, over  the past year, we have seen efforts to eliminate same-day voter  registration, a measure that would disproportionately impact young  voters, including college students and first-time voters.   Similarly, other efforts to prohibit students attending college in  New Hampshire from voting in our State's elections would unduly  burden--if not outright disenfranchise--many of those young voters.  Other attempts to make voter registration more complicated have failed  in court, including requirements for additional documentation for same- day registrants, and restrictions on which types of addresses are valid  for registration.   These efforts are ongoing, with additional restrictive and burdensome  measures being introduced as recently as the current legislative  session. And it is not just our voter laws. Earlier this month, the  Republican-controlled New Hampshire House approved a redistricting plan  that can only be described as gerrymandering. Taken together, these  measures represent a comprehensive and coordinated attempt to burden-- or even deprive--certain Granite State citizens of their right to vote.  Such blatant efforts to suppress the vote must not be tolerated.   The right to vote is one of the most fundamental and cherished  principles of our democracy. The history of our Republic is marked by  those seminal moments when we as a nation extended the right to cast a  ballot to broader populations, thereby including more voices in our  representative government: first after the Civil War with the 15th  Amendment, then to women with the 19th Amendment, and then notably with  the 1965 Voting Rights Act. As others have noted, the Voting Rights Act  has historically drawn great bipartisan support for its reauthorization  because the principles embodied in it go to the very heart of our  democracy.   But the issues and challenges that are increasingly facing our voters  are very real and very troubling--and we must take them seriously or  risk eroding that most fundamental of rights. Making voter registration  more difficult or making the process of voting more burdensome has  disproportionate effects on some of the most vulnerable voters--whether  those be young voters, communities of color, the poor, the homeless,  among others. Eliminating or limiting opportunities for early voting,  same-day registration, voting by mail, automatic registration, or the  use of absentee ballots are all different pathways to the same  pernicious effect--the suppression of the vote.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Freedom to Vote Act and the  John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Together, these bills would  standardize voting election laws across the country, expand voting  access and restore key provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that  have been struck down or weakened by the Supreme Court.   The right to vote isn't determined by political affiliation. It is  the most sacred right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution for every  eligible American and ensures that our country is, as President Lincoln  said, ``government of the people, by the people, for the people.''   I am deeply disappointed by the inability--or unwillingness--of this  august body to come together today to take this basic step in defense  of our democracy. We, the U.S. Senate, ought to be the foremost  champions and defenders of democracy, but today, I fear that we have  allowed partisan considerations to distract us from that duty.   We cannot afford to stay silent and ignore these measures that  attempt to undo the progress that we have made over decades. We  especially cannot stay silent when all of us here witnessed the  horrific events of January 2021 and the attempt to undo a legitimate  election. Protecting voting rights for every American is the first and  irreplaceable step towards protecting our democracy. We must take it  seriously, we must not let it wither in the dark, and we must not stay  silent. It is far too important--and once damaged, it is far too hard  to rebuild.                            ____________________
