 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today as one of a number of our  colleagues to talk about something that really bothers me. We are  seeing historic obstructionism in the Senate today. It has been going  on for the last 2 years.   One of the fundamental responsibilities in the Senate is to provide  advice and consent on Presidential nominations. When President Trump  took office, he acted with urgency to fill positions in his  administration with highly qualified and highly skilled, experienced  individuals from the real world--not just people from the bubble but  people from America. Unfortunately, Democrats have slow-walked this  confirmation process every step of the way. In my view, this is  historic obstructionism, and it needs to stop.   This is the first time in U.S. history that the minority party has  not waived the 30-hour debate rule to this degree. As a result, of the  1,200 nominees to be confirmed by any new President, only 714 have been  confirmed to date. At the end of last year, because of this historic  Democratic obstructionism, we had 386 nominations in line waiting to be  confirmed. At the end of Obama's first 2 years, only 5 nominees were  outstanding, compared to the 386 for President Trump at the end of last  year.   Let me say that again. At the end of President Obama's first 2 years,  only five nominees had not been confirmed. That means that out of  everybody he sent to the Senate, only five at that point had not been  confirmed. However, at the end of December this past year, President  Trump still had 386 nominees in the pipeline right here in the U.S.  Senate, waiting for us to get to them.   Of the last three Presidents, we have collectively only had 24  cloture votes required by the minority party--only 24. However, during  President Trump's first 2 years, Democrats forced 128 cloture votes on  nominees on the Senate floor. Each one of these cloture votes requires  30 hours of debate. We can't do anything else on the floor while we are  doing that. That means the normal business of the Senate cannot be  transacted because we are waiting, due to the 30-hour debate rule, to  get to the vote. Basically, under those realities, the Senate is able  to do only one confirmation per week. Do the math--386 weeks is a long  time.   What is going on here has nothing to do with the nominees'  qualifications, either. Every single one of Donald Trump's nominees who  received a recorded vote was passed. Not one has failed to pass in this  body--not one. The vast majority of these nominees are noncontroversial  and get more than 70 or 80 votes and in some cases more than that.   This chart shows that of the cloture votes we have had to take, 48  percent got more than 60 votes, and 37 percent got more than 70. That  means 70 percent of the nominees got more than 60 votes. These are not  controversial nominees. That is not the issue.   My own cousin, who is now Secretary of Agriculture, waited 4 months.  I know this personally because he bunked in my place for 4 months while  we were waiting to get his confirmation. When he finally got to the  floor of the Senate, he got 87 votes.   It is clear that the Democrats will stop at nothing to obstruct the  Senate from working on real issues. Every hour we have to spend in the  30-hour waiting period is time we can't utilize to take up the  country's business and the priorities Americans want us to be working  on. If this obstruction continues, President Trump will not have his  full team in place until the end of his second term.   These delays are petty, and the American people have had enough. I  hear about it every time I go home.   For the last 2 years, several of my colleagues and I have pushed to  keep the Senate in session during the traditional August State work  break in order to confirm nominees and make progress on funding the  Federal Government. In August of 2017, the leader of the majority  party, Senator McConnell, agreed to keep us here for the month of  August in order to work on several things we were working on, including  confirming these nominees. The minority party agreed, after 4 days, to  basically confirm 77 nominees on that one day. What makes that  important is that prior to that time in August, in all of that year, we  had only been able to get 44 nominees confirmed. While staying here  last August, in 2018, we confirmed 43 nominees and completed 75 percent  of the government funding bills.   As I speak today, there are 249 nominees before the U.S. Senate  waiting to be confirmed. Basically, that would require 249 weeks to do  if we follow the rule we have been following over the last 2 years.  These nominees include the Assistant Secretary of Readiness for the  Department of Defense, who has been waiting to be confirmed for 8  months. This is in the Department of Defense, the Assistant Secretary  for Readiness--one of the crisis areas we have in our military. For 8  months this nominee has been waiting to be confirmed. The Under  Secretary for Food Safety in the Department of Agriculture--one I hear  a lot about--has been waiting 9 months in line to be confirmed.   The people on the other side are saying: The President is just not  sending up nominees fast enough.   Well, what happens with these folks who have been sitting here for 9  months waiting to be confirmed?   The Assistant Secretary for Economic Development at the Department of  Commerce has been waiting to be confirmed for 8 months.   These are not low-level nominees; these are Assistant Secretaries who  are waiting to be confirmed.   This has to stop. This President is not even able to form his own  Cabinet in complete terms because these Assistant Secretaries are not  in place. We should be working around-the-clock to get these people  confirmed.   If this obstructionism continues, we should try to change the  existing rules for confirming nominees by reducing the 30-hour debate  rule at minimum. There is a plan in the Senate right now that would  reduce the 30 hours of debate to 8 hours for most and 2 hours for  [[Page S1505]]  some. Reducing the debate time required would speed up the confirmation  process and allow us to focus on other business in the Senate that  people want us to address. Every single Democrat in the Senate today  who was also here in 2013 supported reducing debate time on nominees,  and they should do so again right now.    I will close by saying that despite this historic obstructionism, the  Senate has, indeed, over the last 2 years--because we focused on this  as a priority, even with this 30-hour debate rule being enacted--we  confirmed 63 district court judges, 31 circuit court of appeals  justices, and two Supreme Court Justices. These judges will have an  impact on the judiciary for years to come.   By the way, these are not activists with political agendas or  motives. They are accomplished, experienced jurists, dedicated to  upholding the Constitution and adhering to the rule of law. It is  criminal that we waited that long to get these people confirmed.   I applaud the President for nominating such outstanding individuals  to these positions. If this historic obstructionism continues in the  Senate, I believe President Trump will not have his full team in place  until the end of his second term, if then. This obstruction needs to  end. The resistance movement threatens the security of our country and  our ability to deal with the problems facing America today. It is time  to rise above this partisan gridlock, change the rules, confirm these  nominees, and finally begin to get results for the American people.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to talk about a crisis in my home  State and indeed five other States across the Southeast. I rise to talk  about disasters in California and to talk about our friends in Puerto  Rico.   On October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall on the Florida  Panhandle as a category 4 hurricane. It was one of the strongest storms  to ever hit the United States. Over the next few hours, Hurricane  Michael barreled through Florida and tore through southwest Georgia. In  a matter of minutes, homes were flattened, tracks of timber were  destroyed, and farmers' crops lay down in the field. People's lives  were radically affected forever.   This hurricane hit at exactly the time of year when most crops were  ready for harvest. It doesn't matter if they were peanuts, cotton, or  pecans--they were all just beautiful this year. As a matter of fact, in  the State of Georgia, I grew up working on our family's farm there, and  I have to say the cotton crop last year was probably the best I had  ever seen. It was almost cruel. Today, agriculture is Georgia's top  industry and our No. 1 economic driver. Before the hurricane, farmers  in my State were expecting a record harvest. Instead, their crops were  completely destroyed.   Shortly after the hurricane hit, President Trump, Vice President  Pence, and Secretary of Agriculture Perdue all came down to Georgia.  Together, we toured the devastation and heard from farmers and local  officials about the tough road of recovery ahead. Some farmers said  they could clean up, replant, and have a crop next year as long as they  had adequate resources. Other farmers were not so lucky.   Georgia is the top pecan-producing State in the country. One of our  largest pecan farms is owned by two brothers in Bainbridge, which the  Vice President and I personally visited. We personally saw the damage  in their fields. Some 800 acres of pecan trees were gone. I cannot  describe to you what that looks like. On the ground was a solid  carpet--if you can imagine this--of mature, beautiful, inch-long pecans  that were ready to be harvested but were on the ground, ruined.   One brother said:         The farmer in me wants to farm this land, but there's no       way I can make it. Next year is the year I'll lose it,       because we're not like the cotton guy. Nothing against them,       but they get to replant a seed next year and have a crop. I       don't.    The problem is that the pecan crop can be annually insured, but there  is no insurance product for insuring pecan trees. If these two brothers  replant, it could take 7 to 10 years for the trees to mature enough to  even generate a minimum revenue. Most likely, full production would  take over 12 years. For them, this is truly a generational loss.   The other brother said:         My brother and I built this business from nothing. We will       make it. We may not be in the pecan business anymore, but       we will be doing something else. We are fighters. [Our       families are committed to this land.] You just have to go       on.    When they saw the devastation, President Trump and Vice President  Pence stepped up to the plate and made a commitment to our agriculture  community.   President Trump said: ``Farmers really got hurt here, especially in  Georgia, but we're going to get it taken care of.''   Vice President Pence said:         We will rebuild these crops and these communities. We will       restore southwest Georgia. We will restore the Sunbelt region       bigger and better than ever before.    This afternoon, I am here to say that the Vice President and the  President are living up to their word. After this disaster relief was  caught up in the political nightmare of funding the last 25 percent of  this year's budget, we now have the opportunity to put this standalone  supplemental appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate. The  President and Vice President have been absolutely resolute in their  support of getting aid to the victims of these disasters. They are now  asking Congress to pass this all-inclusive disaster relief bill right  now.   The State of Georgia has already stepped up and offered tax credits,  short-term financing, and other forms of direct assistance to those who  have been impacted, but they have only scratched the surface. The  people of Georgia have come together and helped their neighbors, served  meals to each other, and assisted first responders in their recovery  efforts.   In Florida alone, then-Governor Rick Scott, who is now our colleague  here on the Senate floor, was in the race for this Senate seat, and he  actually suspended his campaign to devote all of his time, in his  responsibility as the Governor, to lead the effort of analyzing the  damage in Florida and determining what needed to be done. He can speak  directly to the need. He is a cosponsor of this bill, I might add.   However, despite efforts by Senator Isakson and others and me in our  State, this Senate body has yet to take action on disaster relief for  the agriculture community in the Southeast. Our farmers simply cannot  wait any longer. The situation in my State is dire. I would say it is  the same across the South. Because revenue from the 2018 harvest was  destroyed, bankers can't lend money to farmers who right now are asking  to borrow money to put seed in the ground, to fertilize the ground, and  to prepare the ground for next year's crop. It is as simple as that.  Growers cannot replant because they can't get their financial houses in  order because we haven't adopted a resolution for last year's harvest  that they were not able to achieve. Rural communities are suffering,  and in many places, economic activity is at an absolute standstill as  it waits for the Federal Government--this body and the House of  Representatives--to do its job.   For some in my State, the timing of assistance is not just a matter  of putting a crop in the ground this year; it is a matter of  potentially never putting a crop in the ground again. If we do not help  these people right now, they may lose their businesses and livelihoods  through no fault of their own. That is the reality we are facing here.  The people in my State have asked me to utilize every sphere of  influence, turn over every stone, and exhaust all options to get  disaster relief right now.   We are past the time when this should have gotten done. I have spoken  with the President many times about this. His commitment to our farmers  is unwavering. Just last Monday night, he said: David, get it done. He  called me again on Saturday night before he left for Vietnam. He said:  David, what do we have to do to get this bill across the Senate floor?  Talk to our friends in the House, and make sure that everything that is  needed is in.   Senator Isakson, I, and several other Senators have introduced a  supplemental disaster relief bill on the floor of the Senate, and  President Trump has agreed to sign it. Our bill includes disaster  relief for agriculture. It also provides additional funds for Georgia  and other States like Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas, Alaska, Hawaii,  and California that have battled natural disasters over the last year  on  [[Page S1523]]  their own. It also builds on the Trump administration's past efforts  and includes the remaining funding for Puerto Rico.   Both the House and Senate have previously supported similar  proposals. They should be even more inclined to do so now that it is  not tied up with the overall 2019 budget drama. This is a standalone  supplemental bill that includes those things that people on both sides  of this body agreed to and voted for just last year. This bipartisan  package is a win for our farmers. It is a win for families and  businesses that were devastated by historic hurricanes in the Southeast  and wildfires in the West. It is a win for the people of Puerto Rico  whom the President has previously helped. He was committed to including  that in this bill.   I sincerely hope this body will move quickly and pass this disaster  relief bill without further delay. I humbly ask each of my colleagues  in this body for their individual support and for their vote in this  disaster relief package that will save hundreds, if not thousands, of  farming families in my home State from having to give up what they  love, and that is farming the land that in many cases they inherited  from their families. In other cases, people who graduated from HBCUs-- some of our brightest young people--borrowed money to buy the land or  are leasing the land, and they are in danger of losing this dream of  making a living on the ground in Georgia.   Our country and our people are counting on us to get this done, and  time is of the essence.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a great  loss suffered in my home State of Georgia and more specifically in the  city of Valdosta. For more than 40 years, Parker Greene spent every day  of his life thinking about how he could make a difference in his  community by supporting the various missions at Moody Air Force Base,  which is located just on the outskirts of Valdosta in South Georgia.  Parker passed away on December 18, 2018, at the age of 86. He leaves  behind a lasting legacy that will be remembered throughout my home  State for decades to come.   Parker moved to Valdosta in 1970 and immediately became involved with  the Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce. He was named to the  military affairs committee and quickly developed a fondness for the  airmen stationed at Moody, as well as the multiple missions housed at  the base. Through the years, his level of advocacy for Moody continued  to increase. The local community recognized this and created the Moody  Support Committee and named Parker as its chairman. As chairman, Parker  took countless trips every year to Washington, DC, to impress upon  congressional and Department of Defense leaders the importance of  maintaining a robust Air Force presence at Moody due to its strategic  location in the southeastern U.S. and unmatched community support.   In the 1990s, when the Base Realignment and Closure Commission  recommended closing Moody and moving its missions to other bases,  Parker and the Moody Support Committee tirelessly walked the halls of  Congress and the Pentagon to advocate for the removal of Moody from the  BRAC list and to increase its mission presence. Parker's efforts proved  successful. His determination allowed Moody to continue its mission,  while sparing the Valdosta community from certain economic loss due to  the closure of the base.   Following his successful efforts in the 1990s, Parker continued his  work on Moody's behalf to relocate new missions to the base in order to  diversify Moody's mission presence and further prove its strategic  importance. In fact, in 2007, the newly constructed consolidated base  support center at Moody was named after Parker because of his efforts  on behalf of the base and its airmen. Former Air Force Chief of Staff  Michael Moseley was at the renaming and presented Parker with the  first-ever Chief of Staff Exceptional Service Award.   Several years later, Parker was awarded the highest honor the Air  Force can bestow on a civilian: the Air Force Distinguished Public  Service Award. The award stated that Parker ``distinguished himself by  service as an Air Force advocate, with both an intimate knowledge of  Air Force operations and a deep grasp of social and economic issues  vital to Moody Air Force Base. He has expertly advised the Secretary of  the Air Force, the Chief of Staff, and senior Air Force leaders on  these matters while serving as an Air Force civic leader to the  community surrounding the installation.''   Of course, Parker could not have accomplished his many feats without  the loyal and steadfast support from his lovely wife Dr. Lucy Greene.  Together, they made an unstoppable duo, and Lucy proved to be as  tireless an advocate for Moody as Parker. I know I speak for the entire  State when I offer my heartfelt condolences to Lucy and their two  children, Buck and Sharon.   While we mourn Parker and the loss to Moody AFB and south Georgia, I  know that everyone can look at Parker's record of achievement and see  an unparalleled legacy of selflessness, kindness, and service to  others. I have no doubt that Moody will continue to be a leading  example of Air Force excellence because of Parker's impact on the base  and his advocacy for the region in Atlanta and Washington.                            ____________________
