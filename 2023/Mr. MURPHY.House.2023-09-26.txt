 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2795, a  critical piece of legislation that extends the authority of the  Department of Veterans Affairs to continue providing several essential  services.   I am proud to have introduced the House version of this bill and  grateful for Senator Tester's leadership in the other Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, my district is home to over 76,000 veterans, and it is  my honor and privilege to represent them in Congress.   I thoroughly believe that when a man or a woman signs on the dotted  line to serve our country, that is their contract, but when they come  home, it is our contract to take care of them.   It is an absolute priority of mine to make sure that their VA  benefits, which were promised and earned, are given to them.   This legislation enables the Department of Veterans Affairs to  continue carrying out its duty to care for our veterans efficiently and  effectively. It allows physicians and nurses that do veterans'  compensation and pension plans to practice across State lines. It  allows the VA to restore veterans' GI benefits if they use them at an  educational institution that closes or gets decertified from the  program. It extends the Veterans Health Administration's emergency  preparedness measures to protect access to care during times of crisis.   Our veterans have made great sacrifices to protect our way of life  and our freedom. It is only right that we, in turn, serve them and give  them the benefits that they have adamantly earned.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do  the same.                                time  1715
