 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize our fallen  servicemembers as Memorial Day approaches.   This weekend, I was proud to join in the dedication of the Fall River  Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall, which pays homage to the nearly 60,000  Americans who died in Vietnam. They were not always honored as they  should have been by their contemporaries, but we honor them now.  Liberty, justice, and democracy are ultimately protected by those who  are willing to lay down their lives to defend these values.   This coming Memorial Day, let us enjoy time with our friends and  families, a more acute joy than ever, after this past year. But let us  also center ourselves on the true meaning of the day and reflect on the  sacrifice and valor of those no longer with us.                            ____________________
