 Mr. President, just before we left for last week's State  work period, the majority leader filed cloture on six nominees for  Federal circuit courts. He did not take this action in a vacuum.   Over the past year and a half, the majority leader and the  Republicans in the Senate have joined with Donald Trump to try to pack  our Federal courts with ideological judicial nominees who seek to  change American law to match their partisan politics.   To accomplish this goal, the majority leader and Senate Republicans  have also been eliminating procedural checks designed to ensure a fair  and qualified judiciary. One of those checks is the blue-slip  requirement--a mechanism for Senators to indicate their approval of  nominees from their States.   In the past, when Senators objected to a judicial nomination in their  home State, with almost no exceptions, the Judiciary Committee took no  further action on that nominee. This was because the Constitution  requires the President to get the advice and consent of the Senate when  nominating judges.   Traditionally, this has been done by consultation with the home State  Senators, but the majority leader and his Republican colleagues have  largely abandoned this constitutional safeguard.   The Judiciary Committee has, though very rarely, scheduled hearings  for nominees who lack one blue slip and whose home State Senators have  returned negative blue slips.   Now, tomorrow, we will have a hearing for a Ninth Circuit nominee for  whom no blue slips have ever even been returned. This has never  happened in the modern history of the Senate, and it certainly was not  the standard the majority leader and the chair of the Judiciary  Committee applied to President Obama's judicial nominees.   It does not have to be this way. It is possible for home State  Senators to confer with this administration and identify nominees  acceptable to both  [[Page S2539]]  parties. For example, the Trump administration consulted with Senator  Schatz and me about nominees to fill Hawaii vacancies on the district  and circuit courts. We worked together to identify nominees who would  be qualified and appropriate for these lifetime appointments--Jill  Otake for the district court and Mark Bennett for the Ninth Circuit. We  returned our blue slips, and the nominations are moving forward.   Abandoning the blue slip has nothing to do with overcoming so-called  Democratic obstruction of President Trump's judicial nominees. This  President has seen more circuit court nominees confirmed at a faster  pace than any modern President. In fact, he has bragged about the pace  of confirmation of his judges, including at the State of the Union  Address.   Instead, abandoning the blue-slip process is about gutting checks and  balances that would prevent Donald Trump from packing the court with  ideologically driven judges as quickly as possible.   This week, we are considering one of those judges--Michael Brennan-- whose nomination should not proceed. It has come to the Senate without  the traditional advice and consent and over the strong objection of his  home State Senator, Ms. Baldwin.   In fact, in a particularly hypocritical twist, Mr. Brennan was  nominated to fill a seat that has been kept open for over 7 years  because the senior Senator from Wisconsin--a Republican--refused to  return a blue slip for Victoria Nourse--President Obama's nominee for  this very same seat.   At that time, Mr. Brennan--the nominee we are debating today--even  wrote an op-ed in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2011 arguing in  favor of respecting the blue-slip requirement on the Nourse nomination,  saying:         There are now two Senators from Wisconsin from different       political parties, so to exclude Johnson and those citizens       who voted for him would be a purely partisan move.        Johnson represents millions of Wisconsin citizens, just as       Sen. Herb Kohl does and Feingold did. In the same way those       senators had their say in Nourse's first nomination, Johnson       should have his say . . . [He] just wants to be heard and       fulfill his constitutional duty of ``advice and consent.''        Why can't Johnson, elected by the citizens of Wisconsin,       participate in the selection of a judge for a Wisconsin seat       on the 7th Circuit, as Kohl did?    Now that the shoe is on the other foot, Mr. Brennan is perfectly  happy to have his nomination move forward over the objections of one of  Wisconsin's Senators--Ms. Tammy Baldwin. This is the kind of hypocrisy  we have come to expect from this administration, but I am also not  surprised that Senator Baldwin did not approve Michael Brennan,  considering his troubling views on the way the law works. He should not  be confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the Seventh Circuit.    In a 2001 op-ed for the National Review online, Mr. Brennan expressed  dangerous ideas that call into question the duty of Federal judges to  follow precedent. In his op-ed, Mr. Brennan casts doubt on whether  judges have a responsibility to rely on how other judges before them  interpreted laws, what lawyers call stare decisis. He wrote:         If, after reexamination of a legal decision, a court       concludes that the ruling was incorrect, stare decisis does       not require that the rule of that case be followed. . . .       Bush-appointed judges cannot accurately be labeled as       activists for reexamining and following only correct       precedent.    I interpret this op-ed to mean that a judge is free to determine  whether he or she will agree that the precedent is correct. That is not  how the law works. So we, in the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr. Brennan  about this article during his confirmation hearing, and he came up with  a clever explanation for it. He claimed his article asserted that  judges are not necessarily bound by decisions of their own district or  their own circuit. His article, he claimed, did not argue that judges  can disregard precedent of higher, controlling courts. That is not what  he wrote.   It is a convenient explanation, I admit, but it doesn't really hold  up if you read his op-ed, where he clearly argues that President George  W. Bush's judicial nominees should receive a pass for not following the  law. This is what used to be called a confirmation conversion.   As with too many of President Trump's nominees, we are being told to  ignore what we read or hear and set aside common sense. We are told by  these nominees that what they talked about yesterday, think about  today, wrote about yesterday--we are supposed to just ignore all of  that. We are supposed to pretend that what someone has advocated for in  the past, no matter how recent, will have no bearing on what they will  do as a judge, but, remember, Judge Brennan has said he doesn't feel  bound, according to his op-ed piece, by precedent.   Judges, as former Chief Justice Rehnquist said, do not come to their  positions as blank slates. Each of them brings their own ideas and  perspectives to the bench.   The majority leader recently said his most consequential political  act--political act--was blocking Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to  the Supreme Court. This is the same majority leader complaining that  Democrats are now obstructing President Trump's judicial nominees. What  could be more obstructionist than to totally ignore a nominee to the  Supreme Court, no less?   The majority leader's unprecedented action prevented President  Obama's well-qualified, centrist nominee from even having a  confirmation hearing, let alone a vote, and it paved the way a year ago  for Senate Republicans to jam through President Trump's conservative,  ideological nominee, Neil Gorsuch--a Federalist Society-backed  nominee--to provide a five-vote conservative majority on the Court that  will continue to roll back individual rights for decades. President  Trump put his stamp on this approach when he tweeted, ``Republicans  must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court.'' They are taking this same  approach to all of our Federal courts.   I take the Senate's constitutional obligation to provide advice and  consent on judicial nominees very seriously. We should be carefully  considering a nominee's record to ensure they understand that courts  are supposed to protect the rights of minorities.   The courts do not belong to Democrats or Republicans, despite the  fact that Donald Trump has said Republicans must always hold the  Supreme Court. He applies that, by the way, to the district courts as  well as circuit courts. We must ensure that judges with lifetime  appointments will treat all Americans--all Americans, and, I would say,  particularly minorities and women--fairly in court. This is what the  blue-slip requirement is really about. Home State Senators have a  unique role in ensuring that the Federal judges serving in their States  are highly qualified, understand the importance of applying the law  fairly, and meet the needs of their community.   I urge Senate Republicans to reverse their ill-conceived decision to  functionally eliminate the blue-slip requirement. We must all stand  together to respect Senator Baldwin's objections and oppose this  nominee--who, to me, is the height of being a hypocrite--or all of us  are at risk.   I yield the floor.
