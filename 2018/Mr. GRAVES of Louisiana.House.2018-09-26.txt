 Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the  chairman, the ranking member, and their staff for their perseverance on  this legislation. This is really an amazing accomplishment that I think  is going to transform how we plan for, how we prepare for, and how we  respond to and recover from disasters.   Mr. Speaker, we spent more than $1.5 trillion responding to 220  disasters that have cost our Nation more than $1 billion each since  1980. We have this process in the Federal Government where we spend  billions after a disaster rather than spending millions on the front- end actually preparing and making our communities more resilient. This  bill begins to change that.   There are a number of very important lessons learned, commonsense  provisions in this legislation. I want to highlight the duplication of  benefits, section 1210, of this legislation that reverses this crazy  Federal policy whereby it was incentivizing people to wait, to slow  down recovery, while costing FEMA more dollars in temporary housing,  eliminating this process whereby loans and grants were viewed as being  duplicative.
