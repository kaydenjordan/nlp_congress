 Mr. Speaker, of all the policy changes that are being  recommended in this legislation before us today, the one that scares me  the most is the repeal of the so-called Johnson amendment.   The Johnson amendment basically says: If you are a religious  organization or a nonprofit and if you engage in partisan political  activity, you lose your tax-exempt status.   Repealing that has the potential of politicizing the pulpit  nationwide. In fact, 103 religious organizations, 4,200 faith-based  leaders in this country, and 5,500 nonprofits have written a letter to  every Member of Congress telling us: Don't do this.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these letters.       Updated November 1, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Orrin Hatch,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McConnell, Leader       Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Chairman Brady, Chairman Hatch,       Ranking Member Neal, and Ranking Member Wyden: We, the 103       undersigned religious and denominational organizations       strongly oppose any effort to weaken or eliminate protections       that prohibit 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of       worship, from endorsing or opposing political candidates.       Current law serves as a valuable safeguard for the integrity       of our charitable sector and campaign finance system.        Religious leaders often use their pulpits to address the       moral and political issues of the day. They also can, in       their personal capacities and without the resources of their       houses of worship, endorse and oppose political candidates.       Houses of worship can engage in public debate on any issue,       host candidate forums, engage in voter registration drives,       encourage people to vote, help transport people to the polls       and even, with a few boundaries, lobby on specific       legislation and invite candidates to speak. Tax-exempt houses       of worship may not, however, endorse or oppose candidates or       use their tax-exempt donations to contribute to candidates'       campaigns. Current law simply limits groups from being both a       tax-exempt ministry and a partisan political entity.        As religious organizations, we oppose any attempt to weaken       the current protections offered by the 501(c)(3) campaign       intervention prohibition because:        People of faith do not want partisan political fights       infiltrating their houses of worship. Houses of worship are       spaces for members of religious communities to come together,       not be divided along political lines; faith ought to be a       source of connection and community, not division and discord.       Indeed, the vast majority of Americans do not want houses of       worship to issue political endorsements. Particularly in       today's political climate, such endorsements would be highly       divisive and would have a detrimental impact on civil       discourse.        Current law protects the integrity of houses of worship. If       houses of worship endorse candidates, their prophetic voice,       their ability to speak truth to power as political outsiders,       is threatened. The credibility and integrity of congregations       would suffer with bad decisions of candidates they endorsed.       Tying America's houses of worship to partisan activity       demeans the institutions from which so many believers expect       unimpeachable decency.        Current law protects the independence of houses of worship.       Houses of worship often speak out on issues of justice and       morality and do good works within the community but may also       labor to adequately fund their ministries. Permitting       electioneering in churches would give partisan groups       incentive to use congregations as a conduit for political       activity and expenditures. Changing the law would also make       them vulnerable to individuals and corporations who could       offer large donations or a politician promising social       service contracts in exchange for taking a position on a       candidate. Even proposals that would permit an       ``insubstantial'' standard or allow limited electioneering       only if it is in furtherance of an organization's mission       would actually invite increased government intrusion,       scrutiny, and oversight.        The charitable sector, particularly houses of worship,       should not become another cog in a political machine or       another loophole in campaign finance laws. We strongly urge       you to oppose any efforts to repeal or weaken protections in       the law for 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of       worship.

Representative Ron Kind,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Kind: As a leader in my religious       community, I am strongly opposed to any effort to repeal or       weaken current law that protects houses of worship from       becoming centers of partisan politics. Changing the law would       threaten the integrity and independence of houses of worship.       We must not allow our sacred spaces to be transformed into       spaces used to endorse or oppose political candidates.        Faith leaders are called to speak truth to power, and we       cannot do so if we are merely cogs in partisan political       machines. The prophetic role of faith communities       necessitates that we retain our independent voice. Current       law respects this independence and strikes the right balance:       houses of worship that enjoy favored tax-exempt status may       engage in advocacy to address moral and political issues, but       they cannot tell people who to vote for or against. Nothing       in current law, however, prohibits me from endorsing or       opposing political candidates in my own personal capacity.        Changing the law to repeal or weaken the ``Johnson       Amendment''--the the section of the tax code that prevents       tax-exempt nonprofit organizations from endorsing or opposing       candidates--would harm houses of worship, which are not       identified or divided by partisan lines. Particularly in       today's political climate, engaging in partisan politics and       issuing endorsements would be highly divisive and have a       detrimental impact on congregational unity and civil       discourse.   I therefore urge you to oppose any repeal or weakening of the Johnson  Amendment, thereby protecting the independence and integrity of houses  of worship and other religious organizations in the charitable sector.            Respectfully,        Wisconsin--        Rabbi Jessica Barolsky, Rabbi, Reform Judaism, Milwaukee,       WI.

Mr. Speaker, when I go to my church, South Beaver Creek  Lutheran Church, Sunday mornings with my family in rural western  Wisconsin by our family farm, I view that place as a sanctuary for my  soul; a place for us to congregate, to commune, to spend time in  fellowship with our fellow neighbors, and to check up on one another.   Yes, preach values and preach moral lessons to our children,  absolutely. But by repealing the Johnson amendment, you have the  potential of creating conflict in the pews. You could be creating  Republican and Democratic churches, mosques, and synagogues overnight.   This is one of the last refuges, one of the last institutions that we  still have as a country given how much we are self-segregating and  deciding whom we like to hang out with, what clubs we join, what people  we want to associate with, even our own family members, because of  political affiliation. Our places of worship are one of the last places  we can come regardless of political affiliation.   This will create unnecessary strife and unnecessary conflict, and it  has the potential of driving young people away from organized religion  because they won't put up with this. It could be a backdoor attempt for  a lot of political contributors now to get tax-exempt contributions to  these organizations for direct, partisan political campaigns. That is  why the Joint Committee on Taxation viewed this as a cost of over $2  billion.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to reconsider and reject this, and  let's prevent that conflict in our communities.
