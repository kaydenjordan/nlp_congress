 Mr. President, I rise, as my colleague from Alaska just  did so eloquently, to pay tribute to our colleague and our friend,  Senator John McCain.   I guess I have to start with a question: Where do I begin? Where does  anyone begin after all we have heard these last number of days and will  continue to hear in the days ahead when we pay tribute, in a more  formal way in the next few days, here in Washington, in Arizona, and  around the world?   John McCain lived to serve his country. His life could be best  described in many words, but three come to mind: courage, commitment,  and character.   There is a line attributed to Abraham Lincoln in which he said: In  the end, it is not the years in one's life that count; it is the life  in those years. It is a loose translation, not exact. Yet, when you  consider the life in those years in the context of John McCain, what a  life it was. He was a remarkable human being who was able to rise above  the horror of being a captive and of being tortured in order to achieve  so much in his life after that in the Navy, as an elected official, as  a Presidential candidate, and, of course, most especially, as a leader.   John McCain demonstrated a kind of courage that most people cannot  even begin to imagine--5\1/2\ years spent in an enemy prison camp in  North Vietnam. I was thinking, as it was recounted this week, that 5\1/ 2\ years is just a little less than a Senate term that he spent as a  captive. Given the opportunity to cut the line and be released ahead of  his fellow prisoners, likely because of his father's rank as an  admiral, John McCain said, no, he would wait his turn and endure the  beatings and suffering that he had to endure.   A few years ago, a number of us retreated to the rare privilege of  listening to John McCain talk about that experience. We had a lunch-- both sides of the aisle--in the caucus room in the Russell Building,  and John McCain talked about some of his experiences as a prisoner of  war. I will never forget those stories, and I will never forget how he  walked through those experiences with such humility. There is no  recitation of facts that would lead you to the conclusion that he was  heroic--though, he was. There was no self-aggrandizement, no effort to  tell you how tough he was or how strong he was. He just told stories  about what it was like--the daily suffering and the pain his captors  would inflict on him day after day after day.   This experience, obviously and certainly, impacted his approach to  foreign policy and his approach to military policy for the rest of his  life. It especially impacted his work as a public official in the House  of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate.   In his 2008 acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention,  John McCain said:         I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in       someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of       life here. I loved it for its decency, for its faith in the       wisdom, justice, and goodness of its people.    It is a rare soul of great courage who comes away from such a  painful, searing experience with that outlook and with a deep desire to  continue to serve.   John McCain's life, obviously, was a life of action and a life of  commitment. He was committed to this country that he served for 60  years in the Navy, in the House of Representatives, and in the Senate-- the Senate, of course, for more than 30 after having been elected in  1986. He was, of course, committed to bringing hope to the oppressed,  to the persecuted around the world, and to the people here at home.   When I think of John, I am reminded of some of the words from  ``America the Beautiful.'' The one line that is inspirational is that  line that we have often heard: ``O beautiful for patriot dream That  sees beyond the years.''   John McCain's life was a testament to that dream, not a ``dream'' in  a theoretical sense but in the belief that, every day, your work has to  be geared toward the future. The dream of a patriot is not something  abstract. The dream of a patriot has to be the commitment of working on  behalf of those who will come after you. That is why the line talks  about seeing beyond the years, always working, as John McCain did, for  the future--for more freedom, for more opportunity, for less  oppression, for less suffering for people here at home and around the  world. He had that dream that animated his life's work.   John McCain, of course, would also have been the first person to have  reminded us that he had been far from perfect. I am not sure I have  ever heard of a public official recounting or reciting instances in  which he was not perfect or when he didn't do the right thing. Very few  public officials are willing to admit that. Of course, John was not the  usual public official. Even when he cataloged mistakes or things that  he believed he did wrong, everyone who knew him--everyone who knew  anything about his life or his work or his service--would also conclude  at the same time that, without question, John McCain had integrity,  that John McCain had character, and that character must continue to  matter in the life of a public official. If it doesn't matter, then we  are not going to have much of a country. John McCain understood that.  It is not good enough to be smart and committed to your positions on  public policy. It is not good enough just to be there for votes and for  debates. That is, obviously, critical, but character still matters, and  John McCain was living proof of that.   I remember one occasion on which he and I had an acrimonious exchange  in a Senate elevator, for just a couple seconds when the elevator went  from the  [[Page S6005]]  basement to the second floor. John was very heated, and I was taken by  surprise as to how heated he was. Yet, as we have heard so many times  over the past several days, John McCain never let a public policy  disagreement impact personal relationships with his colleagues.   A couple of hours later, we were back on the Senate floor. I wanted  to continue the argument, and I started to approach him on the floor to  continue the argument. I guess I wanted to get the last word, which  might have been a mistake with John McCain. Yet, as I got close to him,  John McCain lifted up his arms, reached out to me, and embraced me. He  said, ``I'm sorry.'' He apologized. It is not common for elected  officials in any government or at any level of government to apologize  on a regular basis, but John McCain was uncommon when it came to being  a unique public official.   John worked with so many of us on many issues. I didn't have the  chance to work with him on a long list of issues, but I do remember one  that had a particular impact on me. That was his work as a vocal  advocate for the people of Syria, who were still suffering under the  oppressive, violent regime of Bashar al-Assad. I worked with John, as  many did here, to pursue a policy as to how the United States could  best support the aspirations of the Syrian people for new political  leadership, for stability, security, and, of course, for a prosperous  future.   John McCain and I didn't agree on all national security issues, but I  will always remember his courage of conviction when it came to standing  with the oppressed and vulnerable people across the world against  tyrannical dictators or despots. On this issue, we were on the same  page and tried to get the policy right.   Whether it was with international affairs or domestic policies, John  worked to find common ground with his colleagues, though, to do that,  we were trying to create, of course, a stronger country and a better  world, and I am grateful to have been included among those who can say  they worked with John McCain to try to enact good policy.   Let me conclude with these words. In one of his final interviews,  when asked how he would like to be remembered, John McCain's simple  response was: ``He served his country honorably.'' The final word was  added with some reservation as if he still wondered if it were  deserved.   Let's be clear. John McCain did serve his country honorably, and this  country is much better for his service. We will miss him in this  Chamber, but we should all strive to live up to his example of service  and bipartisan work in the Senate and bipartisan work for our Nation.   The words ring true for John McCain more than almost anyone else I  can think of: ``O beautiful for patriot dream That sees beyond the  years.'' John McCain was always trying to be that patriot who thought  about the future, who tried to see beyond the years to make life better  for those who would come after him. We were privileged to have served  in the U.S. Senate with John McCain.   On behalf of my family and, I am sure, not just of the family of  Pennsylvania but of those well beyond our State, we offer condolences  to John's wife Cindy and to their family, and his many friends. May he  rest in peace.   God bless John McCain.   I yield the floor.
