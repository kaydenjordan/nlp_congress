 Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask the House  today to adopt my  [[Page H6356]]  amendment--the Kyle Mullen Naval Safety Enhancements--that directs the  Secretary of Defense to conduct an appraisal of and provide recommended  policies for improved medical care and oversight of individuals in the  Navy engaged in high-stress training like the Navy SEALS to better  ensure sailor safety and prevent related long-term injury, illness, and  death.   In February of this year, my constituent Kyle Mullen passed away  after completing the rigorous training of `Hell Week' as a Navy SEAL  candidate.   The autopsy report cited pneumonia and staph infection as the cause  of death.   Kyle was an extraordinary talented and gifted young man--a true  leader who selflessly enlisted in the Navy to serve our nation and  protect our freedom.   Kyle was a world class athlete and was a basketball standout and  Captain of both Manalapan High School and Yale University Football  teams.   Kyle's mother--Regina--a nurse told me in a heartbreaking  conversation in her home that Kyle's death could have been prevented  had her son received timely medical attention.   Regina has many questions that demand answers.   Meanwhile, this grieving mom has made it clear and with great urgency  and resolve that Congress and DOD must insist that medical care,  aggressive monitoring, and oversight be provided now, without delay, to  every Navy SEAL candidate during high-stress training.
