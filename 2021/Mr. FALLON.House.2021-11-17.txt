 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the  unconstitutional overreach shown by this President in his recent  vaccine mandate. And don't be fooled, this is nothing more than an  attack on frontline workers, small businesses, and the rights of every  American.   OSHA's regulatory powers are limited to the workplace and the  workplace alone.   Joe Biden is now trying to use OSHA as an instrument in his political  game;  [[Page H6350]]  mandating a vaccine, and taking away medical freedoms from millions of  Americans.   This goes far beyond OSHA's jurisdiction, and it is incomprehensible.   It affects employees' ability to make life-changing, personal  healthcare decisions.   This is the textbook definition of ``tyranny,'' and it must be  stopped.   The policies this administration continues to hand out are rising  prices, bottlenecking our supply chain, and causing a historic labor  shortage.   What do they think a draconian fine of $14,000 per employee will do  to employers? I will tell you what it will do; it will bury our  economy.   Big Government is not the solution. It is the problem.                            ____________________
