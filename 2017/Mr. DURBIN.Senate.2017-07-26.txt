 Mr. President, yesterday, on the floor of the Senate,  there was a speech which will be remembered for a long time. Our friend  and colleague Senator John McCain came to the floor just days after he  had been diagnosed with a serious cancer challenge. He made the trip  from Arizona to Washington to vote on the floor on this healthcare  debate, then asked for 15 minutes of time afterward to speak to the  Senate. Of course, he was given that opportunity.   During the time that we learned about his diagnosis and he was home,  virtually every one of us sent our personal best wishes to him and his  family. Our love and respect for John McCain is deeply felt in the U.S.  Senate, and virtually everyone stayed on the floor to hear his speech.  Look around the floor now. There aren't many people, right? As good as  my speech may be, it is not going to touch the quality of what John  delivered yesterday. I wanted to be here for it and so did my  colleagues on the Democratic side and on the Republican side.   John said a lot about who we are and what we are in the U.S. Senate.  Fewer than 2,000 individuals, in the history of the United States of  America, have had the honor to stand here and speak on the floor of the  Senate. This is a rare opportunity. For many of us, it is a dream come  true and one we couldn't imagine, but what John said yesterday, to  summarize part of his statement, is that we ought to understand our  responsibilities, as well, as Senators.   We ought to be honest about what we now face in America when it comes  to the political discourse, the political debate. What we face now is a  divided country, a divided Senate, divided House, and yet a yearning by  all Americans for us to step up and do something; make America a better  nation; help America's families, the workers, the businesses; step  forward and solve a problem. John reminded us yesterday that to do  that, we needed to move to what he called the regular order.   It may not mean much to those who are just watching this debate and  don't follow the Senate closely, but the regular order is to introduce  a bill into  [[Page S4247]]  the Senate, send it to a committee, have the committee staff review it,  experts take a look at it, call for a committee hearing so the American  people can see what is in the bill, debate the back-and-forth at the  hearing, then have members offer amendments--changes. Some will win,  some will lose. Then the bill can come to the floor of the Senate for a  similar process. It is an open, public process. That is what regular  order is, and that is what John McCain spoke to.   Let me, at this point, quote what he said verbatim. I like this  paragraph a lot so I am going to add it here. Here is what John McCain  said yesterday on the floor of the Senate:         I hope we can again rely on humility, our need to       cooperate, on our dependence on each other to learn how to       trust each other again and, by so doing, better serve the       people who elected us.    I like this part:         Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and       television and the internet.    John McCain said:         To hell with them. They don't want anything done for the       public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood.        Let's trust each other. Let's return to regular order. We       have been spinning our wheels on too many important issues       because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from       across the aisle. That is an approach that has been employed       by both sides; mandating legislation from the top down,       without any support from the other side, with all the       parliamentary maneuvers it requires. We are getting nothing       done, my friends. We are getting nothing done.    John said it yesterday and it still applies and he is right. I say  that as a Democrat with respect for him as a Republican, but if we are  not going to do more than just listen and be warmed by his words and  applaud his speech, what should we do at this moment?   What is pending before us on the floor of the U.S. Senate is  legislation that will change healthcare for every single American-- every one of them. It will change it for us in the Senate, but it will  change it for the 12.5 million people I represent in Illinois too.  Every one of them will be changed by this bill. What is in this bill  that will change it? We honestly can't tell you. The bill has not been  written. We aren't able to see it. We are being told before the end of  the week we will actually get a copy of the bill. I am not making that  up.   We have tried several amendments on the floor, and they failed--one  has failed. Several are likely to fail this afternoon, but there is no  bill before us. We can't explain to the American people what this is  ultimately going to be, except in the most general terms of what is  being debated. That is embarrassing. It is embarrassing on the floor of  the Senate.   What we should do is take this critical matter that affects every  American and every American's healthcare and send it to a committee-- the HELP Committee, chaired by Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of  Tennessee; Ranking Member Patty Murray, who is a Senator from  Washington; the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch of Utah, Republican;  Senator Wyden of Oregon, Democrat. They need to sit down and look at  these bills carefully.   Let's not make a mistake at the expense of the people who sent us  here. Let's stand up for sound, thoughtful judgment. Let's stand up for  a Senate that works, as John McCain challenged us. Is that what the  American people wish? I think it is at the heart of all of it. I think  John McCain really set a standard we ought to live up to. Let's stop  this waste of time over a debate over a bill that cannot even be  printed. Let's take this to the regular order. Let's do it the right  way, to the credit of the Senate and to the credit of our country.   We took an oath, each and every one of us, to swear to uphold the  Constitution. That Constitution, that document we revere, spells out  exactly what we should do at this moment, which is stop what we are  doing on this floor, stop wasting the time of the American people and  endangering their healthcare and take this to a debate that is  befitting a great Constitution and a great nation and a great Senate.   I yield the floor.   I do it with the hopes that those who speak after me, of both  political parties, will first sit down and read what John McCain said  yesterday and let their applause for his remarks be reflected in what  they do on the floor of the Senate today.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal, Coons, and  Carper.   For years, Republicans painted a drastic, dire picture of the  Affordable Care Act. Just this week, President Trump talked about the  so-called forgotten victims of the ACA.   The ACA isn't perfect--no law is--but to say it hasn't been a  landmark achievement for our Nation and for my State would be  absolutely wrong.   Our country's uninsured rate is at the lowest level in our Nation's  history. In Illinois, our uninsured rate has been cut in half. These  insurance gains are thanks to the Affordable Care Act.   Insurance companies can no longer deny someone coverage or charge  them sky-high premiums because of a preexisting condition, benefitting  roughly 5 million Illinoisans.   Insurance companies can no longer charge women more than men, drop  someone from coverage when they get sick, charge seniors exorbitantly  more than younger people for insurance, or refuse to cover important  and essential health benefits.   I think these consumer protections represent a step forward in  healthcare for people nationwide, and I don't believe we should get rid  of them.   So my motion would instruct the Finance Committee to report out a  bill--within 3 days--that would let any State keep the ACA if they  want.-   These Republican repeal proposals are cruel and dangerous. States  ought to be able to keep the ACA if they want, including all the record  coverage gains, consumer protections and benefits, and Federal funding  for the Medicaid expansion and tax credits.   If Senator Cruz wants to rip away health insurance ``root and  branch'' from his constituents, that is fine.   But this motion protects any State who thinks we have made too much  progress to turn back.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee; and        (2) permit a State to continue to implement the provisions       of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law       111-148), as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act,       if the Governor of that State elects to continue such       implementation, including provisions relating to health       insurance coverage gains, consumer protections and benefits       (including protections related to coverage of pre-existing       conditions, essential health benefits, and the premium levels       that older enrollees may be charged relative to younger       enrollees), and Federal funding provided under that Act       (including levels of Medicaid funding for the Medicaid       expansion population, Federal funding for tax credits, and       cost sharing reduction subsidies).     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal and Carper.   Some of the strongest opponents to the secretive and devastating  Republican repeal effort are our hospitals, especially our rural  hospitals, critical access hospitals, and safety net hospitals in  underserved urban communities.   In particular, they warn us that the devastating cuts in Medicaid  will dramatically increase uncompensated care costs.   The Illinois Hospital Association tells us that slashing Medicaid  like these Republican repeal bills do will cost Illinois between 60,000  and 95,000 healthcare jobs.   You see, not only are our rural hospitals critical lifelines for  healthcare in their communities, they are often the best jobs in town;  yet these drastic Medicaid cuts will increase uncompensated care costs  by billions, forcing cutbacks in services, staff, and expansion.   So my motion would instruct the Finance Committee to report out a  bill--within 3 days--that would protect funding for these hospitals and  prohibit increases in uncompensated care costs for these critical  facilities.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee; and        (2) would prohibit increases in uncompensated costs or       reductions in funding for rural hospitals, hospitals in       underserved areas, or critical access hospitals.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal and Carper.   Medicaid covers one in two births in Illinois. It helps pay for two  out of every three seniors in nursing homes, and it is the largest  payor of opioid and substance abuse treatment.   But guess what else Medicaid does? It helps 45 percent of school  districts provide medical and therapy services for  [[Page S4292]]  lower-income kids and those with special needs.   That is right, Illinois schools currently receive about $144 million  in Medicaid funding each year.   They use this money to provide dental screenings, therapy services  for kids with disabilities, to purchase handicap equipment, and  employing trained staff.   What would happen to kids nationwide if the $4 billion in Medicaid  funding for schools went away?   My motion would to commit would instruct the Finance Committee to  report out a bill--within 3 days--that would protect funding for  schools and students and says, if you want to slash Medicaid, it won't  be on the backs of our kids.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. DURBIN moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensures no reduction in Medicaid funding for items or       services provided in, or under arrangements with, any       kindergarten through grade 12 elementary school in the       Nation.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal and Carper.   When thinking about Medicaid, we often talk about low-income children  or pregnant women. But do you know the most expensive part of Medicaid?   It is providing long-term care for your grandmother, your  grandfather--at home or in the nursing home.   When Social Security and Medicare aren't enough, Medicaid steps in to  care for millions of seniors over age 65.   Medicaid helps pay for two out of three seniors currently in nursing  homes.   These Republican proposals to slash Medicaid are so devastating that  the American Association of Retired Persons, AARP, has come out in loud  opposition to all the repeal bills.   My motion to commit would instruct the Finance Committee to report  out a bill--within 3 days--that protects the millions of seniors who  rely on Medicaid for their care and says, if you want to slash  Medicaid, it will not be on the backs of our vulnerable seniors.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensures no seniors on Medicaid lose benefits, have       reduced provider payments for services furnished to them, or       have any increase in out-of-pocket costs.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senator Blumenthal.   Over the past few months, I have met with many heroes in the  disability community, including a woman in Illinois who has a 23-year- old son with autism. She told me that Medicaid allows her son to be at  home and function independently.   She told me that, without Medicaid, her son would have to be in a  facility she couldn't afford.   You know what else all of these advocates and fighters tell me? They  tell me that the Republican healthcare repeal proposals--all of which  decimate the Medicaid Program in order to give tax breaks to the  wealthy--would be devastating for people with disabilities.   Medicaid is a lifeline for 11 million people with disabilities. It is  the core of our commitment to care for them, and it helps us meet our  basic obligations as a society.   That is why my motion to commit would instruct the Finance Committee  to report out a bill--within 3 days--that protects children and adults  on Medicaid with disabilities from increased costs and fewer benefits.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensures no individuals with disabilities on Medicaid       lose benefits, have reduced provider payments for services       furnished to them, or have any increase in out-of-pocket       costs.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senator Blumenthal.   Under the ACA, our Nation has seen the largest decline in the child  uninsured rate, and in Illinois, we have seen a 40 percent drop. Today  more than 95 percent of kids in our country are insured.   Half of all children born in Illinois are covered by Medicaid.   That means they are guaranteed quality, comprehensive health  coverage, from vaccinations and vision checks, to dental health, mental  health, and lead poisoning screenings.   Medicaid serves low-income children in schools, and -I have visited  many school-based health clinics that provide critical access and  services for our kids.   But every single Republican healthcare repeal proposal would slash  Medicaid for our most vulnerable kids, jeopardizing the services they  receive and their ability to access care.   That is why my motion to commit would instruct the Finance Committee  to report out a bill--within 3 days--that protects our kids and tells  Republicans they will not be a bargaining chip in this cruel repeal  effort.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensures no children on Medicaid lose benefits, have       reduced provider payments for services furnished to them, or       have any increase in out-of-pocket costs.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal and Carper.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare is now financially stable  for an additional 11 years.   Because of the healthcare reforms that improve the delivery of  healthcare, seniors are now paying $700 less annually in premiums and  cost-sharing.   The ACA is also closing the dreaded Medicare ``donut hole''--the gap  where seniors were faced with high costs for their drugs--saving 11  million seniors an average for $2,127 each year on their medications.   But Republicans want to jeopardize this progress.   Instead of strengthening Medicare for the long run, many of the  Republican repeal bills would give a huge tax giveaway to wealthy  Americans--cutting years off Medicare's solvency.   That is why my motion to commit would instruct the Finance Committee  to report out a bill--within 3 days--that does not shorten Medicare's  solvency.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that the bill will not shorten the solvency of       the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under section 1817       of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i).     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed the  Record.   When Republicans talk about the challenges facing Obamacare, they  [[Page S4293]]  tend to be a bit misleading. Let's set the record straight.   What they are really talking about is within the individual market,  where 6 percent of Americans get their coverage and more than 70  percent of those people get subsidies to help cover their costs.   One problem Republicans like to cite is lack of competition, that  private, for-profit insurers are pulling out, leaving few choices.   We call these ``bare counties,'' and they are more common in rural  areas and in States that did not expand Medicaid.   I agree that we need more competition in the individual market.   As a solution, my motion to commit instructs the Finance Committee-- within 3 days--to report out a bill that requires insurers offering  Medicare Advantage plans in a particular county, to also offer an  individual market plan in that county.   Medicare Advantage insurance plans make huge profits off the Federal  Government, yet many of those same insurers are refusing to participate  in the individual exchange.   To address bare counties, my motion says that, if you have a provider  network and you are making money off the Federal Government, then you  should also help improve choice by offering a plan in the exchange.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) require each insurer who offers a Medicare Advantage       plan under part C of the Medicare program in a specific       county to also offer health insurance coverage through the       individual market in that county.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senator Blumenthal.   All of these Republican repeal bills shift costs onto consumers,  patients, hospitals, and State budgets.   None of them do anything to actually address what is driving the  increase in healthcare costs. And one of those biggest drivers?  Pharmaceutical costs--Blue Cross of Illinois tells me they spend more  on prescription drugs than inpatient hospital care.   So what can we do to address prescription drugs? Listen to the  American Medical Association, which called for a ban on direct-to- consumer pharmaceutical advertising.   According to the AMA, these ads are, ``driving demand for expensive  treatments despite the clinical effectiveness of less costly  alternatives.'' In short, pharma advertises their drugs because they  know you will tell your doctor you need it--driving up the cost-- regardless of whether it's right for you. That is why they spend  billions on it.   But the moment of truth on when patients find out about the cost is  when they are checking out at the pharmacy. That is wrong.   So my motion to commit would instruct the Finance Committee--within 3  days--to report out a bill that helps lower the cost of healthcare by  tackling the driving cost of prescription drugs, requiring  pharmaceutical companies to disclose the price of their drug in their  ads.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee; and        (2) would require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the       price of their drug to doctors as part of their educational       outreach, or to patients through direct-to-consumer       advertising.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senator Blumenthal.-   All of these Republican repeal bills shift costs onto consumers,  patients, hospitals, and state budgets.   None of them do anything to actually address what is driving the  increase in healthcare costs. And one of those biggest drivers?  Pharmaceutical costs--Blue Cross of Illinois tells me they spend more  on prescription drugs than inpatient hospital care.   So what can we do to address prescription drugs? Have Medicare  negotiate drug prices on behalf of seniors. Even the President says he  supports this policy.   Medicaid can negotiate drug costs, the Veterans Administration can  negotiate drug costs, why shouldn't Medicare be able to leverage its 50  million beneficiaries to get a better deal?   This motion is simple; it is something the President has talked  about, something the American people support.   This motion to commit would instruct the Finance Committee--within 3  days--to report out a bill that would require the Secretary of Health  and Human Services to begin negotiating drug prices on behalf of  seniors in Medicare.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to,       beginning not later than one year after the date of enactment       of this Act, negotiate the price of drugs covered by the       Medicare program on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senator Duckworth.   The process Republicans have undertaken to repeal our healthcare law  has been secretive, wrong, and undemocratic.   At first, it was 13 chosen apostles--all men--meeting in secret to  craft their repeal measure.   At this moment, I don't know who is hiding in the shadows writing  their repeal measure.   But what I do know is that there have been no hearings, no  opportunity for public input, and no opportunity for myself and Senator  Duckworth--as representatives of Illinois--to offer input.   If myself and Senator Duckworth have been locked out of the process  from the beginning, why then should our constituents have to pay the  price for this partisan Republican effort?   So our motion is simple. It says that this Republican repeal bill  cannot unfairly impose hardships on our Illinois constituents. It  cannot increase costs on my constituents, cut services or benefits or  eligibility for my constituents, eliminate essential health benefits  for my constituents, or impose lifetime limits or discriminate against  my constituents with preexisting conditions.   If Senator Cruz who has been allowed to have input on this repeal  bill--wants to rip away health insurance ``root and branch''from his  constituents, that is fine.   But this motion protects my constituents in Illinois.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee;        (2) prohibit increases in health insurance premiums or out-      of-pocket health care costs for residents of Illinois;        (3) prohibit reductions in eligibility or services, or any       increases in cost-sharing (including premiums and co-      payments) related to the eligibility of residents of Illinois       to participate in the Medicaid program;        (4) prohibit health insurance issuers from imposing annual       or lifetime limits on residents of Illinois;        (5) prohibit health insurance issuers from charging       residents of Illinois who have pre-existing conditions more       than the amount charged to healthy residents; or        (6) prohibit health insurance issuers from stopping       coverage of any essential health  [[Page S4294]]       benefits provided under section 1302 of the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022).     Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record.   The Commonwealth of Kentucky has benefitted immensely from the  Affordable Care Act.   Its uninsured rate has fallen 61 percent, one of the sharpest  declines of any State.   Kentucky chose to expand Medicaid, allowing 150,000 people to gain  coverage.   More than 1.4 million Kentuckians are no longer subjected to lifetime  or annual caps on their benefits.   Kentucky, sadly, has been one of the States hardest hit by the opioid  epidemic. Thanks to the ACA, substance abuse treatment has increased  740 percent among Kentucky residents on Medicaid.   Today, 881,000 Kentuckians--33 percent of adults--have a preexisting  condition that, before Obamacare, could have left them uninsurable.   So to ensure the health cand well-being of the residents of my  neighboring State, Kentucky, this amendment says you cannot increase  costs; cut services, benefits, or eligibility; eliminate essential  health benefits; or impose lifetime limits or discriminate against  Kentuckians with preexisting conditions.   If the Senators representing the Commonwealth want to rip away health  insurance from their constituents, undermine protections for  Kentuckians with preexisting conditions, and raise costs on older  Kentuckians, well, count this neighboring Senator in to fight on their  behalf.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee;        (2) prohibit increases in health insurance premiums or out-      of-pocket health care costs for residents of Kentucky;        (3) prohibit reductions in eligibility or services, or any       increases in cost-sharing (including premiums and co-      payments) related to the eligibility of residents of Kentucky       to participate in the Medicaid program;        (4) prohibit health insurance issuers from imposing annual       or lifetime limits on residents of Kentucky;        (5) prohibit health insurance issuers from charging       residents of Kentucky who have pre-existing conditions more       than the amount charged to healthy residents; or        (6) prohibit health insurance issuers from stopping       coverage of any essential health benefits provided under       section 1302 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care       Act (42 U.S.C. 18022).

(a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From       Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the       current system of privately financed campaigns for election       to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often       perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United       States by--        (1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived       conflicts of interest by encouraging Senators to accept large       campaign contributions from private interests that are       directly affected by Federal legislation;        (2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Senators'       accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to       be accountable to the major contributors who finance their       election campaigns;        (3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by       allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and       unfair influence within the political process;        (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through       legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal       access to lawmakers for campaign contributors;        (5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to       mount competitive Senate election campaigns;        (6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive       elections; and        (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with       fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry       out their public responsibilities.        (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From       the Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and declares that       providing the option of the replacement of large private       campaign contributions with allocations from the Fair       Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and general elections       to the Senate would enhance American democracy by--        (1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest       created by fully private financing of the election campaigns       of public officials and restoring public confidence in the       integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative       processes through a program which allows participating       candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution       limits for contributors with an assurance that there will be       sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral       campaigns;        (2) increasing the public's confidence in the       accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect       them, which derives from the program's qualifying criteria to       participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that       constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and       participate in the program;        (3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign       contributions as a determinant of a citizen's influence       within the political process by facilitating the expression       of support by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging       political participation, and incentivizing participation on       the part of Senators through the matching of small dollar       contributions;        (4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that       may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated       based upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the       influence of campaign contributions;        (5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run       for the Senate and encouraging more competitive elections;        (6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by       citizens of every level of wealth; and        (7) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with       raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their       public responsibilities.

(a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From       Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the       current system of privately financed campaigns for election       to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often       perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United       States by--        (1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived       conflicts of interest by encouraging Senators to accept large       campaign contributions from private interests that are       directly affected by Federal legislation;        (2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Senators'       accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to       be accountable to the major contributors who finance their       election campaigns;        (3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by       allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and       unfair influence within the political process;        (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through       legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal       access to lawmakers for campaign contributors;        (5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to       mount competitive Senate election campaigns;        (6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive       elections; and        (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with       fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry       out their public responsibilities.        (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From       the Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and declares that       providing the option of the replacement of large private       campaign contributions with allocations from the Fair       Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and general elections       to the Senate would enhance American democracy by--        (1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest       created by fully private financing of the election campaigns       of public officials and restoring public confidence in the       integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative       processes through a program which allows participating       candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution       limits for contributors with an assurance that there will be       sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral       campaigns;        (2) increasing the public's confidence in the       accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect       them, which derives from the program's qualifying criteria to       participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that       constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and       participate in the program;        (3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign       contributions as a determinant of a citizen's influence       within the political process by facilitating the expression       of support by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging       political participation, and incentivizing participation on       the part of Senators through the matching of small dollar       contributions;        (4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that       may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated       based upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the       influence of campaign contributions;        (5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run       for the Senate and encouraging more competitive elections;        (6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by       citizens of every level of wealth; and        (7) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with       raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their       public responsibilities.
