 Mr. President, the Hippocratic Oath that guides health  care practitioners begins with these powerful words: ``First, do no  harm.'' This is certainly good guidance for our doctors and other  health care practitioners, but isn't it good guidance also for those  who are in the realm of health care policy, for those who are health  care policy practitioners, as well as the doctors themselves? ``First,  do no harm.''   Those powerful first words of the Hippocratic Oath, very relevant to  this discussion, are being ignored by my colleagues across the aisle,  by the Republicans who have come to power and said: We are going to  dismantle health care across this Nation for millions of Americans, and  we don't know what we are going to do next. We are going to repeal this  plan, and we are going to run away, and in a few years we might figure  out how to replace these health care provisions. This is an  irresponsible perspective. We hold in our hands the health care  challenges of America, and to repeal and run will do a tremendous  amount of harm.   The irresponsibility of it is terrifying families across America.  They are scared of what the future holds, of the uncertainty that  awaits them under this strategy of making America sick again. Folks are  afraid that if they have ever been sick or injured they will soon be  denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition. They are  afraid that they may be one of the more than 20 million Americans who  will lose insurance, having gained insurance and access to affordable  quality health care through the ACA. They are scared that premium hikes  will make health care unaffordable to lower and middle-income  Americans. They are afraid of an unforeseen emergency wiping them out  financially, driving them into bankruptcy.   Our seniors are afraid as well. They remember the situation that  existed before they reached 65 or if they had health care needs and  didn't have insurance, they had to wrestle between paying for their  prescriptions or paying their heating bills. They don't want to be in  that position again. They know how much progress we have made by  filling the doughnut hole that paid for prescriptions throughout the  continuum, and they don't want us to go backward.   From so many different directions, Americans are terrified of the  Republican repeal-and-run strategy threatening to do harm to their  lives. How do I know this? I know this because they are writing to me  and to my colleagues, and we are sharing those stories tonight.   The letter I have from a young woman in Portland starts out:         I must implore you to protect the ACA. Its existence saves       the lives of millions, including mine. I was born in full       renal failure. I currently maintain Stage 3 renal function       with the help of prescription medication. If I am unable to       afford my medication, I will enter end-stage renal function,       i.e., kidney failure. I will die.    She ended her message by saying:         I am so scared. . . . I am only 26, I have so much more to       do.    Cameron of Beaver Creek writes:         My wife and daughter both have chronic health conditions,       and the ACA has allowed us to have them covered by health       insurance despite having preexisting conditions. If the ACA       is repealed, we will lose this protection and I don't know       how we could afford to pay for their medical costs directly.    Lisa in Wilsonville wrote to me about the impact that repealing the  ACA will have on her special needs daughter. Lisa says: ``If the ACA is  repealed, we lose funding that directly impacts her programs, her  respite care, her Medicaid, and I will no longer get support to take  care of my daughter.''   Just before Christmas I got a message from Nick in Portland. Nick  wrote to share his story of a recent medical emergency that threatened  his life. He said:         Without notice this past March, my heart suffered a       debilitating viral infection which resulted in congestive       heart failure. As things stand, I require a new heart, and       await that occurrence with patience and resolve. Thanks to       the ACA, I was able to purchase health insurance the month       prior to that diagnosis. Without it, I don't know how I could       have paid for my initial three-week hospitalization. . . .       Without it, my ability to obtain a replacement organ would be       uncertain. And without it, I envision a bankruptcy filing as       the only viable financial option.    Those individuals are writing about their challenges as patients, but  doctors are also writing to share their observations as folks who see  hundreds of patients in the course of a year.   Meg writes:   [[Page S172]]              I have practiced both before and after the Affordable Care       Act, and witness the sense of hope and relief the expansion       of Medicaid in Oregon brought to my patients who are facing       serious illnesses. We have been able to participate in       community and state level innovations to help transform       health care delivery, lowering costs, improving outcomes, and       making people's lives better.    Isn't that what we should be about? Not a strategy of doing harm to  millions of Americans but a strategy to make these people's lives  better.   A physician from Roseburg, a hand surgeon, wrote about the challenges  that he and his wife face, the serious medical challenges, and says:         Prior to the Affordable Care Act, we were uninsurable due       to these preexisting conditions. It seems clear that the ACA       will be repealed, and we, among millions of other Americans,       will again be uninsurable. This will not simply be a matter       of insurance being expensive; it will be a matter of the       insurance not being available at any cost.    And he continues:         So I am pleading to you to enact legislation prohibiting       insurers from denying the ability to sell policies to       individuals with prior medical conditions. The health of       millions of Americans rests on your shoulders.    And I might add that the health of millions of Americans rests on the  debate and the discussion and the decision of the U.S. Senate.   Angela, another doctor in Portland, wrote about her work with the  LGBTQ community, saying:         The loss of the affordable care act will be devastating to       my community. We have only just won the right for patients to       access medical care, hormones and surgery in the last year. I       have seen a great improvement in my patients' well-being and       mental health over the last year with these new privileges.       With the loss of the affordable care act many of my patients       will be devastated. There is a 50 percent suicide rate in the       transgender community already. Please help me prevent any       further suicides by protecting the affordable care act.    There is message after message after message saying ``first, do no  harm.'' That means we as a body need to come together and move away  from this reckless repeal-and-run strategy being proposed by the  Republicans. People are writing to express their fears and frustrations  and they are calling on us to do the right thing--folks like Meg and  Nick and Cameron and Lisa and Douglas. Their lives are better because  we enacted the Affordable Care Act.   These folks are writing because they are among the millions of people  who are affected by the changes in this law--the millions who gained  insurance coverage because of the law or they are among those who  gained coverage because of the extension of Medicaid or they gained  coverage because tax credits made health care affordable to lower and  middle-income families or they are among the 27 million Americans who  live with preexisting conditions who couldn't get insurance on the  private market or they are among those who lost coverage because of  annual or lifetime limits before the ACA. These stories are powerful  because these individuals are on the frontline, and health care is  essential to their quality of life, not just in America but in any  location on this globe.   There is enormous stress connected with a faulty health care system,  and what we have achieved with the Affordable Care Act is peace of mind  for millions of Americans--peace of mind that there will be the care in  place when they need it, that they will be able to afford it and they  won't be bankrupt, that their loved ones will be able to have their  health care challenges addressed.   Folks used to come to my townhalls and say: Senator, I am just trying  to stay alive till I reach 65 because I have a preexisting condition  and I can't get medical care. Can you imagine the stress involved with  that? Folks would say: I would love to get insurance and address the  health care issues I have, but I can't because I can't afford it. And  now they can afford it because of the subsidies provided through the  ACA.    There was a woman who came up to me at a multiple sclerosis  fundraising march and she said: Senator, things are so different this  year.   I said: What do you mean? What has changed?   She said: A year ago, in the MS community, if you got a diagnosis and  you didn't have insurance, you wouldn't be able to get insurance  because you had a preexisting condition.   She said: If you did have insurance, it is a mysterious and expensive  disease, and because of annual limits or lifetime limits, you would  probably run out of health care. Now we have the peace of mind to know  our loved ones will get the care they need.   That is what we are fighting for--to first do no harm and, second,  make life better for millions of Americans. Let's come together and  defend these massive advances that we have achieved over the last few  years and not destroy it with this reckless, irresponsible repeal-and- run strategy.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.
