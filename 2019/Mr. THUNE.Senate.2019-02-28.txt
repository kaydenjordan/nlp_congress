 Madam President, just in getting started this morning, I  wanted to take a minute to mention the good news on economic growth we  received this morning.   While headlines mentioned the very solid 2.9 percent growth number  for  [[Page S1558]]  2018, if we use the measure that economists prefer, the news is even  better--3.1 percent growth from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the  fourth quarter of 2018. This is just more evidence that Republican  economic policies are working.   We lifted burdensome regulations and passed a comprehensive reform of  our Tax Code to put more money in Americans' pockets and make it easier  for businesses to grow and expand jobs. Now we are seeing the effects.   Unemployment is low. January marked the 11th straight month that  unemployment has been at or below 4 percent. That is the longest streak  in nearly five decades. The number of job openings hit a record high in  December, and, once again, there were more job openings than job  seekers. Wage growth has accelerated. Wages have now been growing at a  rate of 3 percent or greater for 6 straight months. The last time wage  growth reached this level was in 2009. Median household income is at an  all-time, inflation-adjusted record of $61,372. The list goes on.   What does all of this mean? It means more money in American families'  bank accounts, more jobs and opportunities for American workers, more  Americans feeling hopeful about their future.   Republican economic policies are making life better for American  families, which is why it is particularly disturbing that Democrats are  currently advancing policies that would not only destroy the economic  progress we have made but would severely damage our economy for the  long term.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 604         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
