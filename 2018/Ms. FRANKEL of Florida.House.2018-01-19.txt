 Madam Speaker, I stand here to oppose this  deadly legislation being proposed by my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle.   When I was 15 years old--and that was in the days before abortion was  legal--I found a friend bleeding to death because of a back-alley  abortion. Those were the days that when a woman needed an abortion, she  would rely on coat hangers and poison.   This bill is going to take us back to those deadly days. Its aim is  to intimidate doctors and threaten their own freedom if they dare to  use their own medical judgment, with the consent of a patient, to  perform what is now a legal abortion.   Madam Speaker, I stand and I urge my colleagues to oppose this deadly  legislation.
