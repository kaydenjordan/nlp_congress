 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the Senate floor once again  this evening to talk about the brutal and illegal, unjustified invasion  of Ukraine by Russia and what we can do--what more we can do here in  this Chamber and this Congress to be able to help the people of  Ukraine.   This is the updated map that tells the story of what is going on on  the battlefield. You can see this light-blue color here indicates that  the Ukraine forces are on the move and making progress. But in the  meantime, Russia, back in 2014, took Crimea, part of the Donbas. Now  they have taken more of that territory.   So the fighting we will talk about tonight that is most fierce is  taking place here in the east and now increasingly here in the south.  This is where the battlefield is, but that is not the only place where  things are happening.   Remember, this is a country--Ukraine--that just wants to live in  peace with its neighbors. It has no interest in war. And this is  Russia's assault on that country, starting in 2014 and now in this  larger assault. But it is not just here on this battlefield. Russia is  actually sending missiles into the heart of Ukraine.   You see this town here, Vinnytsia. This is where, recently, a missile  exploded, killing civilians, children. Last week, I talked about Liza,  the young girl who was killed in that bombing. Everyplace in Ukraine is  subject to this kind of bombing. We have heard from Kharkiv. We have  seen it in Kyiv and other towns all throughout Ukraine.   Another part of this brutal assault on Ukraine has to do with  blocking the ports. Here is Odesa. This is the largest port. But there  are several ports along here that have been blocked by the Russians.  The Russian Navy is not allowing exports from Ukraine to be sent to the  rest of the world. This, of course, is hurting Ukraine's economy, which  is the whole idea. But it is also preventing the export of millions of  tons of grain, which is creating a global food crisis, threatening the  lives of millions of people around the world, particularly in Africa  where they rely heavily on Ukrainian grains coming out of these ports.   After weeks of discussions--really, the last couple of months-- finally, on Friday, Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the United Nations  agreed to facilitate the export of Ukrainian grain. According to the  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who has been working on this  for months, this provides a ``glimmer of hope'' in alleviating the  global food security crisis.   One part of the agreement that was reached in Turkey was that Russia  would not attack facilities in these Ukrainian cities. Specifically,  the agreement prohibited ``any attacks against merchant vehicles and  other civilian vessels and port facilities engaged in'' the export of  Ukrainian agricultural products. So there is an agreement to allow the  grain to go but also a specific agreement not to attack merchant  vessels, civilian vessels, port facilities that were involved in  export.   The ink was quite literally barely dry when Russia violated the terms  of that agreement. Within 24 hours, the Russians fired four missiles at  Ukraine's largest port, Odesa, which, again, is critical to exporting  the grain from Ukraine. By striking the port infrastructure, they  violated the agreement right after signing it.   Here is the port. You can see the damage that was caused. There were  actually four missiles fired from warships into Odesa. Two of them were  intercepted by anti-aircraft weaponry--thank God--but two destroyed  part of Odesa's port infrastructure, therefore violating the agreement.   I guess we all learned that Russia can't be trusted, so we shouldn't  be surprised. But violating its international obligations less than 24  hours after agreeing to them may be a new low.   Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's Ambassador to the United States, put it  well this weekend when she said:         We will do everything in order to perform and fulfill our       part of the deal. When Russia is violating it, they are       clearly showing who they are and that they need to be       stopped.    She went further and said:         Everything Russia is doing in Ukraine is a violation of       pretty much every international law. Attacking a sovereign       country . . . is a war crime.    She is right. Ambassador Bridget Brink, our Ambassador to Ukraine,  also criticized Russia for this brazen attack. She said:         The Kremlin continues to weaponize food. Russia must be       held accountable.    I talked before on this floor about this specific Russian attack on  the grain bins in Odesa and other port cities, where they literally  have targeted food that is supposed to go to starving people.   President Putin apparently believes that this global food and energy  security crisis--the two crises--are to his advantage. He is seeking to  pressure energy dependent Europeans and pressure countries which rely  on Ukrainian grain to join him in forcing Ukraine to surrender.   Fortunately, it is not working. Countries in the region, in fact, are  rallying around Ukraine more than ever. Why? Because they know they  could be next.   Vladimir Putin has said his ambition is to fully restore the borders  of the old Soviet Union or the Russian Empire. And in recent years, he  has learned the lesson that the West may not stand in his way.   A few global leaders, as an example, stood up to President Putin when  he invaded Georgia, a country that continues to be, in part, occupied  by the Russians. That was 2008. And not enough stood up to him in  Ukraine in 2014 when, as we saw in this previous map, Russia brazenly  invaded and took over Crimea and parts of the Donbas.   When it comes to 2022, it has been different so far. And we should  commend all those countries that have stood up and stood with us. We  now have a chance to actually stop this assault, to stop what Russia  has been doing, and to teach them a different lesson, to protect  Ukraine and other countries in the region that Russia may have set its  sights on.   The free world has rallied. Freedom-loving countries--almost 50--from  around the world have come to Ukraine's aid. Specifically, over 42 of  them have provided military assistance; others have provided  humanitarian aid by way of food and nutrition and economic health.   The weapons that have been provided have made it easier for Ukraine  to defend itself, to take out some of the  [[Page S3632]]  Russian artillery that was sitting back and firing on the Ukrainian  positions with immunity because it was so far back the Ukrainian  artillery couldn't reach it. The new weapons have been helpful in  dealing with that.   The U.S. has provided Ukraine with a specific weapon to help in that  regard called the High Mobility Artillery Systems, or HIMARS, and they  have been critical to the Ukrainian military as they hold off the  Russian invaders and allow the Ukrainian military to be on the  offensive in some of these areas.   A step in the right direction came last week. I commend the  administration for sending Ukraine four more HIMARS systems. They now  have 12 in operation and four more units on the way to the front lines.  That is good, but they need more. What the analysts suggest is they  need 40 or 50 just to be able to push the Russians back.   Officials in Ukraine have made the need for these systems clear, by  the way, for a long time--since early March. I have echoed that need  since that time. Why? Because I was hearing it directly from the  Ukrainians, from their military experts.   So it took us a while, but it turns out the Ukrainians were right;  these systems are effective. GEN Mark Milley, who is the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that the HIMARS strikes are  ``steadily degrading the Russian ability to supply their troops,  command and control their forces, and carry out their illegal war of  aggression.'' That is from General Milley.   The Ukrainians are an effective force when they are armed with the  right weapons. Officials have said that with the help of HIMARS,  Ukraine has taken out Russian command posts, ammunition depots, air  defense sites, radar and communications nodes, and long-range artillery  positions. These are all ``high value'' targets, and destroying them  has saved Ukrainian lives and saved some of the shelling of Ukrainian  cities.   There also seems to be some progress in sending Ukraine other tools  to help them fight, particularly in the air. The U.S. Air Force top  general hinted last week that Ukraine may get fourth-generation fighter  jets from the United States or from other allies, and he left open the  option to train Ukrainians on how to use them. These fourth-generation  fighter jets could include U.S. F-16s, the Gripen from Sweden, the  Rafale from France, and the Eurofighter from the European Union.   Some of Russia's most devastating strikes, of course, have come from  the air, either from aircraft or from missile strikes. Earlier in the  war, you remember, there were many who talked about creating a no-fly  zone in Ukraine. That never happened.   NATO was not willing to move forward with the no-fly zone. But by  providing Ukraine with advanced aircraft, we could empower Ukrainian  fighter pilots to impose their own no-fly zone over critical areas of  the country.   Two weeks ago, I sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin  and to General Milley urging them to expedite more military assistance  to Ukraine, including ``fourth-generation fighter aircraft and  necessary flight training.'' The reason we included that in our  bipartisan letter is because we had heard from Ukrainian fighter pilots  who came over here several weeks ago and met with us.   I am the cofounder and cochair of the Ukrainian Caucus. We put  together a meeting. It was very powerful to hear their words. But they  said they know how to fly these planes. And with regard to the details,  they could learn them quickly. And it would make a huge difference.   It has made a huge difference with what they have, which are aging  Soviet aircrafts, MiGs, and not enough of them. But we have got to move  quickly if we do this because we have to keep Russia from gaining more  ground. And we have to save more lives.   Training Ukrainian pilots on modern Western aircraft will take some  time; and, as we have seen, even a day delay can mean the difference  between life and death. So let's get started.   There is also the battle being waged on energy, and that is, in a  sense, just as important as what is happening on the battle front. Why?  Because Russia gets its funds from energy proceeds. That is what is  funding the war machine. And they continue to leverage Europe's  dependency on their oil and gas as a political and economic weapon.   This is plainly seen as President Putin continues to play games with  Europe's gas supply. Europe depends on Russia for, now, about 20  percent of its natural gas imports. That is down from around 40 percent  last year--so a significant reduction, reducing by half their  dependency.   But with regard to that 20 percent, President Putin is tightening his  grip and retaining his leverage on Europe by decreasing supplies, by  driving prices upward, and by lining his war chest even further. By the  way, his attempts to divide NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance,  have not worked. Over Russian objections, NATO will soon be expanding  rather than dividing or contracting.   Instead of splintering last Tuesday, I was proud to vote in committee  to advance the ratification of Finland and Sweden's NATO applications.   As Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said recently ``adding these  nations into the fold will only strengthen us.'' I agree.   Finland, by the way, has the European Union's longest border with  Russia. It has a very capable air force and other parts of its  military. In response to Russia's aggression, they have increased their  defense spending by 70 percent, and Sweden is targeting military  spending at the NATO commitment level of 2 percent GDP as soon as  possible and already possesses an innovative and effective defense  industry.   In fact, the Swedish weapons that are in the market today are some of  the most advanced in the world. Adding Finland and Sweden to NATO will  strengthen the alliance's security in the north, particularly the  Arctic region and the Baltic Sea.   I just learned a little while ago that we are going to vote on their  applications to join NATO here on the Senate floor this week or next  week. That is great news. I hope my colleagues will join me in a prompt  and strong showing of support, and I think they will.   This is going to be one of the things that brings this Congress  together, because this is in all of our interest--in NATO's interest,  in America's interest, and certainly in Ukraine's interest.   It is a clear demonstration to Ukraine that NATO's open-door policy  is alive and well and that the alliance will continue to welcome  applicant countries that meet the criteria for membership. I believe  NATO should begin that process with Ukraine, allowing them to enter the  next step of NATO membership by earning what is called the Membership  Action Plan, the MAP process. This plan provides a formal roadmap for  NATO membership that is long overdue, in my view.   We need to show Ukraine the world stands with them. And NATO is a  defensive alliance. NATO is about protecting countries in the region.   Last week, Congress had the privilege to hear from someone who knows  how critically important it is that we stand with Ukraine right now. We  heard from Olena Zelenska, President Zelenskyy's wife. She gave a very  powerful speech to the Congress about the horrors of the war and about  the desperate need for more advanced weapons from the United States and  allies.   She painted a vivid picture of life in Ukraine right now. Her moving  words about her own family and about the effects this traumatizing war  has etched in the memory of Ukraine's children I thought was  particularly poignant.   She said Ukraine needs weapons to wage a war, ``not [to be used to  wage a war] on somebody else's land, but to protect one's home and the  right to wake up alive in that home.''   ``To protect one's home and the right to wake up alive in that  home.'' That is what this is about.   In a TV interview during her visit here, Ms. Zelenska talked about  the trauma children have faced and said that she hopes their childhood  can be given back to them at some point. She said:         Before the war, my [nine-year-old] son used to go to folk       dance ensemble. He played piano. He learned English. He of       course attended sports club.    Now, she said:         The only thing he wants to do is martial arts and [learn]       how to use a rifle.    It is a 9-year-old boy.   At the Polish border and at the Moldovan border, I have had the  opportunity to visit with refugees as they have come across from  Ukraine. It is  [[Page S3633]]  all women and children, grandmothers, mothers, aunts--the men staying  behind to fight.   This war is taking away these kids' childhoods and replacing them  with war-torn memories. Those children who fled Ukraine in the early  stages of the war are now growing up, making friends, and going to  schools in foreign countries. Seven or 8 million Ukrainians left  Ukraine. They are far from home, and they want to go home.   And those who stayed in Ukraine are in constant fear that the next  Russian missile may hit their home, their town, their city. Many will  never have the opportunity to get their childhood back.   First lady Olena Zelenska has even started her own initiative to  address the serious mental health impacts of Russia's war against her  country. Although underreported in most media outlets, Russia has  forcibly deported millions of Ukrainians to Russia or Russian- controlled territory in the Donbas, including hundreds of thousands of  children.   Once outside of Ukrainian territory, these children are taught to be  Russian, not Ukrainian, in a deliberate attempt by Russia to wipe out  the national and cultural identity of Ukrainians.   Combined with Russia's consistent denial of the existence of  Ukraine's nationhood and identity, these actions must be acknowledged  for what they are: genocide. And it is important that the United States  and the rest of the world recognize these acts as such.   That is one reason why the world must call out Russia for what is  happening in Ukraine. Last Thursday, five Senate colleagues and I  joined Senator Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, on which I served, in introducing a bipartisan  resolution condemning Russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide.   I know ``genocide'' is a really powerful word. It has a long history,  and it has serious implications. Many people are understandably  hesitant to use it. But the facts in Russia's atrocities are clearly  genocide.   Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the  Crime of Genocide defines genocide as any of several acts ``committed  with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic,  racial, or religious group.''   Two of the acts in the definition are ``killing members of the  group'' and ``causing bodily or mental harm to members of the group.''  Only one of those criteria is necessary for genocide. Russia all too  clearly fits all of these parts of the definition of genocide.   Its forces have killed and wounded innocent civilians all across  Ukraine. Last week, I spoke about little Liza who was killed in  Vinnytsia. This is the aftermath of the bombing in Vinnytsia. I have  also heard about the ``target practice'' that Russian soldiers have  bragged about that they did in Severodonetsk, shooting at innocent  civilians like it was some kind of a game.   And we cannot forget the horrors of Bucha, where Russian forces  massacred over 1,300 innocent civilians, some with hands tied behind  their backs. This included 31 children. And the mental toll of this war  has, of course, also been extreme.   Our Senate resolution also includes a clause about my resolution from  2018 commemorating the 85th anniversary of Holodomor, the Soviet  Union's famine genocide against Ukraine from 1932 to 1933.  Unfortunately, Russia has a history of committing genocide against the  people of Ukraine, and that continues to this day.   The world needs to let the Russian commanders and the Kremlin  officials know we see the war crimes being committed, and they are  being recorded. Perhaps that would have some sort of effect on what  actions they take.   The trickle-down effects of this war are heart-wrenching. We have all  seen the images, the videos on social media of innocent civilians  caught in the crossfire. But not only that, it is what this war has  created: the countless children who are now orphans.   I have talked about this in the past, but according to Under  Secretary of State Victoria Nuland:         Russia makes orphans, and then steals those orphans, up to       1,000 Ukrainian kids being stolen and taken and given to       Russian families to potentially never be found by their       families.    That is very concerning. Let me say that again. She is saying that  Russia takes these orphans and steals them and gives them to Russian  families to potentially never be found by their Ukrainian families.   So there are all these young boys and young girls who watch their  fathers and their brothers and their uncles and, sometimes, their moms  go to war. Many of them never come back home.   There are young boys like Ms. Zelenska's, a 9-year-old, who now wants  to be a soldier. And there are the children who will never be with  their family in Ukraine again.   That is where we are today. A merciless authoritarian who needs to  flex his power against a nation that just wants to live peacefully-- nothing more than to live in peace with their neighbors.   This is a struggle between freedom and democracy and self- determination on the one hand and aggression and conquest and tyranny,  authoritarianism on the other.   Our choice is clear. At this critical juncture, let's continue to  work with our allies to provide Ukraine with what they need to protect  that homeland, to defend that democracy. We need to help Ukraine, and  we need to do more, and we need to do it now. We need to move quickly.  We need to live up to these important words from Ukraine's First Lady  last week. When she was here in the Congress talking to us, she said  ``While Russia kills, America saves.''   Let's continue to save. Let's continue to save lives every day, and  let's save our democratic ally Ukraine--a proud nation that is simply  fighting for its survival.   I yield the floor.
