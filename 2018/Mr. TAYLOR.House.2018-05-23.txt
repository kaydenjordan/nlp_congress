 Mr. Speaker, ``For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity  at  [[Page H4589]]  the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty.'' These are the  words that begin every Medal of Honor citation, our Nation's highest  and most prestigious military decoration.   They are uncommon but not as uncommon as the actions and sacrifice  detailed in the narrative summaries of those awards.   Of the estimated 50 million Americans who have worn a military  uniform, 3,440 have received the Medal of Honor.   The criteria for the award are profound, clear, and always deadly;  indeed, almost all recipients sacrificing their lives to earn them.   Their service is memorialized at military installations throughout  the world. You can read of their bravery on walls, monuments, and  headstones. Buildings, streets, ships, and forward-operating bases bear  their names in an attempt to honor, to inspire, and to remember.   If you wear a uniform, you walk in the dark shadows of heroes every  day.    Today, Mr. Speaker, there are 71 living recipients. Tomorrow, there  will be 72.   Mr. Speaker, in the early morning hours of March 4, 2002, a  helicopter attempted a landing on a mountain peak high in the Arma  Mountain range of southeastern Afghanistan.   The mission was reconnaissance. But, Mr. Speaker, war has no regard  for the plans of men. War is violent. War is chaotic. War is  unforgiving. And as the helicopter touched down, it was engulfed in a  hail of lead and rocket-propelled grenades.   The helicopter escaped, but one man remained: Chief Petty Officer  SEAL Neil Roberts. He was alone. He was isolated, and he was  surrounded.   In a letter to his family, Roberts would write, ``All the times spent  in the company of my teammates were when I felt closest to the men I  had the privilege to work with. I loved being a SEAL. If I die doing  something for the teams, then I died doing what made me happy. Very few  people have the luxury of that.''   Mr. Speaker, men and women join the military for many reasons, but  they do not join with a desire to die. There will always be moments of  uncertainty and fear and hesitation, moments when fear turns the  thoughts to your own safety, well-being, and survival.   Every service issues a uniform. None of them issue courage. In those  moments, where beliefs and resolve are tested, leadership illuminates  the path.   On March 4, 2002, Master Chief Special Warfare Operator SEAL Retired  Britt Slabinski chose to lead. He led his men back into the fight, into  overwhelming odds and superior enemy fire. There would be no element of  surprise. There would be no tactical advantage, and despite the odds  and despite the risk, he chose to lead.   They assaulted trenches and bunkers and hardened machine gun nests.  They took the fight to the enemy until it reached the brink of their  own destruction. They did not run. They did not hide. They fought.   Mr. Speaker, bravery is not motivated by fear, rage, hate, or the  desire for awards or recognition. Bravery is motivated by love: love  for an ideal, love for a country, and love for a teammate.   Bravery is not a certainty; it is a choice.   Master Chief Slabinski and his men chose to be brave. His actions,  his personal courage, and his leadership are an example, not just to  every sailor, soldier, marine, and airman, but to every American.   His citation has earned its place among the other heroes who have  received the Medal of Honor. Its ownership, its meaning, and its  promise belong not just on the walls of every military installation but  on the walls of every home in America.   Master Chief Slabinski's actions serve as a beacon, as a reminder of  who we can become, of what we can accomplish when we, instead of  running away, rise up and challenge our darkest fears, our worst  enemies, or overwhelming odds.   Mr. Speaker, long live the brotherhood.                            ____________________
