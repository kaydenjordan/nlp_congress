 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member of the  subcommittee, with whom I feel very privileged to work, for allowing me  this time. I rise tonight in opposition to this amendment.   Mr. Chair, first I want to say, I have the utmost respect for the  many sponsors of this amendment, and particularly Mr. Wittman and Mr.  Courtney. They have shown tremendous bipartisan support and leadership  in their tireless support of the Navy. They are excellent in their  roles on their committees, and I consider them both great colleagues  and friends.   However, this amendment is the wrong way to support our Navy. The  amendment would cut $1 billion in funding from a variety of extremely  important Navy and Air Force programs to fund advanced procurement for  two Virginia-class submarines.   While they have made an excellent case about how important  strategically those submarines are--and I agree with them on that--the  problem is that one of them will be the DDG 51 program, which is  supported at Bath Iron Works.   I am proud to be from Maine and to have Bath Iron Works and their  excellent workforce in my district. The men and women of Bath Iron  Works have been proving the adage ``Bath Built is Best Built'' for  decades, and I oppose any efforts to cut from the DDG 51 program.   My colleagues have said that this amendment is funded by potential  multiyear procurement savings in future years in the targeted the  programs and, therefore, we should take that funding from these  programs now. But the rationale ignores critical military and defense  needs and the budgets that have been agreed upon.   The amendment will abandon several agreed-upon key national defense  priorities, including increasing the ships in our Navy, a critical  priority. Ships that I am proud to say are being manufactured,  designed, and engineered by many hardworking men and women in my  district.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
