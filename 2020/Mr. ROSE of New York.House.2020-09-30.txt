 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  memory of Ms. Madeleine Brennan, a legend in Dyker Heights and a  testament to the idea that great schools begin with great leaders.   For 50 years, Madeleine served as the principal of Dyker Heights  Intermediate School, making her the longest serving principal in New  York City history and perhaps the entire country.   She loved her job so much that even when her pension and 401(k) meant  that she could make more money in retirement, she kept on working. That  passion inspired many of her students to not only become teachers  themselves, but to return to Dyker Heights Intermediate School to work  on her staff.   Ms. Brennan passed away this past April, but her legacy lives on in  the thousands of lives she influenced over the years. She will be  dearly missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Illinois for yielding her time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 5736, the  Transnational White Supremacist Review Act.   Today, our country faces a wide range of complex threats to our  safety, our security, and our way of life. Not only are American  families having to keep their communities safe and their economy  together in the face of COVID, but in large swaths of the country, they  are doing so while dealing with more frequent and catastrophic natural  disasters.   Sadly, though, amidst all of this, terrorism does not stop. The  homeland security threat posed by white supremacist extremists is  pervasive and persistent. Extremists exploit such crises as we are in  right now. Often, this involves the targeting of the most vulnerable in  society.   Earlier this year, the Directors of the FBI and the National  Counterterrorism Center testified before our committee regarding the  unrelenting nature of bad actors during times like these. Both  testified to the significant homeland security threat posed by racially  motivated domestic actors, primarily white supremacist extremists.   In my capacity as chair of the Intelligence and Counterterrorism  Subcommittee, I have joined with my colleagues to raise the alarm about  this threat. In carrying out my work on the committee, I have  identified a common theme. And that is, plain and simple, that this  white supremacist domestic terrorist problem is, in fact, not domestic  at all. It is global in nature.   Look no further than the deadly attacks in El Paso, Texas, and Poway,  California, last year. The U.S. experienced firsthand the ramifications  of an international white supremacist movement when two domestic actors  independently drew inspiration from the foreign terrorists who  committed the Christchurch, New Zealand, attack.   Troublingly, there are reports that white supremacist groups have  adapted recruitment tactics and begun using training camps modeled  after jihadist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS.   Just last week, a former Trump administration counterterrorism  official confirmed that training by foreign groups is happening when  she acknowledged that there have been instances when our foreign  counterterrorism partners have alerted us to the fact that U.S.  citizens were in their countries to conduct trainings or participate in  trainings with white supremacist movements.   These foreign partners told this former official that the U.S. is an  exporter of this ideology and must address this problem.   This is exactly what this bill today seeks to address, a bill  designed to send a message to our foreign partners that Congress hears  them and is taking action.   This bill would require DHS to produce and circulate a threat  assessment on foreign violent white supremacist extremist groups to  local law enforcement. It would also push social media companies to do  so much more in addressing this threat. Crucially, this bill includes  civil rights and civil liberty safeguards as well.   Countering white supremacy will require a whole-of-society approach,  education, awareness, and so on.   Through our work on this committee, we found that Americans stay  safest when law enforcement at all levels is equipped with the best  available information. This bill makes sure that our frontline  responders in the law enforcement community have just that.   It is endorsed by the ADL, an expert advocacy group that has tracked  the white supremacist threat for decades. It is also endorsed by the  Blue Dog Coalition, a group that looks past partisanship and advocates  for commonsense national security solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on its passage.
