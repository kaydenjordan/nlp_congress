As a  crossroads of America, our rail industry is one of the busiest in the  Nation and contributes to our thriving economy and business  development.   I am proud to support policies that increase the safety and  efficiency of infrastructure in Indiana and the rest of our great  Nation.   We must support our country's railroads so that we can keep America's  economy rolling.
