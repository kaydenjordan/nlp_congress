 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Stuarts Draft  High School cheerleading squad.   After COVID-19 shrank the number of teams that could make it to State  tournament last spring, the Cougars fell just 2 points shy of  qualifying for the 2020 competition.   Coming off of this defeat and facing the loss of nine seniors, the  team was determined to redeem themselves in the 2021 season. After much  hard work and determination, their efforts paid off, winning this  year's Class 2 State championship.   The Cougars dominated the competition earning a score of 257.5 points  with their closest competition trailing by 35 points. With this victory  in the books, Stuarts Draft Cheer has now claimed the State title in 4  of the past 5 years--highlighting just how talented this team is.   Following the win, cocaptain Kay-Lee Freeman said:         To not even make it last year then come back to win, I just       feel so redeemed. People said there was no way we were ever       going to rebuild, but look at us now.    Congratulations again to the Stuarts Draft Cougars on this  accomplishment. It is well-deserved.                            ____________________
