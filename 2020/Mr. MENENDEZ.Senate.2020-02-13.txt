 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 3 minutes in debate.    Madam President, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res.  68. Senator Kaine, a distinguished member of the Foreign Relations  Committee, has done an extraordinary job here in riveting our attention  to a congressional responsibility that is paramount. It calls for the  removal of U.S. troops from hostilities against Iran that Congress has  not authorized.   One of the most consequential decisions we make as Members of  Congress--I have been called on on more than one occasion between the  House and the Senate--is whether to send our sons and daughters into  battle. It is a decision that is about life and death and national  security. The Constitution delegated that power to only one institution  of the entire Federal Government--the Congress of the United States--to  declare war, because of the severity of the consequences of the  decision. It is up to the Congress to ensure that the executive branch,  whoever sits there at any given time, utilizes all the tools of  diplomacy it has to keep Americans safe and that there is an effective  check on executive power before we send our children off to war.   I stand in strong support of the resolution. This body must assert  its congressional privilege.   Of course, the President has the right to take action to defend  against imminent threats to the homeland and to Americans abroad. No  one disputes that. Senator Kaine doesn't dispute that. None of us do.  But the President does not have the authority to engage in any military  action he likes.   We have been hearing from this administration that there is a  redline--Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I agree. But if, at the end  of the day, that means that to enforce your redline, you are going to  take America to war, then you must come to the Congress of the United  States and seek that authorization for war.   What I hear from the administration: Oh, no, we have article II  powers. Oh, no, the 2002 resolution--which had nothing to do with Iran.  Never envisioned. It is so tortured to suggest that is authorization  for us. Can we sit back and contemplate that possibility? We cannot. We  cannot.   So as someone who voted against the war in Iraq and served in  Congress during the debate on whether to authorize military action, I  can assure you that the 2002 resolution--that was not its intention,  and it doesn't comport with the history, the use, or the plain reading  of the text.   I am gravely concerned about the administration's efforts to build a  shaky legal foundation for the explicit purpose of carrying us into  ever-longer wars, including potentially against Iran.   Before we vote to ultimately decide that, it should be the Congress  of the United States that should make that decision on behalf of the  American people, looking our sons and daughters in the eyes and saying,  yes, this is worthy of the national security of the United States.   I will vote to send my son and daughter if the cause is right, but if  the cause is not right, I will not vote to send my son and daughter or  anyone else's sons and daughters. That is the debate that should be had  here. That is what Senator Kaine is trying to do with this resolution.  I am concerned that some of the amendments being offered are simply to  undermine that.   I look forward to joining with Senator Kaine to pass that resolution,  as well as oppose some of the amendments.   I will submit a longer statement for the Record on this resolution,  S.J. Res. 68, and the War Powers Resolution more broadly when we return  on Monday, February 24. I urge my colleagues to read that statement.   With that, I yield back.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1301     Mr. President, I rise to express strong concern about  the situation in South Sudan and to call on the administration to step  up its diplomatic efforts to avert a return to conflict and help  achieve a lasting peace. For 6 years, the people of South Sudan have  suffered the effects of a brutal civil war. International efforts to  find a diplomatic solution have failed, and the humanitarian situation  in South Sudan remains one of the worst in the world.   In September 2018, President Salva Kiir and his main political  opponent,  [[Page S1069]]  former Vice President Riek Machar, agreed to form a unity government in  the capital, Juba, by March of 2019. Though this so called  ``revitalized agreement'' is not perfect, it is what we have to work  with. The ceasefire between Kiir and Machar that was part of it has  largely held, sparing the South Sudanese from the violence and  brutality so many experienced at the height of the civil war. I am also  encouraged that the government and political opposition groups that had  refused to sign the 2018 revitalized peace deal reached an accord last  month.   However, two successive delays in the establishment of the unity  government have made me skeptical about the chances that the latest  deadline, February 22, will be met. While both parties have stated  their commitment to it, they have yet to effectively address two  fundamental sticking points: the boundaries of South Sudan's states,  and the formation of an inclusive national army. Absent an agreement on  these two issues, lasting peace may prove elusive.   At the end of the day, Kiir, Machar, and others who claim to  represent the South Sudanese people are responsible for peace in their  country. However, given our historical role in South Sudan, the United  States has a significant role to play. I would like to remind my  colleagues that the United States was heavily involved in brokering the  2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement which helped create the conditions  for South Sudan's independence. Since independence, the United States  has provided nearly $3.8 billion in emergency humanitarian assistance  since the outbreak of civil war. We have supported the UN peacekeeping  force in South Sudan, UNMISS, which is protecting 200,000 civilians  sheltering in or near its bases, investing more than $342 million last  fiscal year. These dollars are and have contributed to keeping  thousands of people alive. But the South Sudanese deserve more than  mere life support. They deserve to live in peace. We have influence  with all of the key actors in the region, yet the administration has  failed to use it. The administration must effectively use its influence  to help the millions of South Sudanese who aspired to liberty but found  misery instead.   Previous administrations made South Sudan a priority in their foreign  policy. The Bush administration helped negotiate the aforementioned  Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The Obama administration help shepherd  the country to independence and remained actively engaged as the  security and humanitarian situation devolved.   At his confirmation hearing, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa  Tibor Nagy promised that under his leadership, ``The South Sudanese  will realize just how involved the United States is.''   However, administration engagement has been weak and inconsistent,  and it is not guided by a clearly articulated strategy. In May 2018,  the White House announced it was conducting a review of our assistance  programs to South Sudan. In a statement, it expressed frustration that,  ``the leaders of this country have squandered this partnership,  pilfered the wealth of South Sudan, killed their own people, and  repeatedly demonstrated their inability and unwillingness to live up to  their commitments to end the country's civil war''--a bold statement  but it has been more than a year and a half since the review was  announced, and it remains incomplete. Since that time, what has the  administration done? Well, 3 years into the administration, it has  finally designated a special envoy, something for which I have been  advocating for years, but the envoy will not answer directly to the  President or the Secretary of State, which I fear may limit his stature  and, therefore, his effectiveness.   Additionally, the administration has imposed targeted sanctions. Last  year, the Treasury Department sanctioned two Cabinet ministers, Elia  Lomuro and Kuol Manyang Juuk. Last month, they also sanctioned South  Sudan's First Vice President Taban Deng Gai. Deng is credibly accused  of influencing the government to execute to dissidents; he should be  sanctioned for human rights abuses. But, as I have said many times  before, sanctions are not a strategy. Sanctions are a tool to be used  selectively to apply pressure towards a specific political goal. In  this case, support for a comprehensive and durable peace agreement.   Last month, a year and a half since his confirmation, Ambassador Nagy  visited Juba. While I applaud Ambassador Nagy's trip--I believe that  the U.S. should be increasing its diplomatic engagement--one visit does  not a policy make. It is unclear what the trip was meant to accomplish  in the absence of a comprehensive strategy.   At this critical juncture, I am still hard pressed to understand the  administration's approach towards South Sudan, and I am worried that we  do not have a plan of action should this latest deadline not be met.  Time is of the essence; I urge the administration to take several  actions.   First, ensure that Special Envoy Symington has the appropriate staff  and resources to effectively undertake his responsibilities. The  administration has moved from no envoys for Sudan and South Sudan to  two envoys. While the challenges in the two countries are different,  the fates of the two countries remain intertwined. Coordination is  critical, as is support for both of their offices.   Second, we must have a sound strategy for supporting a viable peace  agreement. I call upon Special Envoy Symington to take immediate steps  to develop an interagency strategy, in consultation with our  Ambassadors in the region, aimed at uniting the region to apply  pressure to the parties to address outstanding obstacles to the  formation of a unity government. In the short term, the strategy should  focus on developing benchmarks and milestones towards formation of a  unity government, and steps--to include punitive measures--the United  States will take to encourage regional partners to apply consistent  pressure on the parties to the conflict to move towards peace. Longer  term, it should lead towards supporting conditions that support a  sustainable peace and credible elections. The strategy should also  include actions to support grassroots reconciliation and restorative  justice, as well as accountability for war crimes and human rights  abuses.   Finally, the administration must conclude its review of assistance to  South Sudan and be transparent to the South Sudanese, members of the  diplomatic community, and the American people about exactly what the  next steps will be relative to its findings and how those steps fit  into a broader strategy. Whatever these steps are, they should be aimed  towards cementing peace, and continuing strong support for development  and humanitarian assistance to the people of South Sudan.   If past is prologue, South Sudan's leaders may well once again fail  their people. The stakes for the formation of a unity government--one  that can implement a durable peace--are perilously high. If the current  negotiations collapse, millions will suffer. We must do all we can to  ensure that the South Sudanese are able to move forward with this  agreement, flawed though it may well be, and we must be prepared to  help it succeed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and  congratulate Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ on the  150th anniversary of its founding.   On February 15, 1870, Stevens Institute of Technology was founded as  the first college of mechanical engineering in the United States, with  a bequest from Edwin A.
