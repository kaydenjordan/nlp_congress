 The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Intelligence  Committee voted Gina Haspel's nomination out favorably by a vote of 10  to 5. It was a strong bipartisan vote. Of course, in just a few  minutes, we will vote on her confirmation.   Last week, during her confirmation hearing, she said repeatedly what  those of us who had supported her for weeks already knew: She believes  that U.S. Government actions must be held to a strict moral standard.  If confirmed, she would not obey an order she believed to be unlawful,  and in her new role, she pledged not to restart the interrogation  programs inside the CIA. Of course, that could not happen without  consultation and approval of Congress because the standard has  literally changed since the immediate post-9/11 era.   Based on her testimony, her record of service, and her exemplary  character, it is clear that the only real option for the Intelligence  Committee was to report her out favorably.   Our colleagues on the other side who have objected to this nomination  have an opportunity to join a couple of their Members who have already  come on over and acknowledged that she is the best qualified nominee in  the Agency's history.   Our colleague, the senior Senator from Virginia and vice chairman of  the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Warner, voted yesterday on Ms. Haspel's  behalf. He praised her as an independent voice and found it noteworthy  that she would be the first operations officer in more than five  decades to lead the Agency.   Generally speaking, you have analysts and you have the case officers  who actually handle the cases and do the important intelligence- gathering work from a human intelligence perspective at the Agency, and  that is the work she has been involved in for more than 30 years. She  would be the first officer in more than five decades to have that sort  of experience and the credibility that goes along with it.   The senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, is joined by the senior  Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin, who also sits on the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as the junior Senator from  North Dakota and others. In other words, there are a number of  Democrats now who have decided that it is not in the Nation's best  interest to oppose President Trump's nominees just because they happen  to be President Trump's nominees.   Now I want to talk about some of the stated objections and why I  don't believe they hold any water, but I am glad for this movement in  the right direction, which will allow us to confirm her today.   I appreciate all of our colleagues carefully examining Ms. Haspel's  records. A number of people I have talked to about the nomination said  they wanted to do their due diligence. Well, that is our job, and I  don't believe any nominee should be rubberstamped. I know they have  reviewed her record, and they have met  [[Page S2759]]  with her in person and drawn the only reasonable conclusion, I believe,  which is that she is well qualified; that she loves the CIA, where she  has worked for more than three decades; and that she will provide the  Agency's objective, unbiased, and unvarnished intelligence to the  President and other policymakers in the Federal Government.   Her loyalty, of course, is not to a political party, after all,  because she is nonpartisan, but she owes her loyalty to the American  people, whose safety and security she has made her life's work.   Comparisons have rightfully been drawn between the upcoming  confirmation vote for Ms. Haspel and the 2013 confirmation vote of John  Brennan, former Director of the CIA under President Obama. The vast  majority of Democrats had no problem voting for Mr. Brennan, and so I  believe they should have no problem voting for Ms. Haspel because,  first of all, Mr. Brennan supports her. Of course, he was the No. 4  person at the CIA during this period post-9/11 when the rendition,  detention, and interrogation programs were carried out in full  compliance with then-stated law from the highest legal authority  available, the Office of Legal Counsel. We have also seen others in the  Obama administration support Ms. Haspel as well.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: Those people who know  Ms. Haspel best, who have worked alongside of her on a daily basis in  undisclosed locations around the world, doing the Nation's important  work, like this woman, admire her, respect her, and think she is the  best of the best.   I speak for many when I say that we appreciate Ms. Haspel's  willingness and desire to serve in this new and never-easy capacity. I  hope we can confirm her in short order so she can get back to work and  continue to do the work that she loves and that our Nation needs.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on the Haspel nomination  occur at this time; further, that if cloture is invoked, all  postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate immediately vote on the  nomination; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Indiana (Mr.  Young).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Young)  would have voted ``yea.''    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).   The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 101 Ex.]                                  YEAS--54       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Donnelly      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heitkamp      Heller      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Manchin      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Nelson      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shaheen      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Warner      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--45       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Flake      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Jones      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Paul      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--1               McCain           The nomination was confirmed.
