 Mr. Speaker, today's debate on H.R. 3905, Minnesota's  Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest Act, also known as the  MINER Act, is not just important to the great State of Minnesota: this  legislation is critically important to the United States.   The MINER Act will reverse the misguided last minute actions of the  Obama administration to stop any exploration of one of the most  valuable precious metal deposits in the world. The MINER Act will  ensure that the people of Minnesota will have the opportunity for jobs  and economic prosperity that would come if the deposit can ever be  mined in an environmentally safe and responsible manner.   The MINER Act will renew the Federal Government's commitment and  promise to the citizens of Minnesota. When the Superior National Forest  was created in 1909, and later when the Boundary Waters Canoe Area was  established in 1978, there was an express agreement between the Federal  Government and the State of Minnesota that mining and logging could  continue in the Superior National Forest.                                time  1330    In fact, according to the most recent Superior National Forest Land  and Resource Management Plan, mining and logging are considered  desirable conditions in the forest.   This is about more than 10,000 jobs, which are now at risk because of  the lameduck actions of the Obama administration. This is about  billions of dollars in revenue for Minnesota's economy and billions  more in potential education funding for Minnesota's schools that are  now on the line.   This is also about strategically important metals and minerals, which  are used by Americans every day. The MINER Act, again, is about  protecting Minnesota's right to explore and, if environmentally  appropriate, to mine valuable precious metals--precious metals that are  not only necessary to our everyday technology, but which are critically  important to our Nation's national defense.   There are some who would like to deny Minnesota the right to explore  and potentially mine these precious metals. They argue that any mining  activity could negatively impact our beloved Boundary Waters Canoe Area  Wilderness. This concern, however, ignores the fact that if a mine is  ever proposed--and one has not, but if one is ever proposed--in the  Superior National Forest, it would have to satisfy all current local,  State, and Federal environmental review and permitting requirements  before it could ever be approved to proceed.   We can and we will protect the Boundary Waters. I have no doubt we  could find a way to preserve Minnesota's pristine landscape without  permanently destroying any future job creation or economic development  in Minnesota.   By passing the MINER Act today, we protect thousands of jobs and  billions of dollars in revenue and education funding while leaving an  extensive process intact to protect and preserve the environment and  our State.   In conclusion, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the MINER  Act, because we know that someday someone might find a way to mine  these important precious metals in a safe and environmentally  responsible way. And if that happens, Minnesota deserves the  opportunity and the jobs and economic prosperity that will ensue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the underlying  bill.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Minnesota Governor  Mark Dayton in opposition to H.R. 3905.                                                 State of Minnesota,                                  Office of Governor Mark Dayton,                                  Saint Paul, MN, November 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: I write in strong opposition to HR3905,       which I understand has passed out of Committee and is being       reviewed by House Majority Leadership for a floor vote. I       implore you not to schedule a vote on this bill without a       full vetting of the serious risks to the Boundary Waters       Canoe Area Wilderness from adjacent copper-nickel mining, the       status of the two-year federal study currently underway, and       the wishes of the majority of Minnesotans, who oppose copper-      nickel mining in the immediate vicinity of the Boundary       Waters.        HR3905 is a bill, ``To require congressional approval of       any mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving the       National Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota, to       provide for the renewal of certain mineral leases in such       lands, and for other purposes.'' HR3905 was introduced in       response to the desires of a foreign mining company to use       Congress to circumvent the deliberations of the U.S.       Departments of Interior and Agriculture and their agencies,       the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest       Service (USFS), to determine whether copper-nickel mining can       be conducted safely in this ecologically sensitive part of       Minnesota.        The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BCWAW) is       America's most popular national Wilderness Area, drawing       visitors from all over the world to Northeastern Minnesota to       fish, hunt, and experience its interconnected pristine lakes,       rivers and streams. Additionally, the BWCAW contributes       enormously to Minnesota's social and economic well-being.        In January, 2017, the BLM and the USFS began a       comprehensive two-year study to determine whether copper-      nickel mining, with its toxic by-product, sulfide ore, is       appropriate within the watershed and immediate vicinity of       the BWCA. Specifically, this environmental review will       determine whether the Superior National Forest lands next to       the BWCAW should be removed from the federal mining program       to protect the Wilderness from pollution and other       environmental degradation caused by the resulting sulfide       ore. The study considers a wide variety of factors, including       scientific evidence, public input, economic considerations,       ecological characteristics, and recreational value, among       others.        I respectfully ask that you allow the completion of this       important review process. Over 126,000 Americans have       submitted public comments as part of it. Many attended three       public meetings conducted earlier this year by the BLM and       USFS. Moving HR3905 forward at this time would disregard the       input of all Americans, who have participated in the process,       as well as the views of the 79 percent of Minnesotans, who       favor the two-year pause and environmental review of       potential impacts to the BWCAW.        The BWCAW is crucially important to our state, and I       believe strongly that future federal and state decisions       about its future should be made only after the most careful       and objective scientific review. I urge you to reject the       attempts by a foreign mining corporation to short-circuit the       review process underway, and to affirm the importance of a       careful, objective analysis under the existing federal legal       framework.        Continuing this review process is the best way to allow for       well-informed federal and state decisions, which will affect       many future generations of Americans. Industry should not       dictate the stewardship of taxpayer-owned public lands, nor       use Congress to short-circuit sound decision-making--      especially regarding pristine Wilderness Areas like the       BWCAW.            Sincerely,                                                       Mark Dayton,                                                          Governor.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter from  the Sportsmen for the Boundary Waters in opposition to the bill; a  letter from the National Parks Conservation Association; and a letter  from the Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin Lakes and Pines in  opposition to this bill.                              Sportsmen for the Boundary Waters,                                         Ely, MN, November 29, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters, we urge  [[Page H9485]]       you to OPPOSE H.R. 3905, the so-called ``Minnesota's Economic       Rights in the Superior National Forest Act'' when it is       considered on the House floor.        Simply put, H.R. 3905 is a bill to allow sulfide-ore mining       at the edge of the Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness       (BWCAW), directly threatening one of America's most       accessible and most-visited wilderness areas. At 1.1 million       acres in size, the BWCAW is the largest wilderness east of       the Rockies and north of the Everglades. This interconnected       system of lakes, rivers, and streams provides unparalleled       opportunities for solitude, recreation, hunting and fishing.       The connections between Northern Minnesota's national       forests, Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness, Voyageurs       National Park, and Quetico Provincial Park makes this entire       trans boundary area extremely susceptible to the threat of       pollution from sulfide-ore mining, one of the most toxic       industries in America, according to the EPA.        H.R. 3905 would require congressional approval of any       mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving National       Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota and would       provide for the perpetual renewal of federal mineral leases       in Minnesota, including two that were denied by the Forest       Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The bill       undermines the Antiquities Act, National Environmental Policy       Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Boundary Waters       Wilderness Act, and other laws regulating mineral leasing in       Minnesota's national forests.        Contrary to the bill's title, H.R. 3905 would do more harm       than good for the economy of Northern Minnesota. Economic       analysis by Key-Log Economics LLC shows that sulfide-ore       mining on Superior National Forest lands in the watershed of       the Boundary Waters could lead to the loss of nearly 5,000       jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 22,000 jobs in the rest of the       economy, a $1.6 billion loss in annual income, and a $500       million reduction in private property values.        Specifically, we urge opposition to this bill because it       would:        Renew two expired and undeveloped mineral leases on       Superior National Forest lands next to the Boundary Waters       and along lakes and rivers that flow directly into the       Wilderness, advancing a foreign mining company's interests at       the expense of beloved American public lands.        Void the December 2016 record of decision by the Forest       Service withholding its consent to two mineral lease renewal       requests in the Superior National Forest due to the       unacceptable risks to this watershed, which according to the       Forest Service holds 20 percent of the National Forest       System's fresh water supply.        Undermine the National Environmental Policy Act by limiting       review of these two mineral leases to a 30-day environmental       assessment. Contrary to the bill language, there is no       `pending EA.' However, this section would override the       ongoing two-year Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)       initiated by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management       to carefully consider the potential impacts of sulfide-ore       mining on the Boundary Waters watershed. The ongoing EIS is       strongly supported by Minnesota's Governor Dayton and by the       citizens of Minnesota. More than 79% of Minnesota voters       support the study, while more than 126,000 citizens submitted       comments during the scoping phase.        Amend the 1906 Antiquities Act by mandating Congressional       approval for any national monument designations in       Minnesota's national forests. The Antiquities Act is a       bipartisan conservation law, which has been used by       Presidents of both parties, to protect irreplaceable federal       lands from potential threats. Monument designation under the       Antiquities Act have provided protections for areas including       the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and Olympic       National Parks. Quite simply, this attack on the Antiquities       Act is an attack against our national parks and monuments.        Amend the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act       (FLPMA) by mandating Congressional approval for mineral       withdrawals in Minnesota's national forests. Additionally,       FLPMA intentionally left intact the presidential power to       protect public lands as monuments.        Bar the Forest Service from complying with its legal       obligations under the 1978 Boundary Waters Wilderness Act. In       this Act Congress requires the Forest Service to maintain the       high-water quality of the Boundary Waters and a Mining       Protection Area within the Superior National Forest. The       Forest Service concluded that sulfide-ore mining near the       Boundary Waters would be ``contrary to Congress'       determination that it is necessary to `protect the special       qualities of the [BWCAW] as a natural forest-lakeland       wilderness ecosystem of major esthetic, scientific,       recreational and educational value to the Nation.' ''        Make all mineral leases on Minnesota's national forests       essentially perpetual. The `perpetual' nature of these leases       is material change in long-standing mineral leasing law and       policy. The bill would also override the two laws (1946 and       1950) on mineral leasing in Minnesota's national forests that       require Forest Service consent to any mining.        Ignore the request of the International Joint Commission       that environmental review of impacts on trans boundary water       quality and cumulative effects be studied and the requests of       four tribal entities (the area is Ceded Territory).        Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to       adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,       Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's public lands,       and bedrock environmental laws like the Antiquities Act and       the National Environmental Policy Act, we urge you to OPPOSE       H.R. 3905.            Sincerely,          Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, National Wildlife             Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation             Partnership, Fly Fishers International, Minnesota             Division Izaak Walton League of America, American Fly             Fishing Trade Association, Pope and Young Club,             keepitpublic.org.                                   ____                                                      National Parks                                        Conservation Association,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.      Oppose H.R. 3905: Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior           National Forest Act.         Dear Representative: Since 1919, the National Parks       Conservation Association (NPCA) has been the leading voice of       the American people in protecting and enhancing our National       Park System. On behalf of our more than 1.3 million members       and supporters nationwide, I urge you to oppose H.R. 3905:       Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest       Act when it is reviewed at a markup by the Natural Resources       Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday, November 7th and 8th.        NPCA strongly opposes this legislation as it undermines two       decisions made by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of       Land Management (BLM) regarding harmful sulfide-ore copper       mining within the watershed of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area       Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park. The legislation also       carves out a special exception for Minnesota from protective       provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act       (FLPMA) and the Antiquities Act.        H.R. 3905 threatens the decision-making process already set       in motion by the Forest Service to consider a twenty-year       mineral withdrawal within the Superior National Forest in the       Rainy River watershed. These public lands lie upstream of two       prized and federally-protected areas, the Boundary Waters       Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park. Both areas are easily       threatened by pollutants from mining activities in this       watershed given the exclusive drainage into their waters.       Tens of thousands of people have already submitted comments       on this matter and over 2,000 have participated in agency-      sponsored listening sessions. This legislation could erase       the remarkable outpouring of public support for clean water       and public lands, and set a precedent for legislating a       decision that could counter what our federal agencies and       public want.        The legislation also threatens the BLM's decision, with       advice from the Forest Service, not to renew two mineral       leases on the edge of the Boundary Waters Wilderness held by       Twin Metals Minnesota. Although the language of the       legislation is unclear, it is possible its intent is to       restrain Forest Service and BLM discretion on lease renewals       while reinstating the Twin Metals leases. Congress has       granted discretion to the Forest Service and BLM to assess       the circumstances and surrounding environment of any mineral       lease application, including applications for lease renewals.       Based on this discretion, both agencies have determined that       this region is too vulnerable for this type of risky mining,       a type of mining never before allowed in Minnesota. Twin       Metals would operate in the northeastern part of the state       upstream of the Boundary Waters Wilderness that hosts some of       cleanest water in America, and Voyageurs National Park, which       encompasses over 84,000 acres of water relied upon by many       native species.        NPCA also strongly objects to carving out a special       exception for Minnesota from the protective provisions of the       Antiquities Act and FLPMA. The Antiquities Act allows the       president to establish national monuments on federal lands       already owned by all Americans. Nearly every president since       1906 (eight republicans and eight democrats) has used the       Antiquities Act as a bipartisan conservation tool to protect       our nation's history and culture. The bill would eliminate       this authority on federal lands in Minnesota, making it only       the second state declared off-limits for national monuments       declared by presidential proclamation. To carve out       exceptions from this law is nothing short of a betrayal to       the American people and the land and history we've spent       generations protecting.        FLPMA establishes the authority of the Secretary of the       Interior to withdraw land from leasing for up to twenty       years. Any final Forest Service and BLM decision to move       forward with a twenty-year mineral withdrawal would be based       on a thorough, science-based process through the National       Environmental Policy Act. H.R. 3905 would eliminate this       authority solely for Minnesota, alone among the fifty states,       and undermine the ability of the agencies to do their job, as       appointed by Congress.        Thank you for considering our views on this important       legislation. Please reject H.R. 3905 during this week's       markup.            Sincerely,                                                     Ani Kame'enui,                                  Director, Legislation and Policy.  [[Page H9486]]                                          ____          Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin Lakes and Pines,                                                 November 26, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: I am writing to request you vote       no on HR 3905, which is a bill that would stop a 2-year       Forest Service study of environmental, economic, and social       risks to the Boundary Waters from sulfide-ore copper mining       on Superior National Forest lands in the headwaters of the       Boundary Waters Canoe Area.        For over fifty years, Northern Lakes Canoe Base has offered       wilderness canoe trips in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area       Wilderness (BWCAW). I guided Girl Scout canoe trips for five       years and have directed our wilderness program for 7 years       and am writing this letter to describe the strengths of this       program to you and to underscore the fact that this one-of-a-      kind program cannot exist anywhere other than the Boundary       Waters.        Girls who come on our canoe trips may have had basic       camping and canoeing experiences, but few have experience in       wilderness travel. We typically serve 150-200 girls a summer.        In general, girls travel in wilderness areas less than       boys. Even in 2017, girls are taught to think that the       outdoors is no place for a girl because it is hard work,       dirty, and going to the mall is just much easier. We teach       teenage girls, in a girl-only environment, that their       individual strength and the power of teamwork is far greater       than they ever imagined. They also learn that hard-work and       dirt is part of the fun on a Boundary Waters canoe trip, and       they leave with an appreciation for the beauty of wilderness       and an understanding of the challenges they now know they can       overcome. Girl Scout wilderness canoe trips bring out the       best in teenage girls; we see how creative, hardworking, and       kind they can be to each other. It doesn't take much       imagination to believe that these traits will follow them       back to their everyday life.        We are a high quality, affordable program and pride       ourselves in our thriftiness. We use our canoes for 20+       seasons and packs and paddles summer after summer. We do this       so we can serve girls from all economic backgrounds,       including local iron range and Native American communities.        For years we have received feedback from participants       crediting their Boundary Waters experience for continued,       life-long growth. Our program cannot exist somewhere other       than the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. No other       place on earth offers the perfect combination of       accessibility and high adventure that the BWCAW offers. Many       of our participants drive to Ely from Chicago, Milwaukee, and       Minneapolis. Many others fly to Minneapolis and then rent a       car to get to Ely. Unlike many other wilderness areas which       may be high on a mountain range or only accessible by high-      clearance vehicles, it is easy for a mom or dad to drive a       van full of girls to the Boundary Waters, send them on a       trip, and then pick them up a week later.        The Boundary Waters is also unique in that, unlike many       other wilderness areas, visitors don't require any previous       experience or training to have a safe, adventurous trip.       Anyone seeking adventure and challenge belongs on a canoe       trip, not just body builders and endurance athletes. We have       even seen that a Girl Scout canoe trip sometimes inspires       girls who may be uninterested in athletics or leadership to       seek out her own creative ways to be active and healthy,       leading to improved confidence and greater aspirations.       Again, it doesn't take much imagination to conclude that       girls who experience wilderness travel will go on to make the       world a better place.        Girl Scouts canoe trip participants always remark that the       solitude they find in the Boundary Waters is unlike any they       have found elsewhere, whether at their own Girl Scout       resident camp or a state or national park. The quiet       environment of a protected wilderness area gives them an       opportunity to reflect on their life in a way that they could       not in a non-wilderness setting. Girl Scouts end their canoe       trip with a swagger to their step, ready to take on any       challenge that comes their way.        Thank you for doing your part to preserve the Boundary       Waters Canoe Area Wilderness by voting no on HR 3905. It       means a lot to all of us in Ely whose programs and businesses       are focused around wilderness travel.            Sincerely,                                                    Ann McNally,                                           Northern Lakes Canoe Base                                     Summer Program Director/Guide.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, today's debate on H.R. 3905, Minnesota's Economic Rights  in the Superior National Forest Act, also known as the MINER Act, is  not just important to the great State of Minnesota. This legislation is  critically important to the United States.   The MINER Act will reverse the misguided, last-minute actions of the  Obama administration to stop any exploration of one of the most  valuable precious metal deposits in the world.   The MINER Act will ensure that the people of Minnesota have the  opportunity for jobs and economic prosperity that would come if the  deposit can ever be mined in an environmentally safe and responsible  manner.   The MINER Act will renew the Federal Government's commitment and  promise to the citizens of Minnesota. When the Superior National Forest  was created in 1909 and, later, when the Boundary Waters Canoe Area was  established in 1978, there was an express agreement between the Federal  Government and the State of Minnesota that mining and logging could  continue in the Superior National Forest. In fact, according to the  most recent Superior National Forest land use management plan, mining  and logging are considered a desired condition in the forest.   This is about more than just the 10,000-plus jobs which are now at  risk because of the lameduck actions of the Obama administration. This  is about billions of dollars in revenue for Minnesota's economy and  billions more in potential education funding for Minnesota's schools  that are now on the line. This is about strategically important metals  and minerals which are used by Americans every day. This is about  undoing a last-ditch effort to further a political agenda at the  expense of the livelihoods that Minnesotans have relied on for  generations.   The MINER Act, again, is about protecting Minnesota's right to  explore and, if environmentally appropriate, mine valuable and  important precious metals, precious metals that are not only necessary  to our everyday technology, but which are critically important to our  Nation's national defense.   There are some who would like to deny Minnesota the right to explore  and potentially mine these precious metals. They argue that any mining  activity could negatively impact our beloved Boundary Waters Canoe  Area. This concern, however, ignores the fact that, if a mine is ever  proposed, and to date there has been no mine proposed, if one is ever  proposed in the Superior National Forest, it would have to satisfy all  current local, State, and Federal environmental review and permitting  requirements before it could ever be approved to proceed.   We can and we will protect the Boundary Waters. I have no doubt that  we can find a way to preserve Minnesota's pristine landscape without  permanently destroying any future job creation or economic development  in Minnesota. By passing the MINER Act, we protect thousands of jobs  and billions of dollars in revenue and education funding while leaving  an extensive process intact to protect and preserve the environment and  our State.   In conclusion, I encourage all my colleagues to support the MINER Act  because we know someday someone might find a way to mine these  important precious metals in a safe and environmentally responsible  way, and if that happens, Minnesota deserves the opportunity and the  jobs and economic prosperity that will ensue.  [[Page H9501]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the additional  time, and I recognize my esteemed colleague, the Representative from  Minnesota, for his love of the Boundary Waters that we both share.   Mr. Speaker, I want to address the Representative from California  first on the claim that H.R. 3905 solely benefits a foreign mining  company.   I think you should ask the people of our State. You should ask a  gentleman by the name of Dan Forsman, who, as a Minnesotan, has a  family heritage of benefiting by mining in our State. He was recently  ridiculed by environmentalists in The New York Times because, while he  loves the place where he lives, he also wants to make a living in the  place where he lives. There are several other companies exploring the  area.   Teck has nonferrous mineral holdings within the proposed withdrawal,  the potential development of which would be greatly impacted by the  withdrawal.   Encampment Minerals, Inc., also has a nonferrous mineral holding  within the withdrawal area and is awaiting Federal agency action on a  submitted preference right lease application.   Future expansion of the Northshore Mining taconite mine could extend  into the withdrawal area and, thus, be impacted by the withdrawal.   PolyMet has invested hundreds of millions on projects that will be  negatively impacted by the proposed mineral withdrawal, one of which we  voted on here last night.   Further, the withdrawal proposal will seriously hinder the State's  ability to seek mineral development of more than 90,000 acres of State  school trust fund lands within the withdrawal area.   Twin Metals is a Minnesota company and has been part of the  northeastern Minnesota community for 10 years. The company has invested  more than $400 million in project development activities, investing in  new facilities in the city of Ely, providing local employment  opportunities and supporting hundreds of local jobs in the  construction, consulting, and contracting sectors. By the way, they  also support all the outfitters, the wonderful businesses of tourism.  Twin Metals has also contributed more than $320,000 to local  philanthropic needs and organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I would add that nothing in this bill alters any current  environmental law or protection. The Antiquities Act, the Federal Land  Policy and Management Act, NEPA, and all the other laws still apply to  Minnesota.   At the end of the day, we are protecting the Boundary Waters, we are  protecting the Superior National Forest, and we believe both the  economy and tourism, the environment, can coexist in northern  Minnesota.
