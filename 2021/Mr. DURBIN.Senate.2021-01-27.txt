 Mr. President, today, January 27, marks an anniversary,  in a way, of an event that occurred in this Chamber 3 weeks ago, an  event on January 6, which some of us will never forget.   We are in the midst of preparing for an impeachment trial of  President Donald Trump for any responsibility that he bears for that  day's events. Some have said we shouldn't do that, that we shouldn't  have an impeachment trial.   The former U.N. Ambassador and Governor of South Carolina, Nikki  Haley, said in an interview on FOX television it is time for America to  get over it--get over it. She is not the only one who has expressed  that point of view.   I was in the airport in Chicago last week in a waiting area to get on  a plane when someone seated nearby said: Hey, Senator, get over it. Let  this President ride off into the sunset. Those were his words: Get over  it.   It is hard to get over it if you lived it, and many of us in this  Chamber did.   Last night, there was a vote as to whether we should go forward with  the impeachment. All of the Democrats, 50, voted in favor of having the  trial, since we received that Article from the House. Five--five-- Republicans joined us. Forty-five Republicans voted to end the  impeachment proceeding, voting in favor of the point of order that was  raised by the junior Senator from Kentucky.   I don't know what was going through their minds when they joined that  point of order from the Senator from Kentucky. I don't know if it truly  was a constitutional issue they were thinking about, whether it was  loyalty to Donald Trump, or whether it was fear of Trump's followers in  their home States that led them to vote to end the impeachment inquiry.   But we should move forward. We should go forward, as Lincoln reminded  us, because we cannot escape history, and we certainly shouldn't be  party to rewriting history.   When almost 50 percent of Trump loyalists refuse to believe that the  events 3 weeks ago in this Capitol occurred or, if they occurred, that  they had anything to do with President Trump, we need to make a record,  a record of fact, not just for our current deliberations but for  history.   How can anyone who was in this Chamber on January 6 really argue that  nothing critical and important and horrific occurred?   Do you remember at 2:15, when the Secret Service went up and grabbed  the Vice President by his arms and pulled him down, out that door, so  they could take him to a secure place? We were stunned by that. I was.   They told us to sit here. And do you know what I saw next? Two men,  plainclothes security people--I don't know what Agency they were  working for--came right down here, right down in the middle of this  well. Why do I remember that they were there? Because one of them had  an automatic weapon around his neck, in the Senate Chamber.   Then we were told by a Capitol policeman who stood in front of us:  Sit down. Stay in your seats. We are bringing in your staff and locking  the doors. This will be a secure room. Then they closed the doors off  to the public, and we sat here for a few minutes.   And then the same policeman said: Leave. Evacuate quickly, out the  doors. The crowd, the mob, was advancing and getting closer to the  Senate Chamber.  [[Page S160]]    We went out the back corridor and down the steps. As you go down the  steps, there is a window that looks out on the sidewalk near the  Capitol Building, and I saw this mob coming at us with Trump flags and  American flags and signs--coming right at us. We hurried down those  steps and through the long tunnel to, we hoped, a safe location in one  of the office buildings nearby.   I will never forget it. Do the 45 Senators who voted against the  impeachment trial last night still remember it? I certainly hope they  do, and I certainly hope they can recall it as they watch the  videotapes, the mountain of videotapes of what happened that day.   And, of course, I hope we all remember what the Capitol Police went  through. For those who say they love law and order, take a look at what  they went through when this mob came after them. They were beaten. One  gave his life. And we can never forget.   So how did this come about? Was this just a spontaneous gathering of  people who decided to come to Capitol Hill? Far from it. The President  of the United States, Donald Trump, requested his followers to come to  Washington on January 6. Why did he pick January 6? Because the  Constitution says that is the day when Congress will count the  electoral votes and determine who will be the next President.   And because President Trump refused to accept the reality of his loss  on November 3 and continued in every imaginable way to try to change  the numbers coming out of States like Georgia, he called his followers  to Washington on that day and held a rally on the Ellipse   We have a tape of that rally, and it should be part of the record as  to what this President said to his followers who had gathered on that  day, how his rhetoric inflamed them. We can see it. It is a matter of  record.   Then he pointed to the Capitol Building, this building, and told them  to come up here. Why? Because we were in the process of counting the  electoral votes, which would finally and constitutionally announce that  he had lost the election. It was his last desperate gasp to keep the  White House, even at the expense of the Constitution and reality.   Then the crowd turned and advanced on the Capitol. We have seen those  videotapes as well, as they overran the flimsy barricades that were set  up in the hopes that they would discourage and stop them. And they  broke through windows and doors, came into this building, invading it  for the first time since 1814.   It was 1814 when the British forces came into this building, burned  it, as an invasion. Well, this was a new invasion, an invasion by those  who were either inspired by this President or, for whatever political  reasons, decided to try to stop this government.   It is the first time that has ever happened since 1814. I will never  forget it. I am sorry to say that the 45 Senators who said stop the  investigation, stop the impeachment, may not have as clear a memory as  I do.   Each year, we have a commemoration of George Washington's Farewell  Address, and a different Member of the Senate is asked to read it on  the floor of the Senate. I have to tell you that, honestly, I don't  come to the floor and listen carefully. It doesn't have the impact it  once had. It is a commemoration which is honorific but doesn't have the  real power to create a memory.   Doug Jones is a former Senator from Alabama, and he said on Martin  Luther King's birthday, or nearby, we should all come to the floor and  hear a reading of King's letter from the Birmingham jail, and I think  that is appropriate and it is good.   How will we remember and commemorate January 6? Maybe it is too soon  to think about that, but how can we forget what happened that day? How  can we possibly get over it?   I don't want to get over it. I want to face it squarely and honestly  with the facts. History demands it of us. Those of us who are honored  to serve in this Chamber bear a responsibility to keep the facts alive,  not let those who wish to ignore them or rewrite history have the last  word.   We now have a responsibility to go forward with this impeachment  trial, to make a record and decide as a U.S. Senate. We owe it to the  people we represent. That is for sure. But, more importantly, we owe it  to future generations to show them just how fragile a democracy can be  when a mob turns on the U.S. Capitol and tries to stop the business of  this government.   The good news is this. If there is any source of elation, it is this:  We returned to the Capitol that same day, January 6, and finished our  business of counting the electoral vote. In the early hours of the  morning of January 7, Joseph Biden was announced the winner of the  Presidency, and just 2 weeks later--2 weeks later to the day--he was  sworn in as President of the United States.   Our democracy survived this mob that came forward in insurrection  against our government, and we are now in the beginning of the second  week of the Biden Presidency. He has spoken to the American people and  told them we are going to come together; we are going to unify. Bless  him for doing that.   We owe him this opportunity. We owe it to our country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 76 years ago today, scouts from the  Soviet Red Army pushed their way through Poland. They stumbled on a  place that haunts the world to this day--a place of incomprehensible  suffering, cruelty, and depravity--Auschwitz-Birkenau.   Auschwitz was the largest of Nazi Germany's death camps--40 sprawling  acres of hell on Earth.   Between 1940 and 1945, 1.1 million men, women, and children were  transported to Auschwitz from Nazi-occupied lands; 1.1 million were  murdered there. More than 950,000 of those were Jewish.   At the height of the Nazi concentration and extermination camp's  operations, an average--average--of 6,000 Jews were poisoned and  cremated every day in the gas chambers and crematoria of Auschwitz. It  was mass murder on an industrial scale.   The first Soviet soldiers who entered Auschwitz on January 27, 1945,  were met with an eerie stillness. Most of the camp's prisoners--nearly  60,000 of them--had been evacuated days earlier by Nazis and dispersed  to other concentration camps, where they continued to be exploited as  slave labor. Only about 9,000 prisoners remained. They were the ones  who were too sick to endure the evacuation, simply left there to die-- no food, no water, no heat, no medical care.   In a frantic effort to conceal their monstrous crimes, the SS had  tried to dismantle that killing machine before they abandoned it. They  forced prisoners to dismantle the barracks and demolish the gas  chambers and ovens, but the fires still burned in Auschwitz.  [[Page S175]]    Three weeks ago today, on January 6, 2021, an angry mob attacked this  Capitol Building and this Congress as we gathered to fulfill our  constitutional obligation to certify the results of the 2020  Presidential election. That siege on the Capitol was an attack on  American democracy itself. Sadly, it was incited by then-President  Donald Trump.   So many scenes from that day still haunt us: police officers trying  to maintain order, battered with American flags, threatened to be  murdered with their own service weapons; a scaffold erected on the  Capitol grounds; calls to hang the Vice President of the United States;  a Confederate battle flag paraded through the halls of the Senate--a  desecration that never happened during our Civil War. But for many, the  most painful image of that day was of a middle-aged White man proudly  wearing the sweatshirt that read: ``Camp Auschwitz,'' and then the  words: ``Work makes you free''--a translation of the cruel slogan atop  the black iron gates leading into the Auschwitz concentration camp.   For one retired dentist and grandfather in the Chicago area, that  despicable neo-Nazi hate symbol, shown during the Capitol insurrection,  and the chants of ``Jews will not replace us'' 3 years earlier in  Charlottesville were shocking reminders. George Brent is 91 years old  now, but he was 15 years old and living in Hungary when his parents and  his little brother saw a Nazi invasion on March 19, 1944.   Two months after that invasion, on May 19, 1944, Hungarian  townspeople sympathetic to the Nazis woke George and his family in the  early morning hours and told them they had 2 hours to get out of their  home. The family was taken to the Jewish ghetto. The following morning,  they and the rest of the town's Jews were loaded onto open cattle cars.  After 6 days traveling on the railroad, the doors of the cattle cars  were opened to reveal dogs and whips and SS officers barking commands.   George and his father were ordered to walk in one direction. Out of  the corner of his eye, he saw his mom and his little brother Peter  being herded in the opposite direction. He never saw them again. They  almost certainly died that day in Auschwitz.   George and his father were spared immediate death because they  happened to be strong enough to work. George's father was sent to clean  up destruction and carnage in the Warsaw Ghetto. George was given  different jobs at Auschwitz. He remembers the smoke that billowed from  the crematoria.   In mid-January 1945, as the Allies pushed into Poland, George and  56,000 other prisoners were evacuated from Auschwitz. The emaciated men  and boys were forced to walk hours in the freezing cold and snow, clad  only in rags and wooden clogs. They called it ``The March of Death.'' A  fourth of the prisoners died along the way.   The survivors were loaded into box cars and shipped west. George was  sent to Mauthausen, a notoriously brutal camp in Upper Austria. A few  days later, he was sent to Ebensee, a satellite camp.   The official policy of both camps was ``extermination through  labor.'' It was a cruel mockery of the sign that greeted the prisoners  as they entered Auschwitz: ``Work makes you free.''   At Ebensee, George was put to work digging tunnels in which the Nazis  could hide their war armaments from Allied bombing.   On May 6, 1945--11\1/2\ months after George was ripped from his home  and family, Ebensee was finally liberated by George Patton's 80th  Infantry Division--the last of the Nazi camps to be liberated. George  was then 16 years of age. He weighed less than 70 pounds.   After the war, George stayed briefly with two of his aunts in  Budapest. Together, they discovered their father was still alive but  desperately ill in a tuberculosis sanatorium in Munich. Several months  later, George was able to visit him. He settled into a displaced camp  for Jewish children near Munich.   In October 1949, he moved to America to live with his great-uncle,  who owned a small grocery store on the South Side of Chicago. George  slept on a recliner chair in the storeroom. He was even happy to be  there. He had reached the age of 20.   In May of 1950--7 months after arriving in the United States--he  enlisted in the U.S. Air Force Reserve and served 2 years during the  Korean war. In 1951, George's father moved to Chicago, and they were  reunited for nearly 20 years before his father passed away.   After the war, George married and raised a family. He graduated from  the University of Illinois College of Dentistry in Chicago. He later  taught dentistry at the college for 29 years and practiced dentistry  for 50 years.   After he retired in 2010, he became a volunteer lecturer at the  Illinois Holocaust Museum, where he tells his story mostly to kids.   George Brent is a proud American. He is not really political. But  when he saw the clothing and the symbols at the Capitol siege  glorifying the murderous Nazi regime, he was outraged. How could this  happen in America, he asked?   One effort that I believe is needed--in fact, it is long overdue--is  for Congress to pass legislation aimed at addressing the significant  threat of domestic terrorism--domestic, homegrown American terrorism.  That is why I have introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act in  each Congress since 2017. I will be reintroducing it soon in this  Congress.   For far too long, we have failed to adequately monitor the dangerous  groups that threaten us, the violent White supremacists and other  extremist groups. While we looked the other way, the threat grew.   Intelligence experts have now warned us that such groups constitute a  serious and growing threat to America's security. Unfortunately,  instead of addressing this threat, the Trump administration spent 4  years downplaying it, and the former President made appalling,  incendiary, and embarrassing statements that only served to further  incite these violent extremists. We can't waste another moment.  Congress has to act against this hateful extremism.   As the incoming chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am going  to hold hearings on this matter.   I brought it up to the head of the FBI before. He acknowledged the  problem, but little or nothing was done during the Trump years. I trust  that President Biden will take a different approach. This is a serious  threat to security in America.   I feel badly for George Brent, a man who miraculously survived  Auschwitz, the concentration camps, and everything the Nazis threw at  him. He came to the United States because he dearly loved this country  and the freedoms that are part of it. He made a great life and a great  contribution. He still does with his work at the Holocaust museum. Can  you imagine what went through his mind when he saw that photograph of  the demonstrator in the Capitol--the United States Capitol--with a  sweatshirt mocking his life experience, a sweatshirt which bore the  words ``Camp Auschwitz''?   It was a sad day for America when that group, that mob, overran this  Capitol. I am sorry for the pain that it brought to so many people.   But let me add quickly: We cannot ignore it. It is not a question of  getting over it. It is not a question of letting President Trump ride  off into the sunset. We have got to come to grips with the reality of  what occurred 3 weeks ago today--3 weeks ago today--when we ran out of  this Chamber, and we were told to move as quickly as possible with the  fear that this mob was going to overtake us and harm us.   After we left the building, they overran this Chamber. They went  through the desks. They posed in the chairs where the Presiding Officer  is sitting, took videos and photos of themselves and were just dumb  enough to put them on Facebook. So we have them, and many of these  people are going to pay the price for this criminal invasion of the  Capitol that they were part of.   Again, to George Brent's family: I am sorry for what you had to go  through. We are better than that. America is better than that. We are  glad that you are a part of this great country.   I will work to pass this bill and to get President Biden to sign it  into law. And as I do, I will remember George Brent.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
