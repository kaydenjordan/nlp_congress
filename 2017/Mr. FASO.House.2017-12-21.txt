 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise today to  recognize the distinguished career of Mr. Sam Pollak on the occasion of  his retirement. Mr. Pollak is retiring after 20 years of dedicated  service to the Oneonta and Otsego County community as editor of the  Oneonta Daily Star.   Having worked for decades in newsrooms throughout the Nation, Mr.  Pollak brought many years of experience and a proactive leadership to  The Daily Star.   I thank Mr. Pollak for his commitment to the people of the State of  New York, and I wish him and his wife, Julie, every happiness as they  embark upon this new chapter in life.                            ____________________
