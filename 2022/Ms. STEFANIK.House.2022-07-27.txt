 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Republican New York  delegation, I rise today in recognition of and to honor our good  friend, Mike Long, the longtime chairman of the Conservative Party of  New York. Mike passed away this week with his beloved family at his  side, leaving behind an extraordinary life and legacy.   Mike Long was a man of integrity who lived a life of service above  self. He was among the most, if not the most, respected and esteemed  political leaders in New York politics by both his allies and his  political opponents.   Mike Long was proudly born in Brooklyn, New York, and was raised in  southern Queens.   In 1959, Mike enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He felt  strongly that his duty was to our country, and as we know--and this was  Mike--once a marine, always a marine.   Mike then served in elected office on the New York City Council and  then for decades as chair of the New York Conservative Party, where he  got to know nearly every State and Federal Republican and Conservative  candidate for public office.   His chairmanship continued for more than 30 years, which is a  testament to his character, his work ethic, his leadership, and his  determination to make a difference.   In recognition of his strong defense of the rights of the unborn,  Pope St. John Paul II named him a Knight of St. Gregory, one of the  highest honors for a Catholic layman.   Mike was a champion for hardworking New Yorkers and a lifelong  advocate for smaller government, lower taxes, and improving the lives  of hardworking New York families.   My colleagues and I were all honored to call Mike a true friend.   When I first ran for office, I had met Chairman Long at various  Conservative Party events, but I set up a formal meeting to seek his  advice. It was in his office in Brooklyn. That is a long way for an  upstate New York native running in the North Country. I will be honest.  I got lost in the city driving and was hours late for that meeting. It  is a pet peeve of mine to be late, and, certainly, you never want to be  late for a marine. It is a matter of respect to be on time.   Mike couldn't have been more gracious--I will never forget it--saying  I will probably win my campaign because I know how to drive in upstate  New York but clearly not in New York City.   I was proud to earn his support and that of the Conservative Party.  My family was honored to have Mike and his wife, Eileen, at our wedding  years later. He is a true lifelong friend.   Now, Mike is in Heaven among the angels, and our hearts are broken  for this truly irreplaceable loss.   As I honor him for his service and an extraordinary life well lived  today, we join together in praying for his beloved family, thousands  and thousands of friends, and a vast community of admirers.   I am so honored to have my colleagues here today.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), my  colleague from central New York.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Zeldin), our colleague from Long Island, who is proudly the  Republican and the Conservative Party nominee for Governor of New York  State.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Zeldin for his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jacobs),  our colleague from western New York.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Jacobs for his comments.   This is fitting because my colleague from Staten Island, who  represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, was the longtime  representative at the State level and in Congress for Mike and Eileen  Long.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Malliotakis).    Madam Speaker, as you heard from all the New York  Republican Members of Congress, Mike's influence cannot be over  emphasized. He has touched tens of thousands of lives over his decades  of service and really his lifetime of service.   As many of our Members talked about, Mike Long was a man of  principle. Mike was a man of faith, of freedom, of family, and he was a  proud American.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
