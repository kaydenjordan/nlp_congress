 Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to honor  Cary Jones, an Oregonian retiring after a long career in the Coast  Guard and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The bottom line is Mr.  Jones has embraced and embodied the essence of public service  throughout his distinguished career.   He joined the Coast Guard in 1976 and was stationed in Honolulu,  Seattle, and Coos Bay. He served for several years aboard the USCGC  Boutwell, a high-endurance cutter used to intercept smuggling vessels.  [[Page S631]]    Mr. Jones left the Coast Guard in 2001 as a senior chief yeoman, and  he could have sailed off into an easy retirement. Instead, he went to  work for the VA, where he would spend nearly two decades helping Oregon  veterans. He served in a number of roles at the Portland VA Medical  Center, but in every capacity he sought to do right by veterans. He  worked with my Portland staff for years, and if you ever want to get  one of them going, just ask how helpful Cary Jones was. They will tell  you he worked on more than 10,000 congressional inquiries, each of  which represented an attempt to help an Oregon veteran or military  family.   Cary Jones is a shining example of what public service is supposed to  be all about. He has always been one of the good guys, in it for the  right reasons, and always laser-focused on lifting up people who need a  little bit of help.   Mr. Jones' career reminds me of a quote by the famous naturalist John  Burroughs: ``For anything worth having one must pay the price; and the  price is always work, patience, love, self-sacrifice--no paper  currency, no promises to pay, but the gold of real service.''   And so today I say thank you to Senior Chief Yeoman Cary Jones for  his work, patience, love and self-sacrifice.   I say thank you for leading by example, for showing countless  Oregonians that public service is a noble calling, and for paying the  gold of real service.   I wish you the best as you embark on your well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
