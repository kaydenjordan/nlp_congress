 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5671) to award a Congressional Gold Medal, collectively,  to the United States Merchant Mariners of World War II, in recognition  of their dedicated and vital service during World War II.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5671         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Merchant Mariners of World       War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) 2020 marked the 75th anniversary of Allied victory in       World War II.        (2) The United States Merchant Marine (in this section       referred to as the ``Merchant Marine'') was integral in       providing the link between domestic production and the       fighting forces overseas, providing combat equipment, fuel,       food, commodities, and raw materials to troops stationed       abroad.        (3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged the       indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the victory in a       1945 letter stating that, without the support of the Merchant       Marine, ``the Navy could not have accomplished its mission''.        (4) President, and former Supreme Commander of the Allied       Expeditionary Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower acknowledged that       ``through the prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to       our armed forces overseas, and of cargoes representing       economic and military aid to friendly nations, the American       Merchant Marine has effectively helped to strengthen the       forces of freedom throughout the world''.        (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon       the availability of resources and the Merchant Marine played       a vital role in this regard, ensuring the efficient and       reliable transoceanic transport of military equipment and       both military and civilian personnel.        (6) The Merchant Marine provided for the successful       transport of resources and personnel despite consistent and       ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both the air and       the sea, including from enemy bomber squadrons, submarines,       and naval mines.        (7) The efforts of the Merchant Marine were not without       sacrifices as the Merchant Marine likely bore a higher per-      capita casualty rate than any of the military branches during       the war.        (8) The Merchant Marine proved to be an instrumental asset       on an untold number of occasions, participating in every       landing operation by the United States Marine Corps, from       Guadalcanal to Okinawa.        (9) The Merchant Marine provided the bulk tonnage of       material necessary for the invasion of Normandy, an invasion       which, according to a 1944 New York Times article, ``would       not have been possible without the Merchant Marine''.        (10) In assessing the performance of the Merchant Marine,       General Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command       is quick to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage,       and fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine.       We count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to       duty as we do our own; they have never failed us''.        (11) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D.       Roosevelt stated that the Merchant Marine had ``delivered the       goods when and where needed in every theater of operations       and across every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult,       and dangerous transportation job ever undertaken. As time       goes on, there will be greater public understanding of our       merchant fleet's record during this war''.        (12) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine       are deserving of broader public recognition.        (13) The United States will be forever grateful and       indebted to these merchant mariners for their effective,       reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in       enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World       War II.        (14) The goods and resources transported by the Merchant       Marine saved thousands of lives and enabled the Allied Powers       to claim victory in World War II.        (15) The Congressional Gold Medal would be an appropriate       way to shed further light on the service of the merchant       mariners in World War II and the instrumental role they       played in winning that war.        (16) Many students of the Merchant Marine Academy lost       their lives as they sailed through enemy-controlled waters or       unloaded cargo in overseas combat areas, and, as a result,       the United States Merchant Marine Academy is the only       institution among the 5 Federal academies to be authorized to       carry a battle standard as part of its color guard.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf       of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design to       the United States merchant mariners of World War II, in       recognition of their dedicated and vital service during World       War II.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       described in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike       the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and       inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.  [[Page H548]]         (c) American Merchant Marine Museum.--        (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal       under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the       American Merchant Marine Museum, where it will be available       for display as appropriate and available for research.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the American Merchant Marine Museum should make the gold       medal given to the Museum under paragraph (1) available for       display elsewhere, particularly at appropriate locations       associated with the United States Merchant Marine and that       preference should be given to locations affiliated with the       United States Merchant  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 5671, the Merchant Mariners of World  War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2020.   I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) for his  work on this bill, which honors the courage and sacrifice of the  civilian mariners of the Merchant Marine.   In the early days of America's involvement in World War II, German U- boats sank numerous vessels during the Battle of the Atlantic. While  many think of convoys being attacked as being close to Europe, the  German Navy also took the war to the U.S. Eastern seaboard. In March  1942 alone, 27 ships from six Allied nations were sunk off U.S. shores.  All told, 733 American cargo ships were lost during World War II.   Despite this danger, some 215,000 civilian merchant marines served  with courage to establish and maintain critical supply lines, ensuring  that vital supplies, cargo, and personnel reached Allied forces in both  Europe and Asia. Though they had no military standing or government  benefits, these civilian mariners often faced German U-boat assaults.   These brave mariners paid a heavy price in service to their country,  suffering the highest casualty rate of any branch of U.S. Armed Forces  during World War II. An estimated 9,300 mariners lost their lives, and  another 12,000 were wounded to make sure our uniformed servicemembers  could keep fighting.   Unfortunately, their sacrifices are commonly underappreciated and  often overlooked. They were not even considered veterans until Congress  remedied that disservice in 1988, and many of our histories of World  War II give them a passing mention or do not recognize their vital role  in ensuring the success of the Allied forces.   Now, on the 75th anniversary of the Allied victory in World War II,  let us give these brave mariners the recognition they so richly  deserve.   I thank Mr. Garamendi for introducing this bill this Congress, and I  urge Members to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I am pleased that this bipartisan bill honors those who answered this  Nation's call to duty, regardless of the danger and without expectation  of accolades.   This bill incorporates relevant technical changes introduced by the  Senate and includes the additional recognition of the students of the  Merchant Marine Academy who lost their lives in service to their  country. It is time that we give these courageous mariners the  recognition they have more than earned.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
