 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5129,  the Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act of 2022. This  legislation renews the nation's commitment to reducing poverty through  an established network of more than 1,000 local Community Action  Agencies. Having authored previous iterations of this legislation, and  now being an original cosponsor with my good friend Congresswoman  Bonamici, I could not be more excited to advance this bill today. At a  time when it seems like Congress can't agree on anything, I am glad  that we can show people that there are still issues that bring  Democrats and Republicans together. And that's exactly what CSBG has  been doing for more than 50 years--bringing Americans together.   For years, these agencies have served as incredible resources to help  low-income families escape poverty and better their surrounding  communities. These agencies served on the front lines against COVID-19,  helping millions of Americans get through the pandemic. Just this past  week, I visited the Community Action Partnership of Ramsey and  Washington Counties where I saw first-hand the amazing work these  people do for my constituents.   H.R. 5129 builds on this success by reinforcing existing efforts to  improve the performance and management of Community Action at the  federal, state, and local levels.   I would like to thank my friends Congresswoman Bonamici and  Congressman Glenn Thompson for advancing this essential legislation. I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.
