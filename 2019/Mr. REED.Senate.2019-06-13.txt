 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Stronger  Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act along with Senator Grassley and  Senator Leahy. This bill will help securities regulators better protect  investors and demand greater accountability from market players. Even  after a financial crisis that devastated our nation's economy, we  continue to see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall Street, and  without the consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an  effective deterrent, I worry this disturbing culture of misconduct will  persist.   Today, the amount of penalties the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) can fine an institution or individual is restricted by statute.  During hearings I held in 2011 as Chairman of the Banking Committee's  Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee, I learned how this  limitation significantly interferes with the SEC's ability to perform  its enforcement duties. At that time, a Federal judge had criticized  the SEC for not obtaining a larger settlement against Citigroup, a  major player in the financial crisis that settled with the agency in an  amount that was far below the cost the bank had inflicted on investors.  The SEC explained that a statutory prohibition against levying a larger  penalty led to the low settlement amount. Indeed, then SEC Chairman  [[Page S3482]]  Mary L. Schapiro in 2011 also explained that ``the Commission's  statutory authority to obtain civil monetary penalties with appropriate  deterrent effect is limited in many circumstances.''   The bipartisan bill we are reintroducing seeks to update the SEC's  outdated civil penalties statutes. This bill strives to make potential  and current offenders think twice before engaging in misconduct by  increasing the maximum statutory civil monetary penalties, directly  linking the size of the penalties to the amount of losses suffered by  victims of a violation, and substantially raising the financial stakes  for repeat offenders of our nation's securities laws.   Specifically, our bill would expand the SEC's options to tailor  penalties to the specific circumstances of a given violation. In  addition to raising the per violation caps for severe, or ``third  tier,'' violations to $1 million per offense for individuals and $10  million per offense for entities, the legislation would also give the  SEC additional options to obtain greater penalties based on the ill- gotten gains of the violator or on the financial harm to investors.   Our bill also strives to deter repeat offenders on Wall Street  through two provisions. The first would allow the SEC to triple the  penalty cap applicable to recidivists who have been held either  criminally or civilly liable for securities fraud within the previous  five years. The second would allow the SEC to seek a civil penalty  against those who violate existing federal court or SEC orders, an  approach that would be more efficient, effective, and flexible than the  current civil contempt remedy. These changes would greatly improve the  SEC's ability to levy robust penalties against repeat offenders.   Slightly more than half of all U.S. households are invested in the  stock market. All of our constituents deserve a strong cop on the beat  that has the necessary tools to go after fraudsters and pursue the  difficult cases arising from our increasingly complex financial  markets. The Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act will enhance  the SEC's ability to demand meaningful accountability from Wall Street,  which in turn will increase transparency and confidence in our  financial system. I urge our colleagues to support this important  bipartisan legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 1863. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a  special resource study of the sites associated with the life and legacy  of the noted American philanthropist and business executive Julius  Rosenwald, with a special focus on the Rosenwald Schools, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
