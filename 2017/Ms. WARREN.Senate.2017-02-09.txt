 Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote  against the nomination of Tom Price to be the Secretary of the  Department of Health and Human Services.   The decisions made at HHS touch the lives of every family in America.  The Secretary who runs this agency makes decisions about everything  from safety of the food we eat to the drugs we take, to the health  insurance we buy and the quality of nursing homes we live in. This is  an extremely important job, and we should not hand over the keys to  this agency unless we are certain that the person will put the American  people first every minute of every day.   President Trump has nominated Congressman Tom Price to serve in this  job. Unlike many of the President's other nominees who are stunningly  inexperienced in areas where they will be setting policy, Congressman  Price has a lot of experience in health care policy. Yes, he has  experience, but it is the kind of experience that should horrify us if  we care about Medicare, if we care about Medicaid, or if we care about  our own insurance coverage.   Congressman Price's record is perfectly clear. He wants to destroy  fundamental protections that millions of Americans depend on for their  health and economic security, and, frankly, he isn't very subtle about  it. He has described ACA's ban on discriminating against individuals  with preexisting conditions as ``a terrible idea.'' He has voted 10  times to defund Planned Parenthood--voted 10 times against a group that  provides lifesaving cancer and sexually transmitted infection  screenings to millions of patients a year. He has tried to privatize  Medicare and raise the age of eligibility. Privatize Medicare; think  about that. And he has been one of the chief boosters in Congress for  gutting the Medicaid program--the Medicaid program, which provides  health care for millions of kids, for people with disabilities, for  families with parents in nursing homes--cut money to keep people in  nursing homes.   Nonpartisan analyses of these plans are not pretty. Millions of  people in this country, young and old, children and grandparents, poor  and middle-class workers would be denied access to lifesaving care.   Congressman Price touts his own magic numbers that say differently,  but make no mistake, this is the record of someone who wants to use his  position at HHS to advance a radical, reckless agenda that puts  rightwing, anti-government ideology ahead of the health and safety of  the American people.   During his hearing before the HELP Committee, I asked Congressman  Price some pretty simple questions. I asked him about more than $1  trillion in cuts that he has proposed to Medicare and Medicaid. I asked  him if he would keep or undermine President Trump's campaign claim that  he would protect these programs. I asked him to guarantee that not one  dollar in cuts to Medicare would take place on his watch. I asked him  to guarantee that not one dollar in cuts for Medicaid to help people  living in nursing homes would happen on his watch. I asked him to  guarantee that not one dollar in cuts for people with disabilities  would happen on his watch.   I asked him three separate times to make this commitment, and three  separate times he refused to do so. Think about that--cut Medicare for  millions of seniors, cut help for people with disabilities, cut  Medicaid for people living in nursing homes. This is the person Donald  Trump wants to put in charge of those programs.    We have a lot of work we need to do on health care. We need to reduce  the cost of insurance. We need to make sure insurance is available to  small business owners, gig workers, and part-time workers. We need to  make sure insurance continues to cover health care for women and people  with preexisting conditions who otherwise are not going to be able to  get insurance. What we don't need is to put someone in charge who is  hell-bent on destroying health care in America.   For me, this is easy. When someone says he wants to cut Medicare, I  am done with him. When someone says let's take away the money that  people rely on to pay for nursing homes, this guy is finished. When  someone says that protecting people with preexisting conditions is a  bad idea, they don't get the job. This should be easy for everyone in  Congress. This is a moment for Senator Republicans to step up and say  no.   There is another reason to reject Congressman Price's nomination, a  reason that has nothing to do with his terrible ideas, a reason that  would disqualify him even if we agreed on every single issue. The  reason is basic ethics.   During his time in Congress, Mr. Price has made money by trading  hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock in healthcare-related  companies at exactly the same time that he pushed legislation that  could affect the value of these stocks. His formula has been pretty  simple. First he buys the stock, then he pushes bills to help the  company, which helps the stock price go up.   For example, Congressman Price bought stock in a company that makes  hip and knee replacements, and then he introduced a bill to suspend a  Federal rule affecting Medicare reimbursements for hip and knee  replacements. Congressman Price bought stock in a bunch of  pharmaceutical companies, then cosponsored a bill to suspend a Federal  rule that would hold down drug prices for the drugs that these  companies manufacture. Congressman Price bought stock in an Australian  biotech company with an experimental drug to treat multiple sclerosis,  and then he voted for a bill that would make it easier for the FDA to  approve these drugs.   So what does Congressman Price have to say for himself? How does he  explain this connection between buying stock, then supporting changes  in the law that would boost the value of the stock he just bought?  Well, he has his excuses lined up, and I have to say they are doozies.   He says he didn't know about the trades; his broker made them without  asking him first. Oh, wait. He did know about the trades. He just  happened to know about an obscure Australian biotech firm, and he just  happened to decide to invest as much as $100,000 in it because it was a  good investment. Then he hit his last excuse: It is all OK because he  paid the same price as anyone else who bought the stock.   Wow, that is really a heaping, steaming pile of excuses, and the  excuses stink. These are Congressman Price's stock trades, not anyone  else's. He made those decisions to buy those stocks, and then he  repeatedly pressed for rules that would increase the value of those  stocks. In fact, with one of the deals, it isn't just a question of  stinkiness; it is a question about whether he broke the law.   By his own account, Congressman Price found out about an Australian  biotech company called Innate Immunotherapeutics from a fellow House  Member who, it just so happens, sits on the company's board and holds  the largest stake in the company. So when he decided to buy his latest  batch of stock, Congressman Price got access to a private sweetheart  deal, meaning he got a discount on the price of the shares the general  public couldn't get.   This sequence of events might break the law. That is not good at all.  And getting special access to a sweetheart deal doesn't help your claim  that you are just an ordinary guy with a boring stock portfolio. So  when Congressman Price appeared before the Finance and HELP Committees,  he said he had not paid a lower price than had been available to other  investors. That is just not true. The company itself pointed it out. In  fact, Congressman Price got a  [[Page S1037]]  special discount that went to only 20 people in the country--20 special  friends, including the Congressman who could help write the laws that  would make the company even more valuable.   An outside watchdog has called for an SEC investigation into whether  Congressman Price committed insider trading. Price lied to Congress  about his trades, and that should be the end of it. No more nomination  for Secretary of HHS. The Congressman should have the decency to  withdraw his nomination. It should have happened weeks ago. And if he  didn't go voluntarily, the President and his friends in Congress  should have quietly but forcefully pushed him out, but that is not what  happened either. Instead, Republicans barreled straight ahead, and they  changed the rules to do it.    Since Congressman Price lied to the committee, Democrats wanted him  back for another hearing to ask him about it. Republicans refused, and  Democrats boycotted the Finance Committee to try to force Price to  explain why he lied. So the Republican response was to just suspend the  Senate rules so they can run around the Democrats and move forward  Price's nomination anyway.   Do we do not care about basic ethics anymore? Is that just gone? A  Congressman should not be buying stocks then pushing laws to help the  company, and that Congressman sure shouldn't be lying to the United  States Senate about it.   Because Congressman Price has no shame, it will take three Senate  Republicans to reject his nomination. Where are the three Republicans  who will say no to a man who bought stock and then tried to get the  rules changed in Washington so the companies would be more profitable?  Where are three Republicans who will say no to a man who got a special  stock deal that went to only 20 people in the whole country? Where are  three Republicans who will say no to a man who lied to a Senate  committee? This has nothing to do with politics. It is about basic  ethics. It is about potentially illegal behavior. Where are three  Republicans who will say no to this man?   When Donald Trump selected Congressman Price for this job, he said  Price was part of a ``dream team that will transform our healthcare  system for the benefit of all Americans.'' Over the past few weeks, I  have been trying to understand exactly what that dream looks like.   For families all over this country, the dream is pretty simple. They  want to know that when they get sick, they can go to the doctor and not  be hit with a surprise bill they can't pay. When they buy insurance,  they want to be sure it covers birth control or cancer screenings and  preexisting conditions. They want to be able to fight cancer and not  lose their house or declare bankruptcy because their insurance company  imposes a lifetime limit on benefits.   President Trump does not share this dream for health care in America,  and neither does Congressman Price. From his first day in office,  President Trump has acted to undermine access to health care. Now he  has nominated an HHS Secretary who will help him sabotage our Nation's  health care system from inside the Department of Health and Human  Services.   Yes, we have our differences over health care, and, yes, there are  fixes we need to make, but where are three Republicans who will say no  to a man who wants to cut Medicare? Where are three Republicans who  will say no to a man who wants to cut nursing home care? Where are  three Republicans who will say no to a man who wants to cut insurance  coverage? Democrats can't do this alone. Three Republicans need to put  aside partisanship and stand up for the American people. We need you.  The American people need you.   With my remaining time, I want to share some of the letters I have  been getting from families in Massachusetts who have seen the reckless,  radical plans that President Trump, Congressman Price, and Republicans  in Congress have put forth for the Nation's health care system. These  families know exactly what is at stake in this debate. Congressman  Price didn't have an answer when I asked him to protect Medicare and  Medicaid, but these letters are from constituents and they show just  how important these programs are.   Lee from Holliston wrote to me, concerned about cuts to Medicare and  Medicaid. I am just going to read an excerpt from his letter:         I am a 65 year old disabled woman who depends on the       generosity of MassHealth and Medicare to survive. I am       terrified that Medicare and Medicaid will be so drastically       cut that I will no longer be able to maintain my life. I live       in HUD housing, receive Medicare and MassHealth which covers       all of my healthcare and allows me to continue to live on my       own through senior services and the Personal Care Attendant       program.        I guess I am just feeling scared and hopeless as I realize       the potential for destroying the lives of seniors who live on       Social Security and nothing else. I wear an insulin pump,       have type 1 diabetes going on 53 years, and I have multiple       complications--including an amputation 11 years ago.        My healthcare costs are just unaffordable without all the       assistance. Medicare and MassHealth covers everything for me       so that the $1,050 per month I receive is doable for living       expenses.        I just need to know it is going to be OK.    Lee, we need three Republicans to help out here. Congressman Price  has made it clear that he wants more than $1 trillion in cuts to  Medicare and Medicaid, and that affects you. We have to find three  Republicans to help out and to help stand up for you and the rest of  America.   I also heard from Alan from South Shore, who is worried about his  daughter Meg. Here is what he wrote:         My daughter Meg is 29. She was born with a condition called       neurofibromatosis. As a result of this, she has benign but       inoperable tumors on her spine. They cause her chronic pain       and problems walking. On some days, she cannot walk even one       step. On other days, she might begin walking with a walker,       then suddenly collapse on the floor.        Meg cannot hold down a job: She spent the last quarter of       2016 in and out of hospitals. She receives about $700/month       from Social Security Disability. She has no savings. She pays       for her Medicare prescription drug Part D supplement out of       her Social Security. MassHealth is free for her, and it pays       for Meg's Medicare Part B. I am retired, so I can only help       her a bit.        If Trump's first idea about TrumpCare goes into law--where       he assumes you will buy your health insurance out of       savings--I fear Meg will live in her bed, watching repeats of       quiz shows on her television. And her network of care--      including emergency services, rehab physical therapy, chronic       disease management prescription drugs--will be reduced.    I understand why you are worried, Alan. I am worried, too, because I  think that is exactly the path we are on with Congressman Price's  nomination to head up HHS. That is why we are fighting back.   Boston Center for Independent Living also shared with me a story from  a constituent named Jill who receives health care from the State's  Medicaid Program. Let me tell you a little bit about Jill.   Jill is 62 years old. She has a heart defect, a seizure disorder, and  serious osteoporosis. She had a varied career as a manager of a women's  clothing company a decade ago, and in the 1980s, she installed some of  the first computer networks in public schools. In the past several  years, Jill has had significant health problems: surgery for her heart  condition and multiple broken bones due to her worsening osteoporosis.   MassHealth, the State's Medicaid Program, has covered hospital bills,  appointments with specialists, rehab stays, and an affordable  medication plan.   Jill is now hoping to use a personal care assistant to give her  support with shopping, making meals, and basic housekeeping.   Jill said: ``For me, Medicaid is a lifeline--any cuts from Washington  would be a disaster.''   I hear you on that, Jill. I just hope that Congressman Price,  President Trump, and the Republicans hear you as well.   Medicaid helps a lot of people in Massachusetts, including the very  youngest. I got a very powerful letter from Marika from Duxbury, who  wrote to me about giving birth to her son Jack after just 28 weeks of  pregnancy. I want to read parts of her letter:         I'm writing to you today because I am horrified about the       changes that may be happening to healthcare in the United       States.        My husband and I welcomed our son, Jack, at 28 weeks in       July of 2015. I had a very normal, healthy pregnancy--until       suddenly it wasn't. I ended up with rapid onset of HELLP, a       rare and life-threatening syndrome, and an emergency C-      section saved both my life and Jack's.        Jack was 1 pound, 14 ounces when he was born. We were both       in the ICU for some time,  [[Page S1038]]       my son Jack for 110 days. He had all the issues you'd imagine       at 28 weeks--cardiac, pulmonary, feeding.        Today, at 18 months old, Jack is a fighter--my hero       really--and despite still needing oxygen and a continuous       feeding tube that is surgically inserted into his intestines,       he is cruising, talking, and ALIVE.        He is alive, and quite frankly, I'm alive because of our       amazing healthcare. I have the benefit of an exceptional       employer plan from Harvard University. But Jack also       qualified (because of his birth weight) for MassHealth. And       our public health insurance has been an incredible resource:        Jack's hospital bills were in the millions after his 110       day stay in the NICU. This doesn't even include my own       hospital costs for my stay. Despite having excellent jobs and       resources, my husband and I would have been bankrupt, and       immediately so, without our private health insurance and       MassHealth benefits.        Since coming home from the NICU, Jack is still on a feeding       tube and oxygen, and he cannot be accepted into regular       daycare. He would go to a medical day care, but he has no       cognitive delays, and so placing him in such a facility would       not ensure that he gets the regular developmentally       appropriate engagement that he needs. And so MassHealth pays       for skilled nursing care in our home with no out of pocket       costs. This means that Jack gets the care that he needs, and       my husband and I can still work at the jobs that we love.        Jack participates in early intervention programs and       receives feeding therapy, physical therapy and occupational       therapy free of charge.        Jack's Synagis shots cost zero dollars. Synagis is a       prescription medication that is used to prevent a serious       lung disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, in       children at high risk for severe lung disease from RSV. The       average wholesale price is $780.15 for the 50 milligram       Synagis vial, and $1,416.48 for the 100 milligram vial. Jack       gets a 150 milliliter shot every month.        I cannot imagine this life without my son's public health       insurance. I recently enjoyed the NICU Family Advisory Board       at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Hospital in Boston (where       Jack and I were cared for) as a way to give back. Today, I       mentor other families who have unexpectedly found themselves       the parent to a tiny premature baby fighting for life. In       nearly every case, navigating the insurance system and fears       about money are top of mind.    I am glad to hear that Jack is doing well, but I understand why it is  that you want to hang on to MassHealth and why it is that we cannot  take the cuts Congressman Price has proposed.   Families in Massachusetts are also deeply worried about the future of  the Affordable Care Act. Jackie from Norwood wrote to me about how the  ACA helped her get coverage for therapy after her mother was killed.  She wrote:         My mother was murdered when I was 24. I was on her       healthcare, which kicked me off the day after she died. I had       recently accepted a new job and I was set to start that       Monday (she was killed on Saturday). I had already left my       previous full-time job the Friday before.        Due to having to move states after her death, I couldn't       start my new job. I didn't know when I'd have work again that       could provide insurance, nor did I have another parent whose       plan I could join. I also had no way of affording COBRA       payments.        So in the matter of one night, I was left helpless in so       many ways. Not having health insurance was one of many side       effect issues that no homicide victim's family should have to       worry about. Especially the next day and when planning a       funeral.        Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, I was able to get       covered almost immediately, which meant I could still afford       my current medications and I was able to get into needed       therapy right away. If it weren't for the ACA, I would have       been left struggling and sick as a result of something FAR       out of my control.    Very true, Jackie.   Jackie goes on to say:         I ended up finding work within a couple of months, and I am       still in treatment for PTSD. I was lucky enough to find       employment at Harvard University and no longer needed       coverage through the ACA. I have generous health benefits       provided to me. However, I never want a fellow citizen or       victim of homicide to be without medical care due to cost,       preexisting conditions, or other setbacks. I am happy my tax       dollars go to help programs like MassHealth and the ACA. We       all work hard, but that doesn't mean we are all as fortunate.        I am not the typical poster child for a homicide victim/      survivor. I am white and college educated. I work for an Ivy       League school. I still needed help when disaster struck, and       so many others less privileged than me need help finding       affordable health care.        Please continue fighting for me and other victims and       survivors of homicide.    That is what we are here for, Jackie. That is what we are supposed to  do. We just need three Republicans to help us out on this.   I also heard from Jennifer from Northampton, who is terrified for her  family if the ACA is repealed. She says:         I suppose I can't say when our story starts. Maybe the day       I met my then-life partner (now wife) of 16 years. Maybe it       begins when she had to have emergency surgery in Maryland       when she wasn't covered under my insurance, because our union       wasn't legally recognized. Maybe it begins with the tens of       thousands of dollars of debt we incurred in uncovered medical       expenses when we tried to get pregnant with our son.        Or maybe it started two days ago when the unthinkable       happened. My wife got laid off. After seven years of       exemplary services to a large human services agency whose       mission is supporting individuals and families affected by       homelessness, my wife was given no warning, no severance and       no compassion in her sudden dismissal from the agency. For       any family this would be devastating. Now we come to the dire       part.        About a year ago, my younger sister, Stephanie, was       diagnosed with an aggressive form of Triple Negative Breast       Cancer at 35 years of age. But this story isn't about that.        Six months later, my mother got diagnosed with Stage 4       Metastatic Breast Cancer.        I didn't have to be an over-educated lesbian to know that       there was something genetic going on in my family. I got       tested for the BRCA gene and was found positive for the       mutation that causes breast cancer, specifically Triple       Negative (like my sister had) and am currently looking at an       80% chance of developing Breast Cancer in my lifetime.        I need a double mastectomy and I need it soon. It's       scheduled, in fact, for March 6th, 2017. And now, my wife       doesn't have a job. I am a Behavior Analyst who specializes       in the treatment of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. I       have a small private practice and don't make enough money to       support our household. I also don't have access to health       insurance through any of my contracts.        That is why it's dire.        One laid-off spouse, one four year old son, one self-      employed wife with an 80% chance of developing breast cancer       and fear of the ACA being repealed. This is dire.        We are terrified, I am terrified.        This isn't a ``wait and see'' situation for my family. This       is us. This is now. And this is real.    Yes, Jennifer, and that is why we are here tonight, in the U.S.  Senate, to debate whether or not Congressman Price--a man who wants to  cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, repeal the Affordable Care Act--is going to  be the next head of Health and Human Services. That is why we are  fighting. That is why we are looking for three Republicans to step up  with the Democrats and turn him down. We must protect the Affordable  Care Act.   I also got a letter from Olivia, a college student from North  Reading. Olivia wrote me about what the ACA means to her as someone  living with multiple chronic illnesses. She wrote:         I am a twenty-two year old white woman from a middle-class       suburb of Boston. I attend the University of Massachusetts       Amherst and will be applying to graduate school next year. I       eat an anti-inflammatory diet, I exercise regularly, do not       smoke, and drink lots of water. I am on my parents'       insurance, which they receive through their employer. I am a       patient at some of the best hospitals in the world.        I am so fortunate to live in a state that protects my right       to affordable health care. I was also hopeful when I heard       that President Trump was considering modifying ObamaCare       rather than repealing it. However, I am still worried about       the actions that will be taken in 2017 by his administration       and by Congress.        If you met me you would see a ``young, vibrant, and       ambitious woman''--other people's words, not mine. Many       people and politicians in this country would meet me and not       assume that I rely on the ACA. I am not from a low-income       family, I don't live in an area that doesn't have adequate       medical facilities, and I appear well. I am, however, living       with multiple chronic illnesses. I suffer from asthma,       fibromyalgia, chronic urticaria, chronic migraines,       irritable bowel system, gastro-esophageal reflux disease,       and a rare-genetic kidney disorder.        I take multiple medications daily that keep me alive,       prevent further health complications, and that allow me to       take care of myself. I also seek other therapies to manage my       conditions, such as chiropractic care and physical therapy. I       currently have great health insurance, yet I still pay       hundreds of dollars a month just to give myself any quality       of life.        I read the Trump/Pence administration's health care plan       and I am aware of the efforts by the GOP to repeal Obamacare       and their readiness to do so now that President Trump has       taken office. I don't believe I have to explain to you why       this worries me.    No, you don't.         I won't go on a rant about why health care reform should be       about the people not the money (though I could). I will also       not talk about why we should have universal health care       (though I could). I am hoping that my story offers a slightly       different perspective on why certain aspects of the ACA       cannot be modified.        Please remind your fellow senators that millions of       Americans suffer from multiple chronic illnesses, many of       which are invisible, and that we are a minority that is often  [[Page S1039]]       forgotten. Many people are just like me. We are college       students and new graduates who have to learn to manage our       medical conditions before going out into the real world.        To do this, we may have to stay on our parents' insurance       until we are twenty-six years old. We are people who can only       work part-time jobs and will need insurance to help keep our       medical costs down. We may require expensive prescriptions       and numerous doctor visits a year; we cannot have a cap on       our care because our conditions are chronic and       unpredictable. We are people who will have to apply for       insurance with pre-existing conditions which should not be       held against us. We are thankful for preventative care       because it prevents illnesses that would exacerbate our other       conditions.        Health care is a business that we need but that we didn't       ask to be a part of. It is a business we all take part in,       whether we plan to or not. We are NOT burned-down houses--we       are citizens who provide meaningful contributions to our       country.        I hope that Congress can work together to continue to give       people like me a fighting chance.    I am with you on that. I hope Congress can work together to give  people like you a fighting chance.   I also got a letter from Christine in Canton, who wrote to me about  her son. She writes:         My oldest child is a 21-year-old college student (soon to       turn 22 in February), who is also transgender. He suffers       from anxiety and depression. He's been working very hard to       complete college while also seeking treatment for his mental       health issues. He sees a therapist weekly and has also been       hospitalized twice for mental health issues since he's been       in college.        Luckily, due to the Affordable Care Act, he is able to       remain on our insurance, where the co-payments for both       therapy and hospitalization are at least manageable. If he       were not to have coverage through our insurance, I'm not sure       that we could afford to pay for his treatment--and as a       college student, he certainly could not afford to pay for it.       It frightens me to think of what will happen to him if he is       not able to receive treatment to keep him healthy.        Like so many others covered by the Affordable Care Act, it       is a life or death situation. I need to know that you will       fight by any means possible to keep the Affordable Care Act       from getting repealed.        I also have a 19-year old college freshman and a 17-year       old high school senior. While they do not have the same       health issues as their brother, we all know how that can       change in an instant. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act       will also have consequences for them down the line.    I guarantee, Christine, I will be here to fight for you, to fight for  keeping the Affordable Care Act for you and for families like yours.   Denise from southeastern Massachusetts wrote to me about how her  family is fighting cancer. Here is what she said:         We are family of four, with three cancer survivors. My       husband is a childhood cancer survivor who is now fighting a       blood disorder and is a patient at Dana Farber. I am a three-      time cancer survivor. Having been diagnosed with breast       cancer at age 42 (with no family history), I have since had       two recurrences.        I have had radiation, five years of tamoxifen therapy, a       bilateral mastectomy, and reconstruction. My reconstruction       has been difficult, with five surgeries within 18 months. I       have been postponing another surgery due to cost, since my       insurance has changed for the worse. At age 23, my daughter       was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and underwent surgery       and seven months of chemotherapy.        We are a family that has always been proactive and       responsible in receiving regular health care. Now, my husband       and I have been rejected for long-term care. My daughter, who       has two children, pays a higher premium for life insurance       and has been denied cancer insurance. We are in a position       where we cannot even succeed in our attempts to take       responsibility for ourselves.        This outreach to you is a further attempt to do just that;       to maybe give you one more example of reality in your fight       for us. We are not whining; we are fortunate to be a close,       loving family that has had the strength to rally every time       adversity has struck.        But we are tired from the fight and very afraid for the       future. It is shocking to us that, in the richest country in       the world, after years of working, planning and saving, that       we are at the point of fearing a possible bankruptcy in our       later years. We also fear financial destruction for our hard-      working children due to uncovered medical expenses or the       possible exorbitant premiums of a high-risk insurance pool.        Please, please never tire in the fight for access to       comprehensive affordable healthcare. Good medical care should       not be a privilege for the rich, but a fundamental right for       all.    Boy, I am with you on that one, Denise. It is a fundamental right for  all, and that is what we will continue to fight for.   I also received a letter from Jenny in Worthington. And I want to  read you Jenny's entire letter because she really underlines what is at  stake in this fight.         My husband and I have spent our entire careers in the arts.       I write music for the theater; my husband is a novelist,       playwright, and freelance medical writer. We have two       children. We own a home. We paid back every dime on our       student loans and we contribute regularly to our self-funded       retirement accounts. We have no consumer debt. In short, we       are hardworking, fiscally responsible people.        We recognize the trade-offs that come with being our own       bosses. We enjoy the freedoms of self-employment, and take       seriously the extra burden that society imposes on us,       including making our own Social Security payments,       contributing to Medicare, and buying health care on the       individual market, something we have done our entire adult       lives.        When the Affordable Care Act was passed, we were thrilled.       For the first time, we had adequate coverage for our family.       Our deductibles shrank. We lost the dreaded co-insurance       provision and began to think that we could prepare       financially should we face the worst.        Or so we believed.        Our difficulties began in late 2014, when I was diagnosed       with breast cancer. Over the weeks that followed, I endured 5       surgeries, including a unilateral mastectomy and       reconstruction. Almost immediately after, I began to       experience complications. Since then, I've come to learn that       I was having a reaction to the silicone implant used in my       reconstruction and that was just the early stage of a complex       autoimmune condition that still lacks a name.        Back then, all I knew was that I was wracked with constant,       severe pain. I lost the ability to walk. I could no longer       think straight and I lost sight in my right eye. Luckily, we       stumbled upon an article by a Dutch team that had examined a       cohort of women suffering from the same condition. After       consulting with the lead author of the paper, we decided that       my implant was to blame, and we determined to have it       removed.        Although I experienced some relief immediately after ex-      plantation, I have never fully recovered. The joint pain and       exhaustion persist. I have shed more than a third of my body       weight. The battery of medications I take do little more than       keep my pain at bay, permitting me to drive my son to school       or shop for groceries, but not much more.        As for my artistic life, it has been put on hold. I have       unfinished commissions from two theaters--Chicago Shakespeare       Theater and Playwrights Horizons, in New York City--and both       institutions have been incredibly patient. Yet the truth is       that I have been unable to work for more than two years.        Severe cognitive impairment is a hallmark of my condition,       and I have serious problems with my short-term memory.       Holding the thread of conversation is incredibly difficult,       and I experience blinding headaches if I write music for more       than a couple of hours. Frequently, it feels as though       someone has reorganized my brain but forgotten to leave me       the instructions. It is frustrating; it's terrifying.        Only one thing has made it possible for me to survive this       at all: the coverage I receive through the ACA.        The day I got my cancer diagnosis, I was in the process of       re-certifying through the Massachusetts Health Connector. I       was thrilled when my local Navigator told me that thanks to       my new diagnosis, I qualify for Massachusetts' Breast and       Cervical Cancer Treatment Program, a Medicaid-backed       initiative designed to cover middle and low-income women       through their treatments. Not only would I be covered, but       our two children would also be insured by MassHealth, our       state's Medicaid program. Though my husband continued to       purchase care through a separate plan, this single event       saved our family from financial ruin.        Now, all of that stands to change. With the repeal of the       life-saving provisions guaranteed by the ACA, we are faced       with the complete erosion of our savings. The Republican       Congress has already voted to eliminate the ban on denying       individuals coverage on the basis of previously existing       conditions, meaning that I will most likely be uninsurable.       What will happen then? Will we go bankrupt? Will we lose our       home? How will I cope without my medications when we can no       longer afford to pay for them?        The passage of the ACA did more to shore up our little       family than any other piece of legislation in my lifetime. It       has enabled me to face my grave illness without worrying       whether cost would be a factor in my treatment or whether I       could try the next medication my doctors prescribed to       relieve my pain.        In sharing our story on social media, I have been       overwhelmed by the outpouring of concern from our tiny       community of theater professionals. The President of the       Dramatists' Guild, a professional association for theatre       artists, called me to offer the assistance of their Emergency       Fund should we need it. And while it is heartwarming to       receive the support of my professional community, the hard       truth is that even the most doggedly determined not-for-      profits can't possibly replace the broad social safety net of       the Federal government--a safety net Republicans are       determined to shred.        In every industrialized country but ours, health care is       considered an inalienable human right. It is abhorrent to       claim that  [[Page S1040]]       care is something Americans should have to ``shop for.''       Price-comparison shopping may seem like a wonderful market-      driven design, but in reality it forces us to confront the       terrifying arithmetic of balancing how much care we need       against what we can afford. The sicker one grows, the harder       it becomes to solve that equation.        We have no idea what the Republicans intend by way of a       replacement to the ACA. They refuse to specify, despite their       years of claiming that the ACA is a failure. They talk of       expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), though such       accounts represent nothing but a disingenuous transfer of the       cost to the consumer. Even if such an approach made sense,       how far would $6,750 (the current HSA limit) go in meeting       actual health care costs? That amount would be wiped out       after a single visit to the emergency room.        What's more, where do they expect sick Americans--those       fighting for their lives and unable to work precisely because       of their illnesses--to suddenly uncover $6,750 to sink into a       tax-sheltered HSA?        Clearly, this idea has been put forward by people who do       not depend on their health insurance for their very lives.       They pretend that this sort of thing will save ``our       system,'' but their proposal is like offering a patient an       Advil for an amputation--laughably inadequate at best; an       utter horror at worst.        What's more, efforts like the expansion of Medicaid under       the ACA have already saved us. Or many of us. Certainly me,       in any case. A Republican friend wrote me recently, venting       about the ``third-world'' coverage Medicaid provides. What he       had to say was ignorant and false. Medicaid isn't failing. To       the contrary, it has saved my life and the lives of many       others who have simply had the misfortune of falling ill. And       isn't that, after all, one of the primary functions of       government? To care for its citizens and return them to the       ranks of the healthy and productive?        We have no idea what the year ahead holds for us. It is       likely we will face health premiums of $24,000 or more for a       low-level plan. Our premiums will consume 30% of our income,       more than our mortgage. Despite MassHealth, we shelled out       nearly $15,000 for uncovered medical expenses in 2016, and we       are already on track to surpass that number this year. On top       of everything else, this is the year our daughter starts       college. I'm not the typical Medicaid patient that people       seem so fond of demonizing, nor am I some poster child of the       ACA. I am simply one of the countless individuals whose story       does not fit the narrative the Republicans are attempting to       feed us about the ACA and about what it means to be sick in       America. Medicaid is on the chopping block not because it is       failing, but because the people who benefit from it too often       fail to speak up on their own behalf. Their silence has       nothing do with a lack of will or words. They are simply too       busy struggling to survive.        Medicaid benefits our poorest, yet it also assists those       slightly higher on the income ladder--people like me who       would vastly prefer to be thriving without it. Many more       people than you suspect have turned to it in a time of need.       They aren't merely characters in some musical or play. Trust       me, I know. They are your friends and neighbors. They are       families whose lives have been unended by illness. This is       what happened to my family. And, with a single diagnosis, it       could be your family too.    Thank you. Thank you for writing. This is why we are here to fight.   I also heard from Kaitlyn, from Cambridge, who said the ACA has  allowed her to continue pursuing her postdoctoral research. She says:         I am postdoctoral fellow at MIT, and I have a pre-existing       condition. In 2012, during my second year of grad school, I       started having debilitating pain in my abdomen. The pain was       so bad I couldn't eat or sleep, and I lost 30 pounds over two       months. The pain was so bad I couldn't wait the full 3 months       to see a specialist, and I went to the ER and finally got a       diagnosis for an autoimmune disease and began treatment.        However, my condition was so advanced that a little over a       year later I needed an emergency surgery while I was visiting       family out of state. I spent six nights in the hospital and       rang up a bill in excess of $50,000. Luckily, I was 25 and       still on my parent's insurance. Additionally, I was doubly       insured by the student health insurance from the University       of California, for which I was automatically enrolled through       my graduate program. Other than a $200 deductible, my       hospital bill was paid in full.        Now that I have a chronic illness, having quality       healthcare and regular checkups is vital to staying healthy       and productive. My medication, Humira, costs $5,000 a month       out-of-pocket, which was more than double my grad school       stipend. With insurance, I only pay $25 a month. Though       surgery helped me tame the inflation in my intestines, my       disease began to express itself as arthritis in my joints.       The pain was so bad that one Christmas I canceled my trip       home to see my family and spent the whole time alone on my       couch. I had a bad reaction to some of the medications and       became so severely anemic that I needed a blood transfusion.       Additionally, one of the medications I take causes severe       birth defects. So I needed an IUD to prevent pregnancy.        Easily, all these conditions could become overwhelmingly       expensive. But with my student health insurance through the       University of California, I could afford it. The premium was       $300 per month, part of which was covered by the university.       My medications cost $110 a month, and I had a yearly out-of-      pocket maximum of $2,000. While I didn't get my insurance       through the exchanges, the other conditions of the ACA which       determine the minimum quality of care made it possible for my       care to be affordable.        By having proper treatment and care, I can be a productive       member of society. I have received my PhD in Applied       Mathematics and my research contributes to the design of       medical devices that can be used for cancer screening. I am       able to mentor young girls and encourage them to study math       and science. And who knows--one of them may cure cancer one       day! Since I am no longer in pain and I am not in debt, I was       able to find a prestigious job after graduation. When a state       provides for the health of its people, they can thrive at       home and at work. It is not only the moral choice, but also a       good choice for the economy.    Kaitlyn, thanks for writing and thanks for being one of the big  success stories under the Affordable Care Act. This is what we are  fighting for tonight.   I also heard from a young woman in Somerville named Samantha. Here is  what she wrote:         I've been dealing with severe mental health issues since I       was a kid. I am now 27. In that time, I have been through       numerous hospitalizations, residential treatment, day       treatment, intensive outpatient treatment, and outpatient       treatment.        When I was 18, I had to drop out of college and spent 3       months in residential treatment for my eating disorder. The       year prior, I spent 2 months in residential treatment and 6       months between day and intensive outpatient treatment, and I       had been in therapy for 4 years.        Due to Massachusetts law, I was still covered by my       parent's insurance, but the Massachusetts health care reform       didn't stop insurance companies from imposing lifetime       limits. At 18 years old, fighting for my life, I overheard my       parents discussing lifetime limits in regard to my health       care. I don't know how much all that treatment cost, or how       much of my lifetime limit I had consumed. For the next 7       years, I was in and out of treatment at various levels.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend my time by 10  minutes, if I might, to finish my stories.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Thank you.         In 2014, when I had my own health care, I had a bad       relapse. For the first time I was paying for my own       treatment. I had health insurance through my employer that       was really good, but even with that, for 1 month of       residential treatment, 1 month of day treatment, and 3 months       of intensive outpatient, plus therapy, a nutritionist, a       psychiatrist and medication--all crucial to my recovery--my       out-of-pocket health care costs reached almost $10,000.        These days, I am much more stable and have remained in       relatively good health, but all because of the continued       support I get from my therapist, psychiatrist, and doctor. I       can only imagine how much money has been spent and how close       I'd be to my lifetime limit if those were still in place. And       of course, all that adds up to being a ``pre-existing''       condition.        The simple fact is that I would most likely be dead today       were it were not for the protections provided by the ACA, and       if I lose those protections, if I have another relapse, I       will either end up dead or unemployed and mired in debt.    Samantha, thank you for writing. Thank you for fighting. That is why  we are on the floor of the Senate tonight, to continue to fight for the  Affordable Care Act and to continue to fight against cuts to Medicare  and Medicaid. This is what is at stake for families in Massachusetts.   As Jennifer said in her letter: This is us. This is now, and this is  real. Congressman Price wants to cut more than $1 trillion from  Medicare and Medicaid. But I am not giving up, because I am here to  fight for Lee and Meg and Jill and Marika's baby Jack.   Congressman Price wants to rip up the behavioral health protections  in the Affordable Care Act. But I am not giving up, because I am here  to fight for Christine's son and Jackie and Samantha.   Congressman Price wants to get rid of the ACA's ban on discriminating  against individuals with preexisting conditions. But I am not giving  up, because I am here to fight for Jenny and Kaitlyn and Olivia and  Denise and Jennifer.   I will fight for every one of them and for the tens of millions of  people who are counting on Medicare and who are in need of Medicaid to  pay nursing home bills and to help with home health care for people  with disabilities and who need that Medicaid money for children with  serious problems. I will  [[Page S1041]]  fight for every one of them. Where are three Republicans who will do  the right thing and fight alongside me? That is what tonight is all  about.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.
