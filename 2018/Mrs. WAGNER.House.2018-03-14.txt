 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for yielding.  My hat is off to the vice chair of the Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee, my good friend, Congressman Tipton, for this fine piece  of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1116, the TAILOR  Act, and I urge its immediate passage.   According to the most recent estimates, the 147 new regulations  created under the Dodd-Frank Act have resulted in $40 billion in  additional regulatory costs. Unfortunately, this one-size-fits-all  approach trickles down to consumers and small businesses in my home  State of Missouri, who, for years, have struggled to keep up with these  unnecessary burdens.   I would like to take a moment to share how those burdens have had a  real impact on the constituents of Missouri's Second Congressional  District.   Due to new regulatory burdens imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, a  local credit union in my district contacted my office to tell us how  they were forced to redirect their efforts away from helping their  customers and into bureaucratic studies of how the new rules affected  the credit union. Third-party costs skyrocketed, as the credit union  was forced to spend more money on outside vendors and lawyers for  guidance. Instead of providing their customers with new products or  decreased costs, employees shifted their focus toward compliance  efforts.   Congressman Tipton's bill, which enjoys bipartisan support, is yet  another example of Congress getting it right. This legislation will  focus on the institutions model and risk profile, which will, in turn,  allow financial institutions like the one I previously mentioned to  focus their time and resources on the communities that they serve.   Again, I am proud to support my good friend from Colorado,  Congressman Tipton. I urge all Members to support his bill.
