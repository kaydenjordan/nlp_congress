 Madam Speaker, I truly hope that my Democrat  colleagues don't believe the garbage that they have been spouting, but  I would say that they probably do. Unfortunately, for months Democrats  have been pursuing a radical partisan agenda that contains the most  expensive piece of legislation in the history of Congress, all while  ignoring our Nation's debt. Now they are scrambling.   First they claimed it was Republicans' responsibility to cosign a  loan for their reckless spending bill, even though they control the  White House, the House, and the Senate. Then they tried adding a debt  ceiling increase to a bill to keep the government open, knowing it  would fall on its face in the United States Senate.   Then they argued there wasn't enough time to raise the debt limit on  their own, even though they have time and they have tools to do it. In  fact, last weekend the House Budget Republicans gave Democrats a chance  to address the debt limit by demanding their budget in a markup be  revised. They refused. Then we offered to postpone the markup for just  48 hours to allow them to address the debt limit in reconciliation.   Since you love to do everything else in reconciliation, why not to  raise the people's debt? You are spending it. It is time for you to get  a loan for it. Folks, we are in a crisis right now. My counterpart on  the House Budget Committee made the statement: We should raise the debt  a gazillion dollars.   This is what we are dealing with, folks. The America people are fed  up. They want fiscal accountability. We need a reasonable body in this  House.
