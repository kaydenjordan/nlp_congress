 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  [[Page H2997]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act.   The world has changed, my friends, since our last reauthorization of  VAWA. This bill updates VAWA to cover new victims of domestic violence  that were not covered in our prior bill and desperately need  protection.   In addition, the #MeToo movement has made women more determined  concerning their rights than ever before.   Perhaps the most desperate need of victims of domestic violence is  for sanctuary, shelter, emergency housing, and affordable housing, all  in short supply.   Victims who stay with an abuser risk everything: homelessness, loss  of custody of children, more abuse, and even injury and death.   Victims who remain with an abuser in 40 to 50 percent of cases also  see their children abused.   Forty to as high as 70 percent of female homicide victims were  murdered by their husbands or boyfriends in a relationship where there  had been ongoing abuse.   Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, the most serious issue confronting victims is  no alternative place to live or even to shelter. One-third of survivors  become homeless immediately after separating from partners.   Our bill bars the eviction of the victim until suitable housing or a  termination of a lease without penalty can occur. Grants to help  homeless victims achieve stability are necessary to prevent recurrent  bouts of homelessness from domestic violence.   This reauthorization is desperately needed without delay. I strongly  urge its passage.
