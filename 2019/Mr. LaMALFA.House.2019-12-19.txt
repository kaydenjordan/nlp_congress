 Mr. Speaker, last night we were in the twilight zone,  and now we are in a parallel universe today. Very interesting what we  are doing here.   I come from the high-tax State of California, where we bear the cost  of so many tax increases from Sacramento. So all we are doing here is  justifying the increase in the car tax, the increase in the gas tax,  and spending the money on a dead high-speed rail project, the increase  from a mysterious gas tax, and the cap-and-trade tax.    All we are going to do here is reward bad behavior in California and  five or six other high-tax States.   Instead, let's get back on track with doing things that cause jobs to  happen, as the bill that our Democrat colleagues don't like. They  didn't like Proposition 13, which has saved homes in California. They  have been complaining about it ever since it was passed.   Now they are trying to eviscerate Prop 13 and raise taxes on  businesses. This will justify that ability to do that. Don't send a  message that they can raise taxes in California or other States any  more by what happens in this place.
