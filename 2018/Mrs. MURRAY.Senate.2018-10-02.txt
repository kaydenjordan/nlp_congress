 Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the YWCA for its  dedication to supporting women, girls, and their families in honor of  the organization's 160th anniversary.   YWCA is one of the oldest, largest, and most inclusive organizations  in our Nation, and it has maintained a long history of distinguished  service. The organization has been the forefront at some of the most  important social movements of our time, from civil rights and women's  equality, to healthcare reform and gender-based violence prevention.   Nationwide, YWCA has 210 local associations across 47 States and the  District of Columbia that help to empower 2 million women, girls, and  their families each year. In my home State of Washington, there are 11  YWCA local associations, all of which have been proudly serving women  and girls for over 60 years. These YWCAs protect and empower hundreds  of thousands of Washingtonian women and children each year, and I am  grateful for their work.   YWCA is the largest network of domestic violence service providers in  our Nation and provides critical services to more than half a million  women and girls each year, including support programs for survivors of  sexual assault and domestic violence. Now, more than ever, this is  vital to ensuring the safety and well-being of survivors across the  country. Additionally, YWCA associations offer economic empowerment  programs that engage over 260,000 women and racial justice education  and training programs that engage over 160,000 people.   I stand today in strong support of YWCA's mission to eliminate  racism, empower women, stand up for social justice, promote peace, help  families, and strengthen local communities.   I offer congratulations to YWCA on your 160 years of improving the  lives of women and girls across the United States.   Thank you.
