 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 5389 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, this is a reckless inflation bill that  will increase drug prices. Yes, you can write that down. Just like the  ACA has driven up healthcare costs, this bill will increase drug  prices.   With a limited window to recoup R&D, manufacturers will have to  increase their launch prices. It will also eliminate incentives for  generics to come to market and gain market share by pricing lower than  the branded product.   Perhaps even worse, this bill will delay, if not eliminate, new  innovative drugs for life-threatening illnesses, like Alzheimer's and  cancers. This is why our amendment excludes two categories of drugs  from price controls: Medicare Part D's six protected classes and the  FDA's breakthrough therapy designation drugs.   By voting ``yes,'' you will be protecting patients with mental  illness, organ transplants, Alzheimer's, cancers, and HIV. A ``no''  vote is a vote to never see a cure for Alzheimer's.   Rather than a healthcare system that offers Americans breakthrough  medicines, this reckless tax-and-spend bill will force Americans to  settle for end-of-life care, and that is just wrong.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
