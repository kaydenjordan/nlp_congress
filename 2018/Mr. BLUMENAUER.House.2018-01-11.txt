 Mr. Speaker, Congress has sometimes made the  difficult job of the intelligence community harder by not providing  adequate controls and oversight. We have created a vast Department of  Homeland Security, a vast security sprawling intelligence network that  results in the collection of data that my friend, Mr. Poe, talked  about. Yes, warrants can sometimes be inconvenient, but we have judged  it as a small price to pay to protect Americans from government  overreach.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this amendment.
