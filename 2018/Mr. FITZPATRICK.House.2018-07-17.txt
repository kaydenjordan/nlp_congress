 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a program in  Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that brings together members of our  community to celebrate artistic expression and economic opportunity.   The Lansdale Mural Arts Program seeks to beautify areas in Lansdale  by painting murals on buildings in need of rehabilitation. By improving  the aesthetics of many of these beloved community landmarks, the  Lansdale Mural Arts Program hopes to enhance the economic and social  value of the services and goods that the building's tenants provide.   Started in 2013, the Lansdale Mural Arts Program has painted the  walls of local businesses: Chantilly Floral, Wes Carver Electric, The  Underground at Round Guys Brewing Company, and perhaps the most  profound, an American flag mural at the Lansdale VFW Post.   Currently, the program is looking to continue its work on the  American Legion Post 206 building, and I applaud the Lansdale Mural  Arts Program for their work, especially organizers Margie Booz and  Ellen Foulke for their thoughtfulness and dedication to our community.            Recognizing the Ann Silverman Community Health Clinic     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a nonprofit  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that serves to protect the  health and dignity of residents across our community. The Ann Silverman  Community Health Clinic in Doylestown provides medical and dental care,  along with social services to low-income and impoverished individuals  at no cost.   Offering these critical services will not be possible without the  tireless efforts of a highly skilled staff and volunteer doctors and  nurses. These dedicated professionals deserve our recognition, and,  recently, Dr. Kieran Cody of Bucks County Orthopedic Specialists was  named Volunteer Physician of the Year for his services to the clinic  and his patients over the past 10 years.   Throughout his tenure, Dr. Cody has performed countless surgeries and  MRI services, following in the footsteps of his father, Dr. Kevin Cody,  who has spent 19 years volunteering at the clinic.   I thank Drs. Kieran and Kevin Cody for their service, and I extend my  gratitude to the Ann Silverman Community Health Clinic executive  director, Sally Fabian-Oresic for her leadership.     Recognizing Charles Briskin and Rachel Kohlbrenner of the Shir Ami                                Congregation     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize two members of our  community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who will be continuing their  service to the Jewish faith at Shir Ami Congregation in Newtown.   Charles Briskin and Rachel Kohlbrenner both joined Shir Ami as rabbi  and cantor, respectively.   Rabbi Briskin, who for the past 10 years has led Temple Beth El in  San Pedro, California, was ordained in 2001 and studied at the Hebrew  Union College Jewish Institute of Religion.   Cantor Kohlbrenner previously served as cantor for the Central  Synagogue-Beth Emeth in Rockville Centre, New York, and studied at the  Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music of Hebrew Union College.   I welcome Rabbi Charles Briskin and Cantor Rachel Kohlbrenner to our  community and wish them all the best as they embark on the newest  chapters of their career.   And I thank their predecessors, Rabbi Joel Simon and Cantor Emeritus  Mark Elson for their service and spiritual wisdom that they have  blessed our community with for so long.                            ____________________
