 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  6363, which will prevent a government shutdown.   Over the past several months, House Republicans have been hard at  work passing appropriations bills to cover over 75 percent of Federal  discretionary spending. We also passed the supplemental appropriations  bill to support our ally, Israel.   As a chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, I am proud of our Members'  work to pass a bipartisan fiscal year `24 Defense spending bill with a  high level of Member input.   However, the Senate has been unable to pass all their appropriations  bills in a timely manner and, unfortunately, this means we need more  time to complete the FY24 appropriations process.   H.R. 6363 extends current spending to January and February of next  year. This split approach incentivizes the Senate to negotiate with us  on all 12 bills.   For our military, this bill ensures our troops continue their mission  without fear of missing a paycheck. It also includes anomalies to keep  the Columbia-class submarine, which is the top modernization priority  of the Department of Defense, United States Navy, on schedule.   For those of us who have been in Congress for a shutdown, we have  seen firsthand the damage it does to our military readiness. A shutdown  would prevent any contract changes or new contracts for the entire  Department of Defense. It would require Active-Duty servicemembers to  report to work without pay. It would close essential base services for  military families. It would reduce training, and it would create a long  list of other hardships for the United States military.   As threats like China and Russia continue their provocation, we must  avoid these failures at all costs. As an appropriator, I know how  imperative it is that Congress carries out its constitutional  responsibility and passes the 12 appropriations bills as soon as  possible.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge support of this bill.
