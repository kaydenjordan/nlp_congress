 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of my  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   It is with great honor that I rise today to coanchor this CBC Special  Order hour along with my distinguished colleague, Representative Sheila  Cherfilus-McCormick.   For the next 60 minutes, members of the CBC will spotlight Caribbean  American Heritage Month, a celebration of the significant impact  Caribbean Americans have made in shaping our Nation.   This occasion isn't just important to the CBC, Congress, and our  constituents. It resonates deeply with all Americans.   It is time to appreciate the enduring spirit of Caribbean Americans,  whose influence spans across arts, sciences, politics, and  entrepreneurship. We aim to heighten cultural awareness, honor the  diverse Caribbean cultures, and acknowledge their ongoing  contributions.   Ultimately, Caribbean American Heritage Month reflects a vital piece  of the American narrative that deserves recognition and understanding  for all citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), the  chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the honorable  gentlewoman from the State of New York (Ms. Clarke).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable  Congresswoman Yvette Clarke for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus- McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here to  celebrate our Caribbean Heritage Month. It is also an honor to be here  coanchoring with Jonathan Jackson from Illinois, and I say a very  special thank you to our chairman for allowing us to be here and speak  about all the accomplishments of Caribbean Americans.    As both the first Haitian-American Democrat elected to Congress and a  permanent member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I am firmly  committed to supporting strong U.S.-Caribbean ties. However, we cannot  forget that the success of this global partnership depends directly on  Haiti's prosperity and its ability to triumph in the face of  challenges.   Today, Haiti has found itself engulfed in chaos. The stability of the  country and the preservation of its democratic institutions must remain  of paramount importance to the United States.   Last week, Guyana and the Dominican Republic issued a joint  declaration emphasizing their commitment to enhancing bilateral  relationships between their two countries. The reiteration of their  commitment to address pressing challenges such as food insecurity,  energy security, and climate change is inspirational, and as the United  States, we must be doing the same.   Both nations reaffirmed that Haiti is an important member of the  Caribbean family of nations. They pledged the full support of their  governments toward the achievement of political stability in Haiti. The  regional commitment is to be applauded and continued.   The ongoing situation in Haiti is far too unstable, and recognition  on the world stage is vital as we work to bring an end to this crisis.   It pains me to see Haiti in these times of struggle. The country now  finds itself at one of the lowest points in its history, battling a  surge of gang violence. Public health challenges, along with  catastrophic hunger, stoke the flames of instability.   As a neighbor, we have a responsibility to address this situation and  respond accordingly.   I am pleased that President Biden nominated Dennis Hankins, Foreign  Policy Advisor to the National Guard Bureau, to serve as U.S.  Ambassador to Haiti. This nomination demonstrates that the Biden-Harris  administration recognizes America's role as an ally of Haiti to respond  to the volatility of the situation today.   Throughout Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we must continue to  recognize the challenges that Haiti is currently grappling with and  where our Nation can lend support in these efforts.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my colleagues in recognizing  and giving special commendation to Caribbean-American Heritage Month.   From Shirley Chisholm to Malcolm X, from Congresswoman Yvette Clarke  to Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, to the great W.E.B. Du  Bois, to CBC chair, Mr. Steven Horsford, and to Sheila Jackson Lee,  from the founder of the city of Chicago, Jean Baptiste Du Sable, to the  great general in Haiti, Toussaint Louverture, here we are.   People who come to this country from the Caribbean have helped to  make America more vibrant and successful. This is because Caribbean  Americans are some of the most creative and hardworking people in the  world. This cannot be debated and most certainly cannot be denied.   However, it is really the power of the Caribbean egalitarian spirit  that has really helped to make America a better place. People who come  from the Caribbean are raised in cultures that believe in family and  faith, and they believe that all men and women are truly created equal.   Because of the deep moral values at work in Caribbean culture, people  who hail from this part of the world fundamentally believe that we are  all God's children and that all of us deserve dignity and respect.   This drive for excellence and the commitment to human dignity has  continually given rise to some of the most extraordinary individuals,  each of them adding to the possibilities of America and all of them  expanding the reach of freedom and democracy in this remarkable  country.   This is why I am so glad that in 2005 this body passed legislation to  officially make June Caribbean-American Heritage Month. When this body  passed that legislation, it gave recognition to people who too long had  been overlooked. However, today, we are righting that wrong. We are  correcting the account, as it were. This is important because I believe  that every community should be celebrated and that every heritage  should be venerated and given the dignity that it deserves.   Perhaps somebody needs to remind the Governor of Florida that when we  celebrate the heritage of other people we are, in fact, celebrating  ourselves.   Somebody needs to remind the Governor of Florida that this country  has relied on the diversity of its citizens in order to become the  Nation we are today. Somebody needs to remind him that different does  not mean deficient.    It took a Caribbean American to lead the U.S. military to victory in  the Iraq war by the name of Colin Powell. It was a Caribbean American  who created a national banking system in this country by creating the  Federal Reserve. It was a Caribbean American who made his home in  Harlem and preached with such intensity and integrity that he gave  African Americans the courage to be themselves.   America is a garden comprised of many flowers. All of them are  complicated, and all of them are beautiful in their own way. The  texture, the colors, and the sizes may be different, but the radiance  remains the same.   No matter what white supremacy may try to say, the brightness of  America is the consequence of a multiplicity of colors. We may speak  different languages, we may come from different places, and we may eat  different food, but we are all mortal, we are all dependent upon the  benefits clean air and clean water, we all deserve to be loved, and we  all want the best for our children.   If we do not learn how to live together as brothers and sisters, then  we shall surely perish together as fools.   When we celebrate Caribbean-American Heritage Month, it is a  veneration of the important and ongoing contributions of these  significant Americans. It is by no means a denigration of anyone else.   While it is true that we are all Americans, it is no less the case,  however, that each of us brings something different to America. The  capacity for difference is the thing that makes America successful and  strong.   What would this country be without Earl Graves and the great Harry  Belafonte?                                time  1945    What would this country be like without Beyonce or Eric Holder,  Cicely Tyson, Alicia Keys, Sheryl Lee Ralph, and Mr. Sidney Poitier?  All of them are descendants of the people who came to this country from  the Caribbean.   Caribbean Americans have shaped this Nation's culture and political  direction since its founding, and thank God for it.   Let us never forget those who live in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We  also honor the Honorable Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett. These are  citizens of the United States. Yes, those in the Virgin Islands are  citizens of America. They are a part of our country, they are a part of  who we are, and they are no less helping to shape what we hope to  become.   They too sing America. They too desire to flourish. They too deserve  the benefits of democracy. As much as anybody born in Boston or  Atlanta, or as much as anyone living in Dallas or Little Rock, American  citizens who live in the Virgin Islands are no less a part of who we  are. They are a part of American story.   The notes they bring to this concert of opportunity make the music  sweet and worthy of our listening ears. I would invite my colleagues  and Americans, more generally, to spend time in conversation with  Caribbean Americans.   When you do, you will discover that the love they have for this  country, in  [[Page H2737]]  spite of its tortured history with the people from the Caribbean, is a  remarkable manifestation of both courage and patriotism.   In spite of this country's morbid preoccupation with racism and white  supremacy, Americans of Caribbean descent have time and time again took  their place in the dark shadows of war in order to fight for our  Nation's freedom, and today we remember them.   We speak well of their names. We give honor to those among them who  died to make us free. How dare we not honor them? How dare we not sing  their praises?   As the Bible says: These are they that have come through the great  tribulation, and have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb.   They are as important to the fabric of this country as those who came  from Europe and other places around the world. Therefore, it is  altogether fitting that we enshrine their greatness and celebrate their  heritage without restraint.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus- McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  invaluable contributions of the South Florida Caribbean American  community as we celebrate Caribbean American Heritage Month. This month  provides us with a valuable opportunity to honor the rich culture and  heritage and the remarkable accomplishments of the Caribbean Americans,  particularly in South Florida.   The Caribbean American community has played a significant role in  shaping South Florida's identity. Today, the greater Ft. Lauderdale  metropolitan area has one of the largest Caribbean migrant populations  nationwide. South Florida is home to immigrants from many Caribbean  countries, including Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Dominica,  Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, among others.   The vibrancy of the Caribbean culture touches every part of our  region. We see it in action at spaces like Island SPACE Caribbean  Museum in Plantation, which elevates the profile of Caribbean art,  history, and culture throughout South Florida and the broader diaspora.   We can taste it in the restaurants that dot our street corners,  serving soul-warming jerk chicken and oxtails and all types of  delectable items that we find remind us of our childhood kitchen  tables.   The Caribbean American community has long been an integral part of  the economic fabric of South Florida, contributing to its prosperity.  Caribbean Americans have opened their own businesses and created jobs,  making South Florida a vibrant and thriving region.   During this month, we must recognize challenges currently faced by  Florida's Caribbean American community. Governor Ron DeSantis recently  signed into law a cruel immigration law that pushes the American Dream  further out of reach for Florida and immigrant communities.   For immigrants seeking a better life in Florida, many of whom who  have come to the U.S. for economic opportunities and fleeing violence,  this law is most certainly a slap in their face.   As we celebrate Caribbean American Heritage Month, let us always  treat immigrants with the dignity they deserve and welcome them.  Together, let us reaffirm our commitment to recognizing the immense and  continued contribution of the Caribbean American community.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shine a light  on an often-overlooked chapter of our great Nation's history. As we  gather here in the heart of our Republic, it is important to announce  that the very fabric of our Nation was woven not only with the thread  of our own courage and determination, but also with the substantial  contributions of our neighbors.   In this Special Order hour, I wish to recognize the invaluable  contributions of the Caribbean, particularly Haiti, in shaping American  history.   During the tumultuous years of the American Revolution, while our  forefathers were drafting the blueprints of this great Nation, Haiti,  known then as French Saint-Domingue, was one of the wealthiest colonies  in the world. It was the jewel of the French empire, a beacon of  economic prosperity in the region. Their wealth, however, was built on  the grim reality of a brutal slave society.   This prosperous colony was our silent partner in the fight for  independence. The French, in a bid to safeguard Saint-Domingue from  British capture, provided considerable support to the American cause,  to the tune of better than $9 billion in current U.S. dollars. This  financial assistance was a decisive factor in our victory in the  Revolutionary War.   But it wasn't just monetary aid that the Haitian community provided  America and its founding. Over 500 Haitians, free men of color, fought  shoulder to shoulder with American colonists and French troops in  pivotal battles such as the battle of Savannah in 1779.    The colony also served as a vital transit point for arms, gunpowder,  and supplies from France, a lifeline that often made the difference  between victory and defeat.   The irony is palpable. The fight for freedom in our own land was  bolstered by a colony built on the brutal enslavement of individuals.  These individuals later led a successful revolution of their own,  resulting in Haiti becoming the second American nation to declare  independence in 1804.   Despite the early recognition and support from the United States, the  Jefferson administration banned trade with the newly independent Haiti  in 1806, a decision that greatly hindered Haiti's economic prospects.   In light of recent crises in Haiti, I urge you to remember this  intertwined history. Our fight for independence was supported, in part,  by Haiti's resources and its people and their courage. We have a  historical debt to Haiti, a moral obligation to assist in Haiti's  recovery and long-term prosperity.   Haiti does not come to us as a debtor. We are, in fact, a debtor to  Haiti. Haiti is our creditor, having helped create our independence.   As we navigate the labyrinth of our complex relations with the  Caribbean, let us not forget the sacrifices made and the solidarity  demonstrated by our Haitian brethren. In acknowledging this, we do not  merely pay tribute to our shared past, but also set the stage for a  future defined by mutual respect and collaboration.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus- McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, as we recognize Caribbean  American Heritage Month, I rise today to express my strong support for  the Haiti Criminal Collusion Transparency Act. This bipartisan and  bicameral legislation is an important step in holding accountable those  who have fueled violence in Haiti, and it sends a clear message that  America and Americans stand with the Haitian people.   This bill, which I am proud to cosponsor with several of my  colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would ensure the  Secretary of State sanctions Haiti's economic and political elites who  regularly use gangs as levers of power. This legislative body would  receive regular reports on the nature of the relationship between  Haiti's corrupt elite and the heinous gangs that they have colluded  with.   Recent headlines underscore just how grim the situation in Haiti has  grown. As a result of the worsening gang violence, Haitians are now  taking matters into their own hands. Many have turned to vigilante  justice, using makeshift weapons to root out suspected gang members. At  least 160 suspected gang members were killed between April 24 and May  24.   This is by no means a viable or a safe long-term solution to gang  violence. Vigilante justice leaves open the potential for innocent  individuals to be wrongfully characterized as criminals. Haiti's  government must be equipped to deal with this reign of terror on its  own, without depending on its citizens to take up arms.   The Haiti Criminal Collusion Act, which has been endorsed by the  National Haitian American Elected Officials Network here in the United  States, is a desperately needed legislative solution that can assist  our brothers and sisters in Haiti.   By shining a spotlight on bad actors imposing sanctions on the worst  offenders, the United States is sending a clear signal that it will not  tolerate individuals who exploit their positions of power for personal  gain, and that they will not tolerate individuals who terrorize the  Haitian people.  [[Page H2738]]    As we begin Caribbean American Heritage Month, I urge my colleagues  to join me in supporting this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, you have heard from our  distinguished colleagues about our interest in celebrating Caribbean  American Heritage Month, all issues of great importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus, our constituents, Congress, and all  Americans tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 56 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, June 6, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
