 Mr. Speaker, a very special friend and constituent of mine  turned 100 years old last week. Her name is Marina Metevelis, but back  home, she is better known as Tulsa's ``Rosie the Riveter.''   Marina took the iconic red bandana for the first time and wrapped it  around her head when she was 16 years old in 1941, when she reported to  work on the B-17 Flying Fortress bombers in the aftermath of the attack  on Pearl Harbor.   Marina joined the ``Rosie the Riveter'' sisterhood that day and stood  shoulder to shoulder with an army of extraordinary women who became the  most formidable munition and war supply manufacturers in modern  history.   They played an integral role in World War II, for which the entire  world is grateful.   Marina still wears the red bandana to this day. She hasn't slowed  down for one second, working to forge a better community for Tulsa and  continuing her lifelong mission to support our veterans by raising  funds for numerous veteran organizations.   Happy birthday, Marina. Thank you for your service to our Nation, and  may God bless you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so that  we can immediately consider H.R. 6858.   This administration has sent desperate requests for oil from  oppressive regimes like Iran and Venezuela. It is past time the Biden  administration start making those frantic calls to Oklahoma instead of  OPEC or even my friends in Texas instead of Tehran. Until that happens,  gas prices will continue to soar, and hardworking Americans will  suffer.   While Putin continues to wage war on Ukraine, exposing our dependence  on Russian energy, Biden continues to wage war on our domestic oil and  gas industry that provides sustainable, reliable energy to the American  people.   This week, Biden doubled down his attack by releasing a budget that  includes an astonishing $45 billion in tax hikes on American energy  producers.   Seventy percent of goods in America are moved by trucks. An increase  in gas prices will continue to be passed down on the food and products  that all Americans buy. Let me be clear: Biden's energy policy is  hurting all Americans and not just at the pump.   Whether you like it or not, traditional energy powers our country.  Oil and gas are essential to power our homes and, yes, provide the  energy to power electric vehicles.   Biden's war on energy poses a threat to all of us. It is imperative  that the Federal Government stop villainizing the industry that powers  our world.   Global energy markets are complicated, but one thing is certain: If  policymakers continue to impose barriers on domestic energy production,  prices will continue to rise. Therefore, we need to instill confidence  in the industry that plays such a crucial role in our economy by  restoring stability and consistency with policies that prioritize  American energy production.   Investors and business leaders make their decisions based not only on  the policies debated and voted on in D.C. but also on the rhetoric from  public officials. What happens in this Chamber impacts businesses, but  also what we go out and say on cable TV.    Trust me, I was a business leader for 35 years. Today's political  climate will directly influence future investment decisions, especially  in heavily regulated industries like energy.   The Biden administration has been sending mixed messages. My  colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they are concerned about  the high prices reflected by the weak oil and gas supply, but their  actions tell a different story. They aggressively push a plan to crush  oil and gas production entirely.   Their video simply doesn't match their audio, which is why the  American people have lost faith in Democratic leadership.   We must restore sanity and pursue energy dominance once again on the  world stage.
