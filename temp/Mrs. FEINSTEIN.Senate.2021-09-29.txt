 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S. Air  Travel Public Safety Act. This bill would require airline passengers  flying domestically to provide proof that they are fully vaccinated and  also encourage more healthcare workers to be vaccinated against COVID- 19.   The rise of the Delta variant and the latest COVID-19 surge in the  United States continue to hit hospitals hard, and nearly all patients  who are hospitalized or dying from COVID-19 are unvaccinated.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  surveillance data has shown that even after the more transmissible  Delta variant became dominant during the summer, people who were fully  vaccinated were still about five times less likely to be infected and  more than 10 times less likely to be admitted to the hospital or die  compared to those unvaccinated.   Further CDC studies have supported that our vaccines remain effective  against the severe consequences of COVID-19. For this and other  reasons, we must take every opportunity to get all eligible Americans  vaccinated as quickly as possible.   We know that travel is a significant factor in the spread of COVID- 19. According to a study published in the ``Proceedings of the National  Academy of Sciences,'' people traveling to other counties or States  last year contributed to higher COVID-19 case numbers in their  destination communities. This was especially true during the 2020  summer and winter holidays.   As friends and family gathered together for Thanksgiving, in  particular, we experienced the start of major back-to-back surges that  would culminate into the highest daily cases, hospitalizations, and  deaths reported nationally during the pandemic.   While scientists aren't expecting COVID-19 peaks to reach these  levels again, hospitals may still find themselves overwhelmed if large  numbers of COVID-19 and influenza hospitalizations coincide this  winter.   The U.S. Air Travel Public Safety Act would add an additional  preventative layer to COVID-19 safety measures for domestic air travel.  Specifically, it would require airline passengers to provide proof of  vaccination before boarding a domestic flight within the United States.   The bill would also offer alternatives to airline passengers not yet  fully vaccinated by allowing them to provide either proof of a negative  COVID-19 test result or documentation proving that they have recovered  from COVID-19.   Current CDC guidance notes that fully vaccinated travelers are much  less likely to get and spread COVID-19 than people who are  unvaccinated. Furthermore, new research published in a Mayo Clinic  Proceedings study shows that COVID-19 testing requirements for airline  passengers could have a meaningful effect on detecting active  infections either immediately before or after a flight.   This legislation builds on current requirements in place since  January 2021 that require proof of a negative COVID-19 test result for  all airline passengers, including U.S. citizens, arriving from a  foreign country to the United States. Many Americans have already  experienced this process, and airlines are required to collect this  passenger COVID-19 information on behalf of CDC.   When added to current safety interventions required for domestic  flights, these measures could decrease the risk of transmission during  air travel, as well as the potential of air travelers spreading COVID- 19 at their destinations.   The bill would also require CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization  Practices--ACIP--to develop recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine use in  healthcare settings and among health care personnel in other settings.  ACIP currently recommends that healthcare personnel be vaccinated for  vaccine-preventable diseases, such as Hepatitis B, measles, and  influenza.   ACIP's recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccine would further  encourage health workers to get the shot and reduce the chances of  spread. This is particularly important as vaccination rates among  health workers remain lower than optimal.   This legislation may also positively affect vaccine acceptance among  the general public. According to a poll by the Kaiser Family  Foundation, about 3 in 10 people surveyed who were waiting to be  vaccinated said they would be more likely to get vaccinated if airlines  required passengers to be vaccinated. This number increased to about 4  in 10 among unvaccinated individuals who said they would only get the  vaccine if required.   We must ensure the millions of airline passengers that crisscross our  country aren't contributing to further COVID-19 transmission. This is  especially critical for young children, who remain ineligible to be  vaccinated and are increasingly accounting for reported COVID-19  infections nationwide.   I want to thank the Infectious Diseases Society of America for their  support for this bill. Getting vaccinated is a matter of life and  death, and it is the only option to safely returning to normalcy. I  look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue, and  I urge my fellow Senators to support the U.S. Air Travel Public Safety  Act.   Thank you.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):   S. 2891. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to address  matters relating to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the United  States Patent and Trademark Office, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
