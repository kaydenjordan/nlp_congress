 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service  of Chief Warrant Officer Christopher Eramo, an Army officer from  Oneonta, New York, who tragically lost his life in a helicopter crash  in Alaska.   Chief Eramo exemplified the bravery and selflessness that is required  of our men and women in uniform. He knew the dangers that came with his  service, and he dedicated his life to protecting our country and  safeguarding our freedoms.   As we mourn his passing, we also recognize the sacrifices all of our  servicemembers make every day. They put their lives on the line every  day to protect us, and we are forever grateful for their service.   May we always honor the bravery and sacrifice of Chief Eramo and all  those who have given their last full measure of devotion to a grateful  Nation.                            ____________________
