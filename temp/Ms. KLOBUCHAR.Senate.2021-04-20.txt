 Mr. President, as we await a very important moment for  justice in my State today. Our work goes on.   I am here today, first of all, to acknowledge the loss of my mentor,  Vice President Walter Mondale. He caught the Nation's attention  fighting for justice. So, it is such a moment. He worked on the  forefront of the right to counsel in the landmark case Gideon v.  Wainwright.   He followed in the footsteps of Hubert Humphrey to arrive in the  Senate. He did great things passing civil rights legislation.   As Vice President, he defined the office of the modern-day Vice  President.   He was ``Fritz'' to us. He was our attorney general, our Senator, and  our Vice President, and I know he is up there right now rooting for  justice.   I am going to speak more about Walter Mondale next week. Senator  Smith,  [[Page S2052]]  Senator Grassley, and I have a resolution honoring him for his time in  the Senate and for his time as Vice President, which we will be  presenting next week.                Nominations of Vanita Gupta and Lisa O. Monaco    Mr. President, now, in the name of justice and the idea that justice  must keep rolling along, I want to talk a little bit about some of the  people we need in place as we look to the future, as we look to the  future of police reform and the work that you have done as the lead on  this bill, Mr. President, and the work we have to do.   To do that, we need a functioning Justice Department. We have an  Attorney General who is excellent in Merrick Garland. We congratulate  Lisa Monaco, who is expected to be confirmed later today with a strong  bipartisan vote.   But we need more. We need the presence of true leaders in the Justice  Department. We need to see Kristen Clarke and Vanita Gupta confirmed.   Walter Mondale was someone who always raised the bar. He was someone  who was ahead of his time. When he introduced housing legislation and  childcare legislation, a lot of people said: Oh, why are you doing that  right now?   I think that is a little bit like the experience of these two women,  ahead of their time, doing the right thing, speaking of raising the  bar.   We know that when many of the women of the Senate come to the floor,  something important is going on. And given the challenges our States  face today, the stakes are high.   So today we make the case for Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke, and we  address the unfair and unsubstantiated attacks we have heard from the  other side of the aisle against these eminently qualified women. I have  worked closely with Ms. Gupta and Ms. Clarke for many years, and I am  confident they will lead the Department of Justice with honor and  integrity.   Their nominations also represent the historic opportunity to make  progress toward the goal of ensuring that the government looks more  like the people it represents, especially at the Department of Justice.  When we confirm Ms. Gupta, she will be the first civil rights lawyer  and the first woman of color to serve as the Associate Attorney  General. And when we confirm Ms. Clarke, she will be the first Senate- confirmed leader of the Civil Rights Division to be a woman of color.   They will bring years of experience to bear to take on the challenges  we have right now, like hate crimes, on which we are taking action this  week in the Senate; like voting rights, on which we just had a hearing  today in the Judiciary Committee, and in just a few weeks we will be  marking up the For the People Act in the Rules Committee, which I  chair.   As my State and my country are reeling after the killing of Daunte  Wright, and as we await the verdict in the murder of George Floyd, we  need Ms. Gupta and Ms. Clarke at the Department of Justice to take on  systemic police and criminal justice reform.   They are also the leaders that Attorney General Garland wants at the  Department, which I asked him about at his nomination hearing. He said  Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke ``have skills that I do not have; they  have experiences that I do not have.'' And he said: ``No human being  can have all of the skills necessary to run the Justice Department and  I need this leadership team if I'm going to be successful.''   Attorney General Garland, who was confirmed by a bipartisan vote of  76 to 23, needs his team to be successful. That is something all of us  should want.   After what we saw during the previous administration, it is essential  that the leaders of the Justice Department are committed to its  independence in order to restore trust in our justice system. This is a  priority for the Attorney General, and it is a priority for Vanita  Gupta and Kristen Clarke.   Vanita Gupta has demonstrated her commitment to the pursuit of  justice for her entire career. As an attorney for the NAACP Legal  Defense and Educational Fund, she worked on the frontlines fighting in  court to protect the civil rights of some of the most vulnerable  people.   Later, at the American Civil Liberties Union, she brought cases on  behalf of immigrant children and worked to end mass incarceration while  keeping communities safe.   While serving as our country's chief civil rights prosecutor at the  Department of Justice during the Obama administration, Ms. Gupta led  critical work on criminal justice reform, prosecuting hate crimes and  human trafficking, defending the right to vote, and protecting the  rights of the LGBTQ community and those with disabilities.   As president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,  the Nation's oldest, largest, and most diverse civil and human rights  coalition, Ms. Gupta has a record of fighting for all Americans with  dedication and a willingness to work across ideological lines to  achieve results.   Ms. Gupta's depth of experience at the Department of Justice and her  years as a civil rights attorney make her eminently qualified to serve  as Associate Attorney General.   And I have seen--as I know you have, Mr. President--her work  firsthand. I was one of the cosponsors of the FIRST STEP Act, which  made much needed reforms, a bill that you spent so much leadership on.  And Ms. Gupta worked with us, as she brought a broad range of  organizations and experts in support of the bill, including both law  enforcement and civil liberties groups.   Grover Norquist, a Republican and president of Americans for Tax  Reform, who supported the FIRST STEP Act, described Ms. Gupta as ``an  honest broker; someone with an ability not only to understand, but also  appreciate, different perspectives. She was someone who sought  consensus.''   As I look at what my State has been through for the last year and as  we await this verdict at this moment, that is exactly the kind of  person we need at the Department right now. And, if you have any  lingering questions, I say to my colleagues, just take a look at the  number of law enforcement groups that have come out in support of  he nomination. Just look at them. She is the right person for the job  at the right time.    Then there is Kristen Clarke, nominated to be Assistant Attorney  General to lead the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice.  Ms. Clarke has spent her entire 20-year career fighting for civil  rights and equal justice under the law.   Early in her career, she worked as an attorney in the Criminal  Section of the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department, for the  Bush Administration. She investigated and prosecuted hate crimes and  human trafficking. She also worked in the Division's voting section.   Since 2016, she has been the president and executive director of the  Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the country's  largest and most important civil rights organizations, dedicated to the  pursuit of equal justice for all. It is important to note the history  of the Lawyers' Committee, which was created at the request of  President John F. Kennedy in the summer of 1963, perhaps the defining  year of the civil rights movement. This is an organization of attorneys  founded to organize their peers to use their training to advance civil  rights for all Americans. Isn't that just who we want leading the Civil  Rights Division at the Department of Justice?   I have worked with Ms. Clarke for many years on election issues. She  testified before the Rules Committee and impressed everyone on both  sides of the aisle.   At that time, she said that following the direction of many, she is  going to work to ensure ``that the Civil Rights Division . . . is using  the tools in its arsenal''--and she said that now as she has been  nominated for this position--``the Voting Rights Act, the National  Voter Registration Act, the Uniformed and Overseas Absentee Citizens  Voting Act--to ensure that eligible Americans have access to the ballot  in our country.''   She also mentioned that she was here in the Senate Chamber in 2006,  when this body passed the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act--on  what vote?--98 to 0. That is why she has support from Republicans and  Democrats who work on these issues.   Trevor Potter, who previously chaired the FEC as a Republican  Commissioner, called Ms. Clarke ``one of  [[Page S2053]]  the foremost legal experts in the country on voting rights'' and  described her as ``smart, honest, and deeply committed to equal justice  under law.''   Tray Grayson, former Secretary of State from Kentucky, who is a  Republican and served as chairperson of the Republican Association of  Secretaries of State, sent a letter expressing his strong support of  Ms. Clarke.   And we have also heard from former Assistant Attorneys General of the  Civil Rights Division who served in both Republican and Democratic  administrations, who wrote:         We found Ms. Clarke to be an excellent candidate from the       standpoint of experience, temperament and commitment to the       rule of law. She has the experience, the commitment and the       passion to do this job.    I am joined by a number of our colleagues today. Senator Stabenow was  here earlier. Senator Hirono is with us on the floor to stand up for  Ms. Gupta and Ms. Clarke and to reject the falsehoods we have heard  from our colleagues on the other side. But we are also here to make the  case for why we must seize this historic opportunity to send two women  of color to lead the Justice Department.   So at this pivotal moment we live in, at this very moment, my message  to my friends, Vanita and Kristen, today, is this: We have your backs,  just as you have the backs of the people of this country.   Those jurors in Minnesota, they are not talking to each other about  if they are Democrats or Republicans. They have a job to do. The  witnesses that came forward in that case, people who just happened to  be there--a store clerk doing his job, a man who just happened to walk  by, the police officers who testified--they didn't ask people what  political party they were in. They just came forward. That is why I ask  my colleagues to step back and think about what justice really means  today and what it will mean tomorrow, and ask them to support Ms. Gupta  and Ms. Clarke to serve with Merrick Garland and Lisa Monaco to run the  Department of Justice.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.
