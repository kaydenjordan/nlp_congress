 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, legacy, and  advocacy of Gabrielle Aldea.   Gabby was a tireless fighter for expanding access to healthcare for  those with preexisting conditions. She was born with a bladder the size  of a thimble. Gabby spent the first 7 years of her life in and out of  the hospital.   A tenacious voice for reform and compassion, Gabby overcame this  adversity and took to civic engagement. She became a voice for those  who too often cannot speak for themselves and an inspiration for our  community.   I rise today to call on my colleagues to join me in honoring Gabby's  legacy by recommitting to the value of expanding access to healthcare  and fostering a more equitable community for this generation and for  generations to come.                            ____________________
