 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring awareness to the Trump  administration's effort to gut the Affordable Care Act.   Last Friday, the Justice Department failed to defend a key provision  of the ACA that protects people with preexisting conditions. The  decision jeopardizes millions of people's healthcare in Texas.   The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex has one of the highest uninsured  rates in the entire country. The congressional district that I  represent, alone, has the highest uninsured rate in the entire country.   Right now, Republicans are complicit in allowing insurance companies  to discriminate against over 10 million Texans with preexisting  conditions.   Mr. Speaker, this is bad, and we are asking for basic empathy. We  want to make sure that people don't have to live in a constant state of  panic and praying for the day that their health is in jeopardy and know  that their insurance won't be there for them.   Let's save the Affordable Care Act. Let's make it stronger. These  insurance plans that support hardworking families were put in place for  a reason. We need to protect our loved ones with preexisting  conditions, and that is what we demand.                            ____________________
