 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my remarks  supporting the impeachment of President Donald Trump.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of both articles of  impeachment.  [[Page H12184]]    I did not come to Congress to impeach the President, but his actions  have left us no choice.   The facts are uncontested and the truth is inescapable.   The President leveraged the highest office in the land for personal  political gain. In doing so, he jeopardized our national security,  undermined the integrity of our elections, and betrayed the public  trust. The Framers gave Congress the power of impeachment precisely to  protect our democracy from this kind of abuse of power.   The President's pattern of misconduct outlined in the articles of  impeachment, and his unrepentant contempt for the rule of law, make it  clear that he poses a clear and present danger to the very foundations  of our democracy.   Voting to impeach the President is not an easy decision, nor is it  one I take any pleasure in.   I will cast my vote tonight with a heavy heart and a solemn sense of  duty to protect our Constitution.
