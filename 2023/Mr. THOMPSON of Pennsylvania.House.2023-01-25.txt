 Madam Speaker, I proudly rise today to  represent Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District.   The 15th Congressional District encompasses 18 counties in the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, nearly one-third of the land mass.   It includes all of Armstrong, Cameron, Centre--including my hometown  of Howard--Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Elk, Forest, Jefferson,  McKean, Potter, Snyder, Tioga, Union, and Warren Counties. It also  includes parts of Indiana, Lycoming, and Venango Counties.   Madam Speaker, I take great pride in my service to the people of the  15th Congressional District, and I work hard to earn their trust, help  solve their problems, and be a diligent Representative.   When I am not here in Washington, I spend my days on the road in the  district, traveling to meetings and events, and I work to connect with  my constituents and truly be a voice for each community I serve.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak here as I gave  144 1-minute speeches in the 117th Congress and to be a strong voice  for the citizens of the 15th District.   The challenges before us remain great. It is my hope that we will  tackle these challenges head on. It is the American way.                            ____________________
