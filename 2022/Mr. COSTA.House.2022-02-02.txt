 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on behalf of the America  COMPETES Act of 2022, which makes a critical $45 billion investment in  supply chain resiliency--critical.   Farmers in my district have suffered from a backlog seen in American  ports and harbors. The California Farm Bureau estimates that in a 4- month period last year, California agriculture exports fell by $2  billion--important and significant.   Food, I believe, is a national security issue. This supply chain  crisis hurts farmers and only increases food insecurity and prices for  those in need; i.e., the American consumer.   That is why I am cosponsoring an amendment in the COMPETES Act that  requires the Secretary of Agriculture and Assistant Secretary of supply  chain resilience and crisis response to monitor food and agriculture  supply chains and provide Congress with their findings so that we can  protect and improve our critical supply chain in this country.   Our country must ensure that we have safeguards in place to keep our  supply chains strong, which contributes to success on the global  economic stage.                            ____________________
