 Madam President, I didn't come to the floor to speak on  this matter, but listening to the comments of my friend from Illinois  about the contributions made by immigrants to our country, I  wholeheartedly agree with him about that.   Really, when I think about immigration, I think it is really sort of  the secret sauce to American success. It is the notion that you can  come from anywhere, with virtually nothing, and you can legally  immigrate to the United States and you can begin to get one of those  very difficult jobs working in the fields, working in a meatpacking  plant, or someplace else and begin your climb toward the American  dream.   That, to me, is one of the crown jewels of our country. It is what  makes us different. You look at other countries around the world; they  don't welcome immigrants. They shun immigrants, and their economies and  their countries suffer for it.   Let me just say, I agree with the Senator from Illinois about the  contribution of immigrants. I listened very carefully as a border State  Senator. My State is 40 percent Hispanic. I am sure the Senator from  Nevada has a large Hispanic population. They are part of us. They are  part of our great Nation and make tremendous contributions.   The Hispanics in my State are patriots. They volunteer in  disproportionate numbers to serve in the military. They work at jobs  that are very difficult. They are very tight-knit families. They are  people of faith. They believe in hard work and, most fundamentally,  they believe in the American dream.   But I don't think it does any tribute to their contributions or their  sacrifices to say that people can come to this country without  complying with our laws.   I also join in the Senator's frustration at our inability to get  anything substantially done in this space, but I don't think it is good  enough for us to complain about how hard it is. We are all volunteers.  What we have to do is do the hard work, and we have not done it since I  have been here. We have not done the hard work to try to build that  consensus in order to pass meaningful immigration reform, and we need  to do that. It is on us. We can't blame somebody else. We are the ones  responsible. We haven't done it, and we need to do it.   But I would just point out, and the Senator from Illinois knows this,  that my State has a 1,200-mile border with Mexico. This is ground zero  for the humanitarian crisis that is currently appearing at the border.  The Biden administration reversed a lot of the policies of the previous  administration without having an alternative plan in place, and it was  interpreted as laying out the welcome mat for anybody and everybody who  wanted to come to the United States. That is why we are seeing these  unprecedented numbers, or at least numbers we haven't seen for 20  years, in people trying to stream across the border into the United  States.   I know that there is a lot of debate about, well, should we have  physical barriers at the border? The truth is, the experts, the Border  Patrol, have told all of us that, yes, you have to have physical  barriers in some hard-to-control places, but you also need technology,  and you need boots on the ground because this is not just about people  immigrating to the United States; this is about the drugs that killed  93,000 Americans last year alone, most of which come across the  southern border--cocaine, meth, fentanyl, heroin, just to name a few.  When we see the current crisis at the border because of this reversal  of the previous administration's policies without any alternative plan  in place, this is an open invitation to the cartels to take advantage  of the circumstances.   What it means, as a practical matter, when so many people come across  at the same time, which is what is happening now, including tens of  thousands of unaccompanied children, the Border Patrol, which is the  law enforcement officials who are given the mission of securing our  border--they have to leave the frontline of the border to go change  diapers and clean and feed these kids because there is simply not  enough personnel there in order to handle this flood of humanity.   What happens when they leave the frontlines? Well, in one sector, the  Border Patrol Chief told me 40 percent of their agents had to leave the  frontlines, which then was a green light for the drug components, the  drug smugglers, to bring the poison that killed 93,000 Americans in the  United States last year alone across the border.   These criminal organizations are very sophisticated. They know  exactly what they are doing. They know exactly how to exploit the  vulnerabilities in our law, which is why they also have understood that  if you flood tens of thousands--in 1 month alone, nearly 200,000--of  people across the border, that you are going to overwhelm the system,  and that if you coach the migrants to make a claim of credible fear of  persecution, that you might just be put into our asylum system, which  then has about 1.3, I think, million cases backlogged in our  immigration courts, which means we are forced to give you a notice to  appear at a future hearing so you can present your case in front of an  immigration judge, and maybe, just maybe, you can make your case. As a  practical matter, only about 10 percent of the people who do appear in  front of an immigration judge are able to meet the legal criteria for  asylum.   But here is how the cartels, how the transnational criminal  organizations, have figured out how to exploit our  [[Page S5806]]  laws: Because we have to release people and give them a notice to  appear because of the sheer volume, most of them don't show up for  their court hearing. So they have succeeded because of the gaps in our  law, not because of a lack of a physical barrier along the border. They  are turning themselves in to the Border Patrol and making this claim of  asylum because they know that they will more than likely succeed in  making their way into the United States.   I don't care how many times the Vice President goes to Central  America or talks about root causes of illegal immigration. I don't care  how many times Director Mayorkas tells Cubans: Don't come to America  because of the danger of coming overseas into our country. These  organizations are smart. They are whispering in the ear of these  migrants. They are saying: If you will pay us enough money, we will get  you to America. And these migrants watch TV. They watch cable TV. They  take phone calls and get emails from their friends and relatives in the  United States. They know that this statement ``don't try to come to  America'' is just completely inconsistent with what is happening on the  ground.   So I don't think it does us any good to complain about how hard our  job is or how many times we have failed to get the job done. What I am  really concerned about right now is that the majority whip, who is also  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has basically told us he is going  to give up on a bipartisan immigration reform bill, and they are going  to try to jam this through on a purely party-line vote in this  reconciliation bill, otherwise known as the reckless tax-and-spending  spree.   Now, I don't expect that the Parliamentarian will allow them to do  that under the rules of the Senate. This would completely circumvent  the rules of the Senate, which require, on matters of substantive  legislation, 60 votes to close off debate, the so-called filibuster  rule.   But I couldn't resist responding to the majority whip's--the Senator  from Illinois--statements about how hard our job is. I don't think it  does us much good to come here and say: This is really hard. This is  really hard.   Our constituents expect us to fix it, and we know how to do it if we  will just do our job                                  H.R. 3684    So, Madam President, on the bipartisan infrastructure bill now before  the Senate, I am glad to see that the majority leader, Senator Schumer,  is allowing amendments to be presented from folks on both sides.  Senator Schumer had given us an artificial deadline to finish the bill,  but he has also told us we are not going home until we do so, and we  take him at his word. But I hope he will continue to allow this process  to play out, no matter how long it takes, until this legislation is  ready to be voted on. That is principally because the process that  brought this bill to the floor did not involve the regular, normal  hearings and markups across multiple Senate committees. That is  certainly not a criticism of the bipartisan group who has gotten us to  where we are; it is really just a statement of the dysfunction of the  legislative process in the Senate these days. But the fact is, the vast  majority of the Senators in this Chamber did not have a hand in  crafting this legislation even though it will impact every single  community across the country.   I believe the bipartisan group worked in good faith to get us to the  starting gate. Now it is time to allow every Senator, representing  every State in the country, to weigh in and offer improvements to the  bill. I have said from the beginning that an open amendment process  will be critical to the success of this legislation, and that is  especially true when it comes to paying for this legislation.   We are waiting for the Congressional Budget Office, the official  scorer, to tell us what the costs will be and whether we have been  successful in offering offsetting pay-fors. One budget expert at the  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has already forecasted a  discouraging score. He estimated the bill would only raise about $208  billion--less than half of the new spending in the bill.   But it is important for all of us to realize we are also  reauthorizing the expiring surface transportation bill, which is  ordinarily financed by the highway trust fund, and it is going to  require another $118 billion to shore that up because the White House  has taken off the table any other pay-fors that would include a user  fee on electric vehicles or indexing the gas tax or other ideas that  would fill in that gap. So another $118 billion of borrowed money is  going to be necessary to fill that gap. I don't think any of us regard  that as a good outcome. Maybe it is the best we can do under the  circumstances.   But as it stands now, our debt to GDP, our debt to our gross domestic  product ratio, is at the highest level it has been since World War II.  In other words, we fought a world war to defeat imperial Japan and Nazi  Germany, and we didn't ask how much it cost; we did what we had to do.  We did the same thing when it came to COVID, which was a domestic  equivalent, I think, of war, defeating the virus and shoring up our  economy.   Our country has invested a huge amount of money in the war against  COVID-19, and now is not the time to double down on out-of-control  spending for a nonemergency matter. We need to find responsible ways to  finance these new expenses, and I hope we will have an opportunity to  vote on a range of amendments to that end.   I have been proud to work with Senator Padilla, our new Senator from  California, a Democrat, to offer an amendment that would provide more  funding for a variety of infrastructure projects, including roads,  bridges, and public transit. What it does is it gives State and local  leaders more authority when it comes to identifying and investing in  the greatest needs of their States and their communities. And here is  the kicker: It does so without increasing the deficit one penny. That  is because it gives State and local leaders the ability to spend COVID  relief funding that they already have on infrastructure projects that  might otherwise be neglected. They are not required to do so, but our  amendment would allow them to do so rather than to claw that money back  when the appropriation sunsets or to put guardrails on it and say you  can only use it for some prescribed uses, which, frankly, they have  more money to spend than they know what to do with when it comes to  those authorized uses.   As folks hunkered down in their home to slow the spread of the virus,  the change in travel patterns hurt more than airlines and hotels; it  put a serious dent in State and local transportation budgets in all of  our States. State departments of transportation are facing an estimated  $18 billion in shortfalls through 2024. Leaders across the country have  had to delay or cancel critical transportation projects because of a  lack of funding, and it is unclear when those projects may get back on  track.   I might say that one of the things we have seen with the eviction  moratorium expiring is that $46 billion of money we appropriated last  year still hasn't gotten to the intended beneficiary, to the people who  are trying to pay their rent but can't pay their rent. So we have a  huge problem, logistical problem, in voting on money and actually  getting it to the intended beneficiary. That is true in COVID-19. That  is true in disaster relief. The type of thing that Senator Padilla and  I are suggesting is to take money that is already in the hands of the  State and local governments and let them use it so they can do it  quickly on investments which will last and endure rather than just  spend it on operating expenses.   There is an urgent need for more transportation funding, and that is  exactly what our amendment would provide. There is no mandate, as I  said, that it be spent for a single transportation project. If a city  or a State or a county has plans to use their funds on pandemic-related  expenses, those plans will not be interrupted or called into question.  It simply provides our local leaders what they have asked each of us  for most, and it starts with flexibility.   If a city is experiencing a spike in COVID cases and needs to use  Federal funding to buy additional ICU bedspace or hire new healthcare  workers, they can and they should move forward with those plans. This  is not about cutting resources that are needed. But we  [[Page S5807]]  know that many States and localities simply don't have enough  qualifying expenses to use the money that they have been given. They  are looking for ways to spend the dollars they already have as given to  them in the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan.   That is not to say they don't want this funding; they just want to be  able to use it consistent with the guardrails that Congress has  provided, and that is what our amendment will allow.   The broad support for this amendment is a testament to the importance  of these changes. Our amendment has been endorsed by two dozen  organizations that represent a diverse range of stakeholders, from the  National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the  Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations--all of which  advocate on behalf of cities across the country.   We have also received endorsements from the American Road &  Transportation Builders Association, which represents all facets of the  transportation construction industry, as well as the American Public  Transportation Association. It also includes organizations that  advocate for safer roads, like the American Traffic Safety Services  Association.   I have been pleased to find common ground with Senator Padilla and  our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help build support for  this amendment and, I think, actually enhance the work done by the  bipartisan negotiating group.   This is not something they were able to get done in that negotiating  group--they have told me--even though it was a subject of discussion.  So now it is a chance for the rest of us, on a bipartisan basis, to  weigh in and make this bill better.   Throughout the process, we have made adjustments so States with  unique, but no less important, infrastructure needs can put this  funding toward those uses. We are in the process of making some final  tweaks to ensure that we receive broad bipartisan support, as well as  that of the White House, and I hope we will have a vote on this  amendment on the Senate floor soon.   Our amendment will empower local officials to make the best decisions  for their communities and ensure that taxpayers get the most bang for  their buck with these relief funds that have already been appropriated;  and then, if we do not authorize their use in the manner I have  described, will likely be spent on annual or reoccurring expenses  rather than on something that will endure for a long time, like  infrastructure.   So I hope our amendment will come to a vote in the Senate very soon.  There is no reason--there is no reason--to rush the amendment process  and to cut off good amendments for a vote or consideration that will  actually improve this legislation. There are a lot of great ideas out  there to strengthen this bill, to maximize the impact of every dollar,  and pay for these investments responsibly.   So let me just close by saying I appreciate the hard work that has  gone into this bill so far, and I hope we will continue to have more  opportunities to improve it as the amendment process goes forward.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
