 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to the Republican  budget.   As Vice President Biden stated: ``Don't tell me what you value. Show  me your budget and I will tell you what you value.''   The Republican's so-called Building a Better America budget shows us  they do not value education, infrastructure, research and development,  veterans' benefits, and other programs which expand opportunities for  America's families.                                time  1730    This budget is immoral. It provides trillions of dollars in tax money  to millionaires and wealthy corporations while shifting the burden onto  the middle class. It cuts $5.4 trillion from programs that American  families rely on; programs like SNAP, Pell grants, Social Security, and  healthcare.   The budget ends the Medicare guarantee. It cuts Medicare alone by  almost $500 billion over 10 years. A vote for this budget destroys  American families in favor of a select few. This budget does not build  a better America. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this budget.
