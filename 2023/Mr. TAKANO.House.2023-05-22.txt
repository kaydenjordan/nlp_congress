 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 366, the Korean  American VALOR Act. I am proud to have sponsored this legislation which  will provide eligibility for VA healthcare to veterans who served in  the armed forces of the Republic of Korea, as allies of the United  States during the Vietnam war, who have since become naturalized  American citizens.   This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Korean-American alliance.  Last month, during his visit to Washington, D.C., President Yoon Suk  Yeol addressed a joint session of Congress and reflected on how our  alliance has served to safeguard freedom and democracy throughout the  world.   Following the Korean war, the United States and the Republic of Korea  signed a Mutual Defense Treaty on October 1, 1953. It has been called  an ``alliance forged in blood.'' In part, out of gratitude for the  service and sacrifices made by Americans during the Korean war, the  Republic of Korea has aided the United States in every war since the  Vietnam war.   Between 1965 and 1973, South Korea sent more than 320,000 troops to  fight alongside U.S. servicemembers in Vietnam, the largest contingent  of any U.S. ally. More than 5,000 South Korean troops died in the  Vietnam war, and at least 11,000 were injured.   An estimated 2,800 veterans who served in the armed forces of the  Republic of Korea during the Vietnam  [[Page H2473]]  war and later became U.S. citizens are living today. My legislation  would provide some measure of long-overdue parity for Korean-American  Vietnam war veterans who, up to this point, have never been eligible  for VA healthcare services.   Under this bill, the United States and the Republic of Korea will  establish a reciprocal agreement. Korea will reimburse the United  States for healthcare services VA furnishes to these Korean-American  veterans. In exchange, the United States will reimburse Korea for  healthcare it provides to veterans of the United States Armed Forces  residing in Korea.   Such an arrangement is not new. Since 1958, through its Allied  Beneficiary Program, VA has had the authority to treat veterans who  have served in the armed forces of nations that were allied with the  United States during World War I and World War II. These veterans did  not need to be United States citizens, and VA has the authority to  treat veterans of any combat era.   Now, VA furnishes this care through reciprocal agreements which have  been established with the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand,  Canada, and South Africa. In 1976, VA's Allied Beneficiary Program was  extended to certain veterans who had served in the armed forces of  Czechoslovakia or Poland during World War I or World War II who  subsequently became U.S. citizens.   We recently observed the 50th anniversary of the date the last combat  troops left Vietnam. It is far past time for our Nation to properly  honor the service and sacrifice of South Koreans who served side by  side with United States troops during the Vietnam war and have since  become naturalized U.S. citizens. We must ensure they finally receive  the same respect and consideration their counterparts from other allied  nations have received for generations.   The needs of Korean-American veterans of the Vietnam war are no  different from those of U.S.-born veterans. From Agent Orange exposure,  to coping with complex injuries and mental illnesses, these veterans  deserve the specialized care and services that only VA can provide.  Many of them are entering their final years and should not have to wait  any longer for this care.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 366, the Korean  American VALOR Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from my home State  of California. I am very confident this bill will become law, but we  will need to make sure that we work together in a bipartisan way to  make sure the reciprocal agreement finally gets put into effect.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), my good friend, who holds a seat on the House Budget  Committee, Homeland Security Committee, and the House Judiciary  Committee. She is indeed a staunch advocate for all our military  servicemembers and veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.   Again, I ask all my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 366, the  Korean American VALOR Act. Might I just add to the chairman's assertion  that this is the perfect week to pass this bill. I have already  mentioned the 70th anniversary of our historic alliance, but now as we  in the Indo-Pacific must strengthen our alliance, I also want to add my  congratulations to both the nations of Japan and the Republic of Korea  for making great strides to improve their relationships and to afford  us the opportunity in the trilateral alliance among the United States,  Japan, and South Korea to become stronger allies.   This legislation, I believe, is part of the entire effort to become  stronger allies with greater cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the VET-TEC Authorization Act of  2023, as amended. In 2020, when our country experienced record  unemployment, VET-TEC was a bright spot of veteran employment.   To date, nearly 5,000 veterans have found employment from the program  at a salary of over $65,000 a year.   Today, veterans are employed at record-high levels. The Biden economy  has brought veteran unemployment to the lowest level ever on record.  Let me say that again. The Biden economy has brought veteran  unemployment to the lowest level ever on record.   The legislation before us adds 5 more years to the VET-TEC program,  providing VA an additional $337 million to get more veterans hired in  the high-technology field.   This program was created by Speaker McCarthy in the Forever GI Bill,  and I respect the fact that it is a big priority for the Speaker and my  friend Chairman Bost. While I support the legislation, I wish to share  my concern about moving a bill with such a large cost  [[Page H2477]]  when we have so many provisions awaiting action by this Congress. The  $413 million price tag of this bill dwarfs the costs of many of the  bills we must pass to address veteran homelessness.   This is an expensive bill in a fiscally uncertain time. While we all  appreciate veteran employment programs, veteran unemployment is the  lowest ever on record. A VET-TEC extension is nice to have, but with  veterans experiencing homelessness and food insecurity, there is action  on those programs that we must have.   As ranking member of this committee, I have the responsibility of  weighing priorities and choosing between worthy policies that help  veterans. I know the chairman and his colleagues on our committee share  my goal of ending veteran homelessness.   When we considered this legislation in our committee, I offered an  amendment to this legislation to make permanent some basic authorities  which lowered veteran homelessness by 11 percent during a public health  emergency. This amendment cost only $6 million in mandatory spending.   Last year, the chairman himself made it clear: ``No veteran should be  without a place to call home. I am glad that the most recent estimate  showed fewer veterans living in homeless shelters last year. That is  why we must continue our work to ensure that the rubber is meeting the  road and every veteran has access to safe, stable housing and the help  they need to thrive.''   Chairman Bost is correct. The work must continue. We must continue  the ongoing work, which has already helped so many veterans and can  help so many more.   The reason given for not moving this bill was that it implicates the  Toxic Exposure Fund, or TEF. I understand the chairman is concerned  about how the Congressional Budget Office scores bills with TEF  implications. I am concerned too, and I have spoken extensively on  this.   However, there has yet to be a solution proposed for the TEF that  does not undermine its purpose, which is to protect funding for toxic- exposed veterans and acknowledge this as a cost of war.   In light of this, I am asking that we come together and work on  mutual priorities so that we can responsibly and equitably pass  legislation using the limited offsets available to us.   I think the chairman believes, as do I, that providing basic needs  for homeless veterans deserves to be on that priority list.   Therefore, I ask my colleague, the chairman, if he will commit to  bringing Representative Cherfilus-McCormick's bill, H.R. 645, to the  floor without delay,   Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of a colloquy, I yield to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Bost), and ask if he will commit to this.    Mr. Speaker, I am reclaiming my time.    Mr. Speaker, I was waiting for the answer.    Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time.   Mr. BOST: Mr. Speaker, I am committed to addressing the veterans  homelessness.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I am reclaiming my time.   I simply ask the gentleman whether he will work with us to bring Mrs.  Cherfilus-McCormick's bill to the floor. That is the question that I  will yield for an answer.   Will the gentleman work with us?   I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time.   I am grateful that I hear some kernel that they will work with us in  a bipartisan way. What does worry me is the gentleman mentioned over  the next few months. I can maybe tolerate the next few months in terms  of can we come to an agreement by the fall when the temperatures start  to fall, but even the hot summers, in some parts of the country, would  require us to work much more expeditiously.   These pandemic authorities that expanded our ability to help veterans  who are homeless expired on May 11. For the last 11 days, VA and its  community partners have operated with fewer authorities and less  funding to help homeless veterans.   VA's ability to quickly bring a veteran in off the streets and get  them the services they need to put them on their way to stable,  permanent housing has been greatly diminished.   Prior to the pandemic, we were maintaining the status quo. The number  of veterans experiencing homelessness had remained basically stagnant  year after year for quite some time. For every veteran housed, another  veteran would fall into homelessness.   During the pandemic we approached the homelessness crisis head on and  with the urgency it has long deserved. It is incredible to me that we  were able to reduce homelessness during COVID-19 by 11 percent. During  the darkest days of that pandemic, VA actually reduced homelessness by  11 percent. It permanently housed over 40,000 veterans last year alone.  We know these authorities accelerated VA's progress in ending veteran  homelessness, and we can't lose that momentum.   I am pleased to hear the chairman wants to work together to extend  these authorities and get homeless veterans into housing.   Mr. Speaker, I just say let's prioritize H.R. 645 in the coming days,  not the coming months, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), my friend and colleague from my home State who  serves on the Armed Services Committee and the Oversight Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I commend General Bergman for the section of the VET-TEC bill which  includes addressing this issue related to burials and the cost that the  veteran's family has to bear, but I find it peculiar that the majority  would take pains to include this legislation, which I have no quarrel  with and support, but could not deal with and chose not to deal with  the expiring authorities to deal with our homeless veterans.   Americans care deeply about the homeless veterans in our country and  are offended that we would have anybody who wore the uniform of the  United States be homeless.   There are elements of this bill that came up in markup. They brought  the bill to the floor, the VET-TEC bill, which includes many elements,  but they specifically chose to leave out addressing the expiring  authorities that we have used to bring down homelessness by 11 percent.  I am afraid we are going to lose momentum.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I realize the chairman and all of us in the  veteran space have had our differences with the way the Congressional  Budget Office scores the TEF. However, I would assert that we cannot  use that as an excuse for why we don't address veteran homelessness.   Mr. Speaker, the expansion of VET-TEC as a program is to the tune of  nearly one-half billion dollars--$413 million--at a time when my  colleagues on the other side are looking to make draconian cuts to the  nondefense side of the ledger, which veterans do fall within. They are  expanding a program that addresses veteran employment at a time when  veteran unemployment is at its lowest.   What I want to compare is the $6 million to the nearly one-half  billion dollars that the Republicans want to expand this program by. I,  too, stand behind veteran employment programs and effective ones at  that. However, should we be expanding it and authorizing for 5 years  this program, VET-TEC, when we are allowing a $6 million program to  care for homeless veterans, to get them off the streets, to expire?   It is a rather rich situation that my colleagues want to expand  spending and spend more on a program whose urgency is really in  question because the Biden economy, as I explained, has brought veteran  unemployment to its lowest levels ever. They want to expand spending in  that program by an enormous amount, yet they want to eliminate $6  million in authorizations to take care of our homeless veterans. This  makes no sense at all to me.   I support the chairman's bill, but I hope he will work with us to  solve this problem in a matter of days and not months.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H2480]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for S. 777, the Veterans'  Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2023.   As we do annually, today, we are taking up legislation to increase  the amounts paid for wartime disability compensation, compensation for  dependents, clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans, and  dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and  children.   Specifically, the bill requires VA to raise these benefit amounts by  the same percentage as the cost-of-living increase provided to Social  Security recipients, serving as a guarantee of quality of life for  veterans and their families and ensuring that they will not experience  a decline in earned benefits as economic conditions fluctuate.   The cost-of-living adjustment is a continued recognition by our  grateful Nation of the service and sacrifice not just of those who have  courageously worn our Nation's uniforms but those families who have  supported them and also bear a great burden.   As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, it is an  honor for me to support this effort.   I will note, however, that particularly with respect to dependency  and indemnity compensation, more needs to be done beyond the annual  COLA to bring that program on par with other Federal survivors'  benefits. It has lagged behind for far too long, which is a disservice  to the survivors of our veterans. I hope this committee can see fit to  advance that cause this Congress, as well.   Typically, we alternate primary sponsorship of this bill with the  Senate, and this year it happens to be the Senate's turn. I acknowledge  the Senate for promptly sending us their version.   I also commend the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial  Affairs and extend my gratitude to Ranking Member Pappas and Chair  Luttrell for their sponsorship of the House companion to this bill and  for their unwavering support for our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support S. 777, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on  Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my good friend who serves on the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to pass S. 777,  Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2023, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
