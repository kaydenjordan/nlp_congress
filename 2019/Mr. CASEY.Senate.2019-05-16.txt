 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, I come to the floor again this morning to  discuss several judicial nominations considered by the Senate this  week.   Earlier this week, the Senate voted to confirm Michael Truncale to  the Eastern District of Texas and Kenneth Lee to the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals seat in California, and today we will be voting on the  nomination of Wendy Vitter to the Eastern District of Louisiana.   The Senate is considering and confirming nominees whose records  indicate they are far outside the mainstream. I have worked very hard  over a number of years now--I guess we are in our eighth year--working  with Senator Toomey, to fill district court vacancies in Pennsylvania  with well-qualified and experienced judges whom I believe will be able  to set aside their ideologies or personal beliefs and apply the law to  the cases before them. But I do not have the same confidence in many of  the nominees before this body today and especially the nominees we are  considering.   I will go in the order that I mentioned before--first, Michael  Truncale, then Kenneth Lee, and Wendy Vitter. I believe that in all  three cases, all are not mainstream conservatives. Their backgrounds  and records are very political, and they have long records of  advocating for certain positions on issues that may come before them as  either a U.S. district court judge or an appellate judge.   First of all, Mr. Truncale has advocated strongly for the repeal of  the Affordable Care Act, which provided healthcare coverage and  critical patient protections for 20 million people  [[Page S2897]]  in terms of coverage and tens of millions more in terms of protection.   He said that the Affordable Care Act would ``lead to the rationing of  healthcare.'' He has personally advocated for abolishing the Department  of Education, and he used false, unfounded claims of voter fraud to  support voter ID laws that disproportionately affect low-income voters  and communities of color.   Second, Kenneth Lee was confirmed over the objections of both  California Senators, Senator Harris and Senator Feinstein--Senator  Feinstein, in this case, being the ranking member of the Judiciary  Committee, the very committee that considers judges. Mr. Lee has a  litany of writings that include offensive statements about immigrants,  people of color, and LGBT Americans. He has strongly opposed  affirmative action policies that help make our institutions of higher  learning more diverse, and it is very possible that he may consider  matters relating to these policies as a member of the Ninth Circuit.   Finally, Wendy Vitter has virtually no Federal trial court  experience, has a long record of opposing contraception, and has  promoted false information about the safety of oral contraceptives.  These views are not only outside of the mainstream--the judicial or  legal mainstream--but they are also not supported by science.   I don't believe these nominees will be able to set aside their  personal views and apply relevant precedent, and my concern is  compounded by recent efforts by conservative jurists to overturn  longstanding precedents. Most Americans thought that the Voting Rights  Act, which for decades protected the franchise for Americans of color,  particularly Black Americans, was a foundational, almost untouchable  statute. But in 2013, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court,  which has gotten only more conservative, moved to the right even more.  That Court, the Supreme Court, gutted the protections of the Voting  Rights Act in the Shelby County v. Holder case.   Just last year, in the Janus decision, the Supreme Court overturned a  four-decades-old precedent in the Abood case that allowed public sector  unions to collect nonpolitical, so-called fair share fees to cover the  costs of negotiations that benefit all workers. So you have the union  doing the work, and the law allowed them, for four decades, to charge  other employees who benefit from the work of the union, and the Supreme  Court struck that down.   Pennsylvania passed a similar law in the 1980s, which has been the  law of the land in Pennsylvania for years. It was signed into law in  the late 1980s by my father when he was serving as Governor, so that is  an important issue in Pennsylvania for working men and women.   The conservative majority of the Supreme Court overturned the Abood  case, eviscerating a precedent that was relied upon by public sector  unions and their governmental employers all over the country. I believe  the next step by the far right and by this court and maybe by the  Supreme Court and maybe in another court would be to make illegal the  very right to organize for wages and benefits. I hope I am wrong about  that, but I believe that is the logical next step for the right.   Just this week, a conservative majority of the Supreme Court  overturned a 40-year precedent regarding States' sovereign immunity in  the courts of other States. In the last line of his dissent, Justice  Breyer sounded alarm bells about this kind of judicial activism from  the right, saying: ``Today's decision can only cause one to wonder  which cases the court will overrule next.''   He is right. We no longer know what is civil law and what could be up  for debate. We thought that Abood was settled law in the context of  labor unions and the right to organize or an issue related to the right  to organize. We thought the Voting Rights Act was settled law.   This week we mark the 65th anniversary of Brown v. Board of  Education, a unanimous Supreme Court decision holding that segregation  in our public school system, in addition to being a profound moral  failure, was a violation of our Constitution. I would hope--we all  would hope that Brown v. Board of Education would remain rock solid  settled law. Yet, because of what we have seen in the last couple of  years with this Court, we must stay vigilant. We cannot let civil  rights that Americans fought for and earned and have cherished for  decades be chipped away by extreme judicial nominees who hold  insuperable political and policy preferences.   I oppose the nominees that the Senate has considered this week, and I  will continue to oppose extreme nominees to our Federal courts.   I yield the floor to the distinguished Democratic leader.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Senate's  failure to meet its constitutional obligation and conduct effective  oversight of what seems to me and many others to be this  administration's inexorable march toward war with Iran.   This week, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration  is making plans to deploy 120,000 American troops to the Middle East in  anticipation of a confrontation with Iran. It is no secret that some of  the President's closest advisers are focused on regime change and  possibly military engagement with Iran.   I was encouraged by a story in the Washington Post that was posted  last night. The headline of that story read as follows: ``Trump,  frustrated by advisers, is not convinced the time is right to attack  Iran.'' That was the headline in the version of the story reported by  four Washington Post reporters. In pertinent part, the story indicated  that the President thinks his advisers ``could rush the U.S. into a  military confrontation with Iran.'' Then it goes on to further state  that ``Trump prefers a diplomatic approach to resolving tensions.'' I  am encouraged by that, but we have to be vigilant when it comes to this  issue and the broader issue of the use of force.   The plans that I mentioned before referred to by the New York Times  apparently were submitted by Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan. These  are  [[Page S2901]]  the most recent in a string of actions this administration has taken,  from withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, to designating  the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps--the so-called IRGC--as a foreign  terrorist organization, to suspending waivers that allow partner  countries to continue importing Iranian oil.   I have a long record of working to fight against Iranian aggression.  We all know--and we have said it often, and we should say it again-- Iran is and has been the leading state sponsor of terrorism. For years,  many of us, in a bipartisan way, have led efforts to confront Iran, to  sanction Iran, to hold Iran accountable for its malign activity and  actions in the Middle East and its actions to support terrorist  organizations, whether it is Hezbollah or any other terrorist  organization. We will continue that regardless of this debate.   But when the New York Times talked about that military plan, they  referred to a prior engagement, a prior military conflict--the conflict  in Iraq. ``Echoes of Iraq War'' was what the Times said. These  ``echoes'' trigger memories and reflections of a misguided period of  this body's history in which Congress approved a U.S. invasion of Iraq  based upon faulty intelligence. By the end of that long war, thousands  of Americans had been killed, and many more Americans had been wounded.   In Pennsylvania alone, 197 Pennsylvanians were killed in action in  the Iraq war and more than 1,200 were wounded. I haven't even talked  about the conflict in Afghanistan, where Pennsylvania lost more than  90. The last number I saw was 91 Pennsylvanians were killed in action  in Afghanistan. Pennsylvania is well familiar with contributing  fighting men and women to conflicts from the beginning of our Republic  until this very day.   The administration's actions on Iran also ``echo'' our ongoing  stalemate--``stalemate'' might be an understatement--regarding the  authorization for use of military force--the so-called AUMF--against  ISIS, for example.   If we don't debate and vote on an AUMF as it relates to Iran or any  other country or any other conflict, we are not doing our job.   For 6 years, the United States has been engaged in the fight against  ISIS in Iraq and Syria. For many years, the executive branch has relied  on the 2001 authorization for use of military force to justify its  fight against ISIS, as well as to justify other military engagements.   I ask Majority Leader McConnell to set aside time for sustained  debate and votes on a new authorization for use of military force.   Last month, Secretary of State Pompeo implied during testimony in  front of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate that the 2001  AUMF to go after al-Qaida and its affiliates authorizes war with Iran.  A lot of people would disagree with that. I believe that an 18-year-old  authorization needs an update--another understatement. The threats we  confront today have evolved since 2001.   As this administration seeks to link al-Qaida and Iran in  anticipation of a military confrontation, I am concerned over the  bipartisan failure to hold both this and the prior administration to  account for their constitutional overreach over congressional  authority.   I commend Senator Kaine and other Senators from both parties for  efforts over the last number of years to force a debate on  congressional oversight over this issue.   The majority leader should allow floor time and a robust debate on  congressional war powers and oversight over the Executive's unilateral  actions that send American troops overseas. The debate on the Yemen  resolution and the vote--several votes, actually, on that--demonstrated  that there is bipartisan concern over the use of force, but we need a  broader debate than we had in the debate on the Yemen resolution.   As this administration pursues a reckless strategy with Iran, it is  time for a sustained debate and vote on a new authorization for use of  military force that allows our Nation to, in fact, destroy terrorists  and fight threats to U.S. national security but doesn't result in  endless war. The 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force  authorizing military action in Iraq and Afghanistan are outdated and  must be replaced.   I will conclude with some words from Abraham Lincoln in that now- famous letter to Mrs. Bixby in which he talked about the loss of her  sons' lives in the Civil War. When they did the checks on it, it turned  out to be two sons. When the President was writing, he thought she had  lost five sons. But we still have families who suffer the loss of a son  or a daughter in conflict--we hope not as many as two or more.   In this case, in the second paragraph, President Lincoln said ``the  grief of a loss so overwhelming.'' He then went on to say to this  grieving mother:         But I cannot refrain from tendering you the consolation       that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to       save.        I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of       your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of       the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours       to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.    So said President Lincoln at that time.   The words still ring true today--``the grief of a loss so  overwhelming,'' the memory of ``the loved and lost.'' It goes on to  read ``so costly a sacrifice.''   Every President should read this letter as he or she deliberates  about the use of force that commits our sons and daughters to fight and  risk their lives. When we talk about so costly a sacrifice, we all know  what happened in our State. Military families in Pennsylvania, in the  conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, endured so costly a sacrifice.   I hope President Trump will reread this letter as he deliberates our  next steps with regard to Iran and our next steps with regard to the  authorization for the use of military force.   I yield the floor.
