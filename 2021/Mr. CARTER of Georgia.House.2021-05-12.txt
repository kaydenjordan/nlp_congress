 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Donald Scott Overton of Savannah, Georgia, who  passed away on April 14 at the age of 89.   Scott served our country in the U.S. Army and trained to be a pilot  toward the end of the Korean war, giving him a love for flying that he  would have for the rest of his life.   Scott became an accomplished glider pilot and enjoyed building planes  from a kit in his garage.   Everyone who knew Scott recognized his giving heart and love for  adventure. With his wife and friends, Scott cruised to all the  continents except Africa.   Professionally, Scott worked tirelessly as the president of the  Arthur D. Crane Real Estate Development Company and owned numerous  small water companies.   I am thankful for the immense impact that Scott had on our community,  and I know his legacy will remain.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him, during this most difficult time.                         Recognizing Mickey Stephens     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Georgia Representative Mickey Stephens for his remarkable career  in the Georgia General Assembly.   Mr. Stephens is a native of Savannah and a proud graduate of Savannah  State College.   Mickey served one term in 2002 and was reelected in 2014 to the  Georgia House, representing the 165th District.   As an educator, he was a great asset to Savannah High School, Shuman  Middle School, and John W. Hubert Middle School. Additionally, Mickey  served on the Savannah-Chatham County Board of Public Education and the  Savannah Zoning Board of Appeals.   Mr. Stephens is known throughout Georgia for his civic service,  including his commitment to the community and his efforts in supporting  the education of youth and adults.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Stephens for all of his work to make  Savannah a better place to live. Mr. Stephens is an inspiration to all  of us about giving back to the community.                   Remembering James ``Jimmy'' Allen Petrea     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor the former mayor of Thunderbolt, Jimmy Petrea,  who passed away on April 24 at the age of 74.   Jimmy spent his entire life serving others.   After graduating high school, Jimmy enlisted in the U.S. Navy to  serve our country and went on to serve 3 years in Vietnam.   Jimmy was elected mayor of Thunderbolt in 1981 and was reelected for  multiple terms until he resigned in 2005.   During his 24 years as mayor, Jimmy was highly regarded by his  constituents as a person of unquestioned integrity and dedication.   After a quarter-century of service to the town of Thunderbolt and the  Coastal Empire, one cannot visit Georgia's First Congressional District  without seeing the profound impacts Jimmy made for his community.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him, during this most difficult time.                           Recognizing Martin Bell     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Martin Bell's remarkable career as general manager of the  Okefenokee Swamp Park.   For the past 26 years, Martin Bell has welcomed guests from around  the world to experience the wonders of the Okefenokee Swamp.   Known as an intensely creative and hardworking leader, Mr. Bell's  accomplishments are impressive.   Under Mr. Bell's management, many projects were completed to support  the park's growth and sustainable future. Some of Mr. Bell's more  notable accomplishments include the establishment of the Okefenokee  Railroad, the launch of the holiday light show, the construction of the  Cypress Cove annex and greenhouse, and the reopening of a water trail  that had been closed for 40 years.   Through his stewardship, Mr. Bell has exposed the beauty of the  Okefenokee Swamp Park to visitors from across the globe and built the  park into our State's most desirable ecotourism and educational  destination.   Mr. Bell's passion and leadership for the park will be missed by all  of those, like me, who appreciate his steadfast stewardship.                            ____________________
