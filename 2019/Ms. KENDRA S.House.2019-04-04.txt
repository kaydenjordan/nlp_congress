 HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.   This critical legislation is important not only for survivors, but it  impacts all of us. When we are talking about survivors, we need to also  look at the root of the problem and the lasting impacts of trauma on  the survivors and individuals as a whole. We must acknowledge the  impact of adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs.   ACE scores are based on a list of events one can witness or undergo  before turning 18, including sexual abuse or death in a family. If a  person scores higher than 4, they are 700 times more likely to develop  depression and other negative impacts. Obesity, diabetes, and stroke  also become more likely the higher one's ACE score.   Oklahoma's average ACE score is 4.8, significantly higher than the  rest of the country. It is no coincidence that we rank at the bottom  for health, too.   I am proud of leaders in my own district, like the Palomar Family  Justice Center that uses ACE data and addresses trauma in treating  survivors. I am thankful for the work of the Potts Family Foundation,  which has helped lead the conversation on trauma in Oklahoma and across  the Nation.   These models need to be implemented on a wider scale across the  country, and I am proud to stand with the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act today.                            ____________________
