 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 38 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 38         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order without intervention of any point of order to       consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 21) calling on       Vice President Michael R. Pence to convene and mobilize the       principal officers of the executive departments of the       Cabinet to activate section 4 of the 25th Amendment to       declare President Donald J. Trump incapable of executing the       duties of his office and to immediately exercise powers as       acting President. The amendment to the preamble printed in       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution shall be considered as adopted. The resolution, as       amended, shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and       preamble, as amended, to adoption without intervening motion       or demand for division of the question except one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or       their respective designees.        Sec. 2.  The prohibition against personality in debate       shall not apply during consideration of measures specified in       section 3 of this resolution with respect to references to       the President.        Sec. 3.  The measures referred to in section 2 of this       resolution are as follows:         (a) House Resolution 21.        (b) Any special order of business providing for the       consideration of House Resolution 24.        Sec. 4. (a) During a covered period designated pursuant to       section 3(s) of House Resolution 8--        (1) the Sergeant-at-Arms is authorized and directed to       impose a fine against a Member, Delegate, or the Resident       Commissioner for the failure to wear a mask in contravention       of the Speaker's announced policies of January 4, 2021; and        (2) a fine imposed pursuant to this section shall be       treated as though imposed under clause 3(g) of rule II, and       shall be administered as though pursuant to clause 4(d) of       rule II, except that--        (A) the time periods described in clause 3(g)(3)(C) of rule       II shall not commence until the Committee on Ethics has       adopted written rules, and the chair of the Committee on       Ethics shall notify all Members, Delegates, or the Resident       Commissioner with pending appeals upon such commencement; and        (B) a fine subject to appeal under clause 3(g)(3) of rule       II shall proceed unless dismissed within the time period       provided under clause 3(g)(3)(C) of rule II.        (b) Subsection (a) establishes a standard of conduct within       the meaning of clause 3(a)(2) of rule XI.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported  a closed rule, House Resolution 38, providing for consideration of  House Resolution 21, calling on Vice President Michael R. Pence to  convene and mobilize the principal officers of the executive  departments of the Cabinet to activate section 4 of the 25th Amendment  to declare President Donald J. Trump incapable of executing the duties  of his office and to immediately exercise powers as acting President.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary or a  designee. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment by Chairman  Nadler. The rule provides that the prohibition against engaging in  personalities during debate, with respect to references to the  President, shall not apply during consideration of House Resolution 21  or any special order of business relating to the impeachment of the  President considered on January 13, 2021.   Finally, the rule authorizes and directs the Sergeant at Arms to  impose a fine against a Member, Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner  for the failure to wear a mask in contravention of the Speaker's  announced policy on this subject for the duration of the pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to debate the rule for House  Resolution 21, a resolution calling for Vice President Pence to invoke  the 25th Amendment and declare President Donald Trump incapable of  executing the duties of his office. We take this action solemnly and  with grave concern for the safety and security of our Nation and its  people, even in the final days of this President's administration.   Last Wednesday, a lawless mob breached this Chamber with the most  evil and destructive intent. They were here to take the law into their  own hands, to disrupt Congress as it counted the electoral college  votes, and to overturn the lawful election of Joseph Biden as our 46th  President.   As violent invaders broke windows and rammed doors, they chanted that  they wanted to hang the Vice President and kidnap the Speaker of the  House, and they brought the tools to do it. They beat one police  officer to death, tased others, and tried to shoot one with his own  gun. Another officer will likely lose an eye. Scores of others  [[Page H127]]  suffered head injuries when they were beaten with pipes. Blood was  spilled on the marble floor just outside this room.   Members, staff, and reporters were forced to take cover under  furniture and barricade themselves in rooms, clutching gas masks and  fearing for their lives as the President's MAGA supporters chanted and  raged nearby. Journalists were specifically targeted and beaten.  Explosive devices were placed nearby to divert the police from  protecting the Capitol.   This was not a peaceful protest. These were crimes against our  country and the people who go to work every day on Capitol Hill. Just  this afternoon, the FBI announced that it expects to charge hundreds of  people with crimes ranging from simple trespass to conspiracy and  sedition, to weapons offenses, to felony murder.   Crimes like this do not occur in a vacuum. They must be planned. They  must be led.   The attack on the Capitol was incited by this administration. For  months, they told their supporters that if they didn't win the  election, the election was rigged. When the majority of American voters  decided they had had enough of this chaos, they declared that the  election had been stolen. The administration invited the President's  most rabid supporters to come to D.C. on January 6 for a wild protest.  Then the administration whipped them into a frenzy and sent the mob  across town to attack the Capitol and disrupt the counting of electoral  college votes. But it didn't end there.   The President reportedly watched with excitement as the news media  began streaming images of the terror at the Capitol through electronic  devices in America and around the world. The President tweeted that the  Vice President had betrayed him. And even after the violence was  apparent, the President and his lawyer placed calls to allies on  Capitol Hill, trying to persuade them to prolong their objections to  the counting of the electoral votes. What the administration didn't do  for hours was to lift a finger to call off the mob or to rally support  to defend the government, the historic monuments in the Capitol, the  police, or especially the people under siege in the building. Members  here in this Chamber know that, for hours, the President refused to  return their calls begging for help.    Mr. Speaker, in the days since, the administration has continued to  claim that the election was rigged. It has denied any responsibility  for the riot, and praised the rioters, all while reports proliferate  that the administration's supporters are planning more violence in the  weeks ahead.   This is why this President remains a clear and present danger to the  country, so long as he continues to serve. The reality is that we all-- even the most loyal political supporters--know that this President is  unfit for office. Any other President with an ounce of character would  have resigned after seeing the bloody consequences of the actions on  Wednesday. Any other administration would have invoked the 25th  Amendment long ago.   I don't care if a President incites a riot against Congress on his  first day or the last day of his or her Presidency. Such an act is a  crime against our government, much less against the people who are  terrorized or killed in the attack. If a President can refuse to  acknowledge the will of American voters, then incite a coup to stay in  power without punishment, then our democracy is lost.   Mr. Speaker, that is why it is vital for Vice President Pence and the  Cabinet to do the right thing--to invoke the 25th Amendment. Otherwise,  this Congress must remove Donald Trump from office.   I have heard the calls for unity, and I agree that now is the time to  come forward in unity, to defend our country, not to defend a man who  has proven himself incompetent to occupy the office of the President  for another day.   I am grateful to those Members of the Republican Party who agreed  that the time has come to put loyalty to country above partisan  considerations. And we welcome their support in taking whatever actions  are necessary to end this chaos, to defend our government, and to  protect the American people.                                time  1830    I also find the cries of partisanship by the President's remaining  supporters to be unconvincing. The whole world watched in horror on  January 6 as the administration encouraged a mob to attack the seat of  our democracy to disrupt the election of Joseph R. Biden and then stood  by as rioters sacked the Capitol.   Many civic leaders from both parties have condemned the President's  actions and called for his removal. So, no, this is not partisan.   But I invite the President's supporters in Congress--no, I beg them-- to join the American people in holding this President accountable for  the violence we experienced last week and to prevent further chaos in  the days to come.   Before I conclude, I want to take a minute to give my deepest  condolences to the families of the Capitol Police officers who died as  a result of this attack. I want to thank the men and women of the  Metropolitan and Capitol Police forces who valiantly defended both our  democracy and the people who work on the Hill and wish a speedy  recovery to the scores who were injured during the attack.   I also want to thank our tireless facilities and custodial staff for  putting the building back together after terrorists violated it and the  members of the press corps who have been so abused by this  administration and were specifically targeted by this mob but continued  documenting the attack so Americans could see what was really  happening.   Lastly, I want to thank our staff across the Capitol for their  bravery and dedication to public service. I want to thank them for the  work they do every day but especially for their heroism in returning to  the floor last Wednesday night to help us continue the electoral  college vote count, and I thank them for being back here with us today.  We are indebted to them for their service to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Speaker, we, of course, share the concern of our  colleagues from the other side of the aisle that an incident like this  never happens again. That is why we are urging the Vice President to  invoke the 25th Amendment, because of the clear and present danger of  continued violence under this administration.   While I believe there will be a time to talk about bipartisan efforts  to have an investigation through this House, this is not the moment for  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui), a distinguished former member of the Rules Committee.    I would just suggest that sedition is inherently  divisive, and it is difficult to unify before there has been  accountability.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Suozzi).    Just to clarify, this provision about suspending the  rule about personalities is so that we can have a full and frank  discussion of just why the request is being made to invoke the 25th  Amendment and just why this President should be impeached. It would be  difficult, if not impossible, to describe the high crimes and  misdemeanors and other misconduct which forms the basis of those  requests if that rule were not suspended.   As I mentioned in my opening, we don't view this as a partisan  resolution. We have Members from all sides of the political spectrum  now calling for the removal of this President. Members might want to  check their news feed to see the growing list of civic, business, and  religious leaders from across the country who have said: Enough is  enough. This President is a clear and present danger.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I would inquire if  the gentleman has any more speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, after the chaos and potentially--well, definitely  criminal behavior that we saw here last week, there is no trust left  between this administration and the majority of the American people.   The stability of our executive branch is a foundational piece of our  democracy. This administration has failed or refused to uphold the most  basic duties of protecting our Constitution and our national security  or of respecting the coequal branches of our government.   Wednesday's bloody attack proved that this administration is an  imminent and continuing danger to our country even in the waning days  of this Presidency.   I am heartbroken for our country but more determined than ever to  fight to preserve our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I call on Vice President Pence and the Cabinet to do the  right thing. I call upon our colleagues to do the right thing: to put  our country before the interests of any one man and to join us in  ending this failed Presidency.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and the  underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                      Amendment to House Resolution 38         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 275) to establish the National Commission on the       Domestic Terrorist Attack Upon the United States Capitol. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Homeland Security; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 275.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
