 Madam Speaker, I rise today with gratitude to bid this  body farewell.   I thank my family, my friends, my supporters, and the wonderful  people of Georgia's Seventh Congressional District for the honor of  serving as your Representative in Congress.   While there are many things we accomplished, the most important  occurred in my first week in office. On January 3, as I was on the  floor to be sworn in, I looked at my phone and saw a notification that  President Trump had tried to illegally pressure Georgia's secretary of  state into finding 11,780 more votes to change the results of the  election.   A few days later, on January 6, as I was in my office preparing  remarks to defend Georgia's electoral count, I was told to lock down  and to shelter in place. There I sat for hours and hours with my sister  and a couple of staff as we followed on TV and through text threads the  mob attacking the Capitol and the narrow escapes of many of my  colleagues.   I was one of the first of my colleagues to call for impeaching  President Trump because there was never any doubt in my mind that he  had incited that crowd to march on the Capitol to try to block the vote  to certify the election and to keep himself in power.   That night, I walked past the broken glass through the eerie, empty  halls to certify the election of Joe Biden as the next President of the  United States.   At some point during these events, majority leader Steny Hoyer turned  to me and said: ``I bet this wasn't what you expected when you ran for  Congress.'' I told him that actually I ran for Congress precisely so  that I could be standing at this place at this time to take this vote  to certify the election and to defend our democracy.   I know that many of the people who supported me in the 4-year effort  to flip Georgia's Seventh Congressional District and to deliver Georgia  for the Democrats worked so hard and sacrificed so much in large part  because they, too, saw the danger and worried that President Trump  would stop at nothing to achieve and retain power. While there were  many other important issues at stake, fundamentally, we saw our efforts  as a rescue mission for our country.   I know that many other democratic frontliners saw their efforts the  same way. I know that some of my Republican colleagues who took brave  votes at great political risk shared our concerns.   So for those who are cynical about our politics, who believe that it  is all about corruption, money, and power--and, yes, there is a lot of  that--please know that many people of integrity, courage, and talent in  both parties and in many different roles worked hard for years to be at  the right place at the right time in this particular moment in our  country's history so that they could hold the line to stop the forces  of chaos and autocracy and renew our democracy for one more turn of the  wheel.   I want to recognize the sacrifice of my family and thank my husband,  Jeff, and my son, Nathan, who encouraged me all along the way. I want  to recognize my sister, Margaret Bourdeaux, who threw herself into  helping me day in and day out, and my aunt and uncle, Margaret and  Howard Arbuckle, who stood by me when both my parents died in 2017 and  told me I could not quit working for change, it was too important.   I thank my many supporters whose persistent acts of courage and  sacrifice allowed me to have this brief but very important time in  Congress.   While the preservation of our democracy was always top of mind, we  accomplished quite a lot on other fronts, including the American Rescue  Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS Act, and  the Inflation Reduction Act.   Also critical to the Seventh District was the PPP Extension Act and  almost  [[Page H9915]]  $18 million in community funding projects that will allow the  restoration and preservation of our community's Black history, that  will support critical early childhood education programs, that will  promote small businesses and innovation and economic development and  infrastructure, and that will support a vast array of much-needed  mental health and other social service programs in our rapidly growing  community.   To my staff, all that we have accomplished would not have been  possible without you. Thank you for your hard work and dedication, and  I look forward to seeing what you do next.   To the residents of Georgia's Seventh District, thank you again for  the honor of representing our community in Congress.                            ____________________
