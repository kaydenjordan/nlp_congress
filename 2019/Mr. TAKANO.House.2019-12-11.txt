 Mr. Speaker, Americans are skipping their medications  because the cost of prescription drugs is too expensive. This is  immoral.   Americans are going into debt because the cost of prescription drugs  is too high. This is immoral.   Americans often pay four times more for the same drugs as those in  foreign countries. This is immoral.   This is why I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E.  Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, legislation that will lower the cost  of prescription drugs for millions of Americans and benefit nearly  500,000 people in my district.   No one in America should have to ration their medicine. No one in  America should have to travel to another country because the medication  they need is too unaffordable here.   We have a moral obligation to put the needs of American people above  the greed of the pharmaceutical industry.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of this critical piece  of legislation.                            ____________________
