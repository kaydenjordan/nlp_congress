 Mr. Speaker, this year, we recognize the 100th  anniversary of the equal rights amendment. Today, I rise to  commemorate, as well, the 60th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act of  1963.   Women in our Nation have made great progress in the fight for pay  equality over the past six decades, but it is not nearly enough. We  must close the gap.   Women in Ohio earn 79 cents for every dollar a man earns, and that is  unacceptable. This pay gap has an impact on women's ability to excel in  the workforce, pay for basic necessities, and build retirement savings  for a successful future.   This pay disparity has remained relatively stable over the last 20  years, but this status quo will continue unless we work to close it. We  must ensure equal compensation across the board and rightfully pay  hardworking women their hard-earned dollars.   Women are invaluable members in every workplace and deserve equal  compensation for equal work.   Let us prioritize closing the gender pay gap once and for all and  lift up mothers, sisters, grandmothers, and daughters in our workforce.                            ____________________
