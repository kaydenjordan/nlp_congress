 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1435, the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act.   Democrats' radical Green New Deal agenda is once again being forced  on the American people. This comes on the heels after the Biden  administration has sold 40 percent of our oil reserves and none have  been replenished, endangering our national security.   They passed the Green New Deal and multiple bills, the infrastructure  bill, to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations in the U.S.,  even though there is no mass demand for electric vehicles. They are  also forcing Americans to go net zero by 2035, a date that our current  President will unlikely ever even see.   Forcing Americans to have no choice in the type of automobile that  they drive, on the type of engine that they prefer is forcing every  American's knee to bend to China, our worst enemy.   This is traitorous to autoworkers, traitorous to auto unions, and  traitorous to every American auto consumer.
