 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6753) to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to direct  the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a public- private partnership for purposes of identifying health care waste,  fraud, and abuse, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Such report shall include       the estimated cost of and any potential barriers to the       partnership establishing such a system.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 6753, the  Strengthening the Health Care Fraud Prevention Task Force Act of 2018,  authored by Chairman  Greg Walden and Ranking Member Frank Pallone of  the Energy and Commerce Committee.   H.R. 6753 seeks to codify the Health Care Fraud Prevention  Partnership, which would better equip public and private organizations  to combat and prevent fraud and abuse in our healthcare system.   Tens of billions of dollars are lost to healthcare fraud in the  United States every year, and much of this fraud is preventable or, at  the very least, detectable. Fraud and abuse within our healthcare  system comes in various forms, ranging from telephone or email scams to  obtain patient information to fraudulent billing practices.   Healthcare fraud is not only costly to the Federal and State  governments and an avoidable waste of taxpayer dollars. Fraud and abuse  is costly for, and often hurtful to, American patients.   For example, in May of this year, a doctor in Texas was indicted in a  fraud case involving $240 million worth of claims. A Department of  Justice investigation found that the rheumatologist had given patients  false diagnoses, followed by chemotherapy and other treatments that  they did not need.   Americans should feel confident in and be able to trust their  doctors. The unfortunate reality is that there are bad actors who make  decisions based solely on financial interests and not on what is best  for the patient or for their fellow citizens.   Another Texas case was settled just last month as a hospital  administrator in Houston was convicted for his involvement in a $16  million fraud scheme. In this particular case, the hospital  administrator had orchestrated a system of kickbacks with various  individuals in return for sending Medicare patients to certain partial  hospitalization program services. Thanks to various investigative  bodies bridging the Departments of Justice and Health and Human  Services, this fraud was uncovered and investigated in an effort to  protect both patients and taxpayer dollars from exploitation.   Lastly, near my district in north Texas, there was a scheme in which  a semiretired doctor signed off on fraudulent paperwork, including  payments for fake patients. What started as a retirement gig rubber- stamping documents ended in his conviction, due to his involvement in a  $13 million home healthcare scam. The scam in its entirety stole $373  million from Medicare and Medicaid.   I could go on with stories of healthcare fraud just in Texas, because  these three examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately,  rampant healthcare fraud is not a Texas-specific issue. It is prevalent  across our Nation. This is why we need to pass H.R. 6753 and codify the  Health Care Fraud Prevention Partnership.   The partnership was established by the Secretary of the Department of  Health and Human Services and the United States Attorney General in  September 2012 through the signing of a charter. It is currently  operated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and has  allowed for increased coordination in addressing healthcare fraud,  waste, and abuse, but has not been codified in statute.   This partnership is voluntary among both private and public entities  to reduce fraud in our healthcare system. Participants in this critical  partnership include the Federal Government, State agencies, law  enforcement, private health insurance plans, employer  [[Page H9673]]  organizations, and other associations. The partnership allows for  robust analyses of healthcare across different players, including  Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers.   While these partners have access to their own data, cross-payer  analyses are crucial in identifying savings and increasing detection of  fraud, waste, and abuse. Collaborating through data sharing and other  methods, the partners can paint a broad picture of the fraud networks  and cast a wide net, increasing the ability to intervene and stop  payments, and establish new and effective fraud prevention techniques.   It is worth noting that, in addition to codifying and formalizing the  Health Care Fraud Prevention Task Force, the bill requires the task  force to perform an analysis of abnormal or fraudulent billing patterns  and trends by providers and suppliers of substance use disorder  treatments. This effort fits nicely into what Congress has accomplished  this year with the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act being  signed into law.   H.R. 6753 will make a difference in cutting waste, fraud, and abuse  in our healthcare system. I support this legislation and urge fellow  Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 2422) to amend the Public Health  Service Act to improve essential oral health care for low-income and  other underserved individuals by breaking down barriers to care, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Section 340G of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       256g) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)(5)--        (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the end;       and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(D) the establishment or development of models for the       provision of dental services to children and adults, such as       dental homes, including for the elderly, blind, individuals       with disabilities, and individuals living in long-term care       facilities; and        ``(E) the establishment of initiatives to reduce the use of       emergency departments by individuals who seek dental services       more appropriately delivered in a dental primary care       setting;''; and        (2) in subsection (f), by striking ``$25,000,000 for the 5-      fiscal year period beginning with fiscal year 2008'' and       inserting ``$13,903,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 through       2023''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H9674]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we can all agree that good oral health is important for  all Americans: our children, our seniors, and our families in north  Texas and other neighborhoods across the Nation. It affects our ability  to speak, eat, and show emotions. Yet, good oral health remains an  unmet medical need for many Americans, particularly in rural or  underserved communities.   Increasing access to vital healthcare services like dental health is  a priority for many on the Energy and Commerce Committee. So I am  pleased that today the House is again considering H.R. 2422, the Action  for Dental Health Act of 2018, following recent action in the Senate.   This bill, introduced by Representatives Robin Kelly and Mike  Simpson, takes several steps to improve essential oral healthcare for  disadvantaged patients by breaking down barriers to care and giving  them the dental health treatment and disease prevention services they  need through existing Federal dollars.   Also, most of us are aware that poor oral health can raise the risk  of tooth decay, gum disease, and oral cancer. These oral diseases can  lead to pain and disability for millions of Americans.   It also costs taxpayers and employers billions of dollars each year.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on  average, the Nation spends more than $124 billion per year on costs  related to dental care. More than $6 billion of productivity is lost  each year because employees miss work because of dental problems.   Poor oral health can even be linked to other chronic health  conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Many of these conditions  can be avoided by simple preventive measures, such as regular cleaning  and water fluoridation.   Dentists and dental specialists from Texas discussed similar concerns  with me during meetings in the district and here in Washington. H.R.  2422 aims to address these issues and has the support of several  national dental groups like the American Dental Association and the  American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, to name two.   Specifically, the bill seeks to reauthorize activities for oral  health promotion and disease prevention at the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention. In many rural and underserved regions in Texas,  these activities would expand school-based dental sealant programs and  further support community water fluoridation.                                time  1645    The bill also establishes an Action for Dental Health Program within  the Department of Health and Human Services to improve oral health  education and reduce barriers to oral healthcare by awarding grants,  contracts, or cooperative agreements to dental associations, health  departments, accredited dental education programs, or nonprofit,  community-based organizations.   These grants and agreements could be used by these eligible entities  to collaborate with State or local public health officials, Tribal  health officials, oral health professionals, or other appropriate  groups to support initiatives under the Action for Dental Health  Program.   Lastly, this legislation reauthorizes and expands a grant program  through the Health Resources and Services Administration for innovative  dental programs at over $13 million annually for fiscal years 2019  through 2023. These grants will help States increase their oral health  workforce and offer needed dental care in dental health professional  shortage areas.   Some of the eligible activities for States include establishing  dental homes, which refers to comprehensive oral healthcare, for  children and adults and creating initiatives to reduce the use of  emergency departments for dental services.   I believe targeting resources to facilitate the provision of dental  services to those in need in addition to improving oral health  education will help prevent dental diseases before they start. This  will ultimately reduce medical complications, emergency room visits,  and poor dental health outcomes in underserved communities, not only in  Texas but across the United States.   Benjamin Franklin once famously stated that ``an ounce of prevention  is worth a pound of cure.'' We can heed those famous words by passing  H.R. 2422 today and sending it to the President's desk. I urge all  Members to support this important and bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on the measure, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 41 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, November 29, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
