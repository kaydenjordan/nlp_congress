 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute as in morning business.    Last week, Siouxland Energy, an ethanol plant in Sioux  Center, IA, announced that they are halting production due to the  unfair small refinery exemptions.   This farmer-owned plant was annually buying 23.4 million bushels of  corn from farmers in the area, and it also employed 42,000 people who,  today, do not know when they will be able to go back to work. This kind  of economic impact is a big deal in rural communities. If it spreads,  it is going to create a lot of unemployment and closed ethanol plants  in other places around the country. I have heard of production halts  announced in other States as well.   In fact, the ethanol industry supports more than 365,000 total jobs,  and the biodiesel industry supports more than 65,000 total jobs. We  have made great progress through the Renewable Fuel Standard in  diversifying our Nation's fuel supply while creating jobs and  strengthening local economies.   We have to get this issue settled. I hope we can get an announcement  from the EPA very soon about that so we can get these plants open and  get these people back to work.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
