 Madam Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 41 rejecting  white nationalism and white supremacy.   Today, on what would have been Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 90th  birthday, I am honored to join Majority Whip Clyburn in denouncing the  racist remarks of Representative Steve King and condemning white  supremacy and white nationalism in all forms. Hatred and bigotry should  have no home in America, and certainly not one in the Halls of  Congress.   Dr. King was one of the finest citizens this country has produced: a  champion for justice and a fearless crusader for equality. Today and  every day, we must honor the life and legacy of Dr. King, while also  acknowledging the work which remains. We must strongly condemn hateful  expressions of intolerance wherever and whenever we see them.   America is strongest when we stand together. From the Lowcountry to  the heartland, I believe that today is a promising start.
