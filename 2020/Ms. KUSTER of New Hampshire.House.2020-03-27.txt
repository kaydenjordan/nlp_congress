 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this  unprecedented emergency relief for the American people.   My colleague Chris Pappas and I have spoken with tens of thousands of  our constituents through telephone townhalls and conference calls with  hospitals.   I want support for our people who have lost their jobs, for our small  businesses, but, most importantly, for our frontline healthcare workers  in our rural hospitals. We need supplies, and we need support.   I thank you for voting ``yes.''                                time  1220
