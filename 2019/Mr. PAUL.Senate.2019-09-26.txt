 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 942 and ask  that it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to complete my  remarks before we begin the next vote.    My amendment to this spending bill will be to cut 2 percent  across the board, so we can actually be responsible and try to balance  our budget.   Most people I talk to at home or people who come up here, who are  seeking assistance from the Federal Government, say: That doesn't sound  too bad--1 or 2 percent. We could deal with that.   People come to me and say: Well, my group is doing this great  research for this disease that affects all of these people.   I say: How much are you getting?   They say: $100 million.   I say: We have a trillion-dollar debt, and everybody ought to try to  spend what comes in rather than spending money we don't have. Does it  make sense even for a good cause to borrow money from China to spend  money we don't have?   Most of them--even groups that live at the Federal trough, groups  that need and want and all they come here for is Federal money--say:  Well, that is not too unreasonable. We got $100 million last year.   Could you take $98 million for the good of the country? Instead of  getting $100 million, could you take $98 million--2 percent less--in  order to balance the budget and not destroy the country with all of  this debt?   Interestingly, whether these groups are from the left, right, center,  Republican, Democrat, or Independent, most of them look at me and nod  their heads. I think the groups that receive Federal money realize this  massive debt we have is destroying the country. Even the groups  receiving it are willing to cut 1 percent or 2 percent. But do you know  who is not? The Senate--the Congress. They will not cut anything.   My amendment today to add a 2-percent cut to this spending will get  15 or 20 votes. Not one Democrat will vote for this bill. Do you know  what the Democrats will say? They will say: The debt is because you cut  taxes. This is something that is factually incorrect. We did cut taxes,  but revenue is up. This is a fact. We cut the tax rates, but the  economy is growing gangbusters, and revenue is up.   Why do we have a massive debt? Why are we breaking records? Why, in  February, did we have more debt added than at any other time in our  history? Why are we about to bust a trillion dollars in debts this  year? It is spending; it isn't revenue. Revenue is up.   We did cut tax rates, and companies are growing like they haven't  grown in decades. If you talk to businesses, the biggest problem in our  country right now is they can't find enough people to work for them.  There is a labor shortage in our country. It is a great time to be a  worker in our country.   But this will not pass. My amendment will not pass because people are  afraid that the public will not like them if they don't give them more  money. I am afraid we will destroy the country if we keep running more  debts.   The debt is growing at 8 percent a year. Spending is growing only at  4.5 percent, 5 percent a year. The debt is growing more rapidly because  we have accumulated so much. We have over a $22 trillion debt. The  interest this year is over $300 billion. As it grows faster and faster,  the interest will exceed what we are spending on the military within  about 5 years. Nobody is doing anything about it.   We passed spending caps 5 years ago. It was called the sequester. It  went on for a while and actually was reducing the debt. Then you ask  whose fault is it that we have this massive debt, this massive  spending; is it Republicans or Democrats? The answer is yes. Both  parties are fiscally irresponsible, but it has nothing to do with taxes  or revenue. Revenue is going up dramatically. It has to do with  spending. Both parties are guilty of this.   The Republicans want unlimited military spending, and the Democrats  want unlimited welfare spending. People say that there is not enough  compromise in Washington. That is absolutely untrue. It is absolutely  misreported by the media. There is too much compromise here. The  compromise is always to spend more money and to spend money we don't  have. The military gets their unlimited money, and the welfare state  gets unlimited spending. Republicans and Democrats both join hands  together, and what happens around here on a day-to-day basis is  compromise to spend money we don't have, to borrow it from China and,  sometimes, to send it back to China.   Do you realize we send economic development aid to China? That is  ridiculous. We send money all around the world. Many of these countries  that get money don't like us. They hate us. They burn our flag in the  street, yet we send them money. We are not even sending our own money.  We borrow from China to send it out.   I think this is a very reasonable proposal. Some will say it is  draconian. If they passed my amendment today and cut spending by 2  percent, we would still be spending more money than 2 years ago. We  would be spending $19 billion more than 2 years ago. If we pass my 2  percent cut--the 2-penny cut that I am proposing--we would still be  spending more money than the caps that the vast Senate majority voted  on 5 years ago.   Why is the debt burgeoning? Whose fault is it? Is it Republicans; is  it Democrats? The answer is yes. Both parties are acting fiscally  irresponsibly. It has nothing to do with tax revenue and has everything  to do with spending. People say that the people want it. Do the people  want a bankrupt country? Do they want a country that is being eaten  from the inside out? Do they want this reckless spending that someday  will lead to a day of reckoning? No.   I think we have to get our house in order and get our budget in  order. I think we need to balance our budget. If my amendment for a 2- percent cut were to pass--how many families have had to deal with 2  percent less? How many businesses in bad times have to cut their budget  by 2 percent? If the government were today to pass my amendment--a 2- percent cut--that means you get 98 percent of everything they are  spending. We would balance the budget within 5 years. That is  ostensibly what many Republicans say they are for.    When we have a vote for a balanced budget, everybody lines up, and  all of  [[Page S5723]]  the Republicans vote for a balanced budget amendment to the  Constitution that says the budget will balance within 5 years. Then,  when given the opportunity to vote for spending cuts, we lose half of  the Republicans. The Democrats don't care, as they will not vote for  spending cuts, but the Republicans at least profess to be for spending  cuts. Yet, when we offer a modest proposal like this, we lose half of  the Republicans.   There is a problem with debts, and both parties share some guilt.  What I have put forward today, though, is an opportunity for the  Senators who truly believe the debt is a problem to try to restrain  spending with a 2-percent cut across the board. I hope Senators will  consider voting for this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.                          Vote on Amendment No. 942     Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
