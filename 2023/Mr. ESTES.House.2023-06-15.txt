 Madam Speaker, today I honor a longtime friend and Kansan  with a true servant's heart, Treatha Brown-Foster.   One minute is not nearly enough time to adequately share all the  impressive contributions Treatha has made to Wichita and Kansas. She  was a member of the Library Board, District 1 Advisory Board, Boys and  Girls Club Parent Advisory Board, and the Kansas African American  Museum Board, just to name a few. She was instrumental in advancing  both the Kansas and Sedgwick County Black Republican Councils, serving  in various leadership roles, including chair.   While her contributions to society are many, her real legacy is the  joy she brought to all who were around her. Kansans who met Treatha  will remember her animated smile, infectious laugh, and warm hugs that  were a prerequisite to starting any conversation with her.   She loved everyone, and everyone loved her, as made evident by the  numerous community leaders and elected officials who sought her  friendship and counsel regardless of political differences.   Madam Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence to honor this beloved  Kansan and my friend, Treatha Brown-Foster.                            ____________________
