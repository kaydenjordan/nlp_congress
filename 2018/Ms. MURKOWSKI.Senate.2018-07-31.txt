 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we are working through the remaining  issues as they relate to the various appropriations bills before us, I  wanted to take just a few moments this afternoon to speak about a  friend of mine, a friend of Alaska's, a gentleman, and a leader,  Alaska's LTG Michael H. Shields, who is retiring from the U.S. Army  after 35 years of service. I thank Mike on behalf of my Senate  colleagues and the people of Alaska for his outstanding service as he  retires from Active Duty.   Mike received his commission through the Army Reserve Officers'  Training Corps at Norwich University in 1983. Like so many of Alaska's  best and finest citizens, we kind of adopted him. He came to Alaska to  serve. He came to love our State, and we just loved him right back.   I first came to know Mike as Colonel Shields when he was commanding  the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team--known as the Arctic Wolves--at  Fort Wainwright, AK, just outside of Fairbanks. He led the brigade  during the height of Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was a very difficult  command, probably one of the more difficult commands any colonel could  imagine.   The Arctic Wolves had executed their planned 2005 to 2006 deployment  in northern Iraq. They had done an exceptional job, and they were ready  to come home. They had been there for a full deployment. The plans were  laid. The families had all been told. This very successful, yearlong  deployment was coming to an end during the early summer of 2006. Again,  there was a great deal of excitement about the end of that deployment.  The problem, though, was that it was not coming to an end. The unit had  performed very well in northern Iraq, and the Pentagon basically said:  We need more help. We need you to help out in the vicinity around  Baghdad.   As it is with the military, the Pentagon didn't exactly ask the  soldiers if  [[Page S5478]]  they wanted to extend their deployment; they told the soldiers that the  deployment was going to be extended. That is not unusual. This is the  military. You go where you are told to go and when you are told to go.  Unfortunately, this message was delivered in a messy and very chaotic  way. It was very sudden, and it was without warning to their families.  Some of the elements of the 172nd had already returned to Fort  Wainwright, and ultimately they had to redeploy. They had to go back to  Iraq. Other elements were actually in the air on the way home when  their planes were turned around.   I was in Fairbanks, at Fort Wainwright, at the time, and I can recall  going through the gates, and there were areas where there were chain  link fences. Kids had taken papier-mache and stuffed it in the chain  link to spell out the words ``Welcome Home Daddy'' and hearts. The  messages of love and excitement about their dad or their husband coming  home were everywhere. But when the plug is pulled and they are told  they are not going to be coming home, it is extraordinarily  disappointing not only for those who have been deployed for this  yearlong period but also for those families who are literally waiting,  who knew exactly what they were going to be wearing when their dad  stepped off that airplane, to be told ``He is not coming home now, and  we don't know when he is coming home.'' It was very difficult when  these families were told to wait. The families were angry. They were  upset. They were very angry. They felt they had been misled and with  good cause.    Fortunately, the Army and the Fairbanks community just kind of  stepped up to wrap their arms around the families during this now- extended deployment, and things calmed down. These are military  families. They are tough. They have gone through these separations, and  as hard as that had been, they had kind of set their heads right and  said: No. We are going to get through this. That may have been the easy  part.   Mike, on the other hand, our colonel, had to deal with these problems  from a distance. Baghdad is 5,620 miles and 11 time zones away from  Fairbanks. So not only did Mike have to manage the challenges of the  battlefield in Iraq but also the challenges of maintaining troop morale  and focus across all of this time and distance.   Part of the problem--and making matters worse--was that nobody really  knew how long this extension would be. When you think about all that  goes on in a tense situation like that, only the most outstanding of  leaders can really pull something like this off, and Mike proved  himself to be the best of the best. He reminded his troops, they needed  to stick together in order to survive.   He said: ``The strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of  the wolf is the pack.'' That is the motto of the Arctic Wolves.   Then-Colonel Shields went on to say:         It means no wolf pack is stronger than its individual       hunter, and no hunter is more important than the pack.       Individually, we accomplish little. As a team, we accomplish       much.    The troops endured what turned out to be a 4-month extension on top  of their initial deployment. The unit returned home by Christmas. The  American Forces Press Service reported on December 15 of 2006 that the  Arctic Wolves earned distinction in Iraq as they took on what then-Army  Secretary Francis Harvey called ``the toughest challenge of any unit in  Iraq.'' Again, there are many reasons to be very proud of all they have  done under the command of Colonel Shields.   Mike moved on to other challenges. He was twice promoted following  that deployment. He then went back to Alaska. I was thrilled when Mike  returned as a major general to command U.S. Army Alaska, which was  headquartered at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. He  returned to Alaska in 2013 to command U.S. Army Alaska. He branded U.S.  Army Alaska as the Army's experts in high-altitude, cold-weather ground  operations.   One of our really great--I mean truly great--training assets is the  Northern Warfare Training Center in Black Rapids, AK. Mike ensured that  his troops were trained at Black Rapids for missions that would demand  their unique skill sets. He then opened Black Rapids to the allied  troops who required those skills. He was really an effective evangelist  for the Army's cold-weather mission--a mission of increasing importance  as the Arctic has become more strategic.   He has told me numerous times of some of the challenges of training  some of these young soldiers how to ski in extremely cold conditions  with very interesting Army-issued skis and equipment. One of these  days, he will challenge me to a race, but I don't know. In knowing the  skills of General Shields, I think I am going to pass on that.   Prior to departing Alaska for his next assignment in 2015, Mike was  required to host visiting Army officials who were studying a major  downsizing that potentially involved the consolidation of brigades.  Both the 172nd, which was then rebranded the 1st of the 25th, and the  Airborne Brigade at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson were potentially on  the chopping block.   Big Army was looking at a variety of scenarios across its enterprise,  and that brought evaluation teams to both Anchorage and Fairbanks. He  showed the evaluation teams our remarkable training assets. Even more  importantly, he prepared the teams for what they would hear at the  community meetings. What they heard was that Alaska was a very special  place for our military families and that Alaska communities went above  and beyond what was expected in their support of military communities.  Whatever else one may say about Alaska's military value, it is a great  place for military families.   The evaluation teams left with favorable impressions of what Alaska  had to offer. The Stryker Brigade survived this process. Yes, we fought  to retain our Airborne Brigade at JBER, but Mike laid very solid  groundwork for our ultimate success, and we are very grateful to him  for his support of the Alaska mission.   Throughout, Mike distinguished himself through exceptionally  meritorious service and achievement in a multitude of assignments of  increasing responsibility, culminating as the Director of the Joint  Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization, and he has proven to be an  exceptional and inspiring leader there.   His selfless service, dedication to duty, and unyielding devotion to  soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coalition partners are in  keeping with the finest traditions of military service.   The distinctive accomplishments of Lieutenant General Shields bring  great credit upon himself, the U.S. Army, and the Department of  Defense. It is with great pride that I reflect upon his outstanding  career before the U.S. Senate today.   I yield the floor.
