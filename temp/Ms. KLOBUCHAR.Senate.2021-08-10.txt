 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3731 and  ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, this amendment, which I am  introducing with Senators Booker, Warnock, and Schatz, would allow the  Budget Committee to reallocate funding for the Capitol Police;  Washington, DC; and Metropolitan Police and all first responders who  defended the Capitol on January 6.   The insurrection at the Capitol was more than an assault on  democracy; it was an actual life-or-death situation for the many brave  law enforcement officers who show up here to work every single day.   Last week, we unanimously passed legislation, which Senator Blunt and  I led, to award the Congressional Gold Medal to honor these officers. I  was proud to stand with President Biden when he signed it into law.   This amendment shows our continued commitment to remembering the  heroism and the sacrifice of the first responders who risk their lives  to protect this Capitol.   Before I came to the Senate, I saw firsthand the vital role that law  enforcement officers play in keeping our citizens safe. That is why I  am not surprised by the last vote and the nature of the last vote.   I thank Senator Booker for his response to Senator Tuberville's  amendment. We also must ensure that the officers in this place have the  resources they need to do their jobs.    And we took an important path forward in passing the  funding for the police.   I want to thank my colleagues who join me in introducing this  amendment. I ask all my colleagues to join us in voting for it.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3731    I ask for the yeas and nays.
