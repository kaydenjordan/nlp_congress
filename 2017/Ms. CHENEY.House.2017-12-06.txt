 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for  consideration of H.R. 38 and the underlying bill, the Concealed Carry  Reciprocity Act.   The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Mr. Speaker,  protects the individual rights of American citizens to keep and bear  arms. This is a fundamental right to our great Republic.   In Wyoming, Mr. Speaker, we know that this is a God-given right  enshrined in our Constitution, which is why Wyoming is a constitutional  carry State. Wyoming is not alone in this Constitution-based  conviction.   Across the country, Mr. Speaker, 42 States broadly recognize the  right of law-abiding citizens to carry concealed handguns. Further, all  50 States allow some form of concealed carry. Many States, but not all,  Mr. Speaker, already recognize the gun laws of other States.   However, Mr. Speaker, those traveling through or living on the border  of a State that does not recognize their home State's laws could have  their gun rights stripped when they cross State lines. That is wrong,  Mr. Speaker.   This puts otherwise law-abiding citizens in a situation where they  may be criminally liable for simply carrying out their constitutional  right to keep and bear arms.   The constitutional rights of United States citizens should not change  or end at State lines, Mr. Speaker. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act  ensures the rights of law-abiding citizens to travel across State lines  without worrying about the conflicting patchwork of State concealed  carry laws or regulations.   This bill is crucial to protecting our constitutional rights.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and  the underlying bill.
