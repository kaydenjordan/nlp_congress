 Mr. President, today I wish to honor a Mountain  State coaching legend from Raleigh County, Tex Williams. He is as  legendary and as influential in West Virginia as two of his best  friends, Jerry West and Logan High School Coaching legend Willie Akers.   Good coaches are able to show you what it takes to succeed in the  game. Special coaches are able to put that human touch to it and go a  step beyond to have a positive impact on your life. Tex was able to  capture both. He was the longtime coach at St. Albans and also served  as coach at Vinson High School, Nitro High School, the University of  Charleston, Alderson-Broaddus, and the Charleston Gunners of the CBA.  He was a star athlete in all sports, and has coached on every level-- high school, college, and pro basketball--and won more than 500 games  in his career.   In 2014, I had the privilege of congratulating Tex upon the opening  of the Tex Williams Museum in Artie, WV. There, the Marshall Athletic  Hall of Fame member for both baseball and basketball and acclaimed  coach's legacy is on display, housing 40,000 photos he collected  throughout his long career. Making it even more special, the Tex  Williams Museum is housed in the old post office building his father  helped build and where his mother worked for 43 years.   Tex learned early on that sports can make you into so much more than  a successful athlete if you have the right attitude. There is no  greater achievement than to be in a position to give back to the  community that helped shape who you are, and that is what we are  celebrating today by honoring Tex. He started the Hoops Classic high  school basketball tournament, which is played every year at the  Charleston Civic Center. So many student-athletes have been inspired by  Tex and have gone forward to build successful careers for themselves in  our home State. Tex started the West Virginia Legends Sports Banquet 9  years ago, which reunites former players and coaches who once starred  in West Virginia high school and college athletics. Tex has not only  influenced and inspired student athletes for decades, but he has passed  his knowledge and tradition of coaching excellence to his son, Adam,  who also holds a strong legacy as a player and coach.   Tex is a perfect example of what makes West Virginia so very unique  and special. Our people have this can-do spirit, a neighborly love that  is unrelenting, and we are all grounded by the same core principle: to  help others be the best they can be and to never forget where you came  from. As I always say, if you can count your blessings, you can share  your blessings, and Tex has embodied that sentiment beautifully.   Again, it is an honor to recognize the outstanding achievements of  Tex Williams and all he has done for countless student athletes across  our home State.                            ____________________
