 Mr. Speaker, just because we are doing some  organization and because we are all up against the tyranny of the  clock, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney).                               Rugby World Cup     Mr. Speaker, I am going to try something tonight  because I am very, very concerned this place isn't paying attention to  the numbers and how much trouble I believe we are in. My argument and  my thesis is very simple: If I am wrong, I am wrong; but if I am right  and this place didn't prepare because of the numbers we are seeing,  then we will damage the people, we will damage the economics, we will  damage the country, and we will damage our future. We are not taking it  seriously enough on how the numbers are eroding and how fast--how  fast--the numbers are eroding around us economically.   Now, originally, this was going to be a 1-hour presentation. Now it  looks like I have 22 minutes because of the tyranny of the clock, so I  will try not go too fast, and I promise I will dispose of some of the  boards. As always, wave at me if I start rambling at high rates of  speed.                                time  2140    This is our baseline. The problem is this chart is now a year and a  half old and the numbers are much worse. The reality, 29 years from  now, CBO--this  [[Page H5873]]  isn't some off group; this is our Congressional Budget Office-- functionally says we have $112 trillion. My back of the napkin now says  $120 trillion of publicly borrowed debt in today's dollars, not  inflated dollars.   Functionally, 75 percent of that debt is Medicare. Twenty-five  percent is Social Security. The rest of the budget is in balance.   Well, what happens to Medicare particularly when you start having  inflation like we do?   And I represent a district that has had over 11 percent inflation. I  represent the district with the highest inflation in America.   Let's actually start to walk through what many of the experts are  saying. And remember, I am trying to make a very simple point here. I  am worried about my country. I am worried about our debt and the  ability to pay, and it is skyrocketing; and then the cascade effect of  how many people are getting poorer.   Remember, in the first 15 months of Democrat control here, Americans  are dramatically poorer today than they were a year ago.   So let's actually walk through this. When Larry Summers--when I am  coming to the floor using quotes for Larry Summers--you have got Larry  Summers. In order to do what is necessary to stop inflation, the Fed is  going to raise interest rates enough that the economy will slip into  recession. That is one of the Democrats, at least up until he had  heresy of telling the truth on Democrats' $1.9 trillion spending last  year, and then you put him on the outs. But up till that moment he was  Democrats' favorite economist.   But now he is basically telling us we have structurally built in so  much inflation, we are going to have to have the Federal Reserve force  us into recession.   Do you know what happens to people, what happens to poor people, the  working middle class, the working poor when you are in a recessionary  cycle, and how many years it takes for the public to get their lives  back?   The economy is heading for a hard landing when we are now starting to  see over and over and over the very economists that, a month ago, were  saying we might be able to negotiate a soft landing. Oh, we may just  tip a little bit of growth and unemployment and come back.   And now those same economists, a month later, are saying, no, we are  heading toward a hard landing. We are going into recession.   By the love of the Dear Lord, I hope they are wrong. But if they are  right, have you seen a single thing this body has done to prepare?   The U.S. economy is heading for a hard landing, and this one is  important. We have got to understand. We are starting to see numbers  now that--and we had a Member of the majority here, I think a couple of  days ago, come and somewhere they threw out, oh, but there is all this  excess money in the people's savings accounts. That isn't true anymore.   You do understand, the personal savings rate has plummeted from 26.6  percent a year ago, functionally, a year ago, to 4.4 in April, and it  continues to vault. And understand, that personal savings rate of 4.4  is below where we were before the pandemic.   If we start to hit recession right now, our brothers and sisters out  there don't have that cash reserve in their bank accounts.   Do you understand the concept of fragility?   And now we actually start to see the other thing that really  genuinely terrifies me, and we are going to do a couple of slides on  this. And I know I am going fast but we are up against the clock here.  We have a mandatory shutdown in about 20 minutes.   Treasury yields are really starting to decline. And you have got to  understand, we basically had budget projections, Congressional Budget  Office and others, who had been basically building analysis of what  will the debt look like? And they were using remarkably historically  low interest rates.   A year ago we had expert after expert coming in front of the Ways and  Means Committee and other places, Joint Economic Committee, oh, we are  going to be in historically low interest rates because we are getting  sold as a society. We have all these people saving. We are going to be  more like Japan. Turns out they are wrong.   Remember the previous slide? The savings rate from the largesse of  the giveaways, just structurally we are getting demographically older.  We should be retaining. It is gone. The savings are gone.   And now we are going into an interest rate cycle where they are  having to start to raise interest rates on Treasuries and everything  else to attract capital from around the world. If you have been  watching the U.S. dollar, you understand what is going on with this.   What happens when U.S. sovereign debt--if interest rates are 2 points  historically--so we go a 30-year run, and if we are just 2 percent  higher than what CBO modeled last year, 2 points, in about 25 years, I  believe the math is, every dollar of tax receipts, tax revenues, goes  just to pay interest. There is no more government. We are just covering  our debt.   Do you understand the fragility we have done to ourselves with this  inflationary cycle?   The average interest rate being paid on Federal debt--and this, I  know this board is a little hard to read and hard to see. But  historically, go back to the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, the period that we  have modeled is way down here. This was not normal.   God forbid, if we go back to normality in U.S. sovereign interest  rates, and then we are functionally running $30 trillion of debt, do  you understand how much of--the left wants to spend money on these  things. The right, we want to defend the military. There is no money.   And you saw the first board that basically said the massive, massive  shortfall in Medicare. Remember, Medicare is mostly a general fund  expenditure. It is like only 20 percent of it really is a part A trust  fund, and that is gone in 5 years. And it has begun. It has begun.   And the other thing, it is more than what we borrow today. It is the  amount of U.S. sovereign debt. And I didn't bring that board, and I  probably should have, that has to be refinanced every month. So you may  borrow $1 trillion this year, but you had to refinance 5 or 6 or $7  trillion, and every dime of that now is reset at the new interest  rates.   And the higher interest costs--and I am going to do a couple of  variations of this. But this is functionally, 9 budget years from now.  If it is going where we think it is going, publicly held debt--you are  now in the 126 percent of GDP. And most of this movement here, when you  start to see this movement, it is the financing costs. It is the  financing costs of this government. Because the real explosion of our  demographic spending, you know, the fact that in 7 years, 22 percent of  our country is 65 and older, that explosion of the baby boomers costs-- it really starts--it has already begun, but it really, that curve  really starts to take off at the end of the decade; at the very time we  are already pushing 126 percent of debt to GDP.                                time  2150    Does anyone understand the level of fragility? It is this  inflationary cycle. Democrats did something horrible March last year.  They didn't listen to their own economists because they were so busy  living in this fantasy world of free money. Give it away. People will  love us. Don't require them to participate in the economy. Now we are  paying the price.   If you are trying to save for retirement; if you are a young couple  trying to get ready to buy your first house, there is a technical form  for it in economics. You are screwed. Because every single day that  savings you have is worth less.   If you are a saver, your savings today is functionally about 7  percent less valuable than it was a year ago.   I mean, those of you who intend to retire one day, have you actually  started to think about that the value of the savings you had, if you  put it in safe things like bonds or savings accounts, is substantially  less valuable today. Its purchasing power is less today than it was a  year ago.   If this continues for a couple years, do you understand how many more  years you really need to work? Do you understand how much more savings  you have to have? Do you have an understanding of how much you are  going to have to help your kids buy that first house? This is not a  game.  [[Page H5874]]    Two weeks ago, I came here, and we tried to do some of the math on  the board of how many seniors. If the current inflation cycle lasts for  about 24 months, we basically were trying to do the math of, okay, here  is what happens to seniors' savings. It falls, the value of it. It is  functionally transferred to government.   What happens to the COLA? Well, the COLA and Social Security never  gets close to keeping up to the actual inflation rate because of the  lag problem.   That 20 percent copay you have on your healthcare, and if healthcare  inflation is almost double the CPI rate, and you've got to pay that 20  percent, we were looking at math that said you could potentially double  the number of seniors in poverty in a decade.   Has anyone here actually wanted to dig into that math and start to  understand? This is not a game.   I know there is a desperate attempt by the administration and my  Democrat colleagues, oh, this is inflation because of a war in Ukraine.  This is greedy oil companies.   No, it is not. You believed in modern monetary policy, and it blew  up.   Remember, much of this inflation was structurally built in before the  war in Ukraine. You see it in these sorts of numbers.   By the end of 2021--and remember, that is before Russia's invasion,  right?--credit card debt climbed to $856 billion. It is a 28 percent  annualized increase in the fourth quarter of last year.   It had already begun. People were already borrowing on their credit  cards because prices were going up so fast. So the way they were  supplementing their consumption is they were building up debt.   I have showed you the board before. Savings rates have collapsed. We  are now seeing credit card debt explode. When those hit up the wall-- you see what happened 3 weeks ago--consumer sentiment collapsed.   It is because all of a sudden I can't keep financing my lifestyle by  using up my savings and chewing up credit card debt.   This is going on right now. Where is the concern? Does anyone here  care about people and what is going on to them economically out there,  outside the walls of this building?   The U.S. economy is heading for a hard landing, and this is just  functionally that same thing, once again, by other sources talking  about the growth of credit card debt--or, excuse me, the collapse of  savings rates.   Credit card balances, once again, really, really--from other sources,  saying the growth. This is a real problem.   If we were in a time of prosperity--a couple minutes ago, I was in  the back room. I saw the spokesperson for the White House. These are  fine economic times. Have they lost their minds? Do they own, like, a  subscription to any economic journal?   To say things are fine at the same time you can see the aggregated  data of savings collapsing, credit card debt exploding, interest rates  going up, interest rates and sovereign debt, and now start to  understand what that is going to mean in the financing of this  government.   Now you have got to deal with the Democrats' policy set. The fact of  the matter is, thank God, the Senate has a couple Democrats that  actually may have saved the country--it is hard to say that--by  stopping the Build Back Better and the just stunning amount of debt the  left wanted to build on.   When you start seeing numbers saying that if the Democrats' package  had passed, we functionally would have gone from about $17 trillion of  publicly-held borrowing before the pandemic to $44 trillion by the end  of the decade. This is if the Democrats' spending plans and borrowing  plans had passed.   An absolute, absolute lie, and we have shown it over and over, oh, it  is all paid for; except it wasn't. It wasn't even close.   I think in the Build Back Better, the best estimate we were able to  come--and we used their math--was they were covering about 30 percent  of the expenditures, and they were covering it in a way where they were  going to raise certain taxes that would have actually slowed down the  economic growth that we are desperate for.   Now you start to see my fear for the country. When we start to model  what happens to the projected Federal debt under various interest rate  scenarios--and I know I am sounding like a highly caffeinated  accountant on steroids, but this is the stuff we are paid to read and  understand.   We are not paid to stand behind these microphones and virtue signal.  But, God, that seems to be what we do here. We do policy by virtue  signaling.   Let's come here for just one moment. Here is functionally where we  are at. If you start to say, okay, the mean of U.S. sovereign debt, the  30 years, the 10 years, the 20s, you know, up and down, CBO's baseline  basically says we are at 202 percent of debt to GDP.    With a small increase going back to almost normality, with the  historic average over the last 30 years, we are starting to hit numbers  close to 300.   If we actually were slightly above historic normal, you are at 357  percent of debt to GDP. Does anyone believe this economy doesn't  collapse long before that?   People run from the U.S. dollar. They dispose of U.S. debt. Can you  imagine what the chaos, what the misery, what the dystopian nature of  economics would be in this country if you start to run up these levels  of debt.   You already saw in a previous chart we are heading toward 126 percent  of debt functionally at the end of the decade. Debt to GDP. That is  publicly held borrowed money.   At the same time, you are going to be up against the Social Security  trust fund running out of money. Social Security recipients are heading  toward a 25 to 27 percent cut. The Medicare trust fund will have  already been gone for 5 years, so we still haven't figured out what is  going to happen to the payments to doctors and hospitals within that.   This is not a game, and it is in front of us. If we get here a couple  years from now, and all this is blowing up on us, and this place  pretends they didn't know, maybe I could sit them in front of the hours  I have spent behind this microphone going over the math. The math is in  those binders that are sent to us two times a year.   Here is one of the things that truly terrifies me, as you start to  get into the new interest rate scenarios. This isn't long term. This is  basically, yeah, we start to think of what mean rates mean, and you  start to add in just a 2 percent change.   That 2 percent--and this is within the current 10-year window--you  start to basically add $13.4 trillion additional--well, debt, and this  marginal here is just the marginal increase because you start to chase  your tail.   I have a chart, and I need to actually have it graphically made so it  is easier to see. We will be financing the debt that we are financing.  We will be chasing our tail, and that is where we are heading.   Now the cruelty.   Mr. Speaker pro tem, may I ask, because I am looking at the clock  above. Can you tell me how many minutes I have?    I promise you, I am going to use all 5 minutes.   This is the cruelty now to poor people, to the working poor, to that  hardworking middle class, to those retirees. When you come to them and  say, all right, let's take a look here.   Forgive the colors, but the green would have been if we had hit the 2  percent sort of Federal Reserve benchmark inflation goal. This here is  where we seem to be annualizing right now, and this is some of the  newest projection for the next couple years. It is about 7.4.   But when you see this bar come down, it basically means the $100 you  had in 2022, if you get to 2032, so a decade, that $100 you have, if we  stay at this sort of inflation rate, functionally, you have lost half  of its purchasing value.   So you have saved and saved and saved and saved and saved, and if you  start running--if the current interest or current inflation environment  were to hang around for a decade, at the end of that decade, half the  value is gone. You have lost half of your savings.   This is what is going on. What if it is just for 2 years? You start  just doing it for 2 years, and you start to realize you have lost  almost a quarter. Then you compound that out to you want to retire one  day. You want to finance your kids' school. You want to do these  things.  [[Page H5875]]    Do you understand how the difference of your earning power has to  change just to make up for the loss of the value? I represent a  community that is going through 11 percent inflation rates.   Then the last one in the last how many seconds I have. Please.  Please. Someone hire an economist to talk to the White House. A gas tax  holiday? I mean, you can hear the economists rolling on their backs  laughing right now.   Mr. Speaker pro tem, thank you for your tolerance tonight. I yield  back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
