 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute  to the contributions of Pam Howell-Beach to the greater Toledo  community.   During her tenure with the Toledo Community Foundation, Pam guided  the organization to a strong financial future, increasing its assets by  over $80 million.   Later, as executive director of the Stranahan Foundation, Pam oversaw  grant distributions of more than $71 million to organizations working  in education, health, and the arts.   Pam's leadership in the nonprofit world was as wide as it was  appreciated and as big as her heart. From working with the Zonta Club  of Toledo, Philanthropy Ohio, Ability Center of Greater Toledo, and  Mercy Health Partners, to the Early Childhood Funders Collaborative,  and Susan G. Komen Foundation, her impassioned service touched the  lives of thousands upon thousands of Toledoans.   As Pam confronts a challenging health situation, I want to convey, on  behalf of all Toledoans, how grateful we are for her work, her life,  her dedication and her love for community. We are all the better as a  result of her lifelong commitment to others.   Madam Speaker, I thank Pam, and may God bless her today and always.                            ____________________
