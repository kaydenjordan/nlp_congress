 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and  service of Sedgwick County Sheriff's Deputy Robert Kunze III.  [[Page H8881]]    On September 16, Deputy Kunze responded to a suspicious character  call in a rural area of Sedgwick County. When he arrived, the suspect  opened fire, and Deputy Kunze was shot in the neck.   The suspect could have fled or killed two witnesses standing close  by. But in one final heroic act, before collapsing, Deputy Kunze  returned fire, killing the suspect on the spot. The suspect was a  convicted felon who had stolen two vehicles and the weapon he was  carrying. By killing the suspect, Deputy Kunze ended a violent crime  spree and gave up his life to save others.   Described as a jokester with a contagious laugh, Deputy Kunze leaves  behind his wife, Kathleen, and their young daughter, Alyssa. At his  funeral on Friday, Alyssa addressed the crowd with the words that rang  across Kansas, saying: ``My dad was a hero. . . . He protected  everyone.''   Today, we continue to pray for Deputy Kunze's family, as well as  Sheriff Jeff Easter and the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office.   At this time, I ask our colleagues to join in a moment of silence to  honor Deputy Robert Kunze.                            ____________________
