 Mr. Speaker, insanity is doing the same thing  repeatedly and expecting a different result. That makes the supporters  of this legislation, by definition, insane.   Reckless spending in this town is what causes inflation. We cannot  continue to increase taxes on the American people and put a target on  American energy production while spending a historic $370 billion on  Green New Deal initiatives and expect to lower inflation and improve  our economy.   Remember that so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill? We spent $200  billion on Green New Deal initiatives. I guess that was just a  downpayment on this never-ending theft of American tax dollars. You are  sacrificing American families at the altar of climate change.   Mr. Speaker, isn't it so? Joe Biden himself said the inflation rate  is at zero percent. What the heck are we doing here? Why are we passing  this so-called Inflation Reduction Act if it is at zero percent?   In fact, it is the inflation enhancement act, and it does the exact  opposite of what Americans need right now. This is just another con  game by the Democrats calling something one thing and saying another.    Mr. Speaker, this bill hires 87,000 new IRS agents, and  they are armed. The job description tells them that they need to be  required to carry a firearm and expect to use deadly force if  necessary.   Excessive taxation is theft. The chairman said that we are using the  power of the Federal Government in this bill. You are darn right you  are. You are using the power of the Federal Government for armed  robbery on the taxpayers. I can see why this was rushed through  committee and put on the floor.
