 Mr. Speaker, I rise to repeal the disaster that is  ObamaCare. ObamaCare functions as a wet blanket over the American  economy, stopping businesses from growing, and impairing the rights of  individuals to make their own decisions about health care.   Mr. Speaker, I specifically implore my conservative colleagues to  vote for this bill and give us a chance to get out from under this  disastrous law. This legislation represents $1 trillion in tax cuts,  $1.15 trillion in spending cuts, $150 billion in deficit reduction;  defunding Planned Parenthood.   How long have we been fighting to defund Planned Parenthood?   Close the illegal alien loophole that allows people to enroll in  ObamaCare, only to check their status in this country subsequently.   We install work requirements. I don't think people that are able to  work but choose not to should expect us to go borrow money from China  to pay for their health care. Installing those work requirements is  fundamental to bold conservative reform.   Block grants for States so that finally they can be liberated from  the oppressive hand of the Federal Government, and also blocking States  from additional Medicaid expansion.   We have been engaging in these conservative fights for years, and  finally, today, we have got the chance to put a win on the board; and  so I am joining our President, our Speaker, and many conservatives in  this Congress in voting for the American Health Care Act.   When we win, when we do this, not only do we enhance our economy, not  only do we free up opportunities for broader prosperity in America, but  we allow people to be in charge of health care, and we move from a  government-centered system to a patient-centered system. That was the  promise we made in the elections, and that is the promise I intend to  keep by voting for this bill.
