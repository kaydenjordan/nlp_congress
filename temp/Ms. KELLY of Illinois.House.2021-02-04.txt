 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 72,  to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee post.   Congresswoman Greene is part of the cult conspiracy mindset that has  infected segments of our American society and is ripping our Nation  apart.   The wild conspiracy theories that QAnoners invent are, in essence,  outrageous lies. Even more alarming, they are lies backed by the threat  of violence.   Yes, Representative Greene and her QAnon adherents are ready to  defend their deranged lies with violence. They have expressed a desire  to assassinate Speaker Pelosi and to publicly execute those who  disagree with their malignant lies. They have even expressed a  passionate desire to overthrow our constitutional democracy.   Congresswoman Greene indicated before last year's election that, if  Donald Trump lost, Americans may need to reclaim freedom with the price  of blood.   Marjorie Greene has harassed a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman  Douglas High School shooting, calling him a coward and proclaiming the  massacre was staged as a plot to pass more gun laws.   Yet her Republican colleagues believe she has the proper credentials  and principles to serve on the Education and Labor Committee. Some will  play both sides, but that is a false equivalence.   I think it is clear that we need to draw the line at Jewish space  lasers and calling for political assassinations, not policy  differences. At least with one xenophobic racist, both sides were able  to put country over party. The party of Honest Abe can no longer be  honest with itself.   Marjorie Greene and her fellow conspiracy theorists have saturated  our Nation with lies. It is time to turn the tables and start talking  about truth for a change.   Gandhi liked to say: ``Even if you are a minority of one, the truth  is the truth.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to join in defending truth. Stand up for  truth even if you are alone.
