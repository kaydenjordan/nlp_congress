 Mr. Chairman, I hear from my constituents in southern  Illinois that rural America is hurting. That is why we need the farm  bill, to address the concerns facing agriculture all over rural  America.   The farm bill does just that. The farm bill protects the farm safety  net, including commodity programs and crop insurance, invests in rural  broadband, modernizes FSA loan programs for new and beginning farmers  and ranchers, and invests in conservation.   President Eisenhower once said: ``Farming looks mighty easy when your  plow is a pencil and you're 1,000 miles from a corn field.'' Those  words hold true today, and that is why this bill was crafted with those  farmers in mind, because farmers are everyone's bread and butter.  [[Page H4050]]
