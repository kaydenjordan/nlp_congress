 Madam Speaker, reserving the right to object, my friend  on the Rules Committee has made a commitment this year, which he has  been following through on, to try to bring order to an otherwise fairly  chaotic process up there.   This is clearly just a clerical error, and it is one that we all  worked through together last night, so I have no objection to the  gentleman's amendment request.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding me  the customary 30 minutes. We just came out of a long night in the Rules  Committee. I say ``we'' from the Member side. We were out of there by  midnight. I have not yet asked the Rules Committee staff when they got  out of there last night because I really didn't want to know the answer  to that.   When we meet in the Rules Committee on appropriations bills, we are  in for long nights. My first year in Congress, Madam Speaker--the  gentlewoman may have been following it at the time--it was when the big  Republican majority came in as the new Democratic majority has come in  now. The appropriations season hadn't been finished, so the first order  of business when we came in as a new majority was to take on the  appropriations challenge.   It seemed crazy at the time--this is a minibus, a group of four bills  together--what we decided to do was to take the entire discretionary  account of the entire United States of America, bring it down here to  the House floor, and consider it under an open rule.   I brought a copy of that rule down with me, Madam Speaker. It was  House Resolution 92. We heard the Reading Clerk read this morning. It  took Joseph a while to get through that.   We are only considering a small fraction of the budget today. Back  then, we were considering the entire Federal budget, and it was right  here in three pages. The truth is, the part that dealt with the  appropriations bill is only one of these sections. The other two were  housekeeping business.   We allowed the entire body to bring their ideas to the table to see  what might stick. I say it was a radical idea because I had just gotten  to Congress. I went back and looked at the numbers, historically. It  turned out, it didn't use to be a radical idea. We have made it a  radical idea to let all the amendments come to the floor.   Again, my friend from Massachusetts has a very hard job as chairman  of the Rules Committee. I introduced an amendment last night, Madam  Speaker, barely before the committee ended, after I had had a chance to  question the cardinals who were responsible for that language, and my  friend from Massachusetts made it in order. He is doing everything he  can to try to make the process more open than it has been in the most  recent past.                                time  1230    But if we go back a little bit further, if we think about how to  change the culture in this institution, it hasn't always been this  divided.   Do you remember the first year that Speaker Pelosi sat in the chair  that you are sitting in right now, Madam Speaker? She was the first, as  you recall, Democratic Speaker since 1994 and the first woman to ever  lead this institution. When she sat in that chair for the very first  time, we had an open appropriations process. There were about 110  Democratic amendments that were offered and about 300 Republican  amendments because, when you are in the minority, it is harder to get  your agenda in the underlying bill.   When you run the show, as Mr. McGovern does, you are able to get all  your good ideas in the bill. I have no doubt that every one of Mr.  McGovern's good ideas is contained in the underlying bill. That is the  privilege of leadership. When you sit on the outside, as I do and as  Mr. Stauber does, it is harder to get your ideas in.   So, historically, as Speaker Pelosi did in 2007, more amendments are  made in order for the minority party than are made in order for the  majority party because the minority party hasn't gotten a chance to  influence the process.   I am proud, over the 8 years that I was a part of the majority party  here and had the privilege of sitting on the Rules Committee, more than  half of the amendments, on average, across all the bills, were given to  the minority party. But in this bill, Madam Speaker, again, despite the  chairman's best efforts, the minority party received less than one- quarter of the amendments that are available.   What I am saying is, when Republicans were doing this from their  leadership spot and we were giving more amendments to the other side,  now the majority party is giving not 100 percent more amendments to  their side, not 200 percent more but, more than 200 percent more.   By my statistics, since last time around, we have moved in the right  direction. It used to be 300 percent more amendments given to the  majority party.   Madam Speaker, I don't say that to grouse about sour grapes. Again, I  say it with sincerity when I tell you that what Chairman McGovern is  doing on the Rules Committee he is doing out of a real love of this  institution, trying to reopen the process, but we have got to find a  way to trust ourselves.   Most of what you heard the Reading Clerk read had nothing to do with  the amendments of the bill we are talking about. It had to do with  closing down the process, in many ways for the very first time in my  congressional career, because the minority party, Republicans, are  frustrated that we haven't been able to fund humanitarian needs on the  border.   Now, I know talking about the border is a dog whistle to many folks  in this institution. They think, as you heard the gentleman from  Massachusetts mention, that it is about the wall and it is about  immigration and it is about all sorts of things that it is not.   What we are talking about are children who are in the custody of the  United States of America. Rightly or wrongly, like it or not, that is  where we are today. And we can either fund the needs of those children,  we can either fund the healthcare of those children, we can either fund  the education of those children, or we cannot.   What we have heard from this administration is the same thing we have  heard from the Obama administration when we had this very same crisis  in 2014, and that is that we don't have enough resources to provide for  the flood of folks who have been taken into U.S. custody.   The White House made this request 6 weeks ago, knowing that we were  going to run out of money this month, and the House has taken no action  on that request.   When we had the very same Rules Committee hearing last week, Madam  Speaker, that we had this week, my friend, the chairman, talked about  his sincere desire to move this kind of legislation, but it hasn't  moved.   My friend from California who sits on the majority side of the Rules  Committee and serves on the Appropriations Committee talked about the  meeting they had in the Appropriations Committee that day to move this  in an expedited way, and yet it has not yet moved.  [[Page H4782]]    The reason the rule considers these measures to close down the  parliamentary process here is because folks are rightfully frustrated  with the flow of the floor. We have serious work that we need to do,  and when you are in procedural nonsense, you don't get any of that work  done. But that procedural nonsense comes from a very sincere  frustration that we have very real needs that are shared needs, very  real passions that are shared passions, and that the consequences of  failure affect us all. It affects who we are in our individual  districts; it affects who we are as a nation; and for the life of me, I  cannot understand why it is that this issue is receiving the neglect  that it is from the leadership party.   We are going to talk about that in our previous question amendment.  If we defeat the previous question, we will bring up an amendment to  add to the rule language that will allow us to have this important  debate and provide these important funds. I will reserve the time to  talk about that, Madam Speaker.   But I do want to say we had ample opportunity in the Rules Committee  to make the process wide open, and that decision, candidly, is above  the chairman's pay grade, and the process was not allowed to be an open  process.   So then we also had ample opportunity to close the process down  completely. That is completely within the chairman's pay grade. He  rejected that idea and made the effort to take some very important  steps forward to returning us to regular order, and for that I am  grateful.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), who is one of our young leaders.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   I find my friend from Virginia is almost always right about  everything, so the fact that he is so wrong on this makes it worthy of  commenting.   We are not here night after night voting because the Rules Committee  opened up the process. We are here night after night voting because  what we would ordinarily have done by voice vote, through the comity  that this institution, sadly, is losing some of every day, we are  demanding recorded votes, because we can't get a vote on funding the  humanitarian crisis that is at the  [[Page H4784]]  border, a crisis that my friend from Virginia cares about, my friend  from Massachusetts cares about, my friends from Tennessee and Iowa care  about. You go right across this institution. It does not matter your  ideological position; you care about this issue.    We are voting night after night to draw attention to the fact that we  cannot get our voices heard, not because our voices are heard in  volumes never before seen.   In fact, an interesting sidebar, Madam Speaker: If you go back to the  days of open rules, you will actually find the committee made more  amendments in order on almost every division than we would have  ordinarily had if we just had an open rule. When we clamp down on the  process, that steam drives the amendments up. These conversations  should be had in committee, not on the floor of the House.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Kustoff), my neighbor to the north, a leader on these issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to say to my  friend from New York that he is one of the bright spots on the Rules  Committee. We are doing a lot of things differently this cycle than we  have done them in years past, and he has been a real partner and a  leader on that, Madam Speaker.   If you ever think that it is nothing but partisan nonsense--which you  could imagine in a 9-to-4 committee, that that kind of thing could  break out--I encourage you to come see Mr. McGovern and Mr. Morelle in  action. You might be surprised with what you find.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  King), a good friend and a leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Stivers), a classmate of mine and a perennial leader in this  institution.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to remind folks  that we can defeat the previous question today and get on with the  business of providing for the families and children along the border.   This is something that everyone in this institution cares about. For  whatever reason, we can't move legislation forward. Everybody is  talking about it. Nobody is doing anything about it.   There is no Member of this institution who is more frustrated with  that than the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy). If we defeat the previous  question, we will bring up H.R. 3056, the bill to fund that crisis  management at the border.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy) to discuss that underlying bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to begin where my friend from Massachusetts left off. I have  not enjoyed coming down to vote on things we could have voice-voted  either. I have not enjoyed being here until midnight on votes when I  knew how they were going to come out, when we could have been working  together on issues where I didn't know how they were going to come out  and where we were trying to be agents of change.   But when we are in the minority, it is the only tool that we have to  draw attention. The reason we have been here night after night is not  because Mr. Roy is trying to inconvenience anyone. It is because he  went to the Rules Committee and offered an amendment to do something  that everybody in this Chamber knows ought to be done, and he didn't  even get a vote. Folks wouldn't even let him bring his idea. Here we  are, in the people's House, on an issue that is a bipartisan issue, and  he did not even get a vote.   He is not here to say it is his way or the highway. He is here to say  that he thought this was a place where ideas were debated and agreed to  or defeated. On that, I think he is absolutely right. He is absolutely  right.   My friend from Massachusetts is right, Madam Speaker, when he says  that he has opened up this process more than it was the last cycle  under Republicans. It is true.   But we have heard Member after Member who said: ``I have a good  bipartisan idea. I have a good bipartisan idea, but the Rules Committee  didn't allow it to be heard.''   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 92 from 2011, conveniently offered by  Mr. Woodall, me, that was the festival of democracy in February to  March 2011, where we didn't just have an open rule on one  appropriations bill, or two, three, or four. We opened up the entire  Federal budget and allowed every Member's voice to be heard. From the  most liberal Republican to the most conservative, from the most  conservative Democrat to the most liberal, everybody had a say.    Madam Speaker, the problem we are having, I tell the gentleman from  Massachusetts, is not that we are opening up the process and so that is  why we are having all of these delays. The problem is that the process  is still too closed. That is why we are having delays.   I can understand it if you beat me when I am trying to represent the  views of my constituents. But when you shut me down, I think it offends  each and every one of us.   Appropriations bills have been that loan vestige of openness in this  institution. Democrats shut them down before I got here. Republicans  didn't improve much on that model, save this resolution from 2011.  There is still much room for improvement on both sides.   Madam Speaker, let's start that improvement, start that improvement  by defeating the previous question.   Let's go back to where this whole disagreement started. Let's give  the gentleman from Texas an opportunity to be heard on the bill from  the gentleman from Alabama. Let's fund this crisis that we all agree  needs to be funded.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my amendment  be inserted in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the previous  question.    Madam Speaker, I will close with the words from the  chairman of the Rules Committee last week:         I take a back seat to no one on this issue. We will deal       with this issue. We will come up with something quick, and I       look forward to working with you. We need to move this bill       expeditiously.    I believe every word that he said. But it has been 7 days and the  sole result of those meaningful words is nothing. We might have the  luxury of another day. We might have the luxury of another 2. But that  luxury is fast eroding, Madam Speaker.   My friend from Massachusetts does take a back seat to no one when it  comes to caring for children, which is why we are all counting on his  leadership to move this issue forward with the seriousness that every  Member of this institution believes it deserves.   Madam Speaker, I urge my friends: Defeat the previous question. Let's  have this conversation today, not tomorrow, not the next day. Let's fix  today what we can fix today.   Madam Speaker, success has an amazing way of making people feel  better about themselves. Doing things that matter has an amazing way of  making people feel better. It turns out, in this institution, Madam  Speaker, success is incremental.                                time  1315    We do something well together today, we do something even bigger  together tomorrow.   Defeat this previous question. Take up this issue of families and  their care, and then we will move on with the rest of the  appropriations business exactly, flawed or not, as my friend from  Massachusetts has crafted.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
