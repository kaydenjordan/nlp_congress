 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 3279 would correct a problem in our Federal oil and gas leasing  laws that makes it more difficult for companies to commercially produce  helium from Federal lands. Helium is a critical element for high-tech  research and modern medicine, and because of its unique properties,  there are simply no substitutes.   On the Natural Resources Committee, we have spent many years  overseeing the Federal Helium Program, culminating in the bipartisan  Helium Stewardship Act signed into law 4 years ago.   While the Helium Stewardship Act improved the management and sale of  Federal helium, it didn't do much to promote the development of new  sources of helium, which are in high demand. By allowing companies to  hold onto Federal oil and gas leases if they are producing commercial  quantities of helium and only helium, then the problem that kept  potentially valuable helium resources under lock and key is resolved.  This is only one small step, but it is a very useful one.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this legislation for introducing  it.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3279, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   There are laws on the books that stand in the way of true tribal  self-determination and self-governance. One of those laws is Public Law  80-846, known commonly as the 1948 Act. The 1948 Act targeted only one  tribe, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa, also known as  the Meskwaki Nation, and gave the State of Iowa criminal jurisdiction  over their tribal lands.   In 1948, the Nation did not have a formal mechanism for law  enforcement and was not in a financial position to create one. This was  used as the rationale for the stripping of these jurisdictional rights.  But this has not been the case for many years. The Tribe has a full- time police department as well as a fully functioning court system.   The continued existence of the 1948 Act has resulted in an unfair  system of crimes committed on Meskwaki land, whereby a Native-American  defendant must face the possibility of two prosecutions, State and  Tribal, but a non-Native defendant faces only State prosecution.   That is why I join my colleagues in supporting H.R. 1074. By passing  this bill and repealing the 1948 Act, we will remove the inequity it  has created, and bring the Meskwaki Nation in line with how criminal  jurisdiction issues are addressed on other Native lands.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of H.R.  1074, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 2600 authorizes the conveyance to the State of Iowa the  reversionary interest on the Western Historic Trails Center in Council  Bluffs, Iowa.   In 1989, Congress authorized the Department of the Interior to  partner with the State of Iowa to create a trails interpretative center  to support three National Historic Trails that cross through the  region.   In 1988, the Secretary of the Interior transferred approximately 400  acres to the State of Iowa for use as a visitor center. Ownership was  then transferred to the State with a reversionary clause that limits  the use of the property to a visitor center.   The National Park Service does not operate or maintain the current  visitor center. However, under current law, if the State stops using  the site for its intended purpose, ownership will revert back to the  Federal Government.   Since its establishment, the trails interpretative center has not  lived up to its expectations. Visitation is low and the facility is in  need of significant maintenance.   The National Park Service and the State of Iowa have determined that  termination of the reversionary interest makes both fiscal and  operational sense. This will allow the State to sell the property to  the city of Council Bluffs, allowing the city to maintain the facility.   As long as the State continues to provide National Historic Trail  interpretive services following the terms of the original agreement,  Congress should be allowed to release the reversionary interest to this  particular property.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 1488, the Indiana Dunes  National Park Act. This act seeks to rename the Indiana Dunes National  Lakeshore to the Indiana Dunes National Park, one of the over 400 units  of the National Park System.   Upon successful redesignation, the Indiana Dunes National Park would  become the 60th national park, areas which are known for their variety  of resources, for encompassing large land and water areas, and for  providing protection of resources within their boundaries.   Designated in 1966, Indiana Dunes protects over 15,000 acres, 50  miles of trails, and provides both summer and winter recreational  activities for over 2 million visitors who trek to the lakeshore each  year.   When the lakeshore was admitted into the National Park System in  1966, it was through the hard work of President Kennedy in 1963-64 to  create a compromise for the national lakeshore and a port to promote  the industrial needs of the area.   Sponsors of this bill, including our esteemed colleague  Representative Visclosky, believe that renaming the lakeshore as the  Indiana Dunes National Park will capture the spirit and intent of the  first National Park Service Director Stephen Mather.   Director Mather visited the area in 1916 and recommended the area be  included as a national park within the newly designated National Park  System. Sadly, the United States' entry into World War I precluded that  addition. Now, 101 years later, this bill seeks to redesignate 15,000  acres of the Indiana Dunes National Park.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
