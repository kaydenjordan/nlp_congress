 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I come to the floor on the verge of  what could be a government shutdown.   I have listened to my colleagues throughout the day suggest-- particularly on the other side of the aisle--that this is only about  Dreamers. Dreamers should be able to realize their dream. I have been  as passionate as anyone about believing that these young people, who  only know one flag, the flag of the United States, its stars and  stripes; who only sing one national anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner;  and who only know one country, the United States of America, have, and  should have, the opportunity to ultimately realize their dream. They  responded to the Federal Government's requests that they come forward,  register themselves, give us all types of information, trust us, and  they did. Now the government must respond to them, but what is going on  here is beyond Dreamers.   This is the Federal Government hurtling from short-term funding  resolution to short-term funding resolution instead of having the  appropriate appropriations pass when they were due last October--last  October--instead of working to pass the necessary appropriations to  keep the government not just operating but to do it efficiently, on an  annual basis, so our institutions can appropriately plan and so we can  save money instead of spending more money because of what it costs for  short-term preparations.   Our Republican colleagues were busy, yes, but they were busy in  October and November and December not preparing for the government's  needs but to have a drive in ecstasy toward tax cuts for the wealthiest  people in the country and large corporations on the backs of middle  class and working families. That is what they spent their time on. Then  they come and say: Oh, but it is urgent that we do this now. You had  months in which you did nothing--nothing.   Now, I must say to my friends--and I have heard many of them who are  budget hawks and deficits hawks--this is no way to run a government,  much less the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Who wants to  dictate to countries about being responsible, when we want to give them  assistance or we are trying to get them to do trade things, and this is  the image we send to the world?   Now, only in Washington--I have been here a while. Only in Washington  could Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, the U.S.  Senate, and the President of the United States at the White House, try  to blame a Democratic minority for their failure to govern. Let's be  clear why we are here today. Instead of providing our military, our  first responders, our healthcare centers, and all of our Federal  agencies with the long-term funding they need to efficiently and  effectively serve the American people, Senate Republicans want to pass  yet another--another--another stop-gap, woefully insufficient, short- term continuing resolution.   In fairness, I tried to give my Republican colleagues the benefit of  the doubt. I voted for the first continuing resolution. I voted for the  second continuing resolution, but enough is enough.   I got my start in local government. I was a member of a school board,  and I was a mayor, and then I served in the State legislature. Let me  just say, there is no place from my past experience that you could do  what we do  [[Page S344]]  here. You needed to have a budget done on time. Maybe you might lapse a  day--what would have been for us last October--but you couldn't get  beyond that. You couldn't do that in the State legislature for the  State budget, couldn't do it on the city council, couldn't do it on the  school board. Families can't do it in their own lives. We shouldn't do  it on behalf of the 320-some-odd million people who call America home.   Now, the CR--this continuing resolution to keep the government open  one more time, for the fourth time; not the first time, not the second  time, not the third time but the fourth time because we are all  basically about tax cuts for the wealthy but not taking care of  everybody in terms of government funding--kicks the can down the road  again without making the necessary investments into our communities. It  continues the chaos and the dysfunction that has defined the last year  of Republican control. It doesn't fund community health centers,  something I am so proud of in my home State of New Jersey--federally  qualified health centers. They take everybody who comes through the  door--all taken. You have insurance? Great. You don't have insurance?  We will take care of you. You have Medicaid or Medicare? Fine. Bottom  line, a system that delivers quality healthcare. This doesn't do it. It  leaves them in the lurch out there.   The CR doesn't set budget numbers to fund national security or  domestic investment priorities. We talk about our national defense-- and, yes, I am one of those who is willing to plus-up national  defense--but guess what, the nondefense side of the budget is about  homeland security, the FBI, the Secret Service, the Treasury  Department, the National Institutes of Health that protects us in terms  of illnesses, the CDC--all of these elements are in the domestic  discretionary side of the budget so they are important, too, but we  don't fund budget numbers that allow the national security or domestic  investment priorities to take place.   I heard Leader McConnell say last night that the CR is about helping  all Americans. Well, I will tell you, it doesn't do squat for the 3.5  million Americans who call Puerto Rico their home and who are suffering  in an appalling human catastrophe in the wake of devastating storms. It  doesn't adequately assist communities in Texas and Florida and Western  States that are ravaged by fires that are still waiting for Congress to  act on disaster relief. Even the Secretary of Defense's spokesperson  said we have been working under a continuing resolution for 3 years  now. Our current CR expires tomorrow. This is wasteful. This is the  Secretary of Defense's spokesperson: This is wasteful and destructive.  We need a fully funded fiscal year 2018 budget or face ramifications  for our military.   I would add that these young people--many of them who wear the  uniform of the United States and are willing to risk their lives and  die for the country that seems to want to reject them--they deserve an  opportunity to have a resolution at last.   Let me just say, I know the President has said that maybe the country  needs--would benefit from a good shutdown. I don't ever think there is  a good shutdown. I know, in the past, when President Obama was in the  White House, then Mr. Trump said: Oh, it is the President who is the  leader. It is the President who has to bring everybody into the room.  It is the President who has to get people to come to a conclusion.   Well, you showed up late in the game--very late in the game--the  final hours.   Finally, I think all of us who have been around either this  institution or the Congress know that you need 60 votes in the U.S.  Senate. I have compromised many times on foreign policy. I compromised  with my colleagues to try to achieve a solution for the DACA  legislation. There were hard choices to be made and things I don't  like, but I compromised. Let me tell you something. Sixty votes, you  don't even have your 60 votes. Two of our Republican colleagues have  said--I understand why because they don't want to keep kicking the can  down the road: No, we are not going to vote for this. One of our  colleagues is infirm, not here. So they are not anywhere even near  their numbers.   So that means, when you need 60 and you are far from it, that you  have to engage in a negotiation and a compromise. It is not just stick  it and accept it because when that happens, then we are on the  dangerous path that when this short-term resolution doesn't solve  itself--if we agree to a month--then ultimately we will have another  CR, and maybe we will like even less what is in that CR. Maybe there  will be language that we will find particularly problematic. Maybe  there will even be numbers we don't care for.   The point is, if you know you need 60, you don't wait until the final  hours to try to come to a negotiation.   I would rather live a day on my feet than a life on my knees, in  defense of the 9 million people who call New Jersey home, to make sure  they get what they need, not what I am shafted to try to have to  accept.   So I personally am for a very short-term resolution that makes  leadership and the White House and all of us, as far as I am concerned,  stay here working to achieve what the American people deserve, which is  a full funding of their government--no more short-term lurching from  crisis to crisis. This is an opportunity to take care of those  Americans who have been hurt in hurricanes and storms and fires and the  people of Puerto Rico; an opportunity to give Dreamers their dream; an  opportunity to fund our public health centers; an opportunity to fund  the Children's Health Insurance Program not for 6 years but for a  decade. We have seen study after study that says we could save millions  if we funded it over a decade. Why should we not save millions?   This is an opportunity to deal with the pensions that people who  worked a lifetime and, through no fault of their own, now find  themselves possibly shortchanged. Let's help them retire with the  dignity they deserve.   This is an opportunity to make sure the National Institutes of  Health--which is doing ground-breaking research on the Alzheimer's that  took my mother's life, on the Parkinson's that affects our neighbors,  on the diseases that affect our people, but you can't do long-term  trials if you don't know what your funding is going to be. The list  goes on and on.   The people of America deserve far better than what they are getting,  and I reject the proposition that you can just stick it to us and  suggest that we have to accept it. You create the crisis and then you  want us to accept it.   Well, it is time to get the job done on behalf of the American  people. That is why some of us will not support a longer term funding  resolution, because all it will do is get us right back to where we are  today. The American people deserve much more than that.   They deserve that, and there is no reason we can't deliver that.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.   (Mr. TILLIS assumed the Chair.)   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________
