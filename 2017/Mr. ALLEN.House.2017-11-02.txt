 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support  the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act.   How many of you know what the Independent Payment Advisory Board is-- also known as the IPAB?   How many of you know who serves on the board?   I would venture to say that not many people know the 15 unelected,  unaccountable bureaucrats who have unilateral authority to cut Medicare  spending.   When the Democrats passed ObamaCare, they created the Independent  Payment Advisory Board, providing them with unprecedented power to  alter Medicare policy, ultimately, having the chance to reduce seniors'  access to healthcare and put the government at the center of our  healthcare system with zero accountability or transparency.                                time  1615    My constituents deserve better and Americans across this Nation  deserve better.   A vote for this legislation is a vote to give seniors more control  over their healthcare decisions. I urge my colleagues to support Dr.  Roe's bill.
