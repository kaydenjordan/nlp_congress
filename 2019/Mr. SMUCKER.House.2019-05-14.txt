 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor those brave men and  women who selflessly serve our communities as sworn officers in our  local police departments.   This week is National Police Week.   To say that police officers are heroes would simply be an  understatement. Their work at times puts them in extremely dangerous  circumstances where they are faced with life-or-death decisions. They,  of course, know this and go back to work keeping us safe every day.   That was true late last year for three Lancaster City Police  Officers--Andrew Williams, Matthew Caple, and Todd Dickinson--when a  man visiting Lancaster fell short of breath and began leaning against a  building. The officers performed CPR and used a defibrillator to  stabilize him and save his life.   It is people like Detective Chris Jones of East Lampeter Township  Police Department, who is working to end human trafficking, and Lower  Windsor Township Patrolman Mark Jackson, working diligently to stop  aggressive drivers.   One of the Lancaster City police officers who saved that man last  year said: ``We did what we had to do.''   But we know they do not have to. They could choose any other  profession. They choose to keep us safe, and for that, we are grateful.                            ____________________
