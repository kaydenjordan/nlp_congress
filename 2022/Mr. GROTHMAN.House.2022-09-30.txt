 Mr. Speaker, from time to time we talk about the crisis  at the border, but we still don't talk about it enough. A lot of times  I get people saying, well, maybe these are all wonderful people, maybe  they will get a job. It is still a big problem because you are having  people skip in line ahead of people who are doing things right.   But something came out in the last few weeks that ought to have  people really mad--it maybe should even wake up the Biden  administration, who has done so much, I think, to permanently damage  this country--and that is news that Venezuela may be sending people  here out of their prisons.   Can you imagine any quicker way to ruin America than to accept people  from other countries who are emptying out their prisons?   But that is apparently what is going on.   And nothing is done. We still have over 150,000 people a month  crossing the border, even now, knowing that probably we are getting  people who are committing crimes, heinous crimes in Venezuela, and  sending them here, and the communist government of Venezuela, I am  sure, is laughing all the way.    Please, America, and, please, our comatose press corps, wake up and  educate America that we may be ruined because we have criminals coming  here from Venezuela and allowed to cross the border.                            ____________________
