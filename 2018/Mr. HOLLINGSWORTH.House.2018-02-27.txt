 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of  this legislation because I think it addresses a fundamental flaw in how  we have looked at operational risk capital.   Fundamentally, we want banks to hold capital necessary for the risks  they are taking today and the likely risks that they may incur losses  into the future. By purely looking backwards, we are driving down the  Interstate in the financial system driving by looking in the rearview  mirror only. That is a terrible mistake by only looking at past risks  instead of the risks they have today.   If we want to encourage institutions to become less risky, then we  need to ensure that they can reduce the amount of capital buffer if  they are doing less risky activities. This is basically incentivizing  the right behavior. If we continue to say to institutions: You are  going to be penalized for the past irrespective of what you may be  doing today, irrespective of the less risk you may be taking into the  future, then we are essentially providing them no incentive to become  less risky.   I think the lesson after 2008 is making sure that we allow the free  markets and institutions to act with the right incentives, not the  wrong incentives. We want them to become less risky over time by their  own decisions and by their own elections.   This doesn't change anything about the basic operational risk capital  that they must maintain, except that it says it should match what they  are doing today and the activities that they are going to be engaged on  in the future.   So I do think this is commonsense legislation. I do think this is a  thoughtful response to a genuine problem that I hear about back home in  Indiana frequently. So I continue to support H.R. 4296, and I urge all  of my colleagues to do the same.
