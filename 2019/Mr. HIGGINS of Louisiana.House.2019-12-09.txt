 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3469, the Covert Testing  and Risk Mitigation Improvement Act of 2019, sponsored by our late  colleague, the greatly admired Elijah Cummings.   H.R. 3469 responds to identified gaps in the covert testing conducted  by the Transportation Security Administration on aviation security  concerns. It is critical that our bipartisan congressional oversight be  aimed at improving the security of the traveling public and the  effectiveness of TSA operations.   This legislation not only requires TSA to develop a system for  conducting risk-informed covert tests but also holds TSA accountable  for retesting and risk mitigation efforts. The traveling public  deserves the most effective security, and I support the efforts of H.R.  3469 to improve the public's confidence in aviation security.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and honor the legacy of  leadership left by Chairman Cummings.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the  congresswoman from New York, my colleague, aware that I have no further  speakers, and I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, U.S. Customs and Border Protection law enforcement  officers are the first line of defense in preventing the illicit flow  of drugs and contraband from entering our country.   I walked the border with my brothers and sisters of the thin blue  line, and I have seen what CBP is up against. I can tell you firsthand  that our cartel adversaries are ruthless and steadfast in their  determination to exploit our laws and poison our communities.   Transnational drug traffickers operate like a business, always  looking to capitalize on products high in demand and high with profit  margin. Today, their focus is fentanyl, a drug 100 times more powerful  than morphine. Just 2 milligrams are enough to be lethal.   Fentanyl and its analogs are being produced mostly in China, but also  increasingly in Mexico. Illicit opioids enter the United States through  the mail, concealed within vehicles or cargo coming through the ports  of entry, and in backpacks of cartel drug runners.   Initially, Chinese drug traffickers were so confident that fentanyl  would not be interdicted they sent stacks of it through the mail. The  CBP improved, their targeting improved, and cartels were forced to  change their approach, sending smaller quantities and rerouting  packages through freight forwarders and other countries to mask their  point of origin.   The 2018 DEA threat assessment stated that the purity level of the  fentanyl coming across the land border is, on average, less than 10  percent pure. However, a recent DHS Office of Inspector General report  found that the CBP's small-scale chemical screening devices cannot  identify fentanyl purity levels of 10 percent or less. This is crucial.   The IG also found that there was no policy or centralized database in  place to ensure chemical screening devices had up-to-date spectral  libraries essential to ensuring all analogs and new opioid forms can be  detected. That is why I am pleased to see the House take up my bill,  H.R. 4761, the DHS Opioid Detection Resilience Act of 2019.   My bill addresses the gaps in CBP's opioid detection capability by  requiring the Customs and Border Protection commissioner to implement a  strategy to ensure chemical screening devices can identify narcotics in  an operational environment with low purity levels.   H.R. 4761 also requires DHS to develop a centralized spectral  database for chemical screening devices to ensure unity of effort  across all components they encounter when opioids cross the field.                                time  1615    CBP works tirelessly to prevent this poison from reaching American  communities, and this bill helps law enforcement carry out that  mission.   I thank Congresswoman Clarke and Congressmen Rogers, McCaul, King,  Rose, Katko, and Joyce for signing on as original cosponsors and for  their support of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentlewoman aware that I have  no further speakers and that I am prepared to close.   I urge the adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4739 because of the valuable impact it  will have on Customs and Border Protection officer safety.   The opioid epidemic continues to wreak havoc on communities across  the Nation. It touches people from every age group, race, class,  gender, and background. Parents are losing their children; children are  losing their parents. It is devastating.   Illegally manufactured opioids from China and Mexico are pouring into  the United States through our mail system and across our borders. The  first line of defense against these illicit substances is the brave men  and women of Customs and Border Protection. They work tirelessly every  day to protect us, and we must make sure they have the equipment and  training they need to do it safely.   The safe handling of opioids by CBP law enforcement officers is  crucial, as just 2 milligrams can be lethal. H.R. 4739 requires the  Commissioner of CBP to establish and regularly update a policy for the  safe handling of synthetic opioids by officers, agents, canines, and  other personnel.   The bill also requires that protective equipment and opioid receptor  antagonists be made available for all relevant CBP employees and  canines. When it comes to officer safety, we should never consider  ourselves too careful.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the Congresswoman aware that I have  no further speakers on this bill, and I am prepared to close.   I urge the adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4727, the Department of  Homeland Security Mentor-Protege Program Act of 2019.   The Department of Homeland Security has an important mission to  protect this Nation, but they cannot do it on their own. For many  functions, DHS relies on contractors to get the job done.   H.R. 4727 would expand the contractor pool that DHS relies on by  creating a mentor-protege program to help small businesses grow their  technical capabilities.                                time  1630    I support the legislation and the creation of this program at DHS,  modeled after a similar one at the Department of Defense. Under the  program, larger contractors would develop agreements with smaller firms  to provide assistance and to potentially involve the smaller firm in  DHS contracts at a subcontractor level.   To provide transparency into this program, the Office of Small and  Disadvantaged Business Utilization will report annually to Congress.  This will allow us to evaluate the benefit of this program and its  progress in developing the contractor base.   I would like to thank Representative McEachin for introducing H.R.  4727 and for his work to grow the capability of small businesses that  contract for the DHS.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I do urge the adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3318, the Emerging  Transportation Security Threats Act of 2019, sponsored by my good  friend and colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).   This legislation establishes a task force aimed at improving the  security of the traveling public by bringing together relevant Federal  authorities and transportation security stakeholders.   The task force established by this legislation will look at emerging  and  [[Page H9373]]  potential future threats to transportation security from a number of  threat vectors, including cybersecurity, explosives, public area  security, and evolving terrorist attacks.   This bill also directs the Administrator of the TSA to develop  relevant threat mitigation plans in close coordination with  transportation security stakeholders and appropriate Federal agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his  leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 4713, the Department of Homeland  Security Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Authorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will give the Department of Homeland  Security Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties more tools to  conduct its investigations.   The bill does not significantly broaden the authority of CRCL; it is  intended to grant CRCL the authorities necessary to conduct meaningful  inquiries into allegations of abuse of civil rights and civil liberties  within DHS.   The bill specifically outlines mechanisms to ensure that there is  coordination with other entities at DHS who conduct investigations of  violations of civil rights. DHS already has numerous officers engaged  in investigating such violations, and we want to ensure that the new  authority granted to CRCL is not used to engage in duplicative  activities or investigations.   H.R. 4713 also grants CRCL access to DHS documents on programs and  operations, provides it with subpoena powers and the authority to  administer an oath or take an affidavit. These authorities should be  exercised only in the rarest of the circumstances and only after  approval by the Secretary.   DHS and its components should view cooperation with CRCL as standard  operating procedure and provide relevant documents when requested.  However, in utilizing the authority provided, CRCL must also respect  generally accepted exceptions to document production.   Finally, the bill requires the issuance of a report after an  investigation. Although not required, I expect CRCL to seek the  guidance of the Secretary and the components whenever possible during  an investigation to ensure that it is conducted in a fair and equitable  manner.   We have made some changes to the bill at the request of DHS. To the  extent that DHS continues to have concerns, I encourage the majority to  work with the Department as this bill moves to the Senate to address  outstanding issues.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Taylor), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I urge  adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4402, the Inland Waters  Security Review Act sponsored by my friend and colleague, the ranking  member of the Transportation and Maritime Security Subcommittee,  Representative Debbie Lesko.   H.R. 4402 will improve the security awareness of the Department of  Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard for threats and  vulnerabilities on America's inland water systems. These important  arteries for commerce face unique challenges related to illegal drugs  and smuggling. It  [[Page H9377]]  is important that the Coast Guard continues to work diligently with  relevant stakeholders to address these challenges.   This legislation would also ensure that Federal authorities are  working in close partnership with their State, local, Tribal,  territorial, and private sector partners to identify and address  security issues related to America's inland waters.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lesko for her leadership on this  bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the bill; I  urge adoption of the bill; and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3669, the Weatherizing Infrastructure  in the North and Terrorism Emergency Readiness Act--the WINTER Act--of  2019.   This legislation seeks to better position the United States  government and relevant State, local, and private sector agencies to be  able to respond to a terrorist attack during an extreme cold weather  event.   An extreme weather event, such as a polar vortex, has the potential  to severely impact our daily lives, damage  [[Page H9378]]  our critical infrastructure, and leave America incredibly vulnerable to  terrorist attack.   H.R. 3669 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and  conduct an exercise to respond to terrorism during extreme weather  events.   The bill also requires the Secretary to produce an after-action  report to Congress, presenting the findings of the exercise and plans  for quickly incorporating those lessons learned for future operations  of the Department.   As the threat of terrorism continues to evolve, we must be prepared  to respond to any scenario.   I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for her leadership on this  bill. I urge all Members to join me in supporting the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like the Congresswoman  to be aware that I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to  close.   I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
