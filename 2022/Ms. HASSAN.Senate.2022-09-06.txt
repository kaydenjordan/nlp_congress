 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Deborah  Cross of Manchester as July's Granite Stater of the Month. After  surviving stage 4 cancer, Deborah used her artistic talents to create  photo journals to help other cancer patients process their emotions and  find resilience.   After recovering from endometrial cancer in 2014 and living cancer- free for almost 4 years, Deborah received awful news from her doctor.  Her cancer had come back. While Deborah was devastated by the news, she  also found solace in a creative outlet that would also help others.   Deborah began creating booklets with strikingly edited photos of  nature in New Hampshire, for example, images of seagulls and ocean  sunsets around the New England coast. Below the photos are blank lines  where cancer patients can journal. Deborah hopes that the photos can  evoke deeper emotions that patients might be struggling with in a time  of intense personal hardship. In addition, some of the proceeds from  the sales go to the North of Boston Cancer Resource.   Deborah exemplifies the Granite State spirit of giving back to others  and bringing people together even during challenging times. She took an  immensely difficult experience--battling with stage 4 cancer--and found  her way through it by creating art that would touch others. I commend  her for her work and know that her story will inspire others to make a  difference in their communities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Evan  Crotty of Wilton as August's Granite Stater of the Month. Twelve-year- old Evan is cleaning up every street in his town over the next year,  and the money he is raising through the initiative will go to his  middle school's music department.   When it came time for Evan to choose a bar mitzvah project, he knew  he wanted to start a community cleanup because of his deep appreciation  of nature. Last summer as a Boy Scout, Evan hiked 75 miles and learned  about how to preserve nature, leaving no trace behind on trails. In  addition, Evan had done many community cleanups before with his family,  and he was excited to expand those efforts into a yearlong project.   Teaming up with a community cleanup expert, Evan launched his  project, beginning the process of going street by street in Wilton and  removing the plastic bags, cans, and trash that litter the area.  Already a couple of weeks into the project, Evan has felt the support  from neighbors passing by who have given him a supportive honk from  their cars or thanked him for his work.   As part of the project, Evan is also fundraising online and donating  the proceeds to his middle school's music department. After performing  in Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative Middle High School's production of  ``Matilda,'' Evan knew he wanted to support his theater department so  that other students could have the positive experience that he had by  participating in a show.   Evan hopes that when neighbors drive by and see him removing trash  and other litter, they will be inspired to also care for the natural  spaces around them. In addition, it is a testament to Evan's passionate  spirit that he is also fundraising for the arts through his cleanup  project. I am grateful to Evan for his work and for inspiring Granite  Staters to each take steps to better their own communities. He  represents the very best of our Granite State spirit, taking the  initiative to make a difference.                            ____________________
