 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to our  veterans who served in or near the Panama Canal Zone during the Vietnam  war.   Hundreds of these veterans came home with major health issues after  being exposed to deadly herbicides like Agent Orange and Agent Purple.  Yet, to this day, they are not eligible to receive Federal benefits and  disability compensation.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to say that we are one step closer to  changing that. Today, I was proud to pass my amendment requiring the  Department of Defense to study this issue, which is the first step to  ensuring that these veterans finally will receive the care and benefits  they deserve.   Madam Speaker, these veterans honorably served our Nation. Now, it is  our turn to serve them and get this done.                            ____________________
