 Mr. Speaker, over the last 60 years, the Franciscan  Friars shaped the lives of many students and families that have passed  through the halls of Conwell-Egan Catholic High School in lower Bucks  County. It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to announce the  departure of the Franciscan community from Conwell-Egan.   If you went to Egan like me, then you knew Father Fidelis and Brother  Larry. Their service and the service of more than 150 other Friars who  have ministered there have brought profound grace and enrichment to the  lives of so many young men and women throughout lower Bucks County.   The Franciscan Order at Conwell-Egan reinforced the school mission of  building character through service, achieving academic excellence, and  demonstrating a commitment to a life full of learning.   Myself, my family, and the entire lower Bucks County community are  forever grateful for their continuous guidance and their continuous  support. As we say good-bye to these exemplary individuals, true  representatives of St. Francis, we wish them the best as they move on  to their next mission.                            ____________________
