 Mr. President, I rise to speak on the need to vigorously  protect the Great Lakes.   The Great Lakes are a vital natural resource not only for my home  State of Michigan but for the entire Nation. In addition to providing  drinking water for nearly 40 million people, the Great Lakes serve as  an economic engine for our entire country. This freshwater system is  associated with adding nearly $6 trillion to the U.S. GDP while  supporting millions of jobs. It accounts for more than 50 percent of  all U.S.-Canadian border trade and facilitates the shipping of over 200  million tons of cargo every year.   But ask Michiganders what the Great Lakes mean to them, and they will  tell you that they are a great deal more than simply a source of  commerce; the Great Lakes literally define our State. They not only  define our borders but who we are among the States. We are, in fact,  the Great Lakes State. We love to spend our summers on or near the  lakes and, in the process, form the family memories that we hold for a  lifetime. It is no exaggeration to say that for Michiganders, the Great  Lakes are part of who we are. It is in our DNA.   Over the years, Democrats and Republicans alike have understood the  importance of maintaining the vitality of the Great Lakes. That is why,  in 2004, President George W. Bush signed an Executive order to promote  a Great Lakes regional collaboration.   Then, in 2010, President Obama built on his predecessor's leadership.  In his very first budget request, President Obama called for the  funding for what would later be known as the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative. The GLRI today remains a bipartisan success story because  it provides a platform for Federal Agencies and States to come together  to address the biggest threats to our lakes.   Let me give you a few examples of the positive impact that the GLRI  has had in my home State of Michigan.   In Deer Lake, near Ishpeming in the Upper Peninsula, GLRI funds were  used to successfully eliminate mercury runoff that had contaminated  local wildlife. Over just a few years, these funds were used to restore  the natural habitat, and as a result, Deer Lake was no longer  considered a Federal area of concern.   Thanks to the support of the GLRI, sufficient improvements were made  to prevent runoff at the Gloede Drain in the Clinton Township of Macomb  County, reducing flooding and soil erosion in an area that many  Michiganders call home.   In Detroit, 30 steel mills, oil refineries, chemical manufacturers,  and other plants discharged pollutants into the Detroit River for  decades. However, with the implementation of $89 million worth of GLRI  waterway cleanup projects, the water quality has improved, and Detroit  now has a thriving and vibrant downtown RiverWalk that has become an  economic engine for small businesses.   There is no question the GLRI is a proven success and has been vital  to Michigan's environment and to Michigan's economy. Yet, despite this  success, President Trump, once again, is willing to risk the health,  safety, and vitality of one of the world's largest freshwater systems  by proposing a 90-percent cut--yes, a 90-percent cut--to the Great  Lakes Restoration Initiative. Unfortunately, this is not the first  time. Since taking office, President Trump has tried to eliminate the  funding to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative each and every year  he has been in office, and each and every year, Congress has united in  a bipartisan way to ensure that this critical program remains funded.   Let me be clear. Slashing GLRI funding would have an immediate and  catastrophic impact on the future of the Great Lakes and on both the  nearly 10 million Michiganders whom I represent as well as our entire  country.   I again ask my Senate colleagues for their support. The Great Lakes  are not just a Michigan priority; they are not just a regional  priority--they are truly a national priority. Fully funding the  [[Page S1891]]  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative should never be a partisan issue--it  is simply the right thing to do--and, together, we can protect the  Great Lakes for this generation and future generations to come.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor a lifelong  champion of the American labor movement, Mr. Rick Blocker, president of  the Metro Detroit AFL-CIO, on the occasion of his retirement. As a  member of the  [[Page S1896]]  U.S. Senate, it is both my privilege and honor to recognize Mr. Blocker  for his lifetime of service and contributions that have strengthened  our community and State.   Rick Blocker has been a tireless advocate for his brothers and  sisters in labor throughout his career. From 1987 to 2013, he served as  the secretary-treasurer and executive assistant to the president of the  United Food and Commercial Workers, UFCW, Local Union 876 in Madison  Heights, MI. In this role, he was responsible for managing the finances  and expenditures of the over 19,000 members of Local 876. Rick also  served as a trustee for the Michigan UFCW Unions and Employers Health  and Welfare Fund where he maintained membership services, helped  develop community programs, and assisted in contract negotiations.   Since 2013, Rick has served as president of the Metro-Detroit AFL- CIO. The Metro Detroit AFL-CIO is comprised of approximately 120  affiliated labor organizations that represent nearly 70,000 members. In  this capacity, Rick serves as the lead voice of these affiliates and  members to the public and the State AFL-CIO, representing the interests  of working people throughout the region. Through his work, Rick  continually advocates for economic and social justice and the  betterment of workers lives, not just in metro Detroit, but across the  State of Michigan.   Rick has spent his career and life in support of his community,  organized labor, civil rights, and faith. Throughout his life, he has  been involved with many organizations, including the Trade Union  Leadership Council, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, the  Coalition of Labor Women, is a founding member of the Change to Win  Federation, a life member of the NAACP, and a trustee and executive  director of New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit. Rick also serves on  Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan's Mayor's Workforce Development Board, with  the mission to strive toward successful delivery of workforce programs  across the city of Detroit.   Rick has spent his career in service to others, his community, and  his brother and sisters in labor. I ask my colleagues to join me today  in honoring my friend, Mr. Rick Blocker, for his leadership in  furthering the causes of the organized labor movement and for his many  other contributions to the metro Detroit region. I wish Rick and his  family health and happiness in the years ahead.                            ____________________
