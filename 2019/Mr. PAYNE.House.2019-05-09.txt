 Madam Speaker, May is Mental Health Awareness Month.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor America's mothers and to raise  awareness about maternal mental health.   Each year in the United States, an estimated 1.3 million women suffer  from perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, such as maternal depression.   To all the mothers or potential mothers out there, know that maternal  depression is nothing to be ashamed of. It is the number one  complication of pregnancy in the United States, and it can affect women  regardless of the outcome of the pregnancy. Do not be afraid to reach  out to healthcare professionals to get treatment.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the  mothers, the survivors of maternal depression, and the great  organizations  [[Page H3551]]  across the country that are supporting women's mental health.   By raising awareness, we can help protect the mental health of women  and mothers in our communities.                            ____________________
