 Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute the extraordinary  efforts of the officers and crew of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower  Carrier Strike Group.   These dedicated sailors deployed in late January, navigating over  60,000 nautical miles from Norfolk, Virginia, to the Arabian Sea,  conducting 166 sorties and 1,135 flight hours in support of Operation  Freedom's Sentinel in the Arabian Sea.   This group deserves special recognition for their successful  deployment in which COVID-19 restrictions presented the traditional  port visits.   Upon returning to homeport on August 10, the crew of the Mighty Ike  was underway for an astounding 206 consecutive days.   To the officers and crew, including two constituents from eastern  Connecticut, Petty Officer Ashley Maratta of Amston and Lieutenant  Charles  [[Page H5661]]  Peck of Old Lyme, an aviator on his first carrier deployment who I  proudly nominated to the U.S. Naval Academy in 2011, I say Bravo Zulu,  the sea service signal for job well done. Thank you all for your  service.                            ____________________
