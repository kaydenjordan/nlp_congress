 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the efforts by  House Democrats to protect women from the extreme Republican antiwomen  agenda.  [[Page H5948]]    I say to my colleagues that Republicans across our Nation seek to  criminalize abortion nationwide with no exceptions, not for rape, not  for incest, and they are very determined.   But while they seek to control women and their personal choices,  President Biden and House Democrats firmly stand with women. We trust  women.   Just last Friday, President Biden signed an executive order aimed at  protecting access to reproductive health services. This week, House  Democrats are passing legislation to protect a woman's ability to  travel freely and voluntarily throughout the United States, including  for reproductive health.   We trust women because that is who we are as Democrats. We are the  party that stands by women and their human rights. We trust women.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman and the  ranking member for such kind remarks about a dear friend and colleague  back home, Benny Martinez.   They have covered a lot of what was said, but I will repeat some of  it because I think it is important, not just for people in my district  to hear it, but for people across the district because, with the naming  of this Post Office, Mr. Speaker, it will mean the first post office  named for a Latino in the Houston area, which, too, is a remarkable  achievement.   Mr. Martinez was a community leader, an advocate for Mexican-American  civil rights, an Army veteran, a nurse, a Houston, Texas educator, and  a friend.   Benny and his family came from humble beginnings in Goliad, Texas,  but moved to Houston, like many others, to find more opportunities.   In 1956, at the age of 18, Benny was inducted into the U.S. Army.  After completing his training, he was sent to Korea, where he was  assigned to the 564th Quartermaster Company.   Benny put his education degree to use and worked as an associate  teacher in the Houston School District at Crockett Elementary.   On top of this, Mr. Speaker, he served many organizations. As was  mentioned, he was a lifelong member of LULAC, the League of United  Latin American Citizens; the Veterans of Foreign Wars; the Knights of  Columbus; and the American GI Forum. He also found time to be an usher  at his local church.   The thing that has been mentioned but that I want to underscore,  because it was another historical note, is that he is better known for  facilitating a historic meeting between a Texas LULAC chapter--again,  the League of United Latin American Citizens--and then-President John  F. Kennedy in 1963. This event is the first known meeting between a  U.S. sitting President and a Hispanic civil rights group--very  noteworthy.   After a lifetime of a lot of achievements, Mr. Martinez passed away  at 85 in 2019. This bill would name the post office after him. I urge  all of my colleagues to support this bill in the memory of a history  maker and a pioneer in our community.
