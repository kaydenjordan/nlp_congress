 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Bost for yielding me  this time to speak in support of Representative Luttrell's bill, the  Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2023.   I am grateful that my bill, the Veterans' Appeals Backlog Improvement  Act, is included in this package. My bipartisan bill, which I  introduced with Congressman McGarvey, is aimed at reducing wait times  for our veterans with claims in front of the Board of Veterans'  Appeals.   For too many of our veterans, they are waiting weeks, months, and  sometimes even years to hear back. These delays create an incredible  hurdle for our veterans who are trying to get a potentially life- changing decision.   While progress has been made in this area to older legacy VA appeals  from veterans, the backlog is only increasing with newer claims  stemming from the PACT Act.   Simply put, the Board of Veterans' Appeals, like all employers, is  having issues recruiting employees and does not have enough staff to  process the volume of cases. To address this shortage, my bill would  create an internship program for law students at the Board of Veterans'  Appeals. Additionally, it would create a 9-year pilot honors program at  the VA for recruiting entry-level attorneys to work at the Board of  Veterans' Appeals.   This bill makes major strides in improving and addressing the backlog  and delays that our veterans see far too often and will help recruit  much-needed staff.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to supporting this legislation and  swift passage on the House floor.
