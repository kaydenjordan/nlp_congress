 Mr. Speaker, James Freeman of the Wall  Street Journal on October 19 wrote an editorial on how Americans should  not be complacent living with less, as jobs are destroyed while  inflation accelerates:   ``Selling the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders era of scarcity won't be easy.  And it's going to get much harder if the President and his legislative  coauthor enact their massive new plan to discourage productive labor.         Examining the House version of the plan, economist Casey       Mulligan estimates that by reducing the incentives to work,       the bill's planned expansions of Federal benefits will cost       nine million jobs.        Already, the COVID-era combination of astronomical       government spending and money creation has resulted in too       many dollars chasing too few goods.        Generations of them, American consumers, built the largest       economy in the world and various online commenters have       suggested a slogan for Democrats running in 2022: Expect       Less.    In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan to America.                            ____________________
