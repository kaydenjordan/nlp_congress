 Madam President, today I express my concern over the  rise in violent crime and in particular the hate crimes against Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders.   Every single one of us ought to be horrified to see our fellow  Americans attacked because of their race or ethnicity. We are united in  our opposition to this hateful violence. We are united in seeing it  investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I  introduced a resolution to this effect, and I will welcome all my  Senate colleagues to join me.   I am very happy to see that Attorney General Garland has turned his  attention to this problem. On March 30, he directed the Department of  Justice to engage in a 30-day review of the Department's response to  hate crimes. I hope the Senate will benefit from the results of that  review. However, our responses to the problem of hate crimes must be  guided by the facts and a pursuit of sound policy. I am not sure that  we have done the legwork to arrive at a legislative solution that will  make a difference to preventing, deterring, and punishing these crimes.   Along with my colleague Senator Cotton, the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Counterterrorism, we are  requesting a full or subcommittee hearing on the issue, and we should  do that after the Attorney General's review has been completed.   We now have before the Senate S. 937, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act,  being introduced before the Attorney General's review began and appears  to be duplicative or even in conflict with some of the DOJ's existing  efforts. This does not seem to me to be the best path, but that is the  path the Senate is on now, and I voted to proceed hours ago to S. 937.  I am thankful that it is coming up. I know that Members of the  Republican caucus have amendments that will hopefully improve the bill  and make it a very useful piece of legislation.   We hope these amendments will be listened to and fairly considered by  our Democratic colleagues. This is too important of an issue to get  wrong.                              Election Security    Madam President, now, on another point. Between Democrats who believe  Russia rigged the vote to elect Trump in 2016 and Republicans who  believe various theories questioning Biden's election victory, they all  add up to what seems to be a bipartisan supermajority of Americans  casting doubt about our elections. In fact, one prominent claim by some  Trump supporters that a particular brand of voting machine switched  Trump votes to Biden appears to have been plagiarized from the  Democratic Party's playbook from the election of 2004.   I heard from many left-leaning Iowans at that time who questioned  President Bush's victory based on claims that a particular brand of  voting machine switched votes in Ohio. That was 2004. It seems kind of  similar, doesn't it, today.   Those totally unsubstantiated claims ultimately led Democrats to  force a vote in a joint session of Congress in 2005 to reject Ohio's  electoral votes cast for President Bush. There are still Democratic  Members of Congress in both Chambers who voted to overturn Ohio State's  certified election in 2004.   Now, after the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia, the losing  Democratic candidate refused to concede, claiming, without evidence  that would stand up in court, that she, as a Democratic candidate for  Governor of Georgia, would have won but for voting irregularities. Now,  rather than distance itself from questioning a certified election in  2018, the Democratic Party invited her to speak at their convention in  2020.   Two years later, the tables are now turned. Trump lost Georgia by a  far smaller margin than that Democratic candidate for Governor in  Georgia in 2018 did, but we are now told that to suggest that there  were flaws in the 2020 Georgia election is somehow unacceptable and  undermining democracy.  [[Page S1930]]    It is pretty obvious, after this history, that we need to break the  cycle of partisans questioning elections when their side lost or it is  OK to complain when their side lost, but if the other side does the  same thing, there is something wrong with it. So there is a lesson for  both Republicans and Democrats. Both parties must stop finger-pointing,  stop blaming, and stop the partisan accusations. We all need to work  together to restore Americans' faith in elections.   So that brings me to something very current because it passed the  House of Representatives. So that brings me to the Democrats' so-called  For the People Act. Incidentally, don't you find that name a little  creepy? So often in history, when people claim to speak for ``the  people,'' they were just seeking power.   For the People Act was introduced after the 2018 elections as a clear  political statement to build the hyperpartisan narrative that  Democratic defeats were due to widespread voter suppression.   Now, we always hear about voter suppression before and since the 2020  election, but just think of the historic turnout--not only the historic  turnout that the losing candidate had but the historic turnout that the  winning candidate had. And yet we have voter suppression.   H.R. 1 was then, and remains, a hastily cobbled together collection  of every Democratic proposal for new election mandates. No care was  taken to make it cohesive or workable. It is evident that State and  local election officials were not consulted in its drafting.   You know, just to consider the size of the bill, the Voting Rights  Act of 1965, I think, was only two pages. For the People Act, the bill  introduced--or heard--before the Senate Rules Committee is 800 pages.   Now, that bill that I just talked about had actually passed the House  in 2019 on party lines and was placed directly on the Senate calendar  at Senator Schumer's request. Now, this is very typical of political  messaging bills so the minority leader can force a vote to proceed. I  assume, in 2019, that Senator Schumer did not force the Senate vote to  take up the bill because partisan activists got more traction out of  blaming Leader McConnell for not bringing it up. Regardless, in 2019,  it was clearly designed as a messaging bill and not one designed to  ever get to the President's desk.   Now, in 2021, we are back at it again, considering a totally partisan  messaging bill that would radically rework all States' election  systems, where it has been in the Constitution the primary concern of  the State legislators and Congress seldomly intervening. I suppose the  most obvious is that on a certain date in November we all have  Presidential elections and congressional elections on the same date in  all 50 States, but beyond that, it is pretty much up to each State how  they want to conduct their elections.   So how does this bill, passing the House, once again, over here in  the Senate--how does that jibe with the message from Democrats just a  couple of months ago that State-run elections are beyond reproach?  Don't you remember? Because all 50 States had State-certified  elections, that gave Biden his win.   Now, it is pretty common sense. Either State-run elections are  fundamentally flawed and unfair, requiring massive Federal intervention  and Americans who question the outcome are taking a moral stand, or  State-run elections are, by and large, very fair, and Americans can  have confidence in the outcomes.   Either way, the same principle should apply to the last several  elections whether Republicans or Democrats were relatively more  successful in each case. I get it. I get it that having unleashed this  partisan tiger--the bill that came from the House of Representatives-- it is very hard to get that partisan tiger back in the cage.   But when this bill fails, as it must, we need to tamp down the  partisan accusations and work across party lines to restore faith in  American elections. Now, the way the environment here is in Washington  and in Congress, it isn't going to be easy, but the alternative is  unthinkable   I yield the floor.
