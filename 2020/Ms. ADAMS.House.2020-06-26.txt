 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure to override  the President's veto and to stand up for our Nation's 20 million  college students.   Secretary DeVos' rule would harm tens of thousands of college  students and would allow bad actors to continue some of the worst  practices, such as forcing students to sign pre-arbitration agreements  that limit their rights. We cannot allow predatory institutions to  steal the dream of a college degree from any child.   It is shameful that in his veto message, President Trump used  historically Black colleges and universities, HBCUs, as cover for his  pro-fraud, anti-student agenda.   Now, let's be clear. No HBCU has ever been implicated in a borrower  defense claim, and no HBCU has voiced support for Secretary DeVos'  rule. That is fake news.   It is time that President Trump and Secretary DeVos began standing up  for North Carolinians seeking opportunity instead of lying down to our  Nation's worst institutions. And if they won't do it, Congress will.   It is a fundamental right. Du Bois told us: ``Of all of the civil  rights for which the world has struggled and fought . . . the right to  learn is . . . the most fundamental.''
