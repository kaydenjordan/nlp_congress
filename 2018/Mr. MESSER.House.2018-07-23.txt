 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  California, Chairman McClintock, for his help on this bill; the  gentlewoman from Guam, my friend, Ms. Bordallo, for her support as  well; Chairman Bishop and all the members and staff of the Natural  Resources Committee for their important work and for bringing this  legislation to the House floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize my son, Hudson, I guess named  after a river, for tagging along with me and being here as well.   Mr. Speaker, as most of us learned in high school history, in 1803,  Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were commissioned by President  Jefferson to find a water route to the Pacific Ocean across the United  States.   This bill, the Eastern Legacy Extension Act, formally recognizes the  important role States like Indiana, my home State, played in the  expedition by extending the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail to  the east.   Currently, the trail only marks the western portion of Lewis and  Clark's expedition. However, these explorers, as other speakers have  said, traveled nearly 1,000 miles along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers  in States like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois before  arriving in present day Missouri.   In fact, the town of Clarksville, Indiana, is named after William  Clark after he famously stopped there to recruit members for the  expedition.   To properly recognize this historic expedition and preserve the  entire route Lewis and Clark took, Congress previously requested the  National Park Service to study extending the trail along the route they  took east of the Mississippi.                                time  1715    In February 2018, the final study was released, recommending that  Congress designate the eastern leg of the expedition as part of the  trail. This bill makes that a reality, and by recognizing the eastern  portions of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, we make the entire national  trail stronger.   This legislation will increase tourism opportunities for communities  in Indiana and the rest of the 4,900-mile route and promote historic  appreciation for the role Lewis and Clark played in making our country  what it is today.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage  Foundation for their work on this legislation and, again, thank the  committee and the chairmen for their work, too. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
