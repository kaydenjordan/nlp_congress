 Madam Speaker, as my colleagues and I come back into  legislative session this week, I would like to take this opportunity to  share what I learned from the 12th District of Georgia during the  recent district work period.   Like many of my colleagues, I spent the last 6 weeks meeting with  constituents, and I hope my colleagues got the same earful I did. Our  constituents want to know why Congress can't work together to deliver  results for the American people.   In fact, just last night, I hosted a telephone town hall, and  constituents said that the two top issues they want Congress to focus  on before the end of the year are healthcare and immigration reform.   How do we solve these problems when Democrats are determined to  ensure that our President is not successful? It is not fair to the  American people to put politics ahead of the American people's  interests.   We have a President who is willing and eager to work with us on many  issues, including healthcare and immigration, so let's get to work. The  American people won't accept anything less.                            ____________________
