 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer legislation to honor a  good man, a faithful public servant, a veteran, and a friend to the  people of the great state of Ohio by renaming the Post Office in  Ashland, Ohio after former Ohio Senate President, Bill Harris.   Bill served our nation as a United States Marine for 23 years. He  completed tours of duty in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. His actions led  to him being awarded the Bronze Star twice and the Vietnam Medal of  Honor. He rose to the rank of Major and retired in 1977.   Shortly thereafter, Bill found himself moving to Ashland, Ohio and  opening a car dealership. It is still run by the Harris family. Bill  was an active member of his community, serving as chairman of the  Ashland Area Chamber of Commerce and was a member of the Board for the  Ashbrook Center at Ashland University.   I got to know Bill when we served in the Ohio legislature together.  While he was in the Senate, I served in the House. Bill was Ohio Senate  President when he led them to enact major reforms to Ohio's tax code.  He also had a passion for making Ohio's higher education system better  and more affordable. But I also got to know Bill on a personal level.  After Bill broke his leg slipping on ice in 2009, he was unable to  drive. Since I lived the closest to him, I drove him down to Columbus  while he was recovering. We spent many hours talking, sometimes about  politics and state government, but mostly about family and life. He  told me stories and imparted his wisdom on those drives from Ashland to  Columbus and back.   Bill Harris dedicated his life to his family and friends, his  community and country. I offer this legislation as a way to honor  Bill's legacy and recognize his achievements. I ask for my colleagues'  support of this bill to rename the Post Office in Bill's hometown of  Ashland after him as thanks for his commitment to Ashland, the State of  Ohio, and to America.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read  the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the  table.                            ____________________
