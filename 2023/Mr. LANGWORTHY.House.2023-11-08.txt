 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a true American hero,  Herman ``Pat'' Pawlicki, a 102-year-old veteran from Elma, New York, in  my district, who served our Nation with unwavering dedication and  valor.   On December 7, 1941, Pat heard reports of the attacks on Pearl Harbor  on the radio. He was so moved with love for our country and for his  fellow Americans that he drove to the military recruitment station and  enlisted the very next day.   Pat went on to serve as a bomber pilot in the United States Army Air  Force, completing an astounding 23 bombing missions over Austria and  southern Germany, even striking Adolf Hitler's infamous retreat in the  Bavarian Alps.   Pat's dedication to our country extended beyond the battlefield.  After the war, he continued to serve his community, working as a tool  and die maker at Trico and was active in labor unions until he retired.   He was a dedicated husband to his wife, Frances, and they raised two  daughters together in western New York.   His remarkable contributions to our community have also been  recognized by Elma Supervisor, Wayne Clark.   Now, at the age of 102, Pat Pawlicki is a shining example of  sacrifice, service, and unwavering dedication to our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Pat. I thank Pat for his service and his  unyielding commitment to the principles that make America the land of  the free and the home of the brave.                            ____________________
