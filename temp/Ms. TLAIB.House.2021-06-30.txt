 Mr. Speaker, during my time in Congress, I have made it my  mission to put into policy what we all should know to be true: That  safe, clean water is a human right; that water is life.  [[Page H3517]]    This bill includes critical water provisions that will provide clean,  affordable drinking water. Over 60 schools in one of my cities alone  has garbage bags over their drinking fountains. So we must invest in  lead pipe and school drinking fountain replacement so that no child has  to drink poisoned water. This bill gets us closer to that.   We invest in water debt relief and low-income assistance so that  nobody has to suffer the indignity of having their water shut off and  having to rely on bottled water or collecting rainwater.   A couple in my district, Mr. Speaker, had to melt snow just to flush  their toilets.   Millions of Americans have experienced inhumane water shutoffs, but  this bill declares that nobody, especially our poor neighbors, should  live without water in our country. We will stop water shutoffs.   And my amendment helps families to make it clear that everyone  receiving assistance must be reconnected and stays connected. Again, we  are getting closer to the root causes of shutoffs because in this bill  we include reporting and data collection that is so critically  important to understand why water is becoming unaffordable and  inaccessible.   Again, it is important at all levels of government that we continue  to work together in truly making water a human right.
