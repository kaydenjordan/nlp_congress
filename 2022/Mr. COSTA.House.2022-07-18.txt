 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1130) expressing support for the sovereign decision  of Finland and Sweden to apply to join the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO) as well as calling on all members of NATO to ratify  the protocols of accession swiftly, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1130         Whereas Finland and Sweden have made a historic decision to       deepen their security ties with the transatlantic community;        Whereas a more resilient security architecture in Europe       advances democracy, human rights, and values consistent with       the North Atlantic Treaty;        Whereas, on April 4, 1949, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,       France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,       Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States formed       the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, hereinafter referred       to as NATO, to serve as a defensive alliance based on       promoting democratic values and the peaceful mediation of       disputes;        Whereas NATO membership is open to ``any other European       state in a position to further the principles of this Treaty       and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic       area'';        Whereas Finland and Sweden are European states with strong       democratic foundations that share the transatlantic       community's dedication to the rule of law and the peaceful       resolution of disputes;        Whereas Finland and Sweden have been members of NATO's       Partnership for Peace program since 1994 and have contributed       to NATO-led operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq;        Whereas NATO established the Partnership Interoperability       Initiative at the Wales Summit in 2014 to develop military-      to-military interoperability between select partner nations       enabling them to contribute to future crisis management,       including NATO-led operations;        Whereas Finland and Sweden were designated inaugural       Enhanced Opportunities Partners at the Wales Summit in 2014;        Whereas the hard-fought post-World War II European security       architecture has been upended by the Russian Federation's       cruel full-scale invasion of Ukraine which began on February       24, 2022;        Whereas the Russian Federation's invasion has fomented the       worst European humanitarian crisis since World War II with       4,339 civilian deaths, 4.8 million Ukrainian refugees across       Europe, and 7.1 million more internally displaced within       Ukraine, according to the United States Agency for       International Development as of June 10, 2022;        Whereas Finland and Sweden's populations expressed support       for NATO membership;  [[Page H6700]]         Whereas Finland and Sweden's highly capable militaries are       interoperable with NATO forces and would increase and fortify       NATO's collective security by increasing the security and       stability of the Baltic Sea region and Northern Europe;        Whereas officials of the Russian Federation issued threats       directed at Finland and Sweden prior to their decision to       exercise their sovereign right to apply for NATO membership;        Whereas despite these threats from the Russian Federation,       Finland and Sweden's national institutions have reviewed       their policies of military nonalignment and their governments       and parliaments have expressed support for applying for NATO       membership; and        Whereas in the best interests of their respective peoples,       the European security architecture, the rule of international       law, and democracy in Europe, Finland and Sweden have       announced their support for NATO membership: Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) expresses support for Finland and Sweden's sovereign       and historic decision to apply to the North Atlantic Treaty       Organization (NATO);        (2) recognizes that Finland and Sweden's sovereign and       historic decision to apply to NATO is reflective of the will       of those respective governments' peoples;        (3) urges all members of NATO to meet the two-percent       defense spending pledge as agreed upon during the 2014 Wales       Summit;        (4) opposes any attempt by the Russian Federation to act in       an adverse way in response to Finland and Sweden's sovereign       and historic decision to apply to join NATO;        (5) recognizes that the accession of Finland and Sweden to       NATO requires all 30 Allies to sign and ratify protocols of       accession; and        (6) calls on the member states of NATO to formally support       the accession of Finland and Sweden into NATO.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 1130, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Chairman Keating's resolution  expressing support for the sovereign decision of Finland and Sweden to  apply for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, also known as NATO,  and calling on all members of NATO to swiftly ratify the protocols of  accession.   Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February of this year, the  world has changed. The world has watched as Vladimir Putin ordered his  military to march through Ukraine, brutally attacking civilians and  civilian infrastructure, making it exceptionally clear that his  senseless imperial aspirations go far beyond the Donbas and even  Ukraine in its entirety. As a matter of fact, he has stated such.   In response, our transatlantic allies and partners have had to  completely rethink, as is clear, our security postures, tighten our  ranks, and counter global challenges.   In response to the Russian Federation's unthinkable aggression in  Ukraine, Sweden and Finland, both long-term security partners of the  United States and NATO as a whole, have made the sovereign decision to  apply for NATO membership. This did not come about easily or  automatically.   Both Chairman Keating and I believe Finland and Sweden's accession to  NATO presents a strong, unified message against Putin's aggression in  Ukraine, and this would support peace and the values that we all adhere  to in the NATO alliance. Finland and Sweden's militaries, already  equipped with modern technology and weapons, some of which have already  been delivered to Ukraine, are fully interoperable with NATO systems,  which makes them a good fit.   Additionally, NATO's land border with Russia will now include  significantly more territory, thereby acting as a greater deterrence to  Russian threats and aggression. Their accession will also bolster  NATO's capabilities in the Baltic Sea region, building on the  capabilities of our Baltic partners, as well as Poland, who have each  been steadfast in their commitments to countering Russian aggression  and responding to this grave humanitarian crisis that is Russia's  responsibility and Russia's responsibility solely on their part.   For this decision, as Finnish President Niinisto has rightly said,  when Vladimir Putin looks in the mirror, he has only himself to blame.  Putin's entire warfighting efforts--the bombings, the airstrikes, the  ground movements--have been counterproductive. Instead, Putin and the  military of the Russian Federation, as I and many others have said,  have committed war crimes, forced Ukrainians from their homes into  filtration camps and deported them to far-away Russian territories, and  singlehandedly instigated the largest humanitarian crisis in Europe  since World War II.   Despite his goals of dividing the transatlantic alliance, Putin has  instead united us more resolutely than ever before against his attempt  to spread hate and violence across the globe and to create more  division. Clearly, that has been his goal, and it has been his goal for  years. In addition, individuals from around Europe, most notably  Central Europe, have welcomed those fleeing violence in Ukraine in  their own homes in Poland, Romania, and many other European countries.  It is really an incredible humanitarian effort that these central  European countries have engaged in, and it has been heartening for the  entire world to see.   Bearing the events of the last few months in mind, this resolution  expresses support for Finland and Sweden's monumental decision to apply  for NATO membership. Furthermore, this resolution echoes the leadership  role that Congress and this administration have taken in uniting the  transatlantic alliance and the world in support of Ukraine.   This did not happen overnight. President Biden last year began  working closely with our NATO allies, sharing intelligence, working  together to build on that alliance, including more recently Congress  providing over $50 billion in support for Ukraine's warfighting effort  and the immense humanitarian crisis that has resulted. These funds have  been crucial in ensuring that Ukraine can continue their fight, and it  has provided leadership for our other European allies to do the same.  This is a fight for democracy, a fight for freedom, and it is a fight  that Ukrainians must win. This is the test of our time, and President  Zelenskyy has stood up, reminding all of us that the price of freedom  is not free, and those brave Ukrainian people, how much they have done  to show the entire world that they stand for their sovereignty.   However, this resolution would not have been possible without the  bipartisan support of many of my colleagues, who have long supported  the NATO alliance, like Congressman Turner and so many others. This  includes the lead on this resolution, Chairman Keating, as well as the  lead original cosponsors on this resolution, House Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the Environment, and Cyber, Ranking  Member Brian Fitzpatrick, as well as Representatives Eric Swalwell and  Ann Wagner, and Representatives Connolly and Turner of the NATO  Parliamentary Assembly.   In addition, I thank all of the chairs of the House Finland and  Sweden Caucuses for signing on as original cosponsors of this  legislation.   Finally, I also specifically thank Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member  McCaul of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who have been united in  these efforts over the recent months.   I also express my gratitude to Leader Hoyer and Chairman Meeks for  allowing this resolution to move to the floor so expeditiously.   Through this resolution, the House will loudly and clearly welcome  Finland and Sweden into the NATO alliance, a clear sign of  transatlantic unity in response to Vladimir Putin's brutal ambition.   I was in Brussels in February, 2 days before the invasion, and I have  never seen NATO as united perhaps since the Cold War.   The fact is that we have a strong history, and we have the  opportunity to be bolstered by the strength of their military alliance  as well as the democratic resolve of their governments.  [[Page H6701]]    So in the spirit of unity and recognition of Finland and Sweden as  long-term friends of the United States, I strongly urge my colleagues  to support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of the House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.   I thank Ranking Member Turner for his leadership and for his support  of our common alliance and our defense in these critical and dangerous  times that we are living in.   I want to reflect on why I think this resolution is so important, and  it is an inflection point that Chairman Keating and so many of us feel  with regard to global history. As I said, this is a test of our time as  to whether or not  [[Page H6702]]  democracies will be willing to stand together for the common values we  share, for the rule of law, for a rules-based economy, and for all the  freedoms we cherish that we share in common.   Simply stated, this is a choice about good and evil. For the first  time in eight decades, we have seen a full-scale land invasion in  Europe instigated, resulting in an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.   Think about this. The alliances that we have created post-World War  II, beginning with the Marshall Plan and then NATO and the European  Union, and everything that has followed since that, have resulted in  one of the largest peacetime periods in Europe in over 1,000 years.  Think about that.   What we have also, obviously, learned the hard way is that these  unconscionable crimes committed against the Ukrainian people, I think,  constitute a form of genocide.   I said in a speech several months ago that, in my view, after Bucha,  President Putin should be considered a war criminal along with all who  have been involved in these horrific crimes that we have seen committed  and see daily--hospitals, schools, apartment buildings, innocent  children, and citizens being attacked.   The brave men and women of Ukraine and their leadership, President  Zelenskyy, have reminded us once again that we who share the common  values of democracies must stand together.   We are at the front lines in this fight for freedom, and Ukraine  today is sadly paying the heavy price. But they have demonstrated an  importance to all of us of unity in the face of Putin's catastrophic  and violent attack. They have demonstrated why our support matters, and  it does. Crucially, they have proven that without a doubt, as was said  by my colleague and friend, Congressman Hoyer, democratic values will  prevail over an authoritarian ideology. That is why we must ensure that  Putin fails in his war of aggression.   Finland's and Sweden's historic and sovereign decisions to apply for  NATO membership create an echo of transatlantic unity on this issue,  and this resolution represents strong bipartisan support here in  Congress for Ukraine.   I thank my colleagues on the other side. Chairman Keating leads this  NATO resolution in response to the alliance, our transatlantic  alliance, which has stood up to the aggression of Russia in the face of  unprecedented, unprovoked aggression, and we have come together to do  the right thing.   To my colleagues in the Senate, who will be taking up these articles  of accession shortly, I urge you to demonstrate full support for  Finland and Sweden to join the NATO alliance.   As to my colleagues in this Chamber, I urge your support, as well,  for this resolution so that the United States Government can speak with  one voice, one voice in the resolute support of our Nordic allies and  unwavering support for Ukraine's fight for freedom and their democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
