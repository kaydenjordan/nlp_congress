 Madam Speaker, 54 years ago tonight one of the great  tragedies in our Nation's history occurred in my hometown of Memphis,  Tennessee. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.   In Memphis, there is great love for Dr. King and his dream. He had  given the ``I've Been to the Mountaintop'' speech the night before in  Memphis. And tonight, at this hour there is a memorial service at the  National Civil Rights Museum, which was constructed at the Lorraine  Motel where he was staying and where he was slain.   In Memphis, a phoenix has risen from the ashes. The National Civil  Rights Museum celebrates Dr. King's life and all the pioneers that  preceded him and were after him in fighting for civil rights and civil  justice in this Nation.   I share with all in mourning the death of Dr. King 54 years ago but  take great pride in Memphis having the National Civil Rights Museum and  encourage people to visit.                            ____________________
