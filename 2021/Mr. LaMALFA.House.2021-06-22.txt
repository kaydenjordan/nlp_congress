 Madam Speaker, in June of last year, the city of  Portland, Oregon, cut $16 million from their police budget, and shut  down a unit of the police which was designed to reduce violence in the  city.   As Republicans predicted--and a lot of others--this has not led to  peaceful streets. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has been forced to ask for  more funding for police.   This is not unique to Portland. Major cities across the U.S. have  seen a spike in violent crime as they cut police budgets. Last year,  New York City defunded their police department budget by about $1  billion, or 9.2 percent. The result? Murder is up 17 percent; shooting  incidents are up 77 percent. In Los Angeles, homicides are now up 23  percent after a defunding.   How much more evidence will the defund the police movement need  before they admit they were wrong and innocent people are indeed being  killed? On top of this, prosecutors in some areas are refusing to  charge perpetrators and putting criminals back on our streets to  continue their crimes.   We must push back against these radicals who want to defund the  police and stop this crime wave.                            ____________________
