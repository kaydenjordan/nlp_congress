 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a  remarkable constituent from Rochester Hills, Michigan, Rosaria ``Sara''  Martinico.   She joined so many other brave women to help the war efforts during  World War II as one of the original Rosie the Riveters. She served the  country by working on B-17 bombers for a good portion of the war.   Last Sunday, Mrs. Martinico reached a milestone. Born in 1910, during  the William Howard Taft Presidency, she celebrated her 108th birthday  in Rochester Hills alongside her 2 daughters, 8 grandkids, 18 great- grandkids, and 12 great-great-grandchildren. That is five generations  of family.   Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to represent such an outstanding and  honorable person, and I would like to wish Mrs. Martinico a very happy  108th birthday and thank her for her outstanding service as the  original Rosie the Riveter.                            ____________________
