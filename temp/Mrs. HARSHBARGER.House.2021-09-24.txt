 Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the  unconscionable abortion on demand until birth act.   As a mother and a grandmother of two precious grandsons, I am  sickened by the attempt to allow abortions on demand until birth.   As a pharmacist, I have seen countless women who struggle with  infertility issues. All they ever wanted was to be able to give birth  and to have and to hold those precious children of their own.   Contrast this with what is happening today.   My colleagues across the aisle, many of them are women. They are  trying to make it easier to abort for reasons like bad timing or  inconvenience. Under this law, every State will be a late-term abortion  State, where abortions can be performed until birth for any reason with  no accountability or protections for women.   This is heartbreaking to me, and it is heartbreaking to all of the  women I have helped overcome fertility issues over the years.   I have talked to many women who have had abortions. Most of them  think about that baby they aborted every day. What would their baby  look like? What would their baby have grown up to be? Whom would they  have married? How many children would they have had? How could that  unborn baby have affected our country or our world?   There is such a sorrow that follows these women post-abortion. I want  those women who have had abortions to know this: Nothing is wasted, and  there is forgiveness from a loving God.   They can make a difference today, even now, by praying. I will  continue to advocate on behalf of the right to life. I believe it is a  moral and a God-given responsibility that we protect these treasured  trusts from Heaven.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on this unmerciful  and unthinkable bill. The sanctity of human life depends on it.
