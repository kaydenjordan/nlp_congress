 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  to the process and to the resolution.   When Congress sees fit to examine its solemn power of impeachment, it  is imperative that it does so in genuine pursuit of justice: fairly,  transparently, and objectively. Anything less is unacceptable. This  partisan impeachment has fallen far short of that.   Sadly, Alexander Hamilton's prediction in Federalist No. 65 has come  true, where he warned: ``In many cases, it will connect itself with the  preexisting factions and will enlist all their animosities,  partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and  in such cases, there will always be the greatest danger that the  decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties  than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''    After years of investigations, hearings, and millions of taxpayer  dollars, Democrats found no proof that the President committed a  crime--no proof--as the vague accusations in these articles clearly  reflect.   A basic prerequisite for impeaching for ``high crimes and  misdemeanors'' is a charge that an actual crime was committed. These  empty, baseless articles expose for the American people what this is: a  desperate, partisan attempt to avenge the loss of the Democrats'  preferred candidate in 2016.   We must respect American voters and reject these articles.
