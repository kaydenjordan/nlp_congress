 Mr. Speaker, I am indeed proud to introduce the LWCF  Parity for Territories and D.C. Act, with the support of all six  Members of the House representing our U.S. territories and the District  of Columbia as original cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill gives parity to Guam, the other  territories, and D.C. in annual funding from the Federal Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   Current law requires the territories and D.C. to split six ways a  single State's annual LWCF allocation. This bill fixes this disparity  by providing a full, State-equivalent share of Land and Water  Conservation Fund funding for each territory and D.C. every year.   This additional funding is needed to improve our public parks, our  outdoor sports fields, and our community open spaces on Guam and the  other territories, especially as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands rebuild from recent hurricanes.   So, Mr. Speaker, I encourage our colleagues to cosponsor this  bipartisan legislation and support the LWCF parity for the territories  and the District of Columbia.                            ____________________
