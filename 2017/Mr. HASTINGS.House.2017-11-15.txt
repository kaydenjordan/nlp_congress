 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the gentleman from Texas, my good  friend, yielded me the customary 30 minutes for debate.   Once again, my Republican colleagues have decided that the best way  to govern is through obfuscation, mathematical gimmicks, and a rushed  and closed process, and all in an obvious attempt to hide from the  American people the devastating consequences the Republican-led tax  scam bill will have on working class and middle class Americans.   Just so we are all crystal clear on this point: Who, under this tax  bill, benefits on the backs of working and middle class Americans? Yes,  folks, it is the wealthy corporations and the richest among us.   The Republican majority has made lofty claims about their bill,  saying that because of this legislation, everyone gets a tax cut, jobs  will be plentiful, and that the economy will grow exponentially and  astronomically. The White House has even said that the tax cuts would  result in each household receiving an additional $5,000 to $9,000 in  annual income.   Mr. Speaker, it seems there isn't anything that Republican leadership  won't say to get their own Members to vote for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, they can make all the claims they want, but the actual  tax experts who have analyzed this bill paint a much darker picture  about the consequences of this legislation. According to one  nonpartisan tax analysis, today's Republican plan will result in a tax  increase for 38 million middle class Americans.   Not to worry, though. While these hardworking middle class families  have to deal with the tax increase, the richest 0.2 percent of  Americans will get a windfall. In fact, the estate provision in this  bill alone would allow the heirs of just 11 ultrawealthy individuals to  pocket up to $67.5 billion. An estimated 80 percent of the tax cuts in  this legislation will go to wealthy corporations and the richest 1  percent.  [[Page H9271]]    Mr. Speaker, even more astonishing, a recent analysis by the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that this Republican  tax bill could trigger automatic cuts to mandatory spending to the tune  of $136 billion, including $25 billion in the Medicare cut.   Let that sink in, because actually what is getting ready to happen  here is we are going to have a $1.5 trillion deficit, and these deficit  hawks on the other side are then going to turn right back around and  say that we need to pay for these things. Then watch out Medicare,  Social Security, and Medicaid, because that is the objective, in my  view, in the first place.   In order to cut taxes for the ultrawealthy and corporations, my  Republican colleagues are not only raising taxes on the middle class,  but are now potentially triggering a $25 billion cut to Medicare.   If this inequity were not staggering enough, Americans also have to  keep in mind that today's Republican tax giveaway to corporate America  and the ultrawealthy is not only on the backs of the middle class, but  also future generations, as this bill will explode our national debt by  an estimated $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.   Not surprisingly, Republicans are making the tired excuse that these  cuts will pay for themselves. If they did, then we would have the  easiest jobs in the world. Just cut taxes, and magically we will have  even more revenue to pay for the important needs of our country. That  sounds a lot like the old trickle-down-which-never-worked economics. It  sounds that way to me, and we all know that as far as economic theories  go, that one was and is a complete and total dud.   Mr. Speaker, to summarize the majority's attempt to overhaul our Tax  Code for the first time in 30 years: they raise taxes on middle class  Americans, cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, and  manage to explode the debt all at the same time--all this while also  leading the most closed Congress in history and shutting out Members of  Congress who represent nearly half of the American people.   Hear that, America: a lot of your Representatives had no opportunity  to say or do anything regarding the measure that we are discussing.   Mr. Speaker, let us step back and really get a full view of how  callous this bill is for our Nation by looking at how the bill treats  middle class Americans versus its treatment of the ultrawealthy and  corporate America.   Under this Republican tax scam bill, a working class schoolteacher  who buys supplies for his or her students would not be able to deduct  that expense, but a corporation that buys supplies for itself would be  able to use such a deduction.   Under this Republican tax bill, a middle class homeowner would see  their property tax deduction capped at $10,000, but a corporation would  not face the same cap.   Under this Republican tax bill, if a worker was forced to relocate  for his or her job--footnote there, including the military--because the  company moved or, in the case of the military, they were relocated, he  or she would not be able to deduct that moving expense; but if a  corporation decided to relocate, even to relocate overseas, it will be  able to deduct its moving expense.   Mr. Speaker, the list goes on. But we shouldn't be surprised. As the  old adage goes, bad process makes for bad policy.   Not since the Republicans' failed attempt to strip healthcare away  from millions of Americans have we seen a process that is this bad.   Take, for example, the last time Congress passed major tax reform  legislation in 1986 and what that process looked like. During that  effort, the Ways and Means Committee held a month of public hearings  and took testimony from over 450 witnesses.                                time  1300    The legislation before us now has had no--zero--public hearings and  testimony from no--zero--expert witnesses.   During the last tax reform overhaul, the Ways and Means Committee  spent 26 days marking up the framework of the legislation. This time  around, Republicans spent only 4 days marking up the legislation.   The 1986 legislation framework was released a year before it was  passed in the House. In contrast, the framework for this bill was  released less than a month before they started today's process of  jamming their final bill through the House. There were no hearings and  no amendments made in order. From start to finish, there was less than  a month of actual consideration.   Much like the majority's rushed healthcare processes that produced an  abysmal, destructive bill that would hurt working class Americans, this  rushed process has produced a tax bill that benefits corporations and  the wealthiest Americans, all while managing to raise taxes on the  middle class and adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit.   Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is lurching from one bad bill to  the next with speed--not thoughtful policy--seemingly being the only  goal. It begs the question: What is the rush?   As a matter of fact, I don't even think we need a tax bill of this  consequence. According to them, the economy is roaring, unemployment is  low, interest rates are low. So what is wrong with certainly leaving  the wealthy in the category that they are in?   Why are my Republican colleagues setting an arbitrary deadline of  passing a tax bill by Thanksgiving, instead of focusing on thoughtful  policy and getting the substance right in a bipartisan fashion?   Everyone agrees that we need to do something about the Tax Code.  Democrats have been ready to work with Republicans on this effort, but  have been shut out of the process at every turn. Why?   The only logical conclusion is that this has nothing to do with  policy and everything to do with politics. It has nothing to do with  helping the middle class, but instead is a callous political maneuver  aimed at salvaging a stalled and ever-failing Republican agenda.   We are about to end the year with nothing having been done of  consequence. Mr. Speaker, don't take my word for it. This conclusion is  not based on my own opinion. Some of my Republican colleagues have  admitted as much.   When asked about the need to move on to tax reform quickly, one of my  esteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle was heard to say:  ``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever call me  again.' ''   Likewise, on the other side of the Capitol, one Republican has stated  that, if the Republicans fail on tax reform, just as they did on  healthcare, financial contributions will stop.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think politics should dictate our efforts to  reform something as significant as the Tax Code. Our guiding light  should be to help working folks get a leg up. The only way to do that  is to work in a bipartisan, deliberate manner, hearing from experts and  the American people, as they did in 1986, and not as my Republican  friends have done this time around, spending a mere 3 weeks, with no  hearings, no bipartisan efforts, simply to give us something done  before Thanksgiving.   That approach only gets you what we have here before us today: a bill  that, in my opinion, does more harm than good to middle class Americans  and puts our country further into debt.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch), a member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), a member of the Ways and Means Committee. He  happens to be a Democrat, so he didn't have much input here. He is the  distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax  Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last night, I pointed out to my colleague from Alabama,  whom I greatly admire, that he has a number of people claiming medical  expense deductions who won't be able to do so under this tax measure.  The number of them, in fact, is 22,052, and the total amount claimed  under medical expense deduction by them previously was $186 million.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Polis), a distinguished colleague who I sit next to on the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is like old home week from the Rules  Committee people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), a good friend who used to serve on the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, like I said, it is old home week here with  the Rules Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor), another former member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), who served in the Pennsylvania Legislature  and was chair of appropriations. He really understands this stuff.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), a real champion and a mentor of  mine.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), my good friend.   (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I will go home this week and tell people I  voted against this horrible bill. And I will wonder if the last speaker  would go home and tell the 11,249 people who utilize $131 million in  medical deductions who will not have that under this bill,  understanding that it could be different if they chose.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Krishnamoorthi), a newfound friend and a rising star.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  am prepared to close and would advise the chairman of that regard.   Mr. Speaker, a new Quinnipiac poll out yesterday shows the American  people aren't falling for the Republican tax scam. Only 25 percent  approve of this plan, just 16 percent think it will reduce their taxes,  and only 24 percent said the Republican plan will help the middle class  the most.   Mr. Speaker, we should listen to the American people, throw this  dangerous plan in the trash can, where it belongs, and let's work  together on a bipartisan plan to help all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer  an amendment that will prohibit any legislation from limiting or  repealing the State and local tax deduction, which prevents millions of  families from being taxed twice on the same income.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    First, my Republican colleagues attempted to jam an  abhorrent healthcare bill through Congress. They failed. After that  failure, they moved on to today's attempt to jam an abhorrent tax bill  through Congress. For the sake of middle and working class Americans, I  hope my Republican friends ultimately meet defeat once again.   Mr. Speaker, we set the record with this particular measure of 51  closed rules in this session, the most closed rules in the history of  Congress. What that means is a lot of the Representatives who had good  ideas, more than 100 of them that offered amendments last night, were  unable to be heard because of closed rules.   After this closed, disgraceful process, this Republican majority has  presented, in this instance, a piece of legislation that skews tax cuts  in favor of the ultrawealthy and rich corporations.   Now, let's make it very clear. Wealthy people shouldn't be  disrespected for their wealth, but I don't know any wealthy people who  are knocking down my doors, saying that they need a few more thousand  dollars. But I know a lot of poor people who need a few hundred  dollars, and this particular measure is not doing many of the things  that would allow for them to be able to get on that last rung of that  ladder and lift themselves up.   I heard the gentleman say a rising tide lifts all boats. They had the  Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show,  [[Page H9277]]  the largest one in the world, the week before last. All those yachts  were lifted, but those little dinghies with the people fishing out in  Lake Okeechobee were not lifted one doggone bit by this particular  measure.   This bill does so on the backs of middle and working class people and  future generations.   With this bill, the former deficit hawk Republican majority would add  $1.5 trillion to the debt while potentially triggering $25 billion in  cuts to Medicare. I might add that is where they are headed. Look out  Medicare, look out Social Security, look out Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the underlying bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
