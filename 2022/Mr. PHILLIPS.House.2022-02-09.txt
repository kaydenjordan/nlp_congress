 Mr. Speaker, Minnesota is known for our winters. Most  think we endure them, but the truth is, we celebrate them. From ice  fishing to pond hockey to skiing, we love our snow and ice.   That is why I rise today to honor the 23 Minnesotans representing  Team USA at this year's winter games.   Despite a population of under 6 million people, Minnesota sent more  athletes to the Olympics than 49 of our 50 States and 61 of the 91  nations at the Olympics.   Five of those athletes hail from the district I represent,  Minnesota's Frozen Third, including Jake Brown, Brock Faber, Dani  Cameranesi, Grace Zumwinkle, and Kelly Pannek.   This is the first winter games in history to rely on almost 100  percent artificial snow, and if climate change continues to accelerate,  few cities in the world will have enough snow to host future Winter  Olympic Games.   Countless jobs in my district rely on snow and winter, like those at  Strata Systems, which helped design the sleds for our luge team, and  Polaris, the iconic snowmobile maker. We need to keep the North cold  all around the world, and I invite my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to help us do so.                            ____________________
