 Mr. President, in a few short hours, we will vote on the  motion to proceed to the House Republican healthcare bill. I will have  more to say on the matter prior to the vote.   At the moment, no one knows the plan that is being cooked up in the  Republican leader's office, but it seems to be his intention to do  whatever it takes to pass anything, no matter how small, to get the  House and Senate Republicans into a conference on healthcare.   Surprisingly, I have heard that my friend, the junior Senator from  Kentucky, will vote yes on the motion to proceed. He announced it  himself. It is true he will likely get a vote on the motion to repeal  without replace, but surely he knows that will fail. Why then would the  junior Senator from Kentucky--a man who has preached the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act root and branch, a man who proselytized that  Republicans should stop at nothing short of full repeal--why would the  junior Senator from Kentucky vote on the motion to proceed knowing he  will not get what he wants? It is because, I believe, he and some of  the others in this body know that if the Senate manages to pass  something to get to conference in the House, the likely compromise in  the conference is either a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act or  something close to it. It will certainly mean drastic cuts in Medicaid,  huge tax cuts for the rich, no healthcare for those with preexisting  conditions, and millions and millions losing healthcare, particularly  in our poorer and more brutal States. That is the only thing our  Republicans have been able to agree on.    The hard-right Freedom Caucus in the House would never accept a  Republican bill that only repeals a few regulations in the ACA but  leaves much of it in place. No, they want full repeal, and, at minimum,  deep cuts to Medicaid, huge tax breaks for the wealthy, and millions in  every State in this Nation losing their healthcare.   To my Republican friends who have repeatedly said that full repeal  without replace would be a disaster and to my Republican friends who  have opposed the deep and drastic cuts to Medicaid, I say: Don't be  fooled by this ruse. A vote in favor of the motion to proceed will mean  deep cuts to Medicaid, maybe even deeper than in the House bill. It  will mean people with preexisting conditions will be left high and dry.  It will mean huge tax breaks for the wealthiest of Americans. It will  mean millions will lose their coverage.   So with all the complaining, why are we here at this late moment?  Because even the House bill was too drastic for many of the Members  here, and it is now being ignored on this motion to proceed, and  because we all know the ruse that is going on. The ruse is this: Send  it back to the House; then, we will see what they send us. We know what  they will send us. We may not know every detail. It will either be full  repeal without replace or something far too close to that, and all of  the work and all of the anguish that so many of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle have shown in the last several weeks will be  wasted because they know darn well what is going to happen when there  is a conference.   There are no Democratic votes in the House. The Freedom Caucus calls  the shots. They will either ask for full repeal or something very close  to it. Make no mistake about it. A vote in favor of the motion to  proceed this afternoon will be a permission slip to slash Medicaid,  hurt millions, and give huge tax cuts for the wealthy--something the  vast majority of Americans in every State, a large percentage of  Republicans and Trump voters, abhor.   One last plea to my colleagues: Do not fall for the ruse that the  majority leader is putting together. We know what is going on. We all  know. Our constituents will not be fooled--oh, no. We on this side are  not fooled--oh, no. I hope my colleagues who, out of compassion and  care for the people in their States, have made such a fuss up to now  will not be fooled either.            Comments of the President on Attorney General Sessions    Mr. President, in recent days, President Trump has gone out of his  way to undermine his own Attorney General, his first supporter--what  has been reported to be his best friend in the Senate. He has tweeted  scathing criticism of Attorney General Sessions and chastised him  publicly for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and several  other perceived failures, in the eyes of the President.   We should all take a moment to think of how shocking these comments  are on a human basis. This is the first person who stuck his neck out  for Donald Trump and who was with him through thick and thin. Now, even  if the President has disagreements with him--which I think are ill- founded and self-centered and wrong--you don't ridicule him in public-- someone who is your close friend. That speaks to character.   But I would like to speak to the major issue before us, which is  related. It is clear that President Trump is trying to bully his own  Attorney General out of office. How can anyone draw a different  conclusion? If President Trump had serious criticisms of his Attorney  General, why not talk to him in person? Why air his grievances so  publicly? He wants him out. Here is the danger. Many Americans must be  wondering if the President is trying to pry open the Office of Attorney  General to appoint someone during the August recess who will fire  Special Counsel Mueller and shut down the Russia investigation.   First, let me state for the record now, before this scheme gains  wings, that Democrats will never go along with the recess appointment  if that situation arises. We have some tools in our toolbox to stymie  such action. We are ready to use every single one of them at any time,  day or night. It is so vital to the future of the Republic.  [[Page S4167]]    Second, I cannot imagine that my friends on the Republican side,  particularly in the Republican leadership--my friend the majority  leader, who I have great respect for, and Speaker Ryan--would be  complicit in creating a constitutional crisis. They must work with us  and not open the door to a constitutional crisis during the August  recess.                                Sanctions Bill    Mr. President, on one last item, I know there is a lot going on  today, but I just want to mention one item from the House of  Representatives. Later, the House is going to take up and, hopefully,  pass with near unanimity a sanctions bill that includes strong  sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. It is critical that  the Senate act promptly on this legislation.   I will work with the majority leader, as I have in recent weeks, to  ensure its swift passage so we can get it to the President's desk  before we leave for recess.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in a short time, we will vote on the  motion to proceed to debate the House Republican healthcare bill.  Several months into this new process, with Republicans in the majority  in both Chambers, the American people have not been treated to a high- minded debate or to much debate at all.   The very first action of this Congress was for the majority to pass  reconciliation instructions on healthcare--a process which has locked  out Democrats from the very beginning. The very first thing this  Republican Congress said to the American people is that healthcare is  going to be a partisan project, undertaken by Republicans and  Republicans alone. Right out of the gate, Democrats were locked out.  The majority leader elected to forge a bill in secret and bypass the  committee process entirely--no public hearings, no open debate, no  opportunity for the minority to amend the bill or even to read it  before it emerged from the leader's office. Their plan all along was to  keep their bill hidden for as long as possible, evade scrutiny, hide  the truth from the American people, and then jam the bill through in  the dead of night on a party line.   Now, here we are, after so much cloak-and-dagger legislating, about  to vote on proceeding to a debate on one of the most important issues  of our time--one-sixth of the economy and tens of millions' health and  even lives affected without knowing exactly what we will be debating  on. Perhaps nothing could sum up the process that has gotten us here  quite as well as this. The best the majority leader has been able to  cook up is a vague plan to do whatever it takes to pass something-- anything--to get the bill to a House and Senate conference on  healthcare.   My colleagues, plain and simple, it is a ruse. The likeliest result  of a conference between the House and Senate is the full repeal of the  Affordable Care Act or something very close to it. It will, certainly,  mean drastic cuts in Medicaid, huge tax cuts for the wealthy, no help  for those with preexisting conditions, and tens of millions losing  healthcare, particularly in poorer and more rural States.   The hard-right Freedom Caucus in the House would never accept a  Republican bill that only repeals a few regulations in the ACA but  leaves much in place.   I would say to my colleagues, particularly those on the other side of  the aisle who have heartfeltly fought hard for not cutting Medicaid  drastically, for keeping preexisting conditions, for not giving tax  cuts to the rich while you are cutting healthcare for the poor, do not  go along with this motion to proceed, because you know and I know what  it will lead to. All of the things that you have been trying to avoid  will emerge from that conference, and you will hurt the people of your  States dramatically.   We all know what is happening here. The leader could not get the  votes on a full repeal because it is so damaging to America. He could  not get the votes even on his own bill. Instead, the plan is to come up  with a proposal that is simply a means to repeal, a means to dramatic  cuts, a means to getting us in conference, and we all know what the  result of that conference will be.   I would plead one last time with my friends on the other side of the  aisle--and I know you have sincerely tried to modify and change  things--to turn back. We can go through regular order. We want to work  with you. We know that the ACA is not perfect, but we also know that  what you have proposed is much worse. We can work together to improve  healthcare in this country. Turn back now before it is too late and  millions and millions and millions of Americans are hurt so badly in  ways from which they will never, ever recover.   I yield the floor.
