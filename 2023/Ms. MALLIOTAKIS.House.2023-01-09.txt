 Mr. Speaker, at a time when we should be tightening  our belts, Democrats plan to spend $80 billion on 87,000 IRS agents,  doubling the size of the department.   This is meant to nickel-and-dime, audit, and harass America's small  businesses and families, who they know cannot afford the legal fees to  fight this army.   Mr. Speaker, 87,000 IRS agents but we only have 20,000 Border Patrol  agents and an unprecedented crisis with terrorists, convicted  criminals, and illegal immigrants crossing, in addition to fentanyl. We  only have 5,000 drug enforcement agents to stop traffickers who are  peddling this poison to our kids, the number one killer of young  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, 87,000 IRS agents is more than twice the size of the FBI  and more than the entire staff of the Department of Justice.   We know that our colleagues on the other side love taxes, spending,  Big Government, and bureaucracy, but the American people don't. That is  why we should be voting ``yes'' on this legislation today.
