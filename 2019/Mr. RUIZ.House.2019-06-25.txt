 Mr. Speaker, today the House will vote on legislation to  provide our immigration agencies the humanitarian resources they need  for children, women, and families. However, that is not enough when  this administration has argued in court that children in CBP custody do  not need soap, toothbrushes, or blankets as basic necessities for  hygiene.   This bill funds items and resources for a dysfunctional system that  treats children and families inhumanely. It does not create  humanitarian standards that will change behavior, and it will not meet  the humanitarian needs of children and families.   We need to pass my legislation, the Humanitarian Standards for  Individuals in CBP Custody Act, a comprehensive, public health approach  to address the basic humanitarian needs of children and families under  CBP's custody and responsibility.   Why? Why are these humanitarian standards needed? Because, when I  visited the border, I saw open toilets and crowded cells without  privacy. I saw one latrine for 200 individuals. I saw babies who were  dirty and didn't have diapers and didn't have free access to water and  formula. Because six children have now died while in the custody and  responsibility of CBP, under their supposed TEDS standards.   Why? Because my bill will define what a health screening is. It will  say that a health screening is an interview, a questionnaire, and it  will have vital signs, an actual physical examination, and consultation  with an emergency care provider. The appropriations bill doesn't.   My bill will say that high-priority individuals, upon detention,  within 3 hours, must have a health screening. The appropriations bill  doesn't.   My bill says that there needs to be emergency care backup for every  individual who has a healthcare screening. The appropriations bill  doesn't.   In terms of water, my bill will say that every adult will, at least,  have free access to 1 gallon of water. The appropriations bill doesn't  give those metrics.   It says that there should be one closed, private, functioning toilet  per 12 men or 8 women. The appropriations bill doesn't.   It says that individuals should have the ability to bathe once a day.  The appropriations bill does not.   In terms of shelter, an individual should have 2 meters squared of  space. Right now, they are piled on top of each other. The  appropriations bill will not change that practice.   It says that temperatures should be kept within a humane range.  Currently, they are keeping them in very, very cold rooms, interrupting  their sleep, which decreases their immune system and makes them prone  to more illnesses and mental health disorders.   The appropriations bill does not require them to allow the children  to sleep 8 hours.   The appropriations bill does not say that they need to keep  temperatures in a humane range.   In terms of food, my bill says that an adult should have, at least, a  minimum of 2,000 calories a day. The appropriations bill doesn't. We  are just funding a lot of food, and we already know that children are  given frozen burritos.   My bill will say that a pregnant woman or a child under 12 years old  or the elderly should have age-appropriate food and age-appropriate  calories per day. This appropriations bill does not enforce those  behavioral changes.   So, today's vote is a desperate bill for a desperate situation. But,  don't be fooled that this bill is going to meet the humanitarian needs  of women and children at the border. Don't be fooled into thinking that  we should pat ourselves on the back and walk away thinking that this  problem is over or that children and families will be treated  humanely--not when an administration is arguing that toothbrushes and  soap are not needed for basic hygiene for children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a vote on my bill, and I urge my fellow  Representatives to support my bill, the Humanitarian Standards for  Individuals in CBP Custody Act, to bring humanity back to our treatment  of women, children, and families seeking asylum and prevent the  needless loss of life.                            ____________________
