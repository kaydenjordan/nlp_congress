 Madam Speaker, the first and most important job of the  Federal Government is protecting its citizens. From day one, President  Biden, who campaigned as the unifier in chief, has made record  unilateral decisions to compromise the security of our country and  undermine the rights of the American people.  [[Page H337]]    In his flood of executive orders, President Biden has already stopped  deportation, lifted travel restrictions from terrorist countries,  halted border wall construction, empowered sanctuary cities, weakened  asylum policies--I am running out of breath, Madam Speaker.   I welcome all freedom-loving and law-abiding citizens who want to  make a better life for themselves in this country, but we must respect  the sovereignty of this country, we must respect the rule of law, and  we must always respect the American people's safety first.                            ____________________
