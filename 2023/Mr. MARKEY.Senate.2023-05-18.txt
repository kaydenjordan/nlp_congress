 Mr. President, I rise today to unmask one of the major  players behind the Republican debt limit brinksmanship.   With renewable energy outcompeting fossil fuels, Big Oil is worried  that its oil well has run dry and wants to keep pumping the American  people dry for all that they are worth. So the oil and the gas industry  is running its tried and true playbook with Speaker Kevin McCarthy  taking the snap as their quarterback.   The Republicans all voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. They  turned away from its provisions to create a livable future, its  millions of new, clean energy jobs, its investments in environmental  justice communities. The only thing Republicans haven't turned away is  the billions of dollars in new investments unleashed in their States  and districts from this landmark legislation, with $150 billion in  investments already announced across the country because of the IRA,  because of the largest climate bill in American history.   I have seen Republicans on TV fearmongering about the Inflation  Reduction Act, but I haven't seen a single Republican turn down any of  those $150 billion or any of those jobs, or all those benefits for  those communities in red States.   But the fossil fuel industry itself is actually scared that something  might happen to their season of record-shattering profits. They are  scared that utilities will finally wake up and realize that installing  new renewables is cheaper and more cost effective than running existing  coal plants.   Natural gas plants are also set up to go the way of the dinosaur. In  fact, we won't have to dig up any more dinosaurs in order to create the  fuel. Building new solar and wind, instead of new natural gas, could  save American energy customers nearly $30 billion on their energy  bills.   Renewables are outcompeting fossil fuels. The average levelized cost  of energy for coal and gas is much higher than wind and solar. How  much? Well, coal is nearly double the cost of solar. Natural gas is  almost 1.5 times more costly than wind. And this is not accounting for  the new IRA subsidies, the new climate bill subsidies from last year.   These statistics are the real fear of fossil fuel executives. These  clean energy gains threaten Big Oil's massive bonus and even bigger  profit margin.   Big Oil more than doubled its profits in 2022, making nearly $220  billion in that year alone and paying out $110 billion to their  investors. Those are windfalls made on the backs of American family  budgets. Republicans say they care about budgets, but the only budget  they are committed to protecting is the one of the big oil and big gas  industry across our country.   That is why attacks on clean energy and climate action are on the  Republicans' debt limit and budget agendas. That is why Republicans are  attacking tax credits for the American-made clean energy that makes us  more secure, saves money, and protects our health and our climate. That  is why Republicans are reportedly trying to jam a Big Oil and Natural  Gas wish list masquerading as a so-called permitting package through  debt limit negotiations, instead of going through regular order on the  floor of the United States Senate.   The Republican permitting package would give fossil fuels even more  of a leg up while their repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act's clean  energy provisions would hold our clean energy future hostage.  Republicans don't want to use the budget to give students and children  a head start. They want to give Big Oil a headstart over clean energy.   So just as we cannot default on our national debt, we cannot default  on our debt to society. That means we cannot default on climate action  for a livable future.   Climate should be off the table in debt limit negotiations--no repeal  of the Inflation Reduction Act, no provisions to fast-track fossil fuel  permitting in our country.   We know we need to build a clean energy future, but the Republicans'  permitting proposal wouldn't help build on the IRA. It would bury the  IRA. The Republicans' permitting priorities are a carbon bomb designed  to unleash fossil fuels to push renewable energy off the grid, to stall  the progress that was made.   Their priorities, apparently, don't include fixes for the electric  transmission issues in this country, when transmission is what could  improve reliability and deliver affordable energy to all Americans. In  other words, they want to have permitting for more oil and gas  drilling, but they don't want to fix the transmission issues. None of  that is on the table that the Republicans are asking for in order to  solve the problem of moving renewable energy across the country.   Permitting should be about transmission lines, not pipelines.   And combined with their attacks on the Inflation Reduction Act, their  priorities will devastate our climate, take away good-paying jobs, and  cost Americans billions of dollars.   The Inflation Reduction Act is projected to save households more than  $1,000 every year by 2030. It is projected to create 550,000 clean  energy jobs, and it is projected to give us a fighting chance at  meeting our climate targets. We cannot throw that away.   We have a climate test for success--jobs, justice, and emissions  reductions. That is our climate test. If we negotiate on the Inflation  Reduction Act and permitting as part of debt limit conversations, we  will fail that climate test, and the end result will be an  environmental and climate catastrophe.   Climate action and clean energy progress can't be held hostage in  this debate. Fast-tracking fossil fuels while attacking renewables is  and always has been and always will be the Big Oil game plan. We can't  play their game. We can't play with our future.   We cannot default on our debt, and we also cannot allow the  destructive Republican budget to be implemented. That is why I have  joined some of my Democratic colleagues in calling on President Biden  to utilize his authority under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution,  which clearly states:         The validity of the public debt of the United States . . .       shall not be questioned.    It is in the U.S. Constitution. Using that authority would allow the  President and the United States to continue to pay the country's bills  on time and without delay. It will ensure that we prevent a potential  global economic catastrophe.   But let's not forget that it is the Bush and Trump tax cuts for the  wealthy that are the driving force behind the debt that the Republicans  are now crying crocodile tears over.   Speaker McCarthy says he wants to limit, save, and grow. What he and  the Republicans really want to do is to cut, gut, and slow: cut taxes  even more for the wealthy and corporations; gut programs like Medicaid,  Head Start, Meals on Wheels, Pell grants, and community health centers;  and slow the pace of clean energy and climate action--wind, solar, all- electric vehicles, and battery storage technologies that will  revolutionize energy consumption in our country--all to protect Big Oil  buddies, gas buddies, all across the country.   A livable future and affordable clean energy are budget realities. We  can save money for American families and save our planet at the same  time.  [[Page S1727]]    The IRA's climate provisions and fossil fuel permitting should be off  the table during this negotiation.   We cannot allow the well-being of American families or our planet to  be held hostage to a radical, rightwing, conservative House of  Representatives that is out of control in terms of its relationship  with reality.   I appreciate the attention of the Senate.   I yield the floor.
