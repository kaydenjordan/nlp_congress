 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R.  3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   I am particularly proud of a provision that I worked on with Speaker  Pelosi to improve a provision in the original bill that caps out-of- pocket spending for Medicare part B beneficiaries at $2,000 annually.   My proposal further protects seniors by allowing them to pay these  out-of-pocket costs in equal installments over 12 months, rather than  all at once.   The final version of H.R. 3 also includes a bill I introduced earlier  this month, H.R. 4669, the Maximizing Drug Coverage for Low-Income  Seniors Act.   This is smart and innovative legislation that will ensure seniors are  enrolled in the best Medicare part D program for their individual  needs, not just randomly assigned.   This will save them money on out-of-pocket costs as well as improve  access to their needed medication, while also generating savings in  overall Medicare spending that can be reinvested in the program.   Madam Chair, in the richest Nation in the world, every American  should be able to afford their life-saving medication.   I urge my colleagues to support this groundbreaking legislation and  to vote for H.R. 3.
