 Mr. Speaker, last week's healthcare disaster  was instructive because, in the end, it was never really about health  care at all.   Your plan was a thinly-veiled scheme to deliver a massive tax cut to  health insurance executives and their cronies. UnitedHealthcare is one  of America's largest, private healthcare insurance companies.  UnitedHealthcare is under investigation for defrauding Medicare and the  Federal Government out of billions of dollars. UnitedHealthcare's CEO  made $66 million in 2014--one man, one salary, in 1 year--$66 million  under investigation for defrauding the Medicare program; and your bill,  on page 67, in seven simple words, would have rewarded this potentially  criminal behavior with a massive tax cut.   Mr. Speaker, Americans, on average, will pay more than $10,000 per  person for health care this year. Let's use the enormous leverage of  the Federal Government to drive down those costs and to drive up  quality for all Americans.                            ____________________
