 Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Budget  Committee, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Congressman  Mick Mulvaney to be the next Director of the Office of Management and  Budget, or OMB.   Like many of President Trump's other nominees, my opposition to  Congressman Mulvaney has less to do with his extreme rightwing economic  views than it has to do with the hypocrisy and the dishonesty of  President Trump. The simple truth is that Congressman Mulvaney's  record, in many respects, is the exact opposite of the rhetoric that  then-Candidate Trump used in order to get votes from senior citizens  and working families. Now, if Candidate Trump had run his campaign by  saying: I am going to cut your Social Security benefits if elected  President, well, you know what, Congressman Mulvaney would have been  the exact person that he should bring forth as OMB Director. If  President Trump had said: I am going to privatize your Medicare; vote  for me because I am going to privatize your Medicare--if that is what  he had campaigned on, then Congressman Mulvaney would have been exactly  the right choice for OMB Director. If Candidate Trump had said: I want  to devastate Medicare, I want to make it harder for poor people to get  the healthcare they need, and I want to threaten the nursing home care  of millions of senior citizens--if that is what Candidate Trump had  said, Mick Mulvaney would have been exactly the right and appropriate  leader for the job.   But those are not the words, that is not the rhetoric, and those are  not the ideas that Candidate Trump raised during his Presidential race.  In fact, Candidate Trump said exactly the opposite on May 7, 2015. We  are all familiar with Mr. Trump's tweets. Here is a tweet that he made  on May 7, 2015:         I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state       there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare and       Medicaid. Huckabee copied me.    So you have Candidate Trump making it very clear that there would be  no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   On August 10, 2015, Trump said:         [I will] save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security       without cuts. [We] have to do it. . . . People have been       paying in for years, and now many of these candidates want to       cut it.    On November 3, 2015, Mr. Trump said:         I will save Social Security. I'll save medicare. . . .
