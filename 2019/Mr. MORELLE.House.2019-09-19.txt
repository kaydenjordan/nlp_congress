 Mr. Speaker, every student deserves the opportunity to  pursue higher education and achieve their goals, but for too many  Americans, especially low-income students or families in poverty,  unexpected financial emergencies like sudden medical costs,  transportation issues, or loss of employment can prevent them from  completing coursework or even cause them to drop out of school  altogether.   A broken-down car or a brief hospitalization should not derail a  lifetime of hard work for any student. That is why I am proud to have  partnered with Congresswoman Katie Hill to introduce the CAMPUS Act,  which provides emergency grants to students in need so they can  continue their coursework and stay on track academically. This  legislation provides a critical safety net for low-income students and  brings us one step closer to making higher education accessible and  affordable for all young people.                            ____________________
