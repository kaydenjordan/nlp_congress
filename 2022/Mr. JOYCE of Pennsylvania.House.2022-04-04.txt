 Madam Speaker, since President Biden took  office, more than 2 million illegal immigrants have been apprehended at  our southern border.   Now, Title 42, a key portion of our border security, is set to expire  at the same time that our Border Patrol agents are preparing for a  record surge of illegal border crossings.   The American people cannot afford President Biden's and proclaimed  border czar Vice President Harris' failed border policies.   On President Biden's watch, we have seen record-high levels of  cocaine, methamphetamine, and fentanyl being trafficked into our  communities from across our open southern border. These drugs are  deadly, and over 93,000 Americans have died of overdoses just in the  past year. These policies have made Americans less safe, and they have  made our communities less secure.   In his fiscal year 2023 budget, President Biden failed to even  mention our border security crisis, a border security crisis that  affects each and every American community. The truth of the matter is,  President Biden has no plan to secure our border. President Biden has  no plan to secure our communities.   Without the proper funding for our Border Patrol agents, this surge  in illegal border crossings will lead to a humanitarian crisis, a drug  crisis, and a national security disaster.   President Biden has failed to address the challenges that we are  facing today on our southern border. It is time to keep our communities  safe. It is time to fund our border security. It is time to reauthorize  Title 42, and it is time to secure our southern border. Today, the  actions must occur.                            ____________________
