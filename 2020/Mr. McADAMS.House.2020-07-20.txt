 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, when Utahns learned about recent high-level  meetings on resuming nuclear weapons testing, it rang alarm bells.  Thousands of Utahns are still dealing with trauma inflicted by bombs  exploded from decades past leaving a legacy of illness, suffering, and  death. Why would we ever go down that path again?   For 24 straight years, the Department of Energy and DOD continue to  certify the safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear weapons  stockpile without the use of nuclear explosive testing. That was  confirmed to still be the case at the end of June.   My amendment prohibits the use of funds to prepare for or conduct any  explosive nuclear weapons test that produces any yield.   My amendment does nothing to interfere with our stockpile program. It  allows for national security preparedness consistent with zero-yield  standards. Nuclear clouds must never again threaten the health and  safety of those living downwind.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), the distinguished chair of the House Committee  on Armed Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 20  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus), the congresswoman who has written the book on  nuclear testing.    Mr. Speaker, explosive nuclear testing is not necessary  to ensure that our stockpile remains safe, and nothing in this  amendment would change that.   Explosive nuclear testing causes irreparable harm to human health and  our environment and jeopardizes the U.S. leadership role on nuclear  nonproliferation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
