 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Raskin for his kind words and his  work on this. I particularly thank Mr. Sensenbrenner for his work. He  has been the sponsor of this since it was introduced. I was an original  sponsor since it was introduced as well. It makes a lot of sense for us  to do this and get DNA evidence and use science to the advantage of the  American people, and particularly in law enforcement where we have  problems in identifying suspects and proving guilt on occasion, and  also exonerating the innocent. DNA is a perfect tool as it exonerates  the wrongfully accused and gets the person who has committed the crime.   I am honored to be a part of this. This bill, while a small part in  the big picture, shows that Democrats and Republicans can work together  to get some things done. I appreciate the honor to be able to sponsor,  and I appreciate Mr. Sensenbrenner's work.
