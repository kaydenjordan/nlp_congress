 Madam Speaker, the history of farming and  agriculture in the United States is unquestionably one-sided. Black  farmers have lost over $300 million worth of farmland in the last  century due to a history of widespread discrimination, which has  further exacerbated the wealth gap in America.   According to the most recent Census of Agriculture, there are 3,222  Black farmers in my home State of Louisiana. Nationally, Black farmers  only represent 1.4 percent of more than 3 million farmers. Since the  1920s, the number of Black farmers has dropped from nearly a million to  roughly around 50,000. Today, they own just around half of a percent of  our farmland.   The Justice for Black Farmers Act confronts our history and will  establish a brighter future for the underserved by reforming the USDA,  providing debt relief, and creating a land grant program to encourage  new generations of Black farmers. This bill seeks to correct persistent  injustices and restore the land base that Black farmers have lost  unjustly.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Adams and Senator Booker for  their leadership on this issue.                          Mass Shootings in America     Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy  heart, a heavy heart because our country consistently turns a cheek,  turns and looks away at the violence, the mass shootings that seem to  be reported every day in the news.   It is simply not enough for my colleagues to come to the floor and  offer condolences and well-wishing and prayer. While all those things  are wonderful, in 2023 the people deserve action.   Our young people that are visiting with us deserve to be in a  classroom that is safe. Our friends who worship in churches and  synagogues deserve to be able to worship in peace. People who walk  their dogs or jog along the park should be able to do so without fear  of a mass shooting. People should be able to go to a concert or a party  and enjoy relative safety.   In this month alone: March 27, Tennessee, mass shooting; March 27,  Wisconsin, mass shooting; March 26, Pennsylvania, mass shooting; March  26, Minnesota, mass shooting; March 26, Arkansas, mass shooting; March  26, Louisiana, mass shooting; March 25, Louisiana, mass shooting; March  25, New York, mass shooting; March 25, North Carolina, mass shooting;  March 25, Illinois, mass shooting; March 24, Louisiana, mass shooting;  March 23, Maryland, mass shooting; March 21, New Jersey, mass shooting;  March 21, South Carolina, mass shooting; March 20, Wisconsin, mass  shooting; March 18, Ohio, mass shooting; March 18, Illinois, mass  shooting; March 18, Texas, mass shooting; March 15, Oregon, mass  shooting; March 14, Alabama, mass shooting; March 13, Texas, mass  shooting; March 12, Texas, mass shooting; March 11, New York, mass  shooting; March 11, Washington, mass shooting; and March 10, Florida,  mass shooting.   That is just this month alone. Let that sink in. At what point do we  put people over profit? At what point do we challenge the gun makers to  say: Listen, we are not talking about taking away your constitutional  right to bear arms. We are talking about sensible gun control that will  save these young people that are visiting us today, that will save  these visitors that come to see their government at work.   This is not Republican or Democrat. This is about the survival of our  communities. This is about the survival of our young people. This is  about providing resources to make sure our communities are safe. Stop  it. Stop protecting NRA and their profits and start protecting our  children and their lives.                            ____________________
