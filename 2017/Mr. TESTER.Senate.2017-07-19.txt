 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Air  Force Capt. Robert ``Bob'' Holton, a lifelong resident of Butte, MT,  and an intrepid Vietnam veteran.   To Bob's family, on behalf of myself, my fellow Montanans, and my  fellow Americans, I would like extend our deepest gratitude for Bob's  service to this Nation.   Bob was born on April 8, 1941, in Butte, MT. He graduated from Butte  High School in 1959, a talented musician who excelled at the saxophone,  clarinet, and piano.   Bob continued his education at the University of Montana, where he  earned his pilot's license and served as an outstanding military cadet  with the ROTC. Bob went on to marry his high school classmate, Diane  Eck, in 1962, and graduated with a business degree in 1965.   Bob proudly served his country during the Vietnam War, flying an F4  Phantom as an interceptor alongside his comrade Maj. William Campbell,  a fighter-bomber. Their deployment took them near the border of Laos  and Vietnam, where their plane was downed in enemy fire on January 29,  1969.   This disaster sparked a tragic mystery for the Holton family, who  have been unable to find the site of the crash, nor fully confirm its  outcome. The circumstances gave them no closure and left Bob's family  in pain.  [[Page S4080]]    Bob's memory has been tirelessly honored, with folks across the U.S.  wearing MIA bracelets in recognition of his unfinished story. The  National League of Families and the Air Force have continually  supported the Holton family's search for Bill, for which they are  endlessly grateful.   Now, 48 years after the crash, Butte's only Vietnam war Missing in  Action has been found. Bob's remains have been recovered and will  finally be returned to his home State. His life and light will be  honored Saturday, July 22, in a ceremonial burial at the Sunset  Memorial Park.   For Bob's family, the actions by so many have helped provide closure.  On behalf of a grateful Nation, I want to thank them for their hope and  continued support for Bob and all of our veterans who are missing in  action.   Let us now take a moment to recognize the life of Capt. Robert Holton  and the legacy he left behind. We deeply appreciate his service to the  American people.                            ____________________
