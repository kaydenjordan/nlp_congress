 Mr. Speaker, innocent children shouldn't pay the price  for the President's cruel immigration agenda. Steamrolling the facts  and the law, he has implemented policy after failed policy, playing  catch and release with his own cabinet.   As the President ratchets up his threats to close the border and cut  aid to Central America, thousands of migrants are fleeing their home  countries to seek refuge in the United States.   I recently met with the editors of the book ``Solito, Solita''-- Alone, Alone--a collection of oral histories that tells the stories of  young refugees in their own words. I rise today to read excerpts from  one of them, Gabriel Mendez.   His story begins in a poor, dangerous neighborhood in the capital of  Honduras. He says:         When I was just a boy of 7, my cousins raped me for a long       time--for a year. They raped me at the river, where they       collected water--and in my own home.        . . . Some of my fellow students who belonged to the maras       took weapons to school. I told the mareros that I didn't want       to bring weapons to school. I was afraid of them. They also       wanted me to bring drugs into school. I didn't want to do it,       so I left that school. . . . Now the maras were looking for       me--to kill me. They were asking my neighbors if they knew       me.    When Gabriel was 14, he convinced his mother, who was living in San  Francisco, to pay a coyote $6,000 to bring him to the United States.  Gabriel recounted the horrors he encountered along the way.         . . . they kept us locked in a house with eight other       people for a week. We kept moving. Many days passed without       eating or drinking water.        We were taken to the river, where there was a raft. We       crossed the river into the United States and moved to a safe       house. We spent 4 nights in the desert, including the night       of my 15th birthday.        . . . We came upon another group of people who'd been       traveling 2 days ahead of us. A young man, under 18, had       perished from exposure and lack of water and food. I got       stuck in some barbed wire in the desert. The coyote kicked       me, ripping my flesh to set me free.        . . . We got to Los Angeles on December 17, 2013. If we       didn't pay more money, they threatened to cut off our heads       and all kinds of horrible things. My mom said she'd give them       another $50, and they piled another 8 people in a van and       brought us to San Francisco.    In San Francisco, Gabriel feared for years he would be sent back to  Honduras. With the support of his mother and an attorney, he was  eventually granted asylum.   Now he is a student at the University of California at Berkeley, with  dreams of becoming a lawyer himself.  [[Page H3348]]    In an essay, he wrote:         My experience of childhood sexual and domestic abuse has       shaped my dreams to become a lawyer, to defend victims and       fight for children's rights around the world. My immigration       lawyer was a role model for me because she listened to my       experiences. I want to continue studying to help children       feel protected by the law . . .    If we want to understand the why behind mass migration, we need to  listen and learn from these stories.   As Members of Congress, it is our job to uplift these voices and use  them to fix a broken immigration system. We must insist on due process  for asylum seekers; we must insist on humane treatment of our families;  and we must insist on aid to Central America to stem the drivers of  migration.   Together, we can prevent more children from risking their lives.
