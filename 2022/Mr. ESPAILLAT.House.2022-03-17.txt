 Madam Speaker, yesterday, the House of Representatives  heard from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy as he painted a haunting  picture of pain inflicted on the Ukrainian people and the war crimes  being waged on Ukrainians trying to keep themselves and their families  safe.   It is clear, Madam Speaker, that Vladimir Putin has committed war  crimes by violating international norms, including the Geneva  Convention, in his violent and bloody war of conquest on Ukraine.   I, along with Congressman   David Cicilline, have introduced a war  crimes resolution, H. Res. 964, calling on the global community to hold  Vladimir Putin and the Russian Government accountable for these war  crimes.   Russian forces have used explosive weapons with wide-range effects  near schools and populated areas, hitting them with missiles, rockets,  and heavy artillery. It is clearly a violation of the Geneva Convention  to target civilian and cultural sites.   On March 1, a Russian airstrike hit Freedom Square in Kharkiv,  killing civilians and injuring dozens of innocent people.   On March 1, a Russian missile hit the location of the Babyn Yar  Holocaust Memorial site, a place where thousands of Jewish people were  killed between 1941 and 1943.   On March 3, 47 civilians were killed when Russia hit two schools and  apartment buildings, injuring countless others. This is clearly a  violation of the Geneva Convention.   We have also witnessed the attack of medical units. On March 9,  Russian forces bombed a maternity and children's hospital in the city  of Mariupol. The world watched as a pregnant woman was being carried  lifeless from the hospital wreckage on a stretcher. Both she and her  child passed away.   The World Health Organization has also confirmed several attacks on  healthcare centers in Ukraine, causing countless deaths and injuries.   It is clearly a violation of the Geneva Convention to target nuclear  facilities. On March 3, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy accused Russian  forces of nuclear terror as Russian tanks shot at the nuclear blocks at  a nuclear power station in Ukraine.   More than 3 million people are now refugees who have fled Ukraine,  Madam Speaker. Each day in Ukraine, more than 70,000 children have  become refugees. That accounts for 55 children fleeing the country  every minute.   There have been over 2,000 civilian casualties in the country, and  thousands upon thousands of people have  [[Page H3783]]  been injured. Yesterday, the International Court of Justice  overwhelmingly found that Russia must immediately suspend its unlawful  military invasion of Ukraine.   It is clear, Madam Speaker, that Vladimir Putin and the Russian  Government have committed war crimes. They have invaded a sovereign  nation and are attacking the very core of liberty and democracy. We  must hold them accountable and do all we can to support the brave  Ukrainians fighting for their freedom.                            ____________________
