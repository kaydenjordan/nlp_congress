 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee  on the Judiciary being tied on the question of reporting, I move to  discharge the Senate Committee on the Judiciary from further  consideration of the nomination of Holly A. Thomas, of California, to  be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit from the Committee  on the Judiciary.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Now, Madam President, I want to begin today with some  celebrations.   Recently, our dear colleague and friend Senator Jack Reed of Rhode  Island cast his 8,000th vote as a Senator--a remarkable milestone for  one of the most beloved and respected Members of this body.   A lifelong Rhode Islander, a graduate of West Point, and the dean of  the Rhode Island congressional delegation, Senator Reed is one of  America's best examples of doing politics and public service the right  way: no fuss, no nonsense--just results.   Over the years, he has been a mentor, a friend, and an invaluable  resource for countless Members on both sides of the aisle. Few in this  Chamber can match his expertise on matters of national defense,  veterans affairs, and the military. I would also add that the same can  be said about matching his attendance. Over the years, he has missed  just 38 votes on his way to 8,000--good for an attendance percentage of  99.5 percent. Wow.   As the Senate has undergone change over the years, Senator Reed has  remained the same: focused on Rhode Island, focused on our country,  focused on keeping this Chamber working on behalf of the American  people. We are lucky to call Senator Reed our colleague and friend.   And so congratulations, Jack, on this milestone, and here is to 8,000  more votes to come.                                 Nominations    Madam President, last night, I filed cloture on 22 of President  Biden's nominees who, to date, have been pointlessly stalled by  Republican obstruction--22. We are going to work until they are all  confirmed by this Chamber, and we may need to add more.   In past years, many of these nominees would have sailed through with  consent and cooperation, but, this  [[Page S9220]]  year, a handful of Republicans have hijacked the rules of the Senate to  slow the process down. It is cynical; it is entirely pointless; and  worst of all, it is damaging--seriously damaging--to our national  security.   This is the consequence of Republican obstruction. We are going to  work on getting these nominees confirmed as long as it takes, and we  could be back here in the near future doing this whole thing over  again.   For all the tortured logic we hear coming from the other side for why  these nominations remain frozen, the fact is that my Republican  colleagues who are holding these nominations up are deliberately making  the American people less safe and making it harder for the  administration to address the national security and economic challenges  that face our Nation.   It is unacceptable, and we are going to work to confirm these  important nominees.                                Voting Rights    Now, on voting rights, Madam President, as we continue working to  bring the Senate to a position where we can move forward on Build Back  Better, Senate Democrats have spent the past few weeks engaged in a  separate discussion on addressing another critical and urgent  priority--protecting the right to vote and safeguarding our elections.   Yesterday, I joined with a number of my colleagues in detailed  conversations about how the Senate will get voting rights done in time  for the 2022 elections, including advancing the Freedom to Vote Act and  the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.   In State after State, Republican-led legislatures are approving the  most draconian voter registration laws that we have seen since  segregation, and they are doing it on an entirely partisan basis. Let  me repeat that. Republicans at the State level are passing the most  egregious restrictions on voting rights that we have seen since  segregation, and they are doing it on an entirely partisan basis.   Senate Democrats are working to find a path forward to respond to  these attacks by passing legislation like the Freedom to Vote Act and  the Voting Rights Advancement Act. Part of that conversation involves  finding ways to restore the Senate so it can, once again, work as it is  supposed to, as it has worked for generations before the gridlock of  the past decade or so.   These conversations are ongoing. The fight to protect voting rights  is far from over in the Senate. Just because Republicans will not join  us to defend democracy does not mean that Democrats will stop fighting.  This matter is too important not to act, even if it means we must act  alone to get the Senate working.                         Tribute to Sara Schwartzman    Madam President, finally, a farewell--as anyone who has been here a  while knows, the U.S. Senate is more than just the sum of its elected  Members. Making this institution work is a daunting and awesome  responsibility, and while the spotlight often falls on the men and  women who stand behind these desks, this place would quickly unravel  without the staff who work their magic behind the scenes.   Today, we say goodbye and thank you to one of those incredible  staffers, Sara Schwartzman, who will soon leave the Senate to pursue an  opportunity with NASA.   I join with all of my colleagues and with the rest of the Senate  staff in saying thank you, Sara, and best of luck on the road ahead.   Thirteen years ago, Sara came to the Senate as a legislative support  clerk with the executive clerk's office. Over the years, she climbed up  the ranks, thanks to her skill and to her dedication, eventually  becoming bill clerk in 2015.   For those who don't know, the bill clerk is one of the first  gatekeepers for all new bills and resolutions that are introduced to  the Senate. It is the bill clerk who brings order and sequence to the  actions of this body, recording the Senate's legislative activities,  assigning numbers to every bill and resolution, cataloging the status  of each.   In good times, this is difficult and precise work. But over the last  few years, as we all know, Sara fulfilled her duties in the midst of a  global pandemic and has had to adapt in unprecedented ways. Through it  all, she never missed a beat.   After 13 years, Sara deserves her gleaming sendoff as she pursues her  next adventure in life. And as we say goodbye, we hope she knows she  can always call this place home, and we will forever be grateful for  all she has done to make this Chamber come to life.   So to Sara, thank you. Thank you for everything. We will miss you,  and we can't wait to see what the future has in store for you.   (Applause.)   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the following nominations en bloc: 622, 629, 630, 595, 596,  607, 608, and all the nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Army,  Foreign Service, and Space Force; that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.
