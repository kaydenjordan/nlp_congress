 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 380, I was recorded  as yea. It was my intention to be recorded as nay. Therefore, I ask  unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my vote since it will  not affect the outcome.    Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
