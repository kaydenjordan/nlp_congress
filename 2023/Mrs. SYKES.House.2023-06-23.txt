 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Morgan Hallett, a  rising senior from Norton High School, as Ohio's 13th Congressional  District Champion of the Week.   Morgan recently won her second straight Division II State title in  the discus, blowing out her competition with a record-breaking throw of  170 feet, 8 inches.   After putting on a brilliant athletic display, which Morgan and her  dad fondly call the ``Mo Show,'' Morgan now has the longest throw in a  Division II State meet and is tied for the longest throw in Division II  history.   Morgan has established herself as a truly exceptional student  athlete, and her hard work, dedication, and commitment to excellence  are truly outstanding.   Morgan's achievements have made her family, teammates, coaches,  school, and community proud. Once again, I congratulate Morgan Hallett  on her second straight Division II State title in discus and the best  of luck as she reaches her third next year.                            ____________________
