 Madam President, it is an honor to join my colleagues of  both parties, starting with Reverend Warnock and five--two other  Democrats and three other Republicans on the floor today to read one of  the great pieces of writing of the 20th century, Dr. King's letter from  the Birmingham jail.   I thank Senator Warnock and Senators Murkowski, Republican from  Alaska; Toomey, Republican from Pennsylvania; Padilla, our new  colleague from California, a Democrat; Senator Cortez Masto, in her  fifth year in the Senate, a Democrat from the Presiding Officer's home  State of Nevada; and Senator Cassidy from Louisiana, a Republican. They  will be joining me today for this annual tradition.   Our former colleague, Doug Jones from Alabama, began this reading 3  years ago. I joined him on the floor. He asked me last year after his  election to carry on this tradition in the years ahead. I am honored to  take that responsibility because Dr. King's words are as powerful, as  beautiful, and as relevant as ever.   One of many, many, many incisive things that Dr. King said was that  we live in a 10-day world where people forget about public events 10  days later. Not so for him, not so for his words, and certainly not so  from the letter from the Birmingham jail.   Twelve years after Dr. King's assassination, when Cesar Chavez was  thrown in jail, Dr. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, said:         You cannot keep truth in . . . jail. . . . Truth and       justice leap barriers, and in their own way, reach the       conscience of the people.    She said that is what Dr. King said, were his words.   In April 1963, Dr. King was detained at the Birmingham jail for  leading a series of peaceful protests and boycotts. The goal was to put  pressure on the business community to end discrimination in hiring for  local jobs.   Some White ministers from Alabama had taken issues with his boycotts.  They supported civil rights, they said. They told him to slow down,  don't move too fast, and don't demand too much all at once. Dr. King,  of course, as we know, rejected that premise.   That is what this letter is all about. It is about demanding justice  now. We can't wait around and hope the problems in families' lives will  solve themselves. It is up to all of us as citizens, as leaders, as  members of our churches and our communities to get to work.   Dr. King made that point more eloquently and more persuasively,  certainly, than I can, but we will read this note--we will read his  words. Senator Warnock will begin, followed by Senator Murkowski and  four other Senators.   Senator Warnock.    Madam President, continuing the reading of the letter from  the Birmingham jail.         I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and       Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few       years I have been gravely disappointed with the white       moderate.        I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the       Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is       not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but       the white moderate, who is more devoted to ``order'' than to       justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of       tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice;       who constantly says: ``I agree with you in the goal you seek,       but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action''; who       paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for       another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of       time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a       ``more convenient season.'' Shallow understanding from people       of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute       misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance       is much more bewildering than outright rejection.        I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that       law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice       and that when they fail in this purpose they become the       dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social       progress.        I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that       the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the       transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the       Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive       and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity       and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in       nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We       merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is       already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be       seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so       long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its       ugliness for the natural medicines of air and light,       injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure       creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of       national opinion before it can be cured.        In your statement you assert that our actions, even though       peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate       violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like       condemning a robbed man because his possession of money       precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like       condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to       truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by       the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock?       Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God       consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God's will       precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see       that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is       wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his       basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate       violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the       robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject       the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for       freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother       in Texas. He writes: ``All Christians know that the colored       people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is       possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has       taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish       what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to       earth.'' Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception       of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is       something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure       all ills.        Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either       destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that       the people of ill will have used time much more effectively       than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in       this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions       of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good       people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of       inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men       willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard work,       time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social       stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge       that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to       make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending       national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is       the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of       racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.        You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At       first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would       see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began       thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two       opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of       complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of       long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect in       the sense of ``somebodiness'' that they have adjusted to       segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who,       because of a degree of academic and economic security and       because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become       insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is       one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close       to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black       nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation,       the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim       movement. Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the       continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement       is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have       absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded       that the white man is an incorrigible ``devil.''        I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that       we need emulate neither the ``do nothingism'' of the       complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black       nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and       nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the       influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became       an integral part of our struggle. If this philosophy had not       emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am       convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced       that if our white brothers dismiss as ``rabble rousers'' and       ``outside agitators'' those of us who employ nonviolent       direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent       efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and       despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist       ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a       frightening racial nightmare.     Madam President, I thank my colleague from the neighboring  State, Senator Toomey, for joining us. I thank all of my colleagues who  were here today, Senators Warnock and Murkowski, Toomey and Cassidy,  Cortez Masto, and Padilla for joining to read these powerful words  today.   This is about as diverse a group as we could assemble in the U.S.  Senate, a group of seven Senators who really reflect our country today:  a reverend in a Black church, the son of a union electrical worker, a  doctor from the Deep South, an Independent born in the Alaska country,  a son of Mexican immigrants, a daughter of Mexican Americans who made  this country home for a century, and a son of the Midwest whose father  came from Mansfield, OH, and mother came from Mansfield, GA.   We come from different backgrounds, and we disagree on many things,  but we love this country--all seven us--and we know we can do better  for the people who make it work.   Dr. King and the civil rights leaders of his generation did more than  just about anyone to push this country to live up to our founding  ideals and make the dream of America real for everyone.   Protesting, working for change, organizing, demanding our country to  do better--those are some of the most patriotic things all of us can  do. That is Dr. King's charge of this letter:         Progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability.    That is our charge. I think about the campaign Dr. King was waging  when he was assassinated. You can't forget he was martyred in Memphis  when fighting for some of the most exploited workers in this country,  sanitation workers. He understood the deep connection between workers'  rights and civil rights. As he put it, ``What does it profit a man to  be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter, if he doesn't earn  enough money to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee?''   Until all Americans have the dignity they have earned, Dr. King's  work will remain unfinished. That means paying all workers a living  wage, giving them power over their schedules, providing good benefits  and safety on the job, letting them, if they choose, organize a union.  That means all workers should get a fair share of the wealth they  create. It means recognizing the dignity of communities that Black  Americans have built over generations.   They were denied wealth and investment. The schools were underfunded.  Banks wouldn't lend. Highways tore down businesses and tore apart  neighborhoods in the Presiding Officer's largest city in Milwaukee, as  they did in the largest cities in my State: Columbus, Cleveland, and  Cincinnati.   In the face of all of that, Black Ohioans and people all over the  country built businesses and churches and vibrant neighborhoods and  loving families. But they should not have to do it on their own.   As we emerge from this pandemic and we work together to build a  stronger country out of this crisis, we can't make the mistakes of the  past. We learned in the Banking, Housing Committee this week that  President Roosevelt's collective bargaining laws and investment in  housing with the creation of housing agencies created a middle class  for Americans who look like me but didn't create a middle class for a  whole lot of other Americans.   Think about the infrastructure investments that we made in the 1930s  and the years after World War II. Think how we created millions of new  homeowners and grew the middle class. Think of how we expanded economic  security, with overtime and workers compensation and Medicare and  Social Security.   There is no reason we can't do that again, the same thing again, but  this time we bring along everyone. We invest in all communities. We  bring us closer to the society Dr. King envisioned, where all labor--as  he would say, where ``all labor has dignity.''   I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S1922]]
