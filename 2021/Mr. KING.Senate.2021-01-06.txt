 Mr. President, Winston Churchill once said that he could do  a 2-hour speech extemporaneously, but a 10-minute speech took immense  preparation. I don't know what he would have said about a 4-minute  speech.   We are a 240-year anomaly in world history. We think that what we  have here in this country is the way it has always been.   It is a very unusual form of government. The normal form of  government throughout world history is dictators, kings, czars,  pharaohs, warlords, tyrants. And we thought 20 years ago the march of  history was toward democracy, but it is in retreat in Hungary and  Turkey--goodness knows, in Russia.   Democracy as we have practiced it is fragile. It is fragile, and it  rests upon trust. It rests upon trust in facts. It rests upon trust in  courts, in public officials, and, yes, in elections.   I don't sympathize or justify or in any way--in any way--support-- that is putting it mildly--what happened here today, but I understand  it. I understand it because I saw those people interviewed today, and  they said: We are here because this election has been stolen.   And the reason they said that is that their leader has been telling  them that every day for 2 months.   We cannot afford to pull bricks out from the foundation of trust that  underlies our entire system. And I agree with Governor Romney that the  answer to this problem is to tell people the truth--is to tell them  what happened.   It is easy to confront your opponents. It is hard to confront your  friends.   It is hard to tell your supporters something they don't want to hear,  but that is our obligation. That is why the word ``leader'' is applied  to people in jobs like ours. It is not supposed to be easy. It is  supposed to be something that we take on as a sacred obligation, and if  people believe something that isn't true, it is our obligation to tell  them: No, I am sorry, it isn't, just as Senator Portman just said, as  Mike Lee just said: I am sorry we can't do this here. We don't want to  do this here. This is a power reserved to the States, not to the  Congress.   And I agree with the majority leader. I think this is one of the most  important votes any of us will ever take.   On December 1, 1862, Abraham Lincoln came to this building. He came  to this building in the darkest days of the Civil War. He was trying to  awaken the Congress to the crisis that we were facing, and he didn't  feel that they were fully and effectively engaged. He ended his speech  that day with words that I think have an eerie relevance tonight. Here  is what Abraham Lincoln said:         Fellow-[Americans], we cannot escape history. We of this       Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite       of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance,       can spare one or another of us.    And here are his final words:         The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in       honor or dishonor to the latest generation.    The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down in honor or  dishonor to the latest generation.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Maryland.
