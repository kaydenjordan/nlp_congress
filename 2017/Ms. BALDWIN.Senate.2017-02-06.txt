 Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me  in opposing the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education.  Simply put, Betsy DeVos is completely unqualified to serve as Secretary  of Education in this great Nation.   Many others share this view. I have heard from thousands of parents,  teachers, and other citizens of Wisconsin who are concerned about the  future of our education system urging me to oppose Mrs. DeVos and  certainly opposing her vision for America's students. As of today, over  20,000 Wisconsinites have emailed me, and we have had over 7,000 phone  calls opposing the confirmation of Mrs. DeVos, and Senate Democrats are  unified in our opposition to Mrs. DeVos serving in this capacity. Even  two Senate Republicans have announced that they cannot support Betsy  DeVos. If just one more of my Republican colleagues were to announce  their opposition and were to vote no, we could do the right thing and  tell President Trump that he really needs to find a new candidate, a  new candidate for Secretary of Education who is qualified to run that  Department.   While Betsy DeVos has spent decades advocating for a particular  vision for education, she has never actually worked as a teacher or as  an administrator. Her career has involved investing hers and her  family's considerable  [[Page S717]]  wealth and using those resources to advance the privatization of our K- 12 education system. She did not attend a public school either for  grade school, high school, or college, and nor did her children. She  has never worked as a teacher, principal, professor, counselor, or in  any other formal role in our education system.   Her confirmation hearing before the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee clearly demonstrated how little she knows about  Federal education law and policy. It was startling to see her ignorance  about critical measures like the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act or the debate over growth versus proficiency as a measure  of student achievement. Betsy DeVos has demonstrated that she has  neither the knowledge nor the experience in education that would allow  her to be a successful leader of the Department of Education. Mrs.  DeVos has worked to advance a vision of K-12 education that is  fundamentally hostile to our public education system.   My home State of Wisconsin has a long and very proud tradition of  support for public education. Back at the founding of our State, we  wrote the guarantee that every child should receive a free public  education into our very founding document, our State Constitution.  Wisconsin had the first kindergarten in the United States. Wisconsin is  proud of something that we actually call the Wisconsin idea in higher  education; that the walls of the classroom should be the borders of the  State, if not the borders of this Nation or the entire world.   Mrs. DeVos's experience in education, however, has been a decades- long effort to privatize it. Her record of support for vouchers as well  as charter schools that lack adequate accountability and oversight is  very troubling and could lead to diversion of public dollars in even  greater amounts out of public education.   Regardless of any vision or experience on education, Mrs. DeVos is a  nominee with, let's say, complex and opaque finances. She has a very  opaque record of financial dealings and political giving, including on  matters directly related to the work that the Department does which she  seeks to lead. Given her and her family's investments in companies that  benefit directly from Federal education programs, I remain very  concerned about what we simply still don't know.   I am also troubled by Mrs. DeVos's and her family's long history of  contributing to organizations that have been hostile to the lesbian,  gay, bisexual, and transgender community, even promoting the  discredited idea that sexual orientation or gender identity can be  changed through conversion therapy.   While she told me and several of my colleagues at her hearing that  she believes all students should be treated equally, I really remain  concerned about how this long history of support for these anti-LGBTQ  organizations will influence a Department which, over the last 8 years,  has shown some tremendous leadership in supporting LGBTQ students and  parents in the education system.   The Federal Government's primary role in elementary and secondary  education is to promote equity. I am not convinced that Mrs. DeVos will  be the leader the Department needs to do just that. Congress passed the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965 as a civil rights  measure. It was designed to ensure that every student, regardless of  ZIP Code or parents' income, has access to a quality public education.   We continued that important tradition in reauthorizing this law,  which is now in the form of a very strongly bipartisan bill, the Every  Student Succeeds Act. The next Secretary of Education will have to  implement that act.   I fear that Mrs. DeVos, as a vocal proponent of State and local  control, will not be the strong voice we need to hold States  accountable for serving all students, particularly those who have been  historically left behind.   When we passed the Every Student Succeeds Act, we made sure there  were strong Federal guardrails to assure that we never forget why there  is a Federal role in education to begin with, for equity and civil  rights and to make sure that every child can succeed. Furthermore, I am  very concerned that Mrs. DeVos would not commit to robustly supporting  the Department's Office for Civil Rights or enforcing the very guidance  that protects transgender students from discrimination.   Betsy DeVos lacks knowledge about and commitment to the Federal laws  that ensure students with disabilities have access to the various  supports that they need to receive and benefit from a quality public  education.   As I noted, she has demonstrated a complete lack of understanding  about our Federal obligations to these students. I have heard from  numerous parents in Wisconsin, parents of students with disabilities  who were appalled by her inadequate answers to questions at our  education panel hearing. She was unprepared to answer questions about  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and these parents have  written to express their distress about what her filling the role of  Secretary of Education could mean for their children if she were to be  confirmed.   One Wisconsin mother of three special needs children wrote to me  about how this Federal law provided the legal rights that she needed to  advocate for them, to advocate for the best possible educational  environment for her three sons with special needs.   I heard from another mother, Melissa from Beloit, who detailed how  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act makes it possible for  her daughter, Rowenna, who has Down Syndrome and autism, to actually  thrive in a public education setting, along with her peers.   Finally, as a strong proponent of making college more accessible and  affordable, I do not believe that Mrs. DeVos has the experience or  vision that will allow her to successfully lead the Department in  supporting higher learning.   There is a student debt crisis in this country, but Mrs. DeVos  doesn't have a plan to address it and has even expressed skepticism  about a Federal role.   While she has acknowledged that there are some bad actors in higher  education, she has also refused to commit to enforcing regulations that  help students who are defrauded by dishonest schools like Corinthian  Colleges. We need a Secretary of Education who is an advocate for those  students, not one who is looking for ways to shirk that responsibility.   Despite the fact that the Department oversees billions of dollars in  grants and loans that allow students to pursue higher education, she  has expressed skepticism about any Federal role in making college more  affordable. She has even refused to oppose cuts to a program that helps  students who commit to a career in public service or to support efforts  to ensure that the value of the Pell grant keeps pace with the cost of  college.   For all of these reasons and many others, Betsy DeVos is not the  right choice for Secretary of Education. I call on my colleagues to  defeat her on the question of confirmation and to afford this new  President the chance to send us a nominee who is prepared to be an  advocate for all students and public education in this country.    Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me  in opposing the confirmation of our colleague Jeff Sessions to be  Attorney General of the United States.   I have great respect for Senator Sessions' long history of public  service, and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with him  where we have found common ground. However, Senator Sessions and I have  frequently and sometimes vehemently disagreed on important issues,  including matters like civil rights and voting rights, hate crimes  laws, immigration, and criminal justice reform.   I want to acknowledge that Senator Sessions' nomination is supported  by many, including many in the law enforcement community in my home  State of Wisconsin. It is vital that the Attorney General have a good  working relationship with the law enforcement community, and I have no  doubt that Senator Sessions will be a strong voice for law enforcement,  if he is confirmed.   But the role and the responsibility of our Attorney General is bigger  than any one group. Our Attorney General must work on behalf of all  Americans. The Department of Justice has a broad jurisdiction. So I  have also heard from over 16,000 Wisconsinites who are opposed to his  confirmation, many of whom expressed profound concerns about what it  would mean for racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, including  DREAMers, and others, were he to become our Attorney General. Hundreds  of national civil and human rights organizations have expressed their  opposition on similar grounds.   After reviewing his record, getting a chance to meet with him in my  office, and considering everything that I have heard from my  constituents, I simply do not believe that Senator Sessions is the  right choice to be Attorney General of the United States. I have that  belief for a number of reasons.   First, I am concerned that Senator Sessions will not be the  independent  [[Page S926]]  champion for the rule of law that we need with Donald Trump in the  White House. In any administration, the Attorney General's first duty  is to the Constitution and to the people of the United States. This  President has already issued a number of orders--legally questionable  orders--including one affecting our visa and refugee programs that a  number of Federal courts have already temporarily blocked. We need an  Attorney General who will ensure that the President's actions do not  run roughshod over protections guaranteed by our Nation's laws and  Constitution. I am not convinced that Senator Sessions will be that  kind of Attorney General.   Second, I do not believe that Senator Sessions will be the champion  of the civil rights of all Americans that an Attorney General must be.  The Department of Justice plays a central role in enforcing our  Nation's civil rights laws, from investigating hate crimes to  safeguarding the right to vote, to fighting discrimination against  women, racial and religious minorities, and people with disabilities.  At a time when there has been a disturbing increase in hate-motivated  crimes, discrimination, and harassment, including, particularly,  against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, and people of  the Muslim faith, it is even more important that the Department of  Justice be strong and proactive.   I have heard from constituents in Wisconsin who have faced bigotry  and hate-motivated speech in the wake of the election of Donald Trump.  Among them is a family from Fitchburg, WI, with 11 adopted children,  including children from Ghana and China.   This family received an anonymous letter proclaiming ``Trump won''  and calling them race traitors and telling them to go home. This and  other reports from Wisconsinites and, frankly, from people throughout  the United States breaks our hearts.   Senator Sessions fought against efforts to strengthen and make more  inclusive Federal hate crimes laws and criticized voting rights laws as  ``intrusive.'' He has shown hostility to the rights of LGBT individuals  and attacked the reproductive health care rights of women.   Now more than ever we need a Justice Department that places a  priority on enforcing our civil rights and voting rights laws,  proactively combatting hate violence and fighting for the equality of  all Americans. I am simply not convinced that Senator Sessions will be  the champion vulnerable Americans need as Attorney General with an  unflagging commitment to make our country a fairer and more equal  place.   Third, I believe Senator Sessions will not take a fair or humane  approach as Attorney General with regard to immigration. I was deeply  troubled by candidate Trump's ugly and divisive rhetoric on  immigration, and I am appalled by the actions that he has taken thus  far as President.   Senator Sessions was one of his campaign's key advisers on  immigration and has been a vocal opponent of bipartisan, comprehensive  reforms that would address our broken immigration system.   The Department of Justice is responsible for adjudicating immigration  cases and ensuring fairness and due process in the treatment of  undocumented individuals and refugees.   The Department also plays a key role in our national security  apparatus, helping to fight terrorism, and keeping the homeland safe.   The President's recent orders on immigration have furthered  divisions, created chaos and confusion, proven to be legally and  constitutionally questionable, and are inconsistent with core American  values. In the opinion of many national security experts, they will  make our Nation less safe, not more.   I simply do not believe that Senator Sessions, with his history of  hostility to immigration and support for this President's approach, is  the right person to lead the Department of Justice, as it discharges  its critical duties on immigration and national security.   America has made great progress over the last 8 years with an  administration that has taken seriously a shared responsibility to pass  on to the next generation a country that is more equal, not less.   All Americans deserve a strong commitment from America's top law  enforcement official to act on violence born out of hatred based on  race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any  other characteristic.   At a time when voting rights and the constitutional right of women to  make their own health care decisions are under attack across our  country, we need an Attorney General who will stay true to these  constitutional freedoms and not be driven by politics.   For me, the vote on Senator Sessions' confirmation is a moral choice.  I am guided by my strong belief that all Americans deserve equal  opportunity and freedom to pursue their hopes and dreams. I cannot  support this nomination for Senator Sessions to be Attorney General,  and I urge my colleagues to oppose him.   Now I would like to take a moment to discuss what happened last night  here on the Senate floor. Last night, the Republican leadership of this  Chamber stopped one of my colleagues from reading the words of Coretta  Scott King.   Coretta Scott King wrote a letter and a statement to the Senate  Judiciary Committee back in 1986, expressing her opposition to Jeff  Sessions' nomination to serve as a Federal judge.   Coretta Scott King believed, as I do, that the right to vote is a  fundamental right afforded to every American. It is a right that people  have lost their lives seeking and defending.   Mrs. King wrote in her testimony regarding Jeff Sessions' record:         Blacks still fall far short of having equal participation       in the electoral process. Particularly in the South, efforts       continue to be made to deny Blacks access to the polls, even       where Blacks constitute the majority of the voters. It has       been a long up-hill struggle to keep alive the vital       legislation that protects the most fundamental right to vote.       A person who has exhibited so much hostility to the       enforcement of those laws, and thus, to the exercise of those       rights by Black people should not be elevated to the Federal       bench.    Mrs. King's words matter. They matter to me, and they matter to  millions of Americans. Mrs. King's words should matter in this debate,  and they deserve to be heard. I believe it is simply wrong to silence  legitimate questions about a nominee for U.S. Attorney General, and I  hope that her words can be heard as this debate continues.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
