 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1344 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes  equally divided.  [[Page S1237]]     Mr. President, I believe that every single Member of this  body agrees that remote learning is taking an enormous toll on our  students, teachers, and our students' families, and that we need to  safely get students back into the classroom.   This amendment would ensure that educational agencies receiving  relief funds will within 30 days develop and make publicly available a  plan for the safe return to in-person instruction.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense  amendment to support an objective that we all share: getting our  students safely back in their classrooms.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
