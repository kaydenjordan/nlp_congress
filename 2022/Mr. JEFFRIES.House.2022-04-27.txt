 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5796) to amend title 35, United States Code, to establish a  competition to award certificates that can be redeemed to accelerate  certain matters at the Patent and Trademark Office, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 5796           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.           This Act may be cited as the ``Patents for Humanity Act       of 2021''.       SEC. 2. AWARD OF CERTIFICATES TO ACCELERATE CERTAIN MATTERS                     AT THE PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE.           (a) Award.--Chapter 2 of title 35, United States Code, is       amended by adding at the end the following:       ``Sec. 28. Award of certificates to accelerate certain         matters at the Patent and Trademark Office           ``(a) Establishment.--There is established a competition,       to be held not less frequently than biennially, to award       eligible entities certificates that can be redeemed to       accelerate one of the following matters:          ``(1) An ex parte reexamination proceeding, including one       appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board from that       proceeding.          ``(2) An application for a patent, including one appeal       to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board from that application.          ``(3) An appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of a       claim twice rejected in a patent application or reissue       application or finally rejected in an ex parte reexamination,       without accelerating the underlying matter which generated       the appeal.          ``(4) A matter identified under subsection (d)(4).          ``(b) Administration.--The Director shall administer the       competition established by subsection (a).          ``(c) Application.--An eligible entity seeking an award       under subsection (a) shall submit to the Director an       application, at such time, in such manner, and containing       such information as the Director may require.          ``(d) Rulemaking Authority.--With respect to the       competition established by subsection (a), the Director shall       conduct a rulemaking proceeding to promulgate rules on the--          ``(1) entities eligible to receive an award;          ``(2) process and metrics by which applications are       judged, including the criteria for selecting judges for the       competition;          ``(3) factors that will be considered in selecting the       eligible entities that receive an award; and          ``(4) additional matters for which a certificate       described under subsection (a) may be awarded.          ``(e) Promotion of Competition.--The Director shall       promote the competition through the satellite offices       established pursuant to section 1.          ``(f) Treatment as Successor.--The competition       established under subsection (a) shall be treated as a       successor to the Patents for Humanity Program (established in       the notice entitled `Humanitarian Awards Pilot Program',       published at 77 Fed.

(c) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of       sections at the beginning of chapter 2 of title 35, United       States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:         ``28. Award of certificates to accelerate certain matters             at the Patent and Trademark Office.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 5796.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5796, a bipartisan bill which  codifies a competition at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office called  Patents for Humanity.   The Patents for Humanity program highlights the ways that innovation  and intellectual property help solve global humanitarian challenges.   I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan legislation, alongside  Representative Spartz, to ensure that special recognition permanently  extends to inventors who turn their genius toward helping the world's  most needy and vulnerable.   The Founders of our country understood that society would benefit if  we incentivized creativity and innovation. That is why Article I,  Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution gives Congress  the power to create a robust intellectual property system to promote  the progress of science and useful arts.   As Members of Congress, we have often worked together in a bipartisan  fashion to carry out this constitutional mandate, as we are doing  today.   The Patents for Humanity Act simply codifies an already existing  annual competition run by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that  incentivizes the use of patented technologies for humanitarian  purposes. It is run without cost to the taxpayer, as USPTO is a fee- based entity.   The award for the Patents for Humanity competition is a certificate  to accelerate select matters before USPTO and public recognition during  a ceremony held by that Office.   Winners are selected by a panel of judges who look for inventions  that address either humanitarian needs among an impoverished population  or that further research by others with respect to humanitarian  technologies. Applications are considered in categories including:  medicine, nutrition, sanitation, household energy, and living  standards. The 2022 competition also included a category for COVID-19- related inventions.   Since its implementation as a pilot program 10 years ago, winners  have included not-for-profit organizations, startups, universities,  corporations, as well as individual inventors throughout the country.  Winning submissions have included an all-terrain wheelchair;  improvements to water purification systems and clean water storage;  rechargeable lanterns for those  [[Page H4521]]  without access to reliable energy sources; a portable, low-water kidney  dialysis machine; and an affordable and highly adjustable prosthetic  limb system. These and many other innovations have improved the quality  of life of millions of individuals.   By codifying H.R. 5796, we strengthen and recognize the importance of  this program while providing the USPTO the flexibility to continue to  improve its implementation.   In December, this bill passed the House Committee on the Judiciary  unanimously, building upon the work of Representative McBath, who  successfully led a bipartisan effort to pass the Patents for Humanity  Program Improvement Act into law last Congress, which allows award  certificates to be transferable.   Today, we go a step further by ensuring this program is a permanent  feature of our innovation system and economy.   Once again, I thank Representative Victoria Spartz for her  partnership on this legislation, as well as her leadership as it  relates to the terrible situation in Ukraine. I also thank my  colleague, Representative Issa, for his leadership as well.   The Patents for Humanity program shows how American innovation and  creativity can continue to change the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5796, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  California for his continued leadership in this area.   Once again, Congress is coming together in a bipartisan way to uplift  American innovation and innovators, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support this important piece of legislation. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3059) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to provide  for a periodic transaction reporting requirement for Federal judicial  officers and the online publication of financial disclosure reports of  Federal judicial officers, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3059         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to  [[Page H4522]]  revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S.  3059.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3059, the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act of  2021, embodies an important bipartisan effort to address an alarming  lack of transparency in the personal financial holdings of Article III  Federal judges and the conflicts, or appearance of conflicts, those  holdings can create in the cases these judges are asked to preside over  and decide.   This legislation makes incremental but necessary progress toward  accountability by building on Federal statutes that already prohibit  judges from deciding cases in which they have a personal financial  stake in the outcome.   It has been the law in this country since the 1970s that judges must  recuse themselves from any case in which they hold a legal or equitable  interest of any size in any party or property under consideration.   To help ensure that recusals occur as required, Federal law often  mandates that judges file annual reports disclosing their personal  financial interests so that the litigants, press, and the general  public can monitor and check these responsibilities.   Unfortunately, recent reporting by a Pulitzer Prize-winning  investigative reporter and a hearing by the Judiciary Committee's  Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet have  shown that the law is not working as intended. The infrequency of  judges' financial disclosures and the inaccessibility of the reports  have made actual transparency practically impossible.   When the House first passed this version of the legislation last  year, an investigation revealed that, between 2010 and 2018, over 130  Federal judges had decided cases in which they are part owners of the  parties before them. Over 60 judges have actively traded shares in  entities involved in their courthouse deliberations while their cases  were still ongoing and, in some cases, profited from these trades.   At the time, this investigation also discovered approximately 685  cases where judges should have, according to the law, recused  themselves. That number has continued to climb and now stands north of  a thousand cases. So far, judges in 836 cases have notified the parties  that the case can be reopened because the judge unlawfully failed to  recuse.   While these numbers are incredibly alarming on their own, they may  simply be the tip of the iceberg. I am sorry to say that we can expect  these numbers may continue to grow as more data becomes available and  investigations continue.   The consequences of these actions are both acute and widespread.  Failure to recuse can cause real harm to parties seeking fair and  impartial justice and leave a cloud of doubt over any decision that is  made once the conflicts are subsequently uncovered.   S. 3059 addresses these problems by requiring Federal judges to abide  by the same periodic transaction reporting laws already applicable to  Members of Congress and senior executive branch officials.   The bill also requires the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts  to create an online database of judicial financial disclosure reports  and to timely update that database with searchable, sortable, and  downloadable copies of disclosure reports as they become available so  that litigants, the press, and the public can analyze and access this  information in real time.   The two versions of this legislation, including the original version  passed by the House and the bill currently before us, S. 3059, make two  notable changes.   First, it makes it crystal clear that these reforms also cover  bankruptcy and magistrate court judges. This is a welcome change.   Second, in response to concerns raised by the courts, it allows the  Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts to take more than  180 days to develop the public website and database containing judicial  financial disclosure reports so long as the Director provides the  Congress with a date certain when the website will launch. We expect  that the Administrative Office of the Courts will request no more time  than a few more months and will not use this authority to delay  disclosure.   These simple solutions are long overdue and the product of bicameral  and bipartisan collaboration.   I thank Congresswoman Ross for her leadership in this area and  Congressman Issa for championing this legislation. I also thank my  friend from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), chairman of the Subcommittee on the  Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet, as well as Senator  Cornyn and the other Senators who worked on this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Framers, in their infinite wisdom, created a system  of government with three separate and coequal branches: Article I,  legislative branch; Article II, executive branch; and Article III,  judicial branch, three separate but coequal branches of government.   Justice Brandeis once said: In a democracy, sunlight is the best of  disinfectants. There are standards of transparency and disclosure that  already exist as relates to the Article I legislative branch and senior  officials within the Article II executive branch. Those same standards  of transparency and disclosure allowing for accountability should exist  across the three branches of government. This legislation takes a  meaningful step in that direction.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Ross for her leadership. I thank  Congressman Issa for his leadership. I thank Chairman Johnson, as well  as Senator Cornyn, and those who have worked on this important  legislation in a bipartisan, bicameral way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
