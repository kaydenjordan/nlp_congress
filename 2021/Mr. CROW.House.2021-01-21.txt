 Mr. Speaker, this waiver vote is about our long history of  civilian control of the military, a critical safeguard of our  democracy.   But let's be really clear what this vote is not about. It is not  about the rise of China or artificial intelligence or autonomous  warfare or any of the other issues that I have heard people talk about  that are really the purview of the Senate at this point in the process  and President Biden. It is also not about changing the law, because the  law remains in effect and the limitation remains in effect.   The question before this body is whether there are specific  extenuating circumstances in this moment in time to grant a waiver and  whether the heart and mind of the nominee is consistent with the spirit  of the law.   In the aftermath of January 6, we are reminded how deeply rooted  racism exists in our country. Among those who stormed the Capitol were  current and former military, a fact that highlights the national and  domestic security threat of extremism in our military.   Secretary-designee Austin is uniquely qualified with his experience  and his background to address this threat. He understands in a deeply  personal way how to deal with it. He is a man who understands that our  military is more than a formation of tanks, planes, and troops; that it  is actually a standard bearer of our values, and we are stronger when  we lead with our values and we channel the full strength of our  diversity to meet our threats.   In addition to that, nobody can stand up here and say, as we are  still under cyber attack by Russia and meeting so many other threats,  that the extenuating circumstances of the time do not merit getting a  nominee into this role immediately. That is why I rise in strong  support of Lloyd Austin's nomination and waiver, and I will be working  very hard to support him as our next Secretary of Defense.
