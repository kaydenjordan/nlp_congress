 Mr. President, there is nothing like summertime in South  Dakota.   While I am in Sioux Falls almost every weekend, August gives me the  opportunity to spend more time at home. It gives me a chance to travel  South Dakota's wide-open spaces to meet with constituents and have  important conversations that shape a lot of what I work on here in the  Senate. It is a busy month. We covered a lot of ground this August,  both figuratively and literally.   To begin with, August is fair season in South Dakota. So this year, I  made it to the Turner County Fair, the Brown County Fair, where I got  my usual Tubby burger, and the Sioux Empire Fair. Fairs showcase a lot  of the best of South Dakota, but they are an especially big deal for  our agricultural community. Whether I am serving lunch to producers at  the Sioux Empire Fair's Agriculture Appreciation Day or giving an  update on the farm bill at Dakotafest, which happens every year in  Mitchell, SD, I appreciate opportunities to hear directly from farmers  and ranchers. I do this every year, but it is especially important in a  farm bill year like this one.   Many of my farm bill priorities come directly from these discussions.  In fact, these discussions can often get into the weeds on policy. But  the bottom line from farmers and ranchers this year was really quite  simple: We need to get the farm bill done. Farmers and ranchers need  certainty that the programs they depend on will be there when they need  them. And finishing the farm bill is one of the most important things  on the agenda for the end of this year.   Agriculture is the lifeblood of South Dakota, but there is a lot more  that keeps South Dakota moving. This August, I had the chance to meet  with electric cooperatives that provide power in South Dakota  communities. I joined Midco Communications as they announced a new  broadband expansion in the Black Hills to bring faster internet to more  homes. I was on hand for the new I-29 exit 130 interchange ribbon- cutting in Brookings, SD.   Throughout the month, I also visited a lot of local businesses and  talked with business owners from across the State. I visited Showplace  Cabinetry in Harrisburg, SD, Load King Manufacturing in Elk Point,  Dimock Cheese in Dimock, Dady Drug in Mobridge, and I met with startup  leaders in Sioux Falls. We had some important conversations. It was  clear that business owners are facing some headwinds at the moment.   Business leaders in Yankton, for example, discussed challenges  arising from the workforce shortages in South Dakota. With unemployment  at 1.9 percent in South Dakota, there are workforce challenges in just  about every sector. At the Midwest Agricultural Export Summit, we  talked about the importance of trade and how the Biden administration  has put expanding market access on the back burner, unfortunately.  Business owners across the State expressed frustration with high  interest rates and higher costs. Of course, we learned last week that  inflation has ticked back up. Gas prices are on the rise as well.   And a majority of Americans say the Biden administration has made the  economy worse. Bidenomics is making life harder for families and  businesses around the country. If the President really wanted to help  working families, he would abandon the tax-and-spending agenda that has  been the hallmark of his administration for the last 2\1/2\ years.   As I travel around South Dakota, I know I can depend on South  Dakotans to keep me informed and South Dakota restaurants to keep me  fueled. Often, August becomes a bit of a tour or a bit of, I should  say, ``taste of South Dakota'' tour. Sometimes I describe it as eating  my way across South Dakota--Chislic from Waddy's in Hudson, SD; a  milkshake from Mr. Bob's Drive-In in Selby; coffee from Black Hills  Bagels in Rapid City. There is nothing like South Dakota hospitality  and a good meal to keep you going during long days.  [[Page S4570]]    As much as I love summer in South Dakota, I always get particularly  excited when summer turns to fall because there are few things I enjoy  more than cheering on South Dakota's athletes. Kids go back to school;  and high schools, college teams start competing. My grandkids' sports  seasons have begun in earnest. I made it to football games in Brookings  for South Dakota State University and Vermillion for the University of  South Dakota to support the Jackrabbits and Coyotes in a couple of big  wins as their seasons get underway.   And, of course, it is not long until pheasant season comes around  next month.   Winter, spring, summer, or fall, there is always something to look  forward to in South Dakota. I am lucky to be a son of our State.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Scott).
