 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until  6:30. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for  morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House  will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week  are expected no later than 3 p.m. On Friday, no votes are expected in  the House.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  today. This list will include a series of bills to honor our Nation's  veterans.   With Memorial Day around the corner, it is important for this House  to show our appreciation to those who have defended our freedoms,  especially the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense  of our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, next week in the House is Combating Human Trafficking  and Child Protection Week.   In addition to a series of suspensions, the House will consider H.R.  1973, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, sponsored by  Representative Susan Brooks. This bill would require prompt reporting  of suspected cases of abuse, as well as implementation of procedures  for addressing such allegations.   We will also consider H.R. 1761, the Protecting Against Child  Exploitation Act, sponsored by Representative Mike Johnson. This bill  would protect victims of sexual abuse by ensuring that predators who  send explicit content are subject to appropriate punishment.   Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is an incredibly serious issue in our  Nation. With the passage of these bipartisan bills, we will show our  continued commitment to ending this modern-day form of slavery, while  supporting and assisting all survivors.   Now, lastly, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 953, the  Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, sponsored by Representative Bob Gibbs.  My district is home to many hardworking farmers, so I know this issue  quite well. This bill will reduce red tape that makes it more costly  for farmers to protect their crops and our Nation's food supply.   In addition, the CDC reports that there are still 119 cases of  individuals with Zika in the United States and 495 cases in U.S.  territories. With the summer season approaching, this bill will ensure  we can use pesticides to control mosquitos.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to thank a true public  servant. Next week, Brian Cooper will retire from the House  Parliamentarian's Office after 35 years on Capitol Hill.   Brian is a professional in every sense of the word. Much of his work  is done behind the scenes, but it has not gone unnoticed. From  timekeeping to processing bills, to preparing for joint sessions, Brian  has made sure this body works in an orderly and fair way. It is my  understanding that even my predecessor, Bill Thomas, could not  challenge Brian's timekeeping.   On behalf of all those on this side of the aisle, we wish you well in  your retirement, Brian, and from a very grateful nation for your  service. I am sure you are ready to trade late nights on this floor for  late nights watching the Orioles play baseball.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   As my friend knows, we do expect to receive the formal budget request  from the President next week, which, as my friend also knows, is common  for the first year of a new administration.   Now, as the gentleman said, maybe this is later, but this is the  latest in the history of America that any President has had to wait for  a Cabinet, which is always helpful. He still has many more positions to  be filled and confirmed, and as that progresses, I think actions will  be able to move forward even faster.   But, as is tradition, the Budget Committee has announced its  intention to host OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, as the gentleman knows, a  former colleague here, to answer questions Members may have about the  President's budget request following its release. This will kick off  the regular order process of the committee work on crafting an FY 2018  budget resolution.   Likewise, with appropriations, the committee is looking forward to  marking up bills through regular order. Now, as soon as action is  scheduled for the floor, the gentleman will know that I will notify all  Members.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The gentleman will be happy to know that Appropriations has already  held 47 hearings dealing with FY 2018, so, as we receive the  President's budget and are able to ask questions of the OMB Director,  we will continue to move forward. But it is our intention always to go  through regular order and, in all cases, if possible, individually,  down onto the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I thank him for his long question.    Let me first answer the number of points you have made  because I want history to be written correctly.   First of all, you were shocked. I don't know why you were shocked. I  thought you were going to say you were shocked that that exact same  week, when you read the paper, 94 counties out of 99 in Iowa would have  no healthcare if ObamaCare continued to go forward. I thought that  would have shocked you.   Then, when you wanted to put dates down and talk about hearings, we  had more than 113 hearings. That is more than the number of hearings  you had for ObamaCare.   Our bill is less than 150 pages. That is thousands of pages less than  ObamaCare.   You talk of CBO. You know that CBO scored this bill, but those eight  pages of amendments you were shocked by. You shouldn't be shocked to  know the rules of the House, that you do not move a bill until the CBO  score of those eight pages is done. That will be done next week, and we  will move it right along.   But let's go on further because I do want history to be written  correctly.   We marked up this bill in three separate committees, with over 18  hours of debate in Ways and Means and over 27 hours of debate in Energy  and Commerce. We debated countless amendments in committees, from both  Republicans and Democrats, even the ones where the Democrats asked that  they change the name to have some hashtag. We spent hours on that, but  we did that because we believed that was important to you.   Now, our bill eliminates the many taxes and mandates of ObamaCare. It  gives patients enhanced tools to take control of their own healthcare  decisions, and it expands choice for Americans.   So, yes, I am shocked every day I read the paper that more Americans  are going to lose their healthcare if ObamaCare stays where it is or  that people will even pay more, because I remember the promise the  President made that our premiums would go down or we could keep our own  doctor, which so many thousands of Americans found out to be a lie.   So, Mr. Speaker, I understand politics. I understand the phrases and  the adjectives people can use, but there is no reason to be shocked  that we kept our word of what we would do for the last 6 years. There  is no reason to be shocked that the American public put a majority in  the House and the Senate and the Presidency which, I would argue for  the main purpose, that they want greater choice in their healthcare  system.   So, yes, if I go to Iowa, I go to Tennessee, those 16 counties there  that will no longer have healthcare--or what about Aetna? You didn't  even mention them pulling out of Virginia. You weren't shocked by that  either.   But you know what? Eight pages of amendments that stayed out there  for everybody to read--not more than 2,000--yes, we will wait until the  CBO finishes scoring the amendments and send it to the Senate. Yes, we  know what is in those amendments, just as everybody else had the  opportunity to read them, just as we went through the Rules Committee.                                time  1215    So there are lots of things to be shocked by, but don't ever be  shocked by: We go by the rules of the House. I  [[Page H4377]]  think you should be shocked by the number of faces, the number of  families that will not have healthcare if we did not act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am actually shocked. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but  did you actually make the argument that those 94 counties out of 99 in  Iowa pulled out just because we were bringing a bill up?   Did you actually believe the 18 out of 23 CO-OPs that were given more  than $2 billion pulled out because somehow they knew we would probably  capture the White House, too, and keep the Senate and the House? So  that is why it failed?   Or maybe those 16 counties in Tennessee that were told almost a year  ago that they wouldn't have healthcare the next year; somehow people  could look into the future, and just because a Republican took office,  that is who we are going to blame?   I know President Bush is no longer here, but do we have to continue  to put blame on others instead of having the facts?   So let's talk about a few things. Now, let's be clear of what you  asked me earlier because, I apologize, I got off--you had a lot of  adjectives out there. I wanted to make sure that I had answered them  all. But I am very confident that this bill will hit the mark for  reconciliation and it will move across the aisle over to the other  Chambers.   Now, you talk about the House, and you are going to blame us for  everything. Let's go to facts. They are not my facts. There is a recent  report from Quorum, which is a data analysis company in D.C. These are  bright, young people; a lot of them are Stanford grads. Here are the  facts, because they just went and analyzed the first 100 days:   In the first 100 days, President Trump signed 30 pieces of  legislation into law. Now, that is more than President Obama, Bush,  Clinton, or H.W. Bush signed in their first 100 days.    Only once before in history has a Congressional Review Act been  signed into law, only one. Now we have 14 overturned regulations  through the Congressional Review Act, saving Americans $3.7 billion in  regulatory cost, and 4.2 million hours in filling out paperwork.   Now, my favorite quote of this report, this House, the one we stand  in today, passed 103 bills out of this Chamber, edging out former  Speaker Pelosi's House as the most productive during the first 100 days  of a Presidency since H.W. Bush.   Now, just this week we passed the Modernizing Government Technology  Act, and I do thank my friend for his hard work on this. It is going to  upgrade government IT to better serve our constituents. So if we are  shocked, maybe that shocked you. Maybe we ought to stop playing  politics. Maybe we ought to stop blaming things that just aren't even  there. Maybe we ought to just take responsibility for where we  currently are, understand that this is the greatest Nation on the face  of the Earth, and it was ``. . . conceived in liberty, and dedicated to  the proposition that all men are created equal.''   No, we are not going to blame others for our problems. And if you  want to go along that line, I can go into all of the things that were  promised in the more than 2,000 pages of ObamaCare.   But you know what?   Today I live currently, and what I currently see is that 18 of the 23  CO-OPs have collapsed. And the current law says we are going to  penalize the people who actually paid the CO-OPs to get their  healthcare, but they have no healthcare to get.   I want to read the facts where more Americans took the penalty or the  exemption than actually signed up for ObamaCare; that prior to a bill  even passing on this floor--something we promised for 6 years--that a  number of companies pulled out because it was not working. But the  biggest shock I had all week is that somehow it is our fault.   I could not look an American in the eye knowing the knowledge that we  all have. I don't care what party you are in; you don't sit on a carpet  that has red on one side and blue on the other. This is the American  House. You know people are hurting. You know people have lost their  doctors. You know they are pulling out of these counties. Don't make up  some political spin to make yourself feel better for some vote.   We promised we would repeal ObamaCare and give people greater choice.  That is what we did. You disagree with it, then disagree with it, but  don't lay blame where it is not true.  [[Page H4378]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back.    As I said earlier, this is a technical issue. I have  all the confidence in the world the CBO score will come back, we will  meet the reconciliation number, and we will move it to the Senate.   If my colleague wants to schedule something, I will schedule with  you. We can walk the bill over there together. I believe the American  people are waiting for it.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. on Monday next and  that the order of the House of January 3, 2017, regarding morning-hour  debate not apply on that day.
