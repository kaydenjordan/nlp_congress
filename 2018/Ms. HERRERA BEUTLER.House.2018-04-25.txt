 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bishop for  yielding time for me to speak on this important legislation, and for  the work his committee has been doing to support vibrant salmon runs,  as well as protect low-cost, renewable, clean energy.    Leading scientists and Federal agencies, Northwest States, sovereign  Tribes, and notably, the Obama administration, crafted what is known as  the 2014 Biological Opinion on how the Columbia River Federal  hydropower system should operate.   The BiOp, as it is called, was developed with the utmost standards of  integrity and transparency, and importantly, collaboration.  Conservative Republicans and the Obama administration got together and  used the best available science.   Under this plan's implementation, we have seen several years of  record or near record returns of adult salmon.   The plan is working, so why are we here today?   Unfortunately, in 2016, a U.S. district judge rejected the 2014 BiOp  and ordered the Federal agencies start the process over, with a  requirement that they look at breaching the four Snake River dams.   Here is the reality. I can't express how important this hydro system  is for the entire Northwest. I have heard you couldn't match the energy  produced by these dams with six or more coal-fired power plants. None  of us want to return to that.   More recently, that same judge who issued the order issued a mandated  spill over the Columbia and Snake River dams.   Now, spill occurs when water and young migrating salmon are shot over  the dams.                                time  1515    Spill is like medicine. The right dosage can help you, but too much  can harm or even kill you. The same is true for salmon.   The judge's ruling lacked scientific backing, as Federal fisheries  scientists believe these spill mandates will provide little or no  benefits to juvenile salmon or returning adult salmon. And as we have  seen, these actions are not only in blatant contradiction to the best  available science, they are also a direct attack on ratepayers, the  families and small businesses, and the local economies who depend on  affordable, clean, reliable energy.   Ratepayers in our region spend almost up to $1 billion a year, when  all is said and done, on protecting these wild runs through science- backed spill that already takes place in other mitigation efforts. But  abusive litigation robs hundreds of millions of dollars per year of  hard-earned tax money from the pockets of my constituents. The price  tag on the judge's spill mandates are estimated to be an additional $40  million taken from ratepayers this year.   So now we find ourselves here today needing to pass H.R. 3144 for the  sake of salmon runs, for the sake of our ratepayers, and for the sake  of the environment. Again, this is not a partisan bill; in fact, it is  bipartisan, and  [[Page H3545]]  it represents restoring the Obama administration-led collaborative plan  to responsibly manage our salmon populations and hydroelectric  infrastructure.    The exact same opponents of this bill who claim  it would ``gut'' protections--I repeat, the exact same groups--asked  the court to keep the 2014 BiOp in place. So, basically, before they  opposed it, the bill's opponents asked to do exactly what our bill  does.   So scientists, Federal agencies of jurisdiction, and, yes, at one  time, even the bill's opponents have said that the agencies should  operate under the 2014 BiOp while a new plan is developed.   This is a vote for listed salmon because it keeps current measures in  place, and we know that they are working. This is a vote for the  region's economy, and it avoids wasting millions of dollars. And this  is a vote for the environment because we cannot match the clean,  renewable energy produced by our hydro system.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.
