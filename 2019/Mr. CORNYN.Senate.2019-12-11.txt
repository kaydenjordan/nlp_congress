 Mr. President, as all America knows, climbing healthcare  costs continue to keep the American people up at night. A Kaiser  Foundation poll in September found that the No. 1 health concern of the  American people is prescription drug pricing. A whopping 70 percent of  those polled think lowering prescription drug costs should be a top  priority--a top priority--for Congress, making it the No. 1 item on our  to-do list, but our friend and colleague from New York, the minority  leader, objected last time I offered unanimous consent to take up and  pass a bill, which I will describe here momentarily.   I hope, given the intervening time and further reflection, he will  not do so today, and we can get this bill passed and address this top  priority of the American people.   The good news is, Republicans and Democrats both agree we need to do  something about it. I have the honor of serving on both the Finance and  Judiciary Committees, where we have been looking into this problem and  some of the potential solutions.   There are pharmaceutical CEOs who earn big bonuses as sales go up. I  am not opposed to them receiving compensation, but pharmacy benefit  managers who negotiate backdoor rebates that drive up out-of-pocket  costs are a problem because of the lack of transparency.   What I find very seriously concerning as well is anti-competitive  behavior when it comes to patents by drug manufacturers. There are two  practices, in particular, that the legislation I intend to offer a  unanimous consent request on would address.   One is called product hopping, which occurs when a company develops a  reformulation of a product that is about to lose exclusivity. Let me  just stop a moment and say that one of the ways we protect the  investment and the intellectual property of American innovators is to  give them exclusivity over the right to sell and license that  intellectual property, including drugs. That encourages people to make  those investments. In turn, it benefits the American people and the  world, literally, by creating new lifesaving drugs, and that is a good  thing. There is a period of exclusivity, and after that expires--after  that goes away--then it opens that particular formulation up to generic  competition; meaning, the price will almost certainly be much lower and  more affordable to the American people.   This issue of product hopping is gamesmanship, as I will explain.  First of all, before the drug loses exclusivity, the manufacturer pulls  the drug off the market. This is done not because the new formula is  more effective, but it will block generic competitors.   The second issue is patent thicketing, which occurs when an innovator  uses multiple, overlapping patents or patents with identical claims  that make it nearly impossible for competitors to enter the market.  This is nothing more and nothing less than  [[Page S6968]]  abuse of our patent system, and it is coming at a high cost for  patients who rely on affordable drugs.   Earlier this year, I introduced a bill with our friend and colleague  from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, who happens to be a Democrat, to  address these anti-competitive behaviors. Our bill is called the  Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act, and it streamlines the  litigation process by limiting the number of patents these companies  can use in court. So companies are spending less time in the courtroom  and, hopefully, more time innovating these new lifesaving drugs, while  opening up these drugs once they lose their exclusivity to generic  competition and more and more affordable prices for consumers.   This legislation does not stifle innovation; it doesn't limit  patients' rights; and it doesn't cost taxpayers a dime. In fact, the  Congressional Budget Office estimates it would lower--lower--Federal  spending by more than a half a billion dollars over 10 years. This is  just savings to the Federal Government for Medicare and Medicaid.  Undoubtedly, it would show significant savings for consumers with  private health insurance as well.    I am sure it comes as no surprise, then, that this legislation passed  unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee; not a single Senator  opposed it. That happened in June. This is December, and there has been  no movement since then.   We have tried to be patient because we know there are other bills  coming from the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. There  is a bill coming out of the Finance Committee on which the Presiding  Officer and I sit. My hope is that we would have been able to make  progress on a larger package, but here we are at the end of the year,  and there has been no movement. We have been more than patient, but I  think there comes a time when patience ceases to be a virtue,  particularly when it comes to providing something that would benefit  the American people.   There are no concerns about the policies laid out in the bill, as you  can see by some of the comments reflected in this chart. Again, our  colleague, the Democrat from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, said:  ``This bill offers a positive, solid step toward ending abuses in the  use of patents.''   Senator Durbin, who is the Democratic whip, a member of leadership,  said:         It is a bipartisan measure that passed the Senate Judiciary       Committee. I not only voted for it, I cosponsored it, and I       believe it should pass and should become the law of the land.    So imagine my surprise when the Democratic leader objected to a  unanimous consent request to pass it a couple of weeks ago. He even  went so far as to call this ``a manipulative charade'' and ``a little  game,'' which is strange because he also called it a good bill. His  biggest criticism was it didn't do enough, but as I pointed out then,  if you sit around waiting for the big bill to get passed, nothing  happens in the meantime, and it is a loss to the American people.   I think it is past time for us to take up this legislation, get it  passed, get it signed by the President. Our friends in the House of  Representatives have already passed two bills, which, put together,  essentially reflect the same policy.   I can't think of any other reason for the Democratic leader to object  than pure politics. He doesn't want anybody to get a ``win.'' That also  goes for the Senator from Iowa, when she had offered a bill to  reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. She happens to be on the  ballot in 2020 as well. The only rationale I can possibly think of that  the Democratic leader would continue to object to these bipartisan  consensus bills is just that he doesn't want somebody to be able to  score a point on this side because he feels like that will disadvantage  his candidates in the next election and advantage us.   There comes a time when we need to put those election considerations  to the side and focus on making good policy. I happen to believe good  policy is good politics.   The truth is, the Democratic leader, in objecting to the passage of  this legislation, does have one very big and powerful cheerleader  behind him; that is, the drug companies. The drug companies love it  when bipartisan legislation gets blocked on the Senate floor for  whatever reason. The truth is, they hate this bill, and they don't want  to see anything done on this issue. Inadvertently or not, the  Democratic leader seems to be providing them a lot of cover right now.   My constituents didn't send me to Washington to play these endless  games. They sent me here to get results, and that is exactly what I aim  to do.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as in legislative  session, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar  No. 132, S. 1416. I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute be withdrawn; that the Cornyn amendment at the desk be  agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time  and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I point out to my friend from New York, I  am not the leader or the floor manager of legislation. That is up to  Senator McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky. Obviously, there has been  foot-dragging on important things like appropriations bills, the  USMCA--the important trade agreement with Canada and Mexico--and now  there is impeachment mania that has consumed the House of  Representatives and has crowded out our ability to get other things  done; hence, my loss of patience after waiting since June to get this  bill passed.   This isn't a case of my wanting to get well; this is a case of  wanting to make the American people well by providing them access to  low-cost generic alternative drugs and preventing Big Pharma from  engaging in the sorts of gamesmanship that keep drug prices up and keep  the American consumer down.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
