 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining  me tonight to stand in solidarity with our neighbors in Canada, and  honor the victims of the January 29 terrorist attack at the Quebec  Islamic Cultural Center in Quebec City.   A house of worship is a place of refuge, peace, and reflection, but  for the 6 people killed, the 19 wounded, and the entire community, that  hallowed ground is now tainted--yet, shall always remain covered in  love.   Let our presence here serve as a reminder that we will stand up  against bigotry and hatred wherever it takes place.   I now ask my colleagues to bow their heads and join us for a moment  of silence.                            ____________________
