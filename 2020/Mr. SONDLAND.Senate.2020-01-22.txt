 I know that members of this committee       frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a       simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified       previously with regard to the requested White House call and       the White House meeting, the answer is yes.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This quid pro quo was negotiated between the  President's agents, Rudy Giuliani, and Ukranian officials throughout  the summer of 2019 in numerous telephone calls, text messages, and  meetings, including during a meeting hosted by then-National Security  Advisor John Bolton on July 10.   Near the end of that July 10 meeting, after the Ukrainians again  raised the issue of a White House visit, Ambassador Sondland blurted  out that there would be agreement for a White House meeting once the  investigations began. At that point Bolton ``immediately stiffened''  and abruptly ended the meeting.   During a subsequent discussion that day, Sondland was even more  explicit. LTC Alex Vindman, a director for Europe and Ukraine on the  National Security Council, testified that Sondland began to discuss the  ``deliverable'' required to get the White House meeting. What Sondland  specifically mentioned was ``investigation of the Bidens.'' This is,  again, in that meeting in the White House with a Ukranian delegation  and an American delegation. Sondland explained in that meeting that he  had an agreement with Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney whereby  President Zelensky would be granted the Oval Office meeting if he went  forward with the investigations.   After the meeting, Vindman's supervisor, Dr. Hill, reported back to  Bolton, who told her to tell John Eisenberg, the National Security  Council legal advisor, that he was not ``part of whatever drug deal  Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this.'' She reported their  concerns, as did Vindman.   It remains unclear what action, if any, Bolton or Eisenberg took once  they were made aware of Mulvaney and Sondland's drug deal. Both refused  to testify in our inquiry. However, Dr. Hill testified that she  understood that Mr. Eisenberg informed Mr. Cipollone of her concerns  about the drug deal.   If this body is serious about a fair trial--one that is fair to the  President and to the American people--we again urge you to allow the  House to call both Eisenberg and Bolton, as well as other key witnesses  with firsthand knowledge who refused to testify before the House on the  orders of the President.   Additional testimony and documents are particularly important  because, according to Sondland, ``Everyone was in the loop'' when it  came to the President's self-serving effort. In part relying on email  excerpts, Sondland explained that the President's senior aides and  Cabinet officials knew that the White House meeting was predicated on  Ukraine's announcement of the investigations beneficial to the  President's political campaign.   Hill characterized the quid pro quo succinctly:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         But it struck me when yesterday, when you put up on the       screen Ambassador Sondland's emails and who was on these       emails, and he said, These are the people who need to know,       that he was absolutely right. Because he was being involved       in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in       national security foreign policy, and those two things had       just diverged.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. In effect, President Zelensky was being drawn  into this domestic political area. He grew wary of becoming involved in  another country's election and domestic affairs.   Bill Taylor, the Acting U.S. Ambassador for Ukraine at the time,  described a conversation he had with a senior aide to the Ukrainian  leader. He said:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         [Also] on July 20, I had a phone conversation with       Oleksandr Danylyuk, President Zelensky's national security       advisor, who emphasized that President Zelensky did not want       to be used as an instrument in a U.S. reelection campaign.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Remember that conversation when you hear counsel  say that the Ukrainians felt no pressure to be involved in a U.S.  reelection campaign. But that concern did not deter President Trump. In  his conversation with Sondland shortly before the July 25 call, the  President made clear that he not only wanted Ukraine to do the  investigations or announce them, but also a White House meeting would  be scheduled only if President Zelensky confirmed these investigations,  as Volker communicated to President Zelensky's top aide by text less  than 30 minutes before the phone call between Trump and Zelensky.   Again, we are talking about July 25, in a text 30 minutes before the  Trump-Zelensky phone call. Here is what it says--with Volker texting  Andriy Yermak, a top aide to President Zelensky.         Good lunch--thanks. Heard from White House--assuming       President Z convinces trump he will investigate/``get to the       bottom of what happened'' in 2016, we will nail down day for       visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow--kurt.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, those words couldn't be much clearer:  ``assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/`get to the  bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down [the] . . . visit  to Washington.'' That is a text 30 minutes before that call.   Counsel for the President would like you to think this is just about  that call. You don't get to look outside the four corners of that call.  They don't want you to look at the months that went into preparing for  that call or the months of pressure that followed. But you can just  look at, right now, what happened 30 minutes before that call in this  text message: ``Heard from White House--assuming President Z convinces  trump he will investigate/`get to the bottom of what happened' in  2016.''   If you were wondering whether President Zelensky was aware of what he  was going to be asked on that call, this is how you can tell. He was  prepped. Of course he was prepped. In fact, the missing reference in  the call record to Burisma was a signal Colonel Vindman recognized that  clearly he had been prepped for that call. Why else would the name of  this particular energy company come up in that conversation?   Well, President Zelensky clearly got the message. Toward the end of  the call with President Trump, President Zelensky said:         I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the       United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand,       I also wanted to ensure you that we will be very serious       about the case and will work on the investigation.''    Thank you for the invitation. On the other hand, I want to assure you  that we will be very serious about the case, and we will work on the  investigation.   President Zelensky clearly understood the quid pro quo for the White  House meeting on July 25, but his reticence to be used as a political  pawn  [[Page S451]]  kept President Trump from moving forward with a promise to schedule the  meeting, and so the President and his agents pressed on.   In August, Giuliani met with a top Ukrainian aide and made it clear  that Ukraine must issue a public statement and announce investigations  in order to get a White House meeting. Fearful of getting involved in  U.S. domestic politics and having entered office with a promise to  clean up government and corruption, President Zelensky and his aides  preferred a generic statement about investigations, but Giuliani  insisted. No, the statement must include two specific investigations  that would benefit President Trump.   Let's look at a comparison between the statement the Ukrainians  preferred and the one that Giuliani required.   On the left--and I will read it in case you can't see the screens-- the Yermak draft, the Ukrainian draft, says: ``We intend to initiate  and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available  facts and episodes, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this  problem in the future.'' That is pretty generic.   But here is the Giuliani-Volker-Sondland response. This is what had  to be included: ``We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and  unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes.'' Up to  that point, it is exactly the same, until you get to ``including those  involving Burisma and the 2016 US elections,'' and then it goes back to  the Ukrainian draft: ``which in turn will prevent the recurrence of  this problem in the future.''   You can see in this such graphic evidence that the Ukrainians did not  want to do this. They didn't even want to mention this. Giuliani had to  insist: No, no, no; we are not going to be satisfied with some generic  statement. After all, I think we can see this isn't about corruption-- no, this is about announcing investigations to damage Biden and to  promote this fiction about the last election.   So here in these texts, you see that Giuliani, Volker, and Sondland  have added these references to Burisma--a thinly-veiled reference to  former Vice President Biden--and the 2016 election. They wished to  ensure that the Ukrainians mentioned the sham investigation President  Trump required.   The Ukrainians recoiled at the new statement, recognizing that  releasing it would run directly counter to the anti-corruption platform  that Zelensky campaigned on and would embroil them in U.S. election  politics. As a result, Zelensky didn't get his White House meeting. He  still hasn't gotten his White House meeting.   Senators, witness testimony, text messages, emails, and the call  record itself confirm a corrupt quid pro quo for the White House  meeting--an official act available only to the President of the United  States--in exchange for the announcement of political investigations.  The President and his allies have offered no explanation for this  effort--except that the President can abuse his office all he likes,  and there is nothing you can do about it. You can't indict him. You  can't impeach him. That is because they cannot seriously dispute that  President Trump corruptly used an official White House visit for a  foreign leader to compel the Ukrainian President into helping him cheat  in the next election.   The White House meeting, of course, was not the only official act  that President Trump conditioned on the announcement of investigations  into Biden and the conspiracy theory meant to exonerate President Trump  on Russia's interference on his behalf in the last election. In a far  more draconian step, as we discussed, the President withheld $391  million of military aid.   Several weeks before this phone call with President Zelensky but  after Giuliani was already pressing Ukrainian officials to conduct the  investigations his client sought, President Trump ordered the hold on  Ukraine's military aid. Significantly, this was after Congress had  already been notified that most of it was prepared to be spent. Ukraine  had met all of the critical conditions for anti-corruption and defense  reforms in order to receive the funds. We conditioned the funds. They  met the conditions. The funds were ready to go.   At the time and even today, witnesses uniformly testified that the  order to hold the funding came without explanation to the foreign  policy and national security officials responsible for Ukraine. The  only message from the Office of Management and Budget was that the hold  was implemented at the direction of the President.   Since Russia's illegal incursion into Ukraine in 2014, the United  States has maintained a bipartisan policy of delivering hundreds of  millions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine each year, which several  Senators here have personally invested significant time and effort to  ensure. It was President Trump himself who originally authorized  additional financial support for military assistance to Ukraine in 2017  and 2018 without reservation, making his abrupt decision to withhold  assistance in 2019 without explanation all the more surprising to those  responsible for Ukraine policy.    That confusion, however, would soon disappear. The President used the  hold on military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine to announce these  investigations that he hoped would help his reelection campaign. The  only difference between the prior years when the President approved the  aid without question and the inexplicable hold on aid in 2019 was the  emergence of Joe Biden as a potentially formidable obstacle to the  President's reelection.   These funds that the President withheld--these funds--they don't just  benefit Ukraine; they benefit the security of the United States by  ensuring that Ukraine is equipped to defend its own borders against  Russian aggression.   As Ambassador Taylor noted in his deposition, the United States  provides Ukraine with ``radar and weapons and sniper rifles,  communications that save lives. It makes Ukrainians more effective. It  might even shorten the war. That is what our hope is, to show the  Ukrainians can defend themselves--and the Russians, in the end, will  say: OK, we are going to stop.'' That is in our interest. This isn't  just about Ukraine or its national security; it is about our national  security. This isn't charity; it is about our defense as much as  Ukraine's.   Ambassador Taylor also said that the American aid was ``a concrete  demonstration of the United States' commitment to resist aggression and  defend freedom.'' This is what this country is supposed to be about,  right? Resisting aggression, defending freedom, not exporting corrupt  ideas--that is what we are supposed to be about, right?   It was against this backdrop that American officials responsible for  Ukraine policy sat in astonishment, according to Ambassador Taylor,  when they learned about the hold. Officials immediately expressed  concerns about the legality of President Trump's hold on the assistance  to Ukraine. Their concerns were well warranted, as the Government  Accountability Office, which was just last night pooh-poohed by the  President's counsel--well, that is just some institution of Congress.  Like they are just going to be inherently biased, right? Well, they are  a nonpartisan organization that both parties have come to rely upon.  But I am not surprised that they don't like the conclusion of the GAO,  because the Defense Department warned them that this was going to be  the conclusion, and that conclusion was that the hold on aid was not  only wrong, it was not only immoral, it was also illegal. It violated  the law--a law that we passed so that Presidents could not refuse to  spend money that we allocated for the defense of others and for  ourselves.   The Impoundment Control Act prevents the President and other  government officials from unilaterally making funding decisions when  Congress has made its intent clear. In fact, the act exists precisely  because of previous Presidential abuses of Congress's power of the  purse during the Nixon era. The nonpartisan GAO ruled that the hold on  military aid was not only illegal but that holding underscores the  President's efforts to go to any lengths to ensure his own personal  benefit rather than take care that the laws be faithfully executed as  he swore he would do when he took his oath of office.   Now, because of recent Freedom of Information Act responses in media  reports, we now know additional details about how senior officials  expressed serious reservations about the legality of the hold at the  time. This is not like some big surprise. This is not like something  that just came out of the blue--whoa, an independent watchdog  [[Page S452]]  agency found this was illegal. No, they knew this was illegal at the  time. These concerns were raised at the time.   Certain individuals who may have further information about the hold  who refused to testify at the President's direction--including his  Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney; Robert Blair; OMB official Michael  Duffey, all of them--all of them defied congressional subpoenas but  were included in important email communications that have been made  public only recently.   As you know, these and many other categories of documents from the  White House, the Defense Department, and OMB were subpoenaed by the  House and none was produced--none--at the President's direction and  through Mr. Cipollone's intervention. Although the investigation  developed an overwhelming body of evidence that clearly proves that the  President implemented this hold to pressure Ukraine to announce  investigations, the full story behind the hold--the full and complete  story--is within your power to request.   As you consider the evidence we present to you, ask yourselves  whether the documents of witnesses that have been denied by the  President's complete and unprecedented obstruction could shed more  light on this critical topic. You may agree with the House managers  that the evidence of the President's withholding of military aid to  coerce Ukraine is already supported by overwhelming evidence and no  further insight is necessary to convict the President, but if the  President's lawyers attempt to contest these or other factual matters,  you are left with no choice but to demand to hear from each witness  with firsthand knowledge. A fair trial requires nothing less.   Let's look at some of the evidence that we gathered, notwithstanding  this obstruction.   First, the President withheld the aid without explanation and against  the advice of his own agencies, Cabinet officials, national security  experts, including Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Esper, Ambassador  Bolton, and others. Only Mick Mulvaney, a central figure in this  effort, reportedly supported the hold, and he told us why. During a  press briefing, Mulvaney personally acknowledged that the hold was  ordered as part of a quid pro quo designed to get Ukraine to undertake  the investigation President Trump signed.   Second, the reason for the security assistance hold was undoubtedly  on the President's mind during the telephone call with President  Zelensky on July 25. Near the beginning of their conversation,  President Zelensky expressed his gratitude for U.S. military  assistance, noting the United States' ``great support in the area of  defense.'' Immediately after President Zelensky's reference to defense  and military support, President Trump responded by saying: ``I would  like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through  a lot, and Ukraine knows a lot about it.'' President Trump then  proceeded to openly press Ukraine to conduct these investigations.   Third, numerous officials were aware that President Trump was  withholding the White House meeting until the Ukrainian President  announced the investigations. That the President would ratchet up  pressure on Ukraine to compel its action stunned Ukraine experts like  Ambassador Taylor but followed logically for those engaged in the  President's corrupt scheme.   Fourth, by the end of August, there was still no explanation for the  hold, despite ongoing efforts from numerous officials to persuade the  President to release the money. The leverage of the White House meeting  had not succeeded in coercing Ukraine to announce the investigations,  providing the President and his agents every reason to use the most  aggressive lever of influence, hundreds of millions of dollars in  military support, to compel Ukraine to act. If they didn't feel  pressure, they wouldn't have done it. They wouldn't have done it, but  of course they did.   Imagine if this country were dependent on a more powerful country for  our defense; imagine if we were at war; imagine if we were waiting for  weapons to defend ourselves, something our Framers could have  understood; imagine that we found ourselves in those circumstances, and  much to our astonishment, we couldn't even get a meeting with our ally,  much to our astonishment, they were withholding aid from us. Would you  think we would feel pressure? Of course we would. The Framers had  common sense, and so must we.   Are we to accept: Well, the President said there was no quid pro quo;  I guess that closes the case? In every courtroom in America, jurors-- and I know you are not just jurors. I led the Clinton trial. You are  jurors and judges. Jurors all over America are told: You don't leave  your common sense at the door. Well, we don't have to leave our common  sense at the door here too. Two plus two equals four.   The aid was withheld. You are asking for it. We are asking for it.  His own aides are asking for it, and no one can get an explanation. The  Ukrainians can't get an explanation. All the Ukrainians get is: We want  you to do these investigations. They are promised a White House  meeting. They want a White House meeting. They need a White House  meeting. They are going to be going into negotiations with Putin. They  want to show strength, and they can't get in the door. They see the  Russian Foreign Minister get in the door of the White House. We see the  photos of the President and the Russian Foreign Minister, or the  Ambassador, what a great time they are having, but, no, the President  of Ukraine, our ally, can't get in the door. They are not stupid. They  know what is going on here. They are not stupid. Remember that  conversation I referenced yesterday when the Ukrainians threw it right  back in our face--when Ambassador Volker said to his Ukrainian  counterpart: You shouldn't investigate the former President. You  shouldn't engage in those political investigations. The Ukrainian  response was: You mean like the one you want us to do on the Bidens and  the Clintons? They are not stupid.    By the end of August, there was still no explanation for the hold,  despite efforts by numerous people to seek the release of the funding.  The leverage hadn't succeeded in getting the President to--in coercing  Ukraine to announce the investigations, and so the aid was withheld.  Two witnesses privy to this scheme testified that the only logical  conclusion to reach about the President's continued hold on the aid was  that it was intended to put more pressure on Ukraine to announce the  investigations. As I said, they testified it was as simple as two plus  two equals four.   We can do math, and, more importantly, so can the Ukrainians, and  maybe even more importantly than that, so can the Russians. Multiple  senior officials, including President Trump himself, have confirmed  this logical conclusion. On September 7, Ambassador Sondland spoke  directly to President Trump, who by that point was aware that a  whistleblower complaint was circulating that alleged the contours of  his scheme and that Congress and the public were beginning to ask  probing questions about the hold on aid, including whether the  withholding of the aid was in exchange for reelection help.   During that call of September 7--so in July you have got Mueller's  testimony. You have got the call itself. You have got a followup call  the next day, where the President is speaking to Sondland and wants to  make sure they are going to do the investigations. You have got August,  where they are trying to hammer out a statement, and the Ukrainians are  still resisting.   Then you have September. On September 7, Ambassador Sondland is on  the phone with President Trump. At that point, he is aware that a  whistleblower has filed a complaint alleging the contours of this  scheme and Congress and the public are beginning to ask questions about  the hold on aid, including whether this was to get help in his  reelection.   During this call between the President and Ambassador Sondland,  without a prompt, President Trump told Sondland: There is no quid pro  quo. Now, why would he do that? That is not something that comes up in  normal conversation, right? Hello, Mr. President, how are you today? No  quid pro quo.   That is the kind of thing that comes up in a conversation if you are  trying to put your alibi out there. If you heard about a whistleblower  complaint, if you had seen allegations, if you  [[Page S453]]  know Congress is starting to sniff around, no quid pro quo. But--and I  know this is astonishing--so much of the last 3 years has been a  combination of shock and yet no surprise. Yet, even while the President  is saying no quid pro quo, what does he say? Zelensky must publicly  announce the two political investigations, and he should want to do it.  No quid pro quo, except this quid pro quo.   Sondland immediately relayed the message to President Zelensky,  informing him that without the announcement of the political  investigations, they would be at a stalemate. Sondland made clear that  this reference to a stalemate meant the release of the security  assistance.   President Zelensky, after hesitating for weeks to join the  President's corrupt scheme, finally relented. President Zelensky  informed Sondland that he agreed to do a CNN interview, and Sondland  understood that he would use that occasion to mention these items,  meaning the two investigations at the heart of the scheme.   Candidate Zelensky, who was swept into office with a landslide  victory on a promise of fighting corruption, would be forced to  undertake just the same kind of corrupt act he had been elected to  clean up. Upon learning this, Ambassador Taylor called Sondland to  register his deep concern, telling him that it was crazy--crazy. Taylor  later texted Sondland to reinforce the point: ``As I said on the phone,  I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a  political campaign.''   ``As I said on the phone''--clearly, they had discussed it. ``As I  said on the phone.''   Taylor testified about the message and the events leading up to it.  Taylor said that security assistance was so important for Ukraine, as  well as our own national interest. To withhold that assistance for no  good reason other than help with the political campaign made no sense.  It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It  was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.   What is more, Ambassador Taylor also came to learn that President  Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box.   He testified--Mr. Goldman was asking the question: ``Now, you  reference a television interview and a desire for President Trump to  put Zelensky in a public box, which you also have in quotes.''   Now, this is in reference, I think, to his written testimony.   ``Was that reference to `in a public box' in his notes?''   You remember he kept detailed notes.   Taylor's answer: ``It was in my notes.''   ``And what did you understand that to mean, to put Zelensky in a  public box''?   And Taylor responds: ``I understood that to mean that President  Trump, through Ambassador Sondland, was asking for President Zelensky  to publicly commit to these investigations, that it was not sufficient  to do this in private, that this needed to be a very public  statement.''   So we saw earlier, the side-by-side comparison, right, of what the  Ukrainians wanted to say. They wanted to make no mention of these  specific investigations, and now Giuliani insisted: No, no, no. This  isn't going to be credible unless you mention these specific  investigations. This is what it is going to take. And now you see that  Ambassador Sondland has acknowledged to Ambassador Taylor that it is  not enough to use even the right language, apparently. It has to be  done in public. We are not going to take any private commitment. It has  got to be done in public.    As we would later come to understand, this is because President Trump  didn't care about the investigations being done. He just wanted them  announced. He wanted Zelensky in a public box. He wanted it announced  publicly.   Ambassador Taylor also testified that he understood from Sondland  that because Trump was a businessman, he would expect to get something  in return before signing a check.   (Text of Videotape presentation.)          I first communicated with Mr. Giuliani in       early August, several months later. Mr. Giuliani emphasized       that the President wanted a public statement from President       Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into the corruption       issues. Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016       election, including the DNC server, and Burisma as two topics       of importance to the President.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Giuliani exerted significant influence in this  process. In fact, when on August 4 Yermak inquired again about the  Presidential meeting, Ambassador Volker turned not to the National  Security Council staff or to the State Department to arrange it and  follow up. He turned to Giuliani again. Volker told Yermak that he  would speak with Giuliani later that day and would call the Ukrainian  President's aide afterward.   Volker then texts Giuliani to ask about the Madrid meeting and to set  up the call that he had mentioned to Yermak. Giuliani replies that the  meeting with Yermak was excellent and that he would call later. Phone  records obtained by the committees show a 16-minute call on August 5  between Ambassador Volker and Giuliani. Ambassador Volker then texts  Yermak:         Hi, Andriy. Had a good, long talk with Rudy. Call anytime.       Kurt.    Separately, Volker told Ambassador Sondland: ``Giuliani was happy  with that meeting and it looks like things are turning around''--a  reference to Volker's hope that satisfying Giuliani would break down  President Trump's reservations concerning Ukraine.   But things had not turned around by the end of that first week of  August, by August 7. The aid was still on hold, and there had been no  movement on setting a date for the White House meeting.   Ambassador Volker then reaches out to Giuliani to try to get things  moving. Ambassador Volker texts Giuliani to recommend that he report to  ``the boss,'' meaning President Trump, about his meeting with Yermak in  Madrid. Specifically, he wrote--this is Volker writing to Giuliani:         Hi, Rudy. Hope you made it back safely. Let's meet if you       are coming to DC. It would be good if you could convey       results of your meeting in Madrid to the boss so we can get a       firm date for the visit.    So this is Ambassador Volker following up with Giuliani. Giuliani has  met with the top aide to the President of Ukraine in Madrid. He wants  Giuliani to convey to the boss--to Trump--how good that meeting in  Madrid was about the investigations so they can get the President of  Ukraine in the door at the White House.   Now, think about how unusual this is. This is the President's  personal lawyer, who is on this personal mission on behalf of his  client to get these investigations in Ukraine. The President of Ukraine  can't get in the door of the Oval Office. And who are they going to?  Are they going to the Security Council? No. Are they going to the State  Department? No. They tried all that. They are going to the President's  personal lawyer. Does that sound like an official policy to try to  fight corruption?   Why would you go outside of the normal channel to do that? You  wouldn't. You would go to your personal attorney, who is on a personal  mission that he admits is not foreign policy, when your objective has  nothing to do with policy, when your objective is a corrupt one.   What does that mean, to have a corrupt objective? It means an illicit  one. It means an impermissible one. It means one that furthers your own  interests at the cost of the national interests--the willingness to  break the law, like the Impoundment Control Act, by withholding aid is  indicative of that corrupt purpose, the lengths the President would go,  not in furtherance of U.S. policy but against U.S. policy, not even a  difference on policy at all.   The mere pursuit of personal interest, the pursuit of an illegal  effort to get foreign interference, is the very embodiment of a corrupt  intent.   Here we are, August 7. Volker is saying: Rudy, if you are coming to  DC, let's get together. It would be good if you can talk to the boss  because we can't get a meeting another way.   Around that time, Ambassador Volker received a text message from  Yermak, who asked him--and this is Yermak asking Volker:         Hi Kurt. How are you? Do you have some news about White       House meeting date?    Volker responds:         Not yet--I texted Rudy earlier to make sure he weighs in       following your meeting. Gordon--    Meaning Sondland.       should be speaking with the president on Friday. We are       pressing this.    There is Gordon Sondland, who is ``pressing this.'' This is the man  you have heard from already--Gordon Sondland, the man who says: It was  absolutely a quid pro quo. You have asked about a quid pro quo. There  was a quid pro quo about this White House meeting.   This is what they are talking about right here. Gordon will be  ``speaking with the president on Friday. We are pressing this.''   Ambassador Volker's contact with Giuliani spurred a flurry of  communications. The patterns of calls from August 8 strongly suggest  Giuliani was attempting to call the White House to speak to a senior  White House official, left a message, then had a 4-minute call with  that official later that night.   We don't know from the call records who that White House official  was, but recall that Giuliani has publicly stated that when he spoke to  the White House, he usually spoke to President Trump, his client.   Also, on August 8, Yermak texts Volker that he had some news.  Ambassador Volker replies that he can talk then, and Ambassador Volker  updates Giuliani in a text the next day.   Volker says to Giuliani in the text:         Hi Mr. Mayor! Had a good chat with Yermak last night. He       was pleased with your phone call. Mentioned--    He is referring to President Zelensky here.       making a statement. Can we all get on the phone to make sure       I advise--    Here he is referring to President Zelensky.       correctly as to what he should be saying? Want to make sure       we get this done right.    Here, August 9, there is an effort by Volker to make sure to get this  statement right about the investigations. If they can't get the  statement right, you aren't going to get in the door of the Oval  Office.   It also makes clear who is exactly in charge of this, and that is  Rudy Giuliani. Ambassador Volker is checking with Rudy Giuliani about  what he should advise President Zelensky. We know that Giuliani is  taking his orders from President Trump.   Text messages and call records obtained by the committees show that  Ambassador Volker and Giuliani connected by phone twice around noon on  August 9 for several minutes each.   Following the calls with Giuliani, Ambassador Volker created a three- way group chat using WhatsApp and included himself, Ambassador  Sondland, and Yermak. Ambassador Volker initiated the chat a round 2:20  that day. This is Volker chatting with Sondland and Yermak. It is a  three-way chat.   Volker says:         Hi, Andrey--    Meaning Yermak.         We have all consulted here, including with Rudy. Can you do       a call later today or tomorrow your afternoon time?    Sondland says:         I have a call [scheduled] at 3 pm Eastern for the three of       us. Ops will call.    Call records obtained by the committees show that on August 9  Ambassador Sondland twice connected with phone lines associated with  the White House--once in the early afternoon for about 18 minutes and  once in the late afternoon for about 2 minutes. We know that Ambassador  Sondland had direct access to President Trump.   After all this activity, Ambassador Sondland and Volker thought they  had a breakthrough--finally, a breakthrough. Minutes after this call,  which was likely with Tim Morrison about a possible date for the White  House meeting, Ambassador Volker and Sondland discussed the agreement  they believed they had reached and started with Sondland in this text  message:         Morrison ready to get dates as soon as Yermak confirms.   [[Page S473]]     Volker says:         Excellent!! How did you sway him?    Sondland says:         Not sure I did. I think potus really wants the deliverable.    We know what that ``deliverable'' is. It is the political  investigations.   Volker says:         But does he know that?    And Sondland says:         Yep. Clearly lots of convos--    Meaning conversations.       going on.    Volker says:         OK--then that's good it's coming from two separate sources.    Ambassador Sondland told the committees that the deliverable required  by President Trump was a press statement from President Zelensky  committing to do the investigations into the Bidens and the allegation  of Ukraine election interference that President Trump mentioned on July  25. But Tim Morrison testified that he didn't know anything about the  deliverable; he was just involved in trying to schedule the White House  meeting, which everyone wanted to schedule as a sign of support for  President Zelensky and our ally Ukraine. But Trump's agents wouldn't  just accept Ukraine's word for it.   Ambassador Sondland then recommended to Ambassador Volker that Yermak  share a draft of the press statement to ensure that the statement would  comport with the President's expectations.   Here, on August 9--we are still less than 2 weeks after the July 25  call; I guess we are about 2 weeks--Sondland says in this message:         To avoid misunderstandings, might be helpful to ask Andrey       for a draft statement (embargoed) so that we can see exactly       what they propose to cover. Even though Ze--    Referring to Zelensky.       does a [live] presser they can still summarize in a brief       statement. Thoughts?    And Volker says:         Agree!    At his deposition, Ambassador Sondland said that he suggested  reviewing a written summary of the statement because he was concerned  that President Zelensky would say whatever he would say on live  television, and it still wouldn't be good enough for Rudy/the  President.   Yermak, in turn, was concerned that the announcement would still not  result in the coveted White House meeting. On August 10, Yermak texted  Volker, attempting to schedule a White House meeting before the  Ukrainian President made a public statement in support of the  investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election.   You can see what is going on here. The President and his agent,  Giuliani, want this public statement of the investigations before they  will give a date. And the Ukrainians want a date before they have to  commit to making public they are going to do the investigations.   So you have had this standoff where each is trying to get the  deliverable first, but there is no debate about what the deliverable is  on either side. There is no debate about the quid pro quo here: You  give me this; I will give you that. You give me the White House  meeting; I will give you the public announcement of the investigation  into your political rival.   No, no, no. You give me the announcement of the investigation into my  rival, and then I will give you the meeting.   The only debate here is about which comes first.   August 10, Yermak texts Volker:         I think it's possible to make this declaration and mention       all these things. Which we discussed yesterday. But it will       be logic to do after we receive a confirmation of date. We       inform about date of visit about our expectations and our       guarantees for future visit. Let discuss it.    Ambassador Volker responded that he agreed but that first they would  have to iron out a statement and use that to get a date, after which  President Zelensky would give the statement. The two decided to have a  call the next day and to include Ambassador Sondland.   Yermak texts Ambassador Volker:         Excellent.        Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing,       announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot       of the US-UKRAINE relationship, including, among other       things, Burisma and election meddling in investigations.    Yermak was also in direct contact with Ambassador Sondland regarding  this revised approach. In fact, he sent Ambassador Sondland the same  text message.   Ambassador Sondland kept the leadership of the State Department in  the loop. On August 10, he told Ambassador Volker that he had reported  to T. Ulrich Breckbull, Counselor of the Department of State, who,  Sondland testified, frequently consulted with Secretary Pompeo.   Sondland wrote to Volker: I briefed Ulrich. All good. So Ulrich is in  the loop.   Sondland and Volker continued to pursue the statement from Zelensky  on the investigations. The next day, Ambassador Sondland emails  Breckbull and Lisa Kenna, the State Department's Executive Secretary,  about efforts to secure a public statement and a big presser from  President Zelensky.   Sondland hoped it might ``make the boss happy enough to authorize an  invitation.''   After first being evasive on the topic, Secretary Pompeo has  subsequently acknowledged that he listened in on the July 25 call.   Since he was on the call, Pompeo must have understood what would make  the boss--that is, the President--happy enough to schedule a White  House meeting.   Again, everyone was in the loop. On August 11, Ambassador Volker sent  Giuliani a text message. This is Volker to Giuliani:         Hi Rudy--we have heard bCk [sic] from Andrey again--they       are writing the statement now and will send it to us. Can you       talk for 5 min before noon today?    And Giuliani says:         Yes just call.    That is August 11.   On the next day, August 12, Yermak sent Ambassador Volker an initial  version of the draft statement by text. Notably, as we saw earlier,  this statement from the Ukrainians doesn't explicitly mention Burisma,  Biden, or 2016--election investigations that the President has been  seeking.   You can see what is going on here now. There was this game of  chicken.   You go first.   No, we'll go first. You give us the date, and we will give you the  statement.   No, you give us the statement, and we will give you the date.   And now, realizing, OK, they have to give the statement first,  Ukraine tries to give them a generic statement that doesn't really go  into specifics about these investigations. And why? You can imagine  why. Ukrainians don't want to have to go out in public and say they are  going to do these investigations, because they are not stupid, because  they understood this would pull them right into U.S. Presidential  politics. It was intended to, which isn't in Ukraine's interests. It is  not in our interests either, and Ukraine understood that. And so they  resisted.   First they resisted having to do the public statement, and then they  wanted to make sure they got the deliverable, and then, when they had  to make the statement, they didn't want to be specific--for one thing,  for another thing. This was what Zelensky campaigned on. He was going  to fight corruption. He was going to end political investigations, so  he didn't want to be specific.   He sends this statement that doesn't have the specific references.  Ambassador Volker explained during his testimony that was not what  Giuliani was requesting, and it would not satisfy Giuliani or Donald  Trump.   Presumably, if the President was interested in corruption, that  statement would have been enough. But all he was interested in was an  investigation or an announcement of an investigation into his rival and  this debunked theory about 2016.   The conversation that Volker referred to in his earlier testimony  took place on the morning of August 13, when Giuliani made clear that  the specific investigations related to Burisma--code for Bidens--and  the 2016 election had to be included in order to get the White House  meeting.   The Americans sent back to the Ukrainian top aide a revised draft  that includes now the two investigations. You have seen the side-by- side. This was then the essence of the quid pro quo regarding the  meeting. This direction came from President Trump. Here is how  Ambassador Sondland put it.  [[Page S474]]    (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. Mr. Giuliani's requests were a quid       pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President       Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public       statement announcing the investigations of the 2016 election       DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the       desires of the President of the United States, and we knew       these investigations were important to the President.    According to witness testimony, as you might imagine, Ukrainian  officials were very uncomfortable with a draft that Giuliani, Volker,  and Sondland were negotiating. They understood that the statement was  the deliverable that President Trump wanted, but yielding to President  Trump's demands would, in essence, force President Zelensky to break  his promise to the Ukrainian people to root out corruption because  politically motivated investigations are the hallmark of the kind of  corruption that Ukraine has been plagued with in the past.   Mr. Yermak tried to get some confirmation that the requested  investigations were legitimate. Yermak asked Volker ``whether any  request had ever been made by the U.S. to investigate election  interference in 2016''; in other words, whether any request had been  made by any official U.S. law enforcement agency through formal  channels as you would expect if it were a legitimate request.   Ambassador Volker, trying to find a satisfactory answer, on August  15, Volker's assistant asked Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent  whether there was any precedent for such a request for investigations.  At his deposition, Kent testified that ``if you're asking me, have we  ever gone to the Ukrainians and asked them to investigate or prosecute  individuals for political reasons, the answer is, I hope we haven't,  and we shouldn't because that goes against everything that we are  trying to promote in the post Soviet states for the last 28 years,  which is promotion of the rule of law.''   We are now on the next day, August 16. In a conversation with  Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. Ambassador in Kyiv--Ambassador Taylor  stepped in when Ambassador Yovanovitch was pushed out--Taylor  ``amplified the same theme'' and told Kent that ``Yermak was very  uncomfortable'' with the idea of investigations and suggested it should  be done officially and put in writing.   As a result, it became clear to Kent in mid-August that Ukraine was  being pressured to conduct politically motivated investigations. Kent  told Ambassador Taylor: ``That's wrong, and we shouldn't be doing that  as a matter of U.S. policy.''   Ambassador Volker claimed that he stopped pursuing the statement from  the Iranians around this time because of the concerns raised by  Zelensky's aide. At his deposition and despite all his efforts to  secure a statement announcing these very specific political  investigations desired by the President, Ambassador Volker testified  that he agreed with Yermak's concerns and advised him that making those  specific references was not a good idea because making those statements  might look like it would play into our domestic politics.   Without specific references to the politically damaging  investigations that Trump demanded, the agreement just wouldn't work.  Ukraine did not release the statement and, in turn, the White House  meeting was not scheduled. As it turns out, Ambassadors Sondland and  Volker did not achieve the breakthrough after all.   Let's go into what finally breaks the logjam because that involves  the military aid. With efforts to trade a White House meeting for a  press statement announcing the investigations temporarily scuttled,  Sondland and Volker go back to the drawing board. On August 19,  Ambassador Sondland told Volker that he drove the larger issue home  with Yermak, President Zelensky's top aide, particularly that this was  now bigger than a White House meeting--bigger than just the White House  meeting and was about the relationship per se. It is not just about the  meeting anymore; it is about everything.   By this time in late August, the hold on security assistance had been  in place more than a month, and there was still no credible explanation  offered by the White House despite some, like Ambassador Sondland,  repeatedly asking. There were no interagency meetings since July 31,  and the Defense Department had withdrawn its assurances that it could  even comply with the law, which, indeed, it couldn't. Every agency in  the administration opposed the hold. As the Government Accountability  Office confirmed, concerned DOD and OMB officials had been right that  the President's holding of the aid was an unlawful act, but President  Trump was not budging.   At the same time, despite the persistent efforts of numerous people,  President Trump refused to schedule the coveted White House visit with  President Zelensky until the investigations were announced that would  benefit his campaign.   Here is what Ambassador Sondland said about the hold on funds and its  link to the politically motivated investigations in Ukraine.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. In the absence of any credible       explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to       believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur       until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to       the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma, as Mr.       Giuliani had demanded.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. From the Embassy in Kyiv, David Holmes reached  the same conclusion--a conclusion as simple as two plus two equals  four.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         GORDON. Mr. Holmes, you have testified that by late August,       you had a clear impression that the security assistance hold       was somehow connected to the investigations that President       Trump wanted. How did you conclude--how did you make--reach       that clear conclusion?        Ambassador HOLMES. Sir, we've been hearing about the       investigation since March--months before--and President       Zelensky had received a congratulatory letter from the       president saying he would be pleased to meet him following       his inauguration in May.        And we had been unable to get that meeting. And then the       security hold came up with no explanation.        And I'd be surprised if any of the Ukrainians--we discussed       earlier, you know, they're sophisticated people--when they       received no explanation for why that hold was in place,       they would have drawn that conclusion.        GORDON. Because the investigations were still being       pursued?        Ambassador HOLMES. Right.        GORDON. And the hold was still remaining without       explanation?        Ambassador HOLMES. Right.        GORDON. So this to you was the only logical conclusion that       you could reach?        Ambassador HOLMES. Right.        GORDON. Sort of like 2 plus 2 equals 4?        Ambassador HOLMES. Exactly.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Sondland explained the predicament he believed he  faced with a hold on aid to Ukraine.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. As my other State Department       colleagues have testified, this security aid was critical to       Ukraine's defense and should not have been delayed. I       expressed this view to many during this period, but my goal       at the time was to do what was necessary to get the aid       released, to break the logjam. I believed that the public       statement we have been discussing for weeks was essential to       advancing that goal.        You know, I really regret that the Ukrainians were placed       in that predicament, but I do not regret doing what I could       to try to break the logjam and to solve the problem.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. On August 22, Ambassador Sondland tried to break  that logjam, as he put it, regarding both the security assistance hold  and the White House meeting. Ambassador Sondland described those  efforts in his public testimony. Let's listen to him again.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. In preparation for the September 1       Warsaw meeting, I asked Secretary Pompeo whether a face-to-      face conversation between Trump and Zelensky would help to       break the logjam. This was when President Trump was still       intending the travel to Warsaw.        Specifically, on August 22nd, I emailed Secretary Pompeo       directly, copying Secretariat Kenna. I wrote--and this is my       email to Secretary Pompeo. Should we block time in Warsaw for       a short pull-aside for POTUS to meet Zelensky? I would ask       Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once       Ukraine's new justice folks are in place in mid-September,       that Zelensky--he, Zelensky, should be able to move forward       publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to       POTUS in the U.S. Hopefully, that will help break the logjam.        The secretary replied, yes.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Sondland also explained that both he and  Secretary Pompeo understood that issues of importance to the President  were the two  [[Page S475]]  sham investigations the President wanted to help his reelection  efforts. And that reference to the logjam meant both the security  assistance and the White House meeting.   At the end of August, National Security Advisor John Bolton arrived  in Ukraine for an official visit. David Holmes took notes in Bolton's  meeting and testified about Ambassador Bolton's message to the  Ukrainians.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador HOLMES. Shortly thereafter, on August 27th,       Ambassador Bolton visits Ukraine and brought welcome news       that President Trump had agreed to meet President Zelensky on       September 1st in Warsaw.        Ambassador Bolton further indicated that the hold on       security assistance would not be lifted prior to the Warsaw       meeting, where it would hang on whether President Zelensky       was able to ``favorably impress President Trump.''    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Let's think about that for a minute--unless you  have something further to say. Let's think about that for a minute.  Bolton further indicated that the hold on security assistance would not  be lifted prior to the Warsaw meeting where it would hang on whether  President Zelensky was able to ``favorably impress'' President Trump.   What do you think would favorably impress President Trump? What were  the only two things that President Trump asked of President Zelensky?  What were the two things that Rudy Giuliani was asking of President  Zelensky and his top aides? What would favorably impress Donald Trump?   Would Donald Trump be favorably impressed if President Zelensky were  to tell him about this new corruption court or new legislation in  Marada or how negotiations with the Russians were going or how they are  bringing about defense reform?   Had any of those things ever come up in any of these text messages,  any of these emails, any of these phone calls, any of these  conversations? Of course not. Of course not. There was only one thing  that was going to favorably impress President Trump in Warsaw, and that  is if Zelensky told him to his face: I am going to do these political  investigations. I don't want to do them. You know I don't want to do  them. I resisted doing them, but I am at war with Russia, and I can't  wait anymore. I can't wait anymore. I am sure that would have impressed  Donald Trump.   But the meeting between the two Presidents never happened in Warsaw.  President Trump canceled the trip at the last moment. Before Bolton  left Kyiv, Ambassador Taylor asked for a private meeting. Ambassador  Taylor explained that he was extremely concerned about the hold on  security assistance. He described the meeting to us during his  testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. Near the end of Ambassador Bolton's       visit, I asked to meet him privately, during which I       expressed my serious concern about the withholding of       military assistance to Ukraine while the Ukrainians were       defending their country from Russian aggression. Ambassador       Bolton recommended that I send the first-person cable to       Secretary Pompeo directly, relaying my concerns.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Now, in the State Department, sending a first- person cable is an extraordinary step. State Department cables are  ordinarily written in the third person, as Ambassador Taylor testified  at his deposition. Sending a first-person cable gets attention because  there are not many first-person cables that come in. In fact, in his  decades of diplomatic service, he had never written a single one until  now.   Taylor sent that cable on August 29. Would you like me to read that  to you right now? I would like to read it to you right now, except I  don't have it because the State Department wouldn't provide it, but if  you would like me to read it to you, we can do something about that. We  can insist on getting that from the State Department. If you would like  to know what John Bolton had in mind when he thought that Zelensky  could favorably impress the President in Warsaw, we can find that out,  too, just for the asking in a document called a subpoena.   Taylor sends that cable on August 29. The State Department did not  provide that cable to us in response to a subpoena, but witnesses who  reviewed it described it as a powerful message that described the  folly--the folly--of withholding military aid from Ukraine at a time  when it was facing incursion from Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.  That cable also sought to explain that U.S. assistance to Ukraine was  vital to U.S. national security as well.   Now, why don't they want you to see that cable? Maybe they don't want  you to see that cable because that cable from a Vietnam veteran  describes just how essential that military assistance was not just to  Ukraine; maybe they don't want you to see that cable because it  describes just how important that military assistance is to us--to us.   The President's counsel would love you to believe that this is just  about Ukraine. You don't need to care about Ukraine. Who cares about  Ukraine? How many people can find Ukraine on a map? Why should we care  about Ukraine? Well, we should care about Ukraine. They are an ally of  ours. If it matters to us, we should care about the fact that, in 1994,  we asked them to give up their nuclear weapons that they had inherited  from the Soviet Union, and they didn't want to give them up, and we  were worried about proliferation.   We said: Hey, if you give them up, which you don't want to do because  you are worried the Russians might invade if you give them up, we will  help assure your territorial integrity.   We made that commitment. I hope we care about that. I hope we care  about that because they did give them up.   And do you know what? Just what they feared took place--the Russians  moved across their border, and they remain an occupied party in  Ukraine. That is the word of America we gave, and we are breaking that  word. Why? For help on a political campaign?   Ambassador Taylor was exactly right. That is crazy. It is worse than  crazy. It is repulsive. It is repugnant. It breaks our word. To do it  in the name of these corrupt investigations is also contrary to  everything we espouse around the world.   I used to be part of a commission in the House on democracy  assistance, where we would meet with parliamentarians, and I know my  Senate colleagues do much the same thing. We would urge our colleagues  to observe the rule of law, not to engage in political investigations  and prosecutions. I don't know how we make that argument now. I don't  know how we look our allies or these burgeoning democracies in the face  or our fellow parliamentarians and make that argument now. I wouldn't  make that argument now.   Testimony indicated that Secretary Pompeo eventually carried that  cable into the White House, but there is no evidence that those  national security concerns that they don't want you to see were able to  outweigh the President's personal interest in his getting foreign help  in his reelection campaign. There is no evidence at all.   Now we get to August 28.   POLITICO was the first to publicly report that President Trump had  implemented a hold on nearly $400 million of U.S. military assistance  to Ukraine that had been appropriated by Congress. Now that the worst  kept secret was public, Ukrainian officials immediately expressed their  alarm and concern to their American counterparts.   As witnesses explained, the Ukrainians had two serious concerns.   One, of course, was the aid itself, which was vital to their ability  to fight off Russia. In addition, they were worried about the symbolism  of the hold; that it signaled to Russia and Vladimir Putin that the  United States was wavering in its support for Ukraine. Witnesses  testified that this was a division that Russia could and would exploit  to drive a further wedge between the United States and Ukraine to its  advantage.   The second concern was likely why Ukrainian officials had wanted the  hold to remain a secret in the first place--because it would add to the  negative impact to Ukraine if the hold itself became public. It is bad  enough that the President of the United States put a hold on their aid.  It was going to be far worse if it became public as, indeed, it did.   Andriy Yermak, the same Zelensky aide, sent Ambassador Volker a link  to the POLITICO story and then texted: ``Need to talk with you.''   Other Ukrainian officials also expressed concerns to Ambassador  Volker  [[Page S476]]  that the Ukrainian Government was being singled out and penalized for  some reason.   Well, what do we think that reason was? Why were they being singled  out? Why was that country being singled out? That was the one country  that this President could lever for help against an opponent he feared.  That is why Ukraine was being singled out.   On August 29, Yermak also contacted Ambassador Taylor. Yermak said  the Ukrainians were very concerned about the hold on military  assistance. He said that he and other Ukrainian officials would be  willing to travel to Washington to explain to its officials the  importance of this assistance.   Ambassador Taylor, who was on the ground in Ukraine, explained the  Ukrainian viewpoint and, frankly, their desperation.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. In September, the Minister of Defense,       for example, came to me--I would use the word--``desperate''       to figure out why the assistance was being held. He thought       that perhaps, if he went to Washington to talk to you--to       talk to the Secretary of Defense, to talk to the President--      he would be able to find out and reassure--provide whatever       answer was necessary to have that assistance released.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Without any official explanation for the hold,  American officials could provide little reassurance to their Ukrainian  counterparts. It has been publicly reported that President Trump,  Secretary Esper, and Secretary Pompeo met in late August and that they  all implored the President to release the aid, but President Trump  continued to refuse to release the aid.   As of August 30, the President was clearly directing the OMB to  continue the hold on security assistance. In documents reviewed by just  security but withheld from the Congress by the OMB on the President's  instructions, OMB official Michael Duffey emailed DOD Comptroller  Elaine McCusker that there is ``clear direction from POTUS to continue  the hold.''   So here we are on August 30. A month after that July 25 call, aid is  still being withheld. Ukrainians are still holding on, still not  willing to capitulate, not willing to violate Zelensky's whole campaign  pledge about not engaging in corrupt investigations.   On that same day, August 30, Republican Senator Ron Johnson spoke  with Ambassador Sondland to express his concern about President Trump's  decision to withhold military assistance to Ukraine. Senator Johnson  described that call in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.   According to Senator Johnson, Ambassador Sondland told him that if  Ukraine would commit to ``get to the bottom of what happened in 2016-- if President Trump has that confidence--then he will release the  military spending.''   Senator Johnson added:         At that suggestion, I winced. My reaction was, ``Oh, God. I       don't want to see those two things combined.''    The next day, August 31, Senator Johnson spoke by phone with  President Trump regarding the decision to withhold aid to Ukraine.  According to the Wall Street Journal, President Trump denied the quid  pro quo that Senator Johnson had learned of from Ambassador Sondland.  At the same time, however, President Trump refused to authorize Senator  Johnson to tell Ukrainian officials on his upcoming trip to Kyiv that  the aid would be forthcoming.   The message that Ambassador Sondland communicated to Senator Johnson  mirrored that used by President Trump during the July 25 call with  President Zelensky in which President Trump twice asked the Ukrainian  leader to get to the bottom of it, including in connection to an  investigation into the debunked conspiracy theory of Ukrainian  interference in the 2016 election. It also mirrored the language of the  text message that Ambassador Volker sent to President Zelensky's aide  just before the July 25 call.   Indeed, despite the President's self-serving denials, the message was  clear: President Trump wanted the investigations, and he would withhold  not one but two acts vested in him by the power of his office in order  to get them.   Now begins September, September 1.   The President was supposed to go to Warsaw, as we know, but he does  not go to Warsaw. Mike Pence goes to Warsaw. Jennifer Williams, the  special adviser to the Vice President for Europe and Russia, learned of  the change in the President's travel plans on August 29. The Vice  President's National Security Advisor asked, at the request of Vice  President Pence, for an update on the status of the security assistance  that had just been publicly revealed in POLITICO and would be a  critical issue during the bilateral meeting between the Vice President  and President Zelensky in Warsaw.   The delegation arrived in Warsaw and gathered in a hotel room to  brief Vice President Pence before he met with the Ukrainian President.  National Security Advisor Bolton led the meeting.   As Williams described it, advisers in the room ``agreed on the need  to get a final decision on security assistance as soon as possible so  that it could be implemented before the end of the year, but Vice  President Pence did not have authority from the President to release  the aid.''   Ambassador Sondland also attended that briefing. At the end of it, he  expressed concern directly to Vice President Pence about the security  assistance being held until the Ukrainians announced the very same  politically motivated investigations at the heart of this scheme.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Chairman SCHIFF. You mentioned that you also had a       conversation with Vice President Pence before his meeting       with President Zelensky in Warsaw and that you raised a       concern you had, as well, that the security assistance was       being withheld because of the President's desire to get a       commitment from Zelensky to pursue these political       investigations. What did you say to the Vice President?        Ambassador SONDLAND. I was in a briefing with several       people, and I just spoke up, and I said: It appears that       everything is stalled until this statement gets made. It was       something--words to that effect. That's what I believe to be       the case based on, you know, the work that the three of us       had been doing--Volker, Perry, and myself--and the Vice       President nodded like, you know, he heard what I said, and       that was pretty much it as I recall.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Everyone was in the loop. Ambassador Sondland  testified that Vice President Pence was neither surprised nor dismayed  by the description of this quid pro quo.   At the beginning of the bilateral meeting between President Zelensky  and Vice President Pence, as expected, the first question from  President Zelensky related to the status of the security assistance.   As Vice President Pence's aide Jennifer Williams testified, President  Zelensky explained that just equally with the financial and fiscal  value of the assistance, that it was the symbolic nature of that  assistance that really was the show of U.S. support for Ukraine and for  Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.   Later that day, Vice President Pence spoke to the President about his  meeting with President Zelensky, but the hold on security assistance  remained in place well after Vice President Pence returned from Warsaw.   After the Warsaw meeting with Vice President Pence, Ambassador  Sondland quickly pulled aside Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's top aide, and  informed him that the aid would not be forthcoming until Ukraine  publicly announced the two investigations that President Trump wanted.   So here we are, after the meeting--right after the meeting. They are  still in Warsaw, and Zelensky pulls aside his Ukrainian counterpart,  Yermak, and explains the aid is not coming until the investigations are  announced.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. Based on my previous communication       with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns       with Mr. Yermak. It was a very, very brief, pulled aside       conversation that happened within a few seconds. I told Mr.       Yermak that I believed that the resumption of U.S. aid would       likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on       the public statement that we have been discussing for many       weeks.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Let's let that sink in for a minute too.   You have heard my colleagues at the other table say: Ukrainians felt  no pressure. There is no evidence they felt any pressure.   Of course, we have already had testimony about how they did feel  pressure, and they didn't want to be drawn into this political  campaign. You saw over  [[Page S477]]  and over in these text messages and emails: No, you go first. You  announce. No, you go first. Yet we are supposed to believe they felt no  pressure? There it is. It breaks out into the open. The military aid is  being withheld, and there is a connection between the holding of the  military aid and these investigations.   The first thing they are asking about--and they send the copy of the  article--is: What is happening with this aid? They are ready to come to  DC to plead for the aid. They go to Warsaw. They meet with the Vice  President. The first question is the aid.   And what happens after that meeting? Now, that was a big meeting, by  the way, with the Vice President and the Ukrainian delegation. It is  not likely, in front of all of those people, the Vice President is  going to bring it up.   So Sondland goes up to his counterpart right after that, on the  sidelines of that meeting, and he says basically: Ya ain't getting the  money until you do the investigations.   And we are to believe they felt no pressure? Folks, they are at war.  They are at war, and they are being told: You are not getting $400  million in aid you need unless you do what the President wants, and  what the President wants are these two investigations.   If you don't believe that is pressure, that is $400 million worth of  pressure, I got a bridge I want to sell you.   It is hard for to us put ourselves in the Ukrainians' position. I  mean, imagine if the eastern third of our country were occupied by an  enemy force, and we are beholden to another country for military aid,  and they are saying: You are not going to get it until you do what we  want. Do you think we would feel pressure? I think we would feel  pressure, and that is exactly the situation the Ukrainians were in.   You heard the other counsel say before: Well, but they say they don't  feel pressure--like they are going to admit they were being shaken down  by the President of the United States. You think they feel pressure  now, you should see what kind of pressure they would feel if they  admitted that.   Tim Morrison, the NSC official, witnessed the conversation between  Sondland and Yermak from across the room and immediately thereafter  received the summary from Ambassador Sondland. He reported the  substance of that conversation to his boss, Ambassador Bolton. He told  Morrison to ``consult with the lawyers.'' Go talk to the lawyers.   You know, if you keep getting told you got to go talk to the lawyers,  there is a problem. If things are perfect, you don't get told ``go talk  to the lawyers'' time and again.   Morrison confirmed that he did talk to the lawyers, in part to ensure  there was a record of what Ambassador Sondland was doing. That record  exists within the White House. Would you like me to read you that  record? I would be happy to read you that record. It is there for your  asking. Of course the President has refused to provide that record.   Precisely why did Ambassador Bolton direct Morrison to tell the  lawyers, talk to the lawyers? Would you like Ambassador Bolton to tell  you why he said that? He would be happy to tell you why he said that.  He is there for your asking.   What did Bolton know about the freeze in aid prior to this meeting in  Warsaw? What did he mean that he can press Zelensky--it is going to  depend on whether you can press Zelensky? Would you like to know what  that meant? I would like to know what he meant by that. I think we know  what he meant by that.   Tim Morrison also conveyed the substance of the Sondland-Yermak pull- aside to his colleague Ambassador Taylor. So this is now Tim Morrison  told by Bolton ``go talk to the lawyers,'' and he talks to, also,  Ambassador Taylor, our Ambassador in Ukraine.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. On the evening of September 1st, I       received a readout of the Pence-Zelensky meeting over the       phone from Mr. Morrison during which he told me that       President Zelensky had opened the meeting by immediately       asking the Vice President about the security cooperation. The       Vice President did not respond substantively but said that he       would talk to President Trump that night. The Vice President       did say that President Trump wanted the Europeans to do more       to support Ukraine and that he wanted the Ukrainians to do       more to fight corruption.        During the same phone call with Mr. Morrison, he described       the conversation Ambassador Sondland had with Mr. Yermak in       Warsaw. Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security       assistance money would not come until President Zelensky       committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.        I was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the       Sondland-Yermak conversation.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Ambassador Taylor then explained why he was so  alarmed by this turn. Let's hear that as well.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
