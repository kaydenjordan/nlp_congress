 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, every Minnesotan deserves access to high- quality healthcare no matter where they live. However, too many of my  neighbors face difficulty traveling long distances to the nearest  hospital or even finding a nearby pharmacy. On top of that,  prescription drug prices are skyrocketing and putting lifesaving  medications out of reach for too many families.   These critical issues--access to healthcare and the price of  prescription drugs--are the top issues I hear about in my district.  Therefore, my amendment would take a step toward addressing these  issues by giving the Health Resources and Services Administration's, or  HRSA, Federal Office of Rural Health Policy an additional $1 million to  prioritize its coordination with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to  establish its rural health liaison.   This amendment builds on report language in the underlying bill that  encourages HRSA to coordinate with the U.S. Department of Agriculture  to ensure communities have access to the full suite of Federal  resources and that those resources are used effectively for health  outcomes.   Madam Chair, for a bit of additional background, Representative Cheri  Bustos and Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, their bipartisan Rural  Health Liaison Act of 2018 was ultimately included in the 2018 farm  bill and established this rural health liaison position.                                time  0245    The liaison position at USDA will be responsible for working with the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to better coordinate rural  health resources across Federal agencies. This new program is critical  to rural areas, which have historically lacked access to adequate  healthcare, and this disparity is getting worse.   It is vital that we move forward to close these gaps and address the  rural shortage of hospitals, medical professionals, mental health  services, and other healthcare resources to ensure that every family  can access the healthcare that they need.   Madam Chairwoman, as a Member of the House Agriculture Committee, I  have made it a priority to partner with rural communities to improve  access to healthcare, broadband, housing, and quality of life for those  who live there. This amendment is part of that commitment.   Our fight for more affordable, accessible healthcare must include  rural America if we are going to truly address this critical issue.  When our rural communities are healthy, all of our communities are  healthy.   Madam Chairwoman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro), the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.    Madam Chairwoman, I urge my colleagues as well to support  this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    May I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Madam Chairwoman, I would like to point out that I, too,  am concerned about $22 trillion in deficits. But I can tell you, the  rural people in my district, they are very concerned about the $1  trillion tax bill that was a giveaway to the top 5 percent and large  corporations in this country.   I grew up in a mobile home park, and that was the last time we tried  trickle-down economics in this country, and nothing trickled down to my  family. So I will tell the gentleman this: If he wants to find $21  million since we have been here tonight, let's take a look at the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act and have real middle-class tax reform.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, as a mother of four sons, the wife of  an educator, and the daughter of a teacher, I know that we should never  underestimate the power of a high-quality education, and we need the  Federal Government to be a strong partner in this effort.   That starts by fully funding special education. Unfortunately, for  far too long, the Federal Government has not lived up to its commitment  to fully fund special ed. Under the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act, or IDEA, the Federal Government is required to fund  special education up to 40 percent per pupil. Special education  programs in Minnesota currently receive as little as 8 percent.   My amendment, which I am incredibly proud to introduce today with my  Minnesota colleague, Representative Pete Stauber, stresses the  importance of IDEA grants to States to address funding gaps in special  education programs.   These grants are given to each State to ensure that adequate  resources are being devoted to special education programs.   As the mother of a son with learning challenges, I am proud to fight  for our children and our communities. I want to thank the  Appropriations Committee for working on this issue, and I applaud their  work in increasing funding for IDEA.   This bill provides over $14 billion for special education, an  increase of $1 billion over the 2019 enacted level. This is a great  start toward that 40 percent. Special education should be a critical  piece of any conversation surrounding education because for too long,  we haven't given it the attention or the resources it deserves.   I am listening to my district. My district wants the Federal  Government to send its tax dollars back to Eagan, and Apple Valley, and  South Saint Paul, and West Saint Paul, and all of the places where we  can do what we need to do for our kids.   This isn't just about special education children. It has a ripple  effect. When we fail to fund special ed programs, that money is taken  from other  [[Page H4618]]  budgets in our schools to make up the difference, and all students end  up at a disadvantage.   Every student deserves access to a quality education no matter how  they learn. Our public schools give kids the skills they need to become  future leaders in our communities and earn a good life for their  families. Special education can make all of the difference in a  student's life and in a family's life, and we must take action to  ensure we are properly supporting these students.   Madam Chairwoman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), chairwoman of the House Appropriations  Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies.    Madam Chairwoman, I urge my colleague to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, education is at the core of our communities,  but for too long, students have been told that traditional, 4-year  degrees are their only option for finding good-paying jobs.   In reality, we have a major skills gap in Minnesota. We are unable to  find skilled workers for the jobs that exist.   I have one son in high school, two in traditional 4-year colleges,  and my last son, Josh, just graduated from a career training program.  He is my son with multiple job offers.   Career and technical education needs to be a critical investment in  order to connect workers with the right training to help keep our  economy strong.   My amendment stresses the importance of Perkins funding in adult  education to ensure that we are devoting adequate resources to job  training programs. Expanding access to grants for career and technical  education, including apprenticeships, is critical.   Minnesota's economy depends on bright, talented young people, and we  need to make sure that they have the skills they need to succeed. That  starts with taking a new approach to postsecondary education and  training and expanding career and technical education opportunities.   Everyone should be able to get the skills and training that they need  to find a good-paying job. To make this a reality, we need to take a  fresh look at our job market, our education system, and the way we  prepare students for the workforce. That starts by investing in these  programs and helping our young people see 2-year degrees as part of  their career path.   We have to change the way we think about postsecondary education in  this country. We have to look at the economy in education, and a  critical piece is investing in career skills and technical education.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
