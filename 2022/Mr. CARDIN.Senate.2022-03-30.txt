 Mr. President, we are at a critical point in our battle  against COVID-19. While we are still losing Americans to the virus, we  have reached a stage where most of us are able to resume many of the  daily activities we used to regard as normal. But our sustained effort  to improve health outcomes and keep our economy on track is running out  of funding. Now is the time to act.   Over the last 2 years, our communities have taken necessary  mitigation measures. Healthcare and frontline workers have given  everything they have to care for our loved ones. The Biden  administration, with funding provided through the American Rescue Plan,  has worked hard to ensure we had the resources necessary to continue to  adapt our response to COVID-19.   After the peak of the Omicron variant, the reduced COVID-19  transmissions has made it safer to reconnect with friends and family  and resume some of the activities we have all missed during the past 2  years. Due to the tireless work of the Biden administration, testing  capacity and therapeutics are more available than they have been at any  time during the pandemic. Over 81 percent of Americans who are 5 years  or older have had at least one COVID-19 vaccination, and nearly 50  percent of Americans who are eligible are fully vaccinated and have had  a booster. In Maryland, 91 percent of Marylanders 5 and older have had  at least one COVID-19 vaccination shot.   Overall, we have made significant strides in fighting the COVID-19  pandemic, but the threat is not over. Many Americans have children who  are too young to be vaccinated and are immunocompromised or otherwise  at high risk, so they may not be able to resume normal activities.  While positivity rates and hospitalizations are decreasing, almost 700  Americans still are dying, on average, each day.   Additionally, new variants continue to emerge. Countries across  Europe and Asia have seen new spikes in cases due to a more contagious  version of Omicron known as BA.2. We could soon see a renewed surge as  we are oftentimes only weeks behind rising cases in Europe. This latest  subvariant already makes up 35 percent of the cases here in the United  States.   Fortunately, at this stage, BA.2 appears no more severe than the  original Omicron variant. In the United Kingdom, however, as BA.2  increased, children 2 to 11 years old had the highest rate of  infections of any group in the country, the younger children.   To respond rapidly to emerging variants, we must keep financing  pandemic prevention and response needs. The White House and the  Department of Health and Human Services have made it clear that at  least $22.5 billion of additional funding is necessary to replenish  pandemic prevention programs that are nearing completion or have  already been depleted. Without these funds, we will have to cut back on  critical aspects of the pandemic response.   Here are some examples. Our national testing capacity will decline,  leaving us vulnerable and less able to detect emerging variants. It  will become harder to diagnose infections early enough to take  effective treatments. Also, uninsured individuals may no longer be able  to access vaccines, tests, and treatments for free. This will cut off a  critical support for uninsured individuals and health providers who  care for them if they become ill with COVID-19.   In addition to testing and acute care, vital COVID-19 research will  suffer if we do not provide sufficient funding. Continued development  of new medications and vaccines is critical, but without additional  funding, research will stop, leaving us potentially vulnerable to a  variant resistant to our current arsenal. Specifically, the National  Institutes of Health may shut down some of its COVID-19 research.   Further, the Food and Drug Administration recently granted an  emergency use authorization for a new monoclonal antibody treatment  that is effective against the Omicron variant. Without additional  funding, however, the Federal Government won't be able to continue  ordering the monoclonal antibody treatments, vital therapies for  immunocompromised patients, and antiviral pills, all of which are  already in short supply.    Additional funding is critically important if we want to see the  United States continue its leadership role in distributing vaccinations  across the world to prevent more and worse variants from taking off and  arriving on our shores.   I will continue to fight to ensure that we get additional COVID-19  funding. The American Rescue Plan Act demonstrated our ability to pass  legislation that quickly ramped up pandemic response efforts and  effectively mitigated the negative economic impact of the pandemic.  This legislation has been critical in helping individuals and  communities respond to the challenges brought on by the pandemic. Local  governments have had to provide essential services at an unprecedented  level, and they have risen to the occasion without falling into  financial ruin. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas.   Restaurants, for example, still need help. The American Rescue Plan  created the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, but the $28.6 billion  provided to the program was not enough to meet demand. I remain gravely  disappointed that the fiscal year 2022 omnibus spending package  Congress passed earlier this month did not include additional  assistance for restaurants and other hard-hit small businesses. For the  last 2 years of the pandemic, nearly all restaurants have been under  great strain as they have struggled to keep staff and adapt to the new  variants, while facing increased pricing due to supply chain  disruptions and inflation. And those have been the restaurants  fortunate enough to survive the pandemic. Thousands have closed their  doors for good.   More than 100,000 restaurants received grants from the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund that have helped them keep their doors open, but  more than 180,000 restaurants that submitted their applications on time  to receive funds--their applications were there--have received no funds  at all. That is not fair, and they desperately need our help.   If Congress had not acted quickly to replenish the Paycheck  Protection Program when it ran out of money weeks after it opened in  April 2020--and we did that, by the way, with strong, almost unanimous  support, and it was hundreds of billions of dollars that we were  short--the program would have been a half-measure, necessary but not  sufficient. Instead, we extended the emergency aid needed to meet the  crisis we faced, and that is exactly what we need to do again with the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund.   For the past 2 years plus, I have worked hard to secure vital  resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that those who are  struggling from the economic effects or emotional toll have the  necessary support going forward. I will continue that fight.  [[Page S1850]]    The novel virus continues to challenge our Nation and the world, so  we must be prepared. I urge the Senate to pass necessary additional  funding for COVID-19 relief so Americans can continue to face this  challenge head-on and prevail.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this March, as we mark National Colorectal  Cancer Awareness Month, we must remember those we have lost to  colorectal cancer, acknowledge the progress we have made to date to  reduce colorectal cancer cases, and renew our commitment to fighting  this devastating illness. Since its inception in 2000, National  Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month has given us the opportunity to raise  awareness and remind people of the importance of cancer screening in  the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer.   While cases of colorectal cancer have declined, it is still the  second leading cause of cancer death among men and women combined in  the U.S. This year alone, more than 150,000 Americans will be diagnosed  with colorectal cancer. Over 52,000 people will die from the disease.  In 2018, 2,597 Marylanders were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and  982 patients died from it.   Colorectal cancer has a disproportionate impact among racial and  ethnic minorities, particularly Black Americans, Jews of Eastern  European descent, and Indigenous communities. Black men are 22 percent  more likely than non-Hispanic White men are, and Black women are 18  percent more likely than non-Hispanic White women to be diagnosed with  colorectal cancer. American Indians and Alaska Natives are 10 percent  more likely than non-Hispanic White Americans to die of colorectal  cancer. Jews of Eastern European decent are two to three times more  likely to get colorectal cancer than the greater population.   Fortunately, because of early detection and prevention tools,  colorectal cancer is among the most preventable of all cancers.  Colorectal cancer screenings not only detect the disease in its early  stages, but can catch precancerous growths, or polyps, too. When these  polyps are found, they can be removed and prevent cancer from  occurring. Regular screening saves lives. Over 60 percent of deaths  from colorectal cancer could have been prevented with screening, but  one in three adults in the U.S. aged 45 to 75 years old is still not  getting screened as recommended. Colonoscopies are one of the most  effective screening methods for colorectal cancer.   That is why I have long worked to increase access to colonoscopies.  The Affordable Care Act ensured that Medicare would cover the cost of  screening colonoscopies without cost-sharing for most seniors, but the  work was not done. Since 2013, I led the Removing Barriers to  Colorectal Cancer Screening Act with Senators Brown, Wicker, and  Collins to ensure Medicare beneficiaries would not be charged for a  colonoscopy, regardless of whether a polyp or tissue is removed. This  legislation was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of  2021. The law decreases barriers to screening by ensuring that seniors  do not have to worry about unexpected medical costs if a polyp is  detected and removed during a screening colonoscopy.   I am also proud of the work Maryland is doing to decrease rates of  colorectal cancer. Through the Maryland Colorectal Cancer Control  Program, Maryland has used funding from the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention--CDC--and the State's CRF Cancer Prevention Education,  Screening, and Treatment Program to promote screening. The program  partners with local health departments, community health centers, and  various health systems, among other entities. Because of these and  other initiatives, 72.5 percent of adults 50 years and older in  Maryland were up-to-date with colorectal cancer screenings in 2018,  slightly above the Healthy People 2020 target of 70.5 percent.   Still, we must do more to ensure younger Americans are aware of their  risks of colorectal cancer and its symptoms and get the appropriate  [[Page S1863]]  screenings to prevent and detect the disease. This year, Fight  Colorectal Cancer placed 27,400 blue flags on the National Mall to  represent the number of people under 50 expected to be diagnosed with  colorectal cancer in 2030. The installation not only raises awareness  of the increase in colorectal cancer in this younger population but  also serves as a tribute to all those touched by the disease. By 2030,  colorectal cancer is projected to be the leading cancer killer for  those aged 20 to 49.   This is why continued investments in awareness and screening programs  and research into effective treatments are so essential. Colorectal  cancer research is one of the least funded among different cancers. I  am proud of the work that the National Institutes of Health's National  Cancer Institute and other Maryland-based research institutions and  healthcare providers have done to reduce colorectal cancer rates, but  they all need more resources.   We have made progress in combatting colorectal cancer, but there is  more work for us to do. This is why I will continue to work my  colleagues to fight this terrible disease.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  outstanding leadership of Donald B. Tobin, Esquire, as dean of the  University of Maryland Francis Carey King School of Law, following his  announcement that he will step down at the end of the 2021-2022  academic year and return to full-time teaching as a member of the  Maryland Carey Law faculty. This decision concludes an 8-year chapter  in service to the school's 645 students, 176 faculty members, and  thousands of alumni. Dean Tobin has been a tireless advocate and  instructor who truly treasures the law school community.   Donald Tobin has been dean and professor of law at my alma mater, the  University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law located in  Baltimore City, since 2014. Under his leadership, the law school has  built upon two centuries of distinguished history to deliver its core  academic mission of integrating legal theory and practice, serving as a  resource and partner to neighboring communities and training the next  generation of excellent lawyers and leaders. As dean, he has risen to  meet the unprecedented challenges of the last decade.   Donald Tobin grew up in Columbia, MD, and began his career on Capitol  Hill, as a professional staff member for my predecessor, the inimitable  U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes. Donald also staffed the Senate Committee on  the Budget and the Joint Economic Committee. He worked on the Hill  before, during, and after the time he was attending law school at  Georgetown University, where he earned his J.D. in 1996. It was here in  this Chamber that Donald first contributed to policy at the national  level. He went on to serve as a law clerk for the Honorable Francis  Murnaghan, Jr., of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and  as an appellate attorney in the Tax Division of the U.S. Department of  Justice. Donald remains a leading expert on the intersection of tax and  campaign finance laws, an area of law more critical to our democracy  today than ever before.   Donald was professor of law and associate dean for academic affairs  and associate dean for faculty at the Ohio State University Moritz  College of Law before he decided to come back home to Maryland. Given  his wealth of expertise, I am particularly excited for him to rejoin  the faculty as a professor in this next phase of his career. Donald has  demonstrated an abiding passion for education, scholarship, and the  public service mission of the law school. He has wisely invested his  time in understanding the needs of the Maryland legal and nonprofit  community. And he has fostered a supportive community that provides  personalized learning experiences, which empower the school's students  to realize countless possible career pathways.   Donald has always provided a welcoming presence around the school. He  has taught the popular ``Lawyers as Leaders'' class, and he has put his  tax law knowledge and Maryland Bar membership to use by working with  students in the Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic.   The Clinical Law Program makes experiential education a core  component of the law school's curriculum, and it makes advancing access  to justice a prerequisite for graduation. This program is unique among  law schools nationally.   The law school requires every student who initially enrolls as a  first year, full-time day student to provide legal services to people  who are poor or otherwise lack access to justice in order to graduate-- a provision known as the ``Cardin Requirement,'' which I championed. It  attracts students who care deeply about their clients and their  communities.   It is no surprise that students attracted to a law school for its  spirit of excellence in public service would choose someone of Donald's  character for its leader. He brings that same personal attention to the  law school's relationships among its many constituents, the bar, and  the surrounding community.   Donald's positivity and kind nature were critical to his success  throughout a deanship ``book-ended'' by unthinkable events. In the  aftermath of the killing of Freddie Gray in the spring of 2015, Donald  led efforts to expand the law school's positive impact in the  community, bolstering channels to local volunteer opportunities and  providing forums for students and faculty to explore the systemic  causes that led to Baltimore's unrest and to possible solutions. Donald  redoubled the school's efforts to recruit and retain highly qualified  and diverse students, while keeping legal education accessible and  affordable. Our law firms, judicial benches, and nonprofit leadership  should all equitably reflect Maryland's population. Donald's commitment  to facilitating an inclusive law school community has brought us closer  to this imperative.   As a member of the Law School Board of Visitors, I greatly appreciate  Donald's support for establishing the Honorable Elijah E. Cummings `76  Scholarship Endowment at the law school in 2019. The scholarship pays  apt tribute to our former colleague--another luminary of the Maryland  congressional delegation--and to his many contributions to his District  and to our  [[Page S1864]]  Nation as one of our most distinguished alumni. Board of visitors  member and former chair Bob Kim--class of 1983--has spearheaded  establishing the scholarship, which will support law school students  who have an interest in public service, a record of academic  excellence, and demonstrated financial need.   Toward what would be the end of his time as dean, Donald maintained a  cohesive law school community despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustained  high turnout at virtual versions of beloved events such as the alumni  honors banquet and Morris Brown Myerowitz Moot Court Competition  evinced this resilience and unity, with alumni volunteers serving as  mock judges or interviewers, during a time of social distancing.   Even before the global pandemic, Donald took an active role in  protecting student health and well-being, instituting Kindness Week to  promote student resources and self-care in partnership with the board  of visitors.   William Butler Yeats wrote, ``Education is not the filling of a pot  but the lighting of a fire.'' For over 20 years now, Donald Tobin has  been lighting fires among his students, and their glow has brought  light to the law school community, the city, our State, and the Nation.  I thank him for his tremendous service to the law school's students,  faculty, staff and alumni, and I wish him well on this exciting new  chapter in his exemplary career.                            ____________________
