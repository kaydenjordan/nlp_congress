 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, having read over the amendment, there  are a couple of concerns I want to walk you through. And please  understand, I am one of those--I co-chair the Blockchain Caucus. I have  a fascination with could we ever move to encrypted blockchain security  of these levels of information.   But if you actually walk through this amendment, it is a little  hollow in its details. The executive director gets to appoint a 15- member, we will call it, committee. Tell me that those 15 members in  this amendment can't have relationships with a certain security firm,  or with a certain vendor, or with certain things. I will argue that you  are creating now functionally a fourth committee within the commission  and handing an awful lot of power to the executive director without a  lot of guidelines, that should actually, in many ways, make both  Democrats and Republicans a bit nervous.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate and I love the concepts of  technology. I am really concerned. This should actually be a bipartisan  concern, because at some point is that executive director going to be  one party or another, or demonstrate certain political bias?   But if you hand sole authority to the executive director to appoint a  15-member commission that is going to establish saying, here is how we  are going to review these grants and what sort of grants and direction,  I am sorry, but you are creating all sorts of both policy leakage here,  potentially a favoritism to certain either technologies or securities  or firms.   I don't have a problem with the attention. I think it is actually an  authority that should have been given to one of the other committees  instead of creating a fourth one, because we have this tendency, as  Members of Congress, to sort of create bureaucracies on top of  bureaucracies.   But please understand--and I am being as genuine as I can--I fear  that it may not happen now, it may not happen for a few years, but you  are creating, as technology changes, as there will be a time in our  future where I may be voting through a blockchain technology on my  phone, have you just created the very commission that actually said:  Hey, here is the security mechanics. Oh, by the way, our security  mechanics favor the seven people who actually have a relationship to  this particular security encryption who have a friend who is a friend?  I am sorry; it is just not designed with enough comfort when this is  about our voting system.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, having been here for a little while, be  careful--good intentions--and when people often bring those issues and  bring those--be careful. You may have good intentions. And the  intentions of often those who bring us a thought or an issue, until we  have vetted whether they have particular potential economic interests-- I am just sharing my concern--the amendment, just as it is designed  right now, our side is going to have to vote no because we create a  fourth level. We don't create enough definitions. We hand so much power  to the executive director.   Mr. Chairman, I would love to talk to the gentlewoman about election  encryption and my personal fixation on blockchain technology. But for  this one, I think we may miss the mark.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I actually appreciate the study  mechanisms, but this is actually one a little bit broader.   How many of us are from States that have actually had public funding  or public matching of our State legislatures?   I am from Arizona; I have actually lived this experience. And do  understand, we used to--in Arizona--refer to it as the ``no new  moderates'' piece of legislation.   If you actually look at what happened to Arizona--and my  understanding is this happened in other States--personal experience: I  was 28 years old when I got elected to the Arizona Legislature.   I was there. You had to go knock on a door. You had to ask someone  for a couple hundred dollars. You had to listen to them. They would  look you in the eye, and if they thought you weren't worthy, you walked  out the door without anything. It turns out asking for money is part of  the vetting process.   Well, a few years later--so we have had it for 25 years in Arizona-- here is what happened:   You are part of the group over here on the right or you are part of  this group on the left. In Arizona, you get a couple hundred people to  write you a $5 contribution, and you get elected. Within two election  cycles, we wiped out half of Democrats, half of Republicans, maybe one- third of the body who were in the moderates.   So when I was in that State legislature for 4 years, half the  Republicans were conservatives, half the Republicans were moderate;  same thing on the Democratic side. After just functionally 4 years of  public funding or public match, they were gone.   I appreciate the study of saying: Hey, this amendment is really about  knowing, you know, do the dollars match, do the mechanisms match? And I  don't know if the FEC is the right place to go to say: Are we about to  try to finance the bipolar--the extremisms on both ends?   In many ways, this piece of legislation--at least this mechanic right  here--you have got to understand what you are doing. You are going to  wipe out the middle.   This is, in many ways, the ``no new moderates'' piece of legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I accept this as--and I don't mean this in  a mean fashion, but I accept this as one of the tenets of faith on the  Democratic side.   The gentleman from Maryland--wonderfully articulate--that isn't what  happened. I mean, you have 25 years in other States and other  communities, particularly in legislative bodies. I thought the same  thing.   But the fact of the matter is, what you do in this fashion is the  person who is part of a certain leftist group, right group: I just need  these folks to write me enough checks so that I get enough matching, or  a good direct mail vendor who hits the ideological extreme so I get  those dollars.   Those aren't the facts. And on occasion, we have to take a step back  and take a look at sort of the incubators of democracy and experience,  which is our State legislatures, and understand the reality of what has  happened.   I am a conservative. It worked out fine for my view of the world, but  understand--at least in my State legislature--within 4 years, this type  of plan completely changed the character of the population that was  representing the people in Arizona.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, wishes and hopes and optimism are not  public policy. Be careful what you are asking for here. There are real- life examples across our country with what this did to our democracy.  Understand the damage you are about to do.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, and to my friend, thank you for  stalling.   What we are doing tonight--and we will try to do it somewhat  efficiently so you don't have to spend too much time in the Chair--is  every week we have been taking a half an hour or so--tonight we may do  something less--and sort of walking through what we believe is actually  an idea that actually saves this country. And not to be too  melodramatic, but let's actually walk through some of the mathematical  realities.   We have 74 million baby boomers moving into retirement. The peak of  the baby boom is just a couple years away from retirement. So baby  boom, 74 million over an 18-year period.   If you look at Federal spending, the growth in Federal spending from  2008 to 2028 as CBO has calculated--2008 to 2028--91 percent of all the  growth in Federal spending is interest, Social Security, healthcare  entitlement.   I know this doesn't sort of fit the mantra that you so often hear  around here from Republicans and Democrats, but it is math.   We have a demographic issue. We are getting old much faster than  almost anytime--anytime, I think--in our society, and our birth rates  have substantially collapsed.   So one of the things we have come to is saying: How do you maximize  economic vitality in our society so we can keep our promises, those  promises of earned benefits like Social Security or promises such as  earned benefits of Medicare?   We believe we have five pillars, so we always start with this chart,  and you can do them in any fashion you want.   Last week, we actually did 30 minutes--which I am sure was riveting  for anyone who was willing to watch--on labor force participation, but  it is important.   If you go back over the last couple years and look at some of the CBO  reports, repeatedly there are sections in there that talk about: What  is the barrier to economic expansion in our country?   They will often talk about two things: capital stock, basically,  savings rates, money to be lent into the economy to multiply, to build  things, to grow things; and the second thing is population, labor force  availability.   Well, it turns out, since tax reform, the capital stock numbers have  been much better than almost any of us had expected in the modeling. So  our restraint on economic expansion turns out to be substantially labor  force.   Okay. So that is what we talked about last week. How do you draw in  millennial males? How do you add incentives to those who are older to  stay in the labor force? So that was last week.   We have also actually talked about what we will have to do--and every  week we are going to do one of these--dealing with the earned benefits.  Are there things we can do in those earned benefits to add some  competition for when someone is buying their medical benefits through  Medicare? Can we add certain incentives?   Say I am healthy. I wish to work longer. Can we give you certain  incentives to either of those programs in the Tax Code to stay in the  labor force as long as you are healthy?   And we actually see other societies around the world--you know, look  at Japan and others--who are actually having to work through this  concept as their demographics get older. How do they actually keep as  much of their population still within the labor force so the economy  continues to stay stable and grow?                                time  2000    Economic growth, we are going to do a whole presentation on  everything you do from designing a Tax Code that stays competitive in  the world, somewhat like we did a year-plus ago, that incentivizes  capital formation, incentivizes investment in plant and equipment and  technology, because we had gone functionally almost two decades with  very little productivity growth.   Do you want to pay Americans more? Well, what is the formula? Do we  all remember our high school economics class? What are the two elements  that go into typical growth in someone's salary? Well, it is inflation.  If you get an inflation adjustment, you are not getting any further  ahead. You are just sort of holding steady. It is productivity.   When we look at the formulas that end up organically, systematically  thought through, when businesses pay their workers more, here is the  inflation adjustment. By the way, we bought a new plant; we bought new  equipment; we bought new technology. We are able to make this many more  widgets now. Our productivity has gone up. We can pay more. That is the  key reason.   We functionally have gone a couple decades with very little wage  growth because we didn't have productivity growth.   As we start to talk about economic growth, it is going to be  everything from designing a Tax Code that maximizes that type of  growth, to trade policy that maximizes economic expansion in our  country, all the way down to how you design a rational regulatory  environment.   Some people like to come behind these microphones and talk about  deregulation or re-regulation. I want to make the argument that we  should be, as a society, talking about smart regulation.   You have a supercomputer in your pocket or your purse, that phone you  have. Why aren't we using much more technology to be the driver of our  regulatory environment?   A simple example: What would happen if you could crowd source data on  the environment? You could have a few thousand people. If you are in a  large urban area or other areas that have a sensor on your phone that  says, hey, I am going to help crowd source ozone,  [[Page H2501]]  or crowd source volatile organics, or whatever, our environmental  regulator is no longer a file cabinet of paperwork where we put paper  and document more, document more. Instead, it is almost like a quick  reaction for us of: Hey, the sensors are saying there is a hotspot over  here. Let's go deal with it.   I think it is time we revolutionize what we consider financial,  environmental, health types of regulations, realizing we have  technology today that would make us healthier, more prosperous, our  financial markets much more stable, and the time between a bad act and  something getting fixed could be minutes, not years.   An example is, if you had certain types of technology, a Bernie  Madoff could never happen because you would instantly know his accounts  don't match his bank accounts.   The other one we are going to do next week is technology disruption.  What happens if you could go home and, at home, you have this thing  that looks like a large kazoo? You could blow into it, and it instantly  tells you if you have the flu or not and then instantly could order  your antivirals. A couple hours later, those antivirals could be  delivered to your home. How much healthier would you be?   We are going to bring in a whole series of healthcare technologies  that is a true disruption because, remember, part of our premise is, if  you look at the cost curves, so much of it is Medicare. The fact is, we  do not have the resources set aside to keep our promises right now.   That technology, if we do the adoption, if we remove the barriers,  could be an amazing disruption in the price of healthcare because this  body--let's be brutally honest--for a decade, we have been having the  wrong debate. We have the ACA over here, which, functionally, just  moved around who got to pay. We had many of our Republican alternatives  that we believed would add some competition and those things, but it  was, substantially, who got to pay.   It is time the Republicans and Democrats got together to understand  there is a technology revolution out there that could be, that can be,  that will be the price disrupter on healthcare, if this body is willing  to remove those barriers to that technology.   Imagine being able to have certain wearables, whether you are the  type of person who walks around with a smartwatch or the type of person  who has the patch that can read your blood oxygen and these types of  things, or the autonomous healthcare clinics that are being  experimented with in the Phoenix-Scottsdale market.   There is a revolution happening out there. We need more of it. We  need to adopt it faster. We need to remove the barriers and stop having  these crazy conversations of little, incremental changes. We need the  disruption.   As we walk through, part of the premise is, if you look at this  slide, and I brought this slide in previous discussions, 91 percent of  the spending growth between 2008 and 2028, interest, Social Security,  healthcare, and functionally the healthcare entitlements.   When you look at that, you start to realize these other colors you  see here are functionally the other portions of the budget. Nondefense  is green. Yellow is defense. Their percentage of the growth and  spending is substantially flat. A little growth here, a little growth  there, but the explosion in the curve, where you see those lines going  up, is interest, Social Security, and healthcare entitlements.   Why doesn't this place, why don't we as Members of Congress, have the  honest conversation that, if you care about the debt, if you care about  retirement security, if you care about these things, this is the honest  conversation?   Take a look at this slide. Between 2018 and 2048, a 30-year period,  and this slide is not adjusted for inflation, you see the little green  bar on the far end? That is the rest of the Federal budget. That is  the non-Social Security, non-Medicare. It is actually $16 trillion to  the positive. How do you end up with $84 trillion in the negative over  those 30 years?    It is functionally the interest and the spending on Social Security,  the interest and the spending on Medicare. I believe we have a moral  obligation to protect these earned entitlements. But you aren't  protecting them by avoiding the subject, and that is what this place  has become famous for doing.   Let's talk about this concept we refer to in our office as sort of  population stability. Remember, this is just one of our five pillars.  In 9 years, our society, and its driven by demographics, will have two  workers for every one person in retirement. Think about that for a  moment.   Programs like Social Security and Medicare, there were four or five,  five-plus workers for every one in their benefits. In 9 years, we moved  2-to-1. What also happens in 9 years? It is the end of the baby-boom  cycle, so the end of the spiked years.   If this slide doesn't make you go ``wow, maybe we should take this  seriously,'' because we should have taken it seriously a couple of  decades ago because we knew people were going to turn 65 from the baby  boom for how many years? Nine years, two workers, one person in  retirement. This is absolutely critical, and this is what is coming to  us.   What are the solutions on this particular pillar we call population  stability? We need to be honest and work hard for policies that  maximize family formation. I don't even know if I have them here--I  hope I do--some of the charts that show you what is happening in the  birth rates around the country.   You do understand, as a nation, we are now well below replacement  rates in our population. This one I particularly like because it is  from my home State of Arizona, but the trendline is almost identical.  We will go through some of that.   If I asked you right now which State had the largest fall in birth  rates, how many of you would have said Arizona? It turns out Arizona  had the largest fall in birth rates. It is a little complicated. You  have to read through the data, but Native Americans and Hispanics,  their birth rates fell substantially and are looking much more like the  mean of the rest of our society.   Apparently, the demographers say, that is wonderful. What it means  is, even though this place sometimes spends a lot of our politics  keeping us apart, the actual demographics say, when we are all having  babies like each other, it is a symbol that the melting pot is working,  that we are all starting to have similar education, live in the same  neighborhoods, have similar job descriptions. Now our family formations  are starting to look very, very similar.   That is wonderful. The melting pot is working. But understand what  that means in the future, having enough workers to participate in  keeping the economy growing and stable.   These pay-as-you-go programs, which are Social Security and Medicare,  have that vitality, and this is a real threat when you start to see  these sorts of numbers and understand what that means.   How do you reach a level of population stability? This is a brand-new  slide for us. We are going to do a little more on what is happening  population-wise. Once you substantially look at, we will call it the  green line, the second one down, do you see that precipitous fall?   If we are right here, that was sort of our last time of being in the  positive, a bit before 2010. Since then, we have continued to fall, and  fall, and fall. Now our demographers are coming back and saying, yeah,  this is sort of the new normal, because it is not just the United  States.   Apparently, this trend is all over the industrialized world. A lot of  the great writers and thinkers on demographics are saying the next  prized asset in the world isn't going to be lithium for batteries or  petroleum products. It is going to be people, smart people.   You are starting to see that around the world where other countries  right now are even starting to change some of their immigration rules  to say, if you have talent, you are given a much faster path to enter  our country. We are going to have to have that very honest conversation  of a major change in our immigration system.   The last slide here, and then we are going to talk about some of the  solutions in this, this is just sort of fun to understand that it is a  trend. We have one or two States that are still bucking the trend of  having positive population growth, and that is through birth rates. But  the rest of the country is substantially collapsing.  [[Page H2502]]    What do you do for population stability? Okay, back to family  formation. Are there things we can do that will work? We have spent  about a year in our office reading literature from around the world,  what they have done in Scandinavia, what they are doing right now in  Hungary, what has been done in a province in Canada, trying to promote  native births. Small, incremental changes--no one has found the magic  formula.   Maybe we as a society have to have this discussion. What works? What  can we do? Is it something you do in the Tax Code? Is it something you  do in family friendly policies? What do we do to maximize family  formation in our country?   Right now, when you start to look at the cost, I have only one  beautiful little girl, and you realize, children are the greatest thing  that ever happened to my wife and I, but it is expensive.   The second part of that population stability discussion is, if you  are over here working on family formation and making sure society  understands the blessing of children in our society, are there  immigration policies that if you are bringing in populations into the  United States that maximize the economic vitality?                                time  2015    So part of this thought experiment, based on the actual numbers in  the last 10 years, the U.S. fall in birthrates functionally equals 4  million children that we expected that with the fallen birthrates will  not be part of our society. You do realize that over 10 years that is  functionally 4 full years of legal immigration.   So let's say we actually were effective in being serious about family  formation here, and we actually started to have an honest discussion of  as a society do we start to do the things such as New Zealand, Great  Britain, Australia, Canada, and others are doing where substantially it  is a talent-based immigration system?   Why do you want to fixate on that?   It is an immigration system that actually has the elegance of we  don't care about your gender, we don't care about your religion, and we  don't care about your race. But what we care about as a society is we  care about the vitality, the energy, and the talent you bring to our  society to maximize the economic growth so we can keep our promises,  particularly on Social Security and Medicare.   Remember, demographics are really the biggest issue we as a society  are facing, except it is really hard to talk about it because the math  is complex.   So are we as a body willing to take on complex issues and understand  you can't just do one of them?   There was a time here a decade ago or so people would come to the  microphone and say: Well, if we do entitlement reform, then we get  this.   We have missed that window.   Now my argument to this country, to my brothers and sisters here in  Congress, is we have to actually reach out to at least the five pillars  we have laid out of maximizing economic growth, and that is everything  from tax policy to trade policy to regulatory policy, and labor force  participation.   How do you design programs, everything from Social Security  Disability to TANF to food stamps to this and that, saying we want you  in the labor force?   What can we do so you have your safety net, but we have got to get  you into the labor force?   What do you do for population stability as we have talked about right  now?   What do you do for dramatic disruptive technology adoption,  particularly for healthcare, but it can also be for environment?   We are going to actually do that in the coming weeks.   Then we will have to step up and have an honest conversation of as  the promised earned benefits, we call entitlements, how can we adjust  and refine them so they incentivize to stay in the labor force, but  they incentivize efficiencies of how healthcare is purchased?   We need to do this as an entire society. Once again, remember, in 9  years, two workers, one person in retirement, one person 65. Over the  20-year period, 2008 to 2028, 91 percent of all the growth in spending  will be interest, Social Security, and healthcare entitlements. In 9  years--the CBO report that came out last month has a beautiful graph in  there--in 9 years, 50 percent of all the noninterest spending coming  from Washington, D.C. will be for those who are 65 and older.   So if you care about keeping our promises, if you care about this  country being able to maintain its place in the world, it is math. It  is demographics. There is a path for us to succeed, but it no longer  works. The math no longer works by just doing one thing or these  little, incremental, petty things I see happening around here on this  floor where it is political power grabs instead of the things that  stabilize and grow our country and protect my 3-year-old daughter and  her economic future and her opportunity to actually live the American  Dream.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
