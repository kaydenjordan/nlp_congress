 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, the Supreme Court struck  down a Louisiana law that would have restricted abortion providers so  severely that Louisiana would have been left with only a single clinic.  These types of laws have popped up in State after State as a backdoor  means of banning abortions--if not in law then in practice--an  insidious campaign to undermine the rights of women to make their own  medical decisions.   Today's ruling is a thunderbolt of justice for millions of American  women who were at risk of having their constitutional rights  invalidated by a reactionary State legislature, as there are many  throughout the country.   After surprising but very welcome rulings on DACA and LGBTQ rights 2  weeks ago, the Supreme Court has once again made the right decision.  The Supreme Court is entering Buffalo Springfield, territory: ``There's  something happening here.''   Truthfully, today's ruling should not have been a surprise. The  Louisiana law violated the Court's precedent. In 2016, the Court struck  down a Texas law that was virtually identical to the one in Louisiana.  The newest addition to the Supreme Court, however, despite promising  the Senate that he would respect precedent, dissented from the  majority's ruling today. Justice Kavanaugh told Senators he believed  Roe v. Wade to be settled law, but in the very first ruling on a  related issue, he decided that the Court's precedent was wrong, and Roe  v. Wade could be greatly undermined.   Thankfully, Kavanaugh's view was not in the majority. Today, America  can breathe a sigh of relief that the Supreme Court kept the floodgates  firmly shut against this particular attempt to nullify the landmark  decision of Roe v. Wade.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Russia, on Friday, the New York Times  and other media outlets reported that a Russian intelligence unit was  offering Taliban-linked fighters bounties--bounties to kill American  and coalition troops in Afghanistan. It should go without saying that  it is our solemn obligation to support and protect our troops. If  Russian intelligence is conducting a shadow campaign to sponsor the  murder of American troops, there must be swift, strong, and  unmistakable consequences for Putin and his cronies--something we  should do in this NDAA bill.   The New York Times reported that the Trump administration was aware  of these activities as early as March of this year. Yet, the Trump  administration has authorized no--no retaliatory actions. Russia gives  bounties to kill Americans; the administration does nothing.   Donald Trump, you are not being a very strong President here, as  usual.   At the very least, you would expect the President and his team would  want to get to the bottom of this. The President claimed, however, that  ``nobody briefed or told [him] me about this report.''   President Trump, you lose either way. If you weren't briefed on this  important report, how can you run an administration where something  this important is not brought to your level? And if you were told about  the report and did nothing, that is even worse. Shame on you. Shame on  you.   A few hours ago, the White House Press Secretary said the President  still has not received a briefing from the intelligence community about  these reports. The White House Chief of Staff, meanwhile, is reportedly  briefing Republican Members of the House before the President of the  United States gets a briefing.   Is that amazing? He is the Commander in Chief. He is the one who is  supposed to be protecting our soldiers, and they are still twiddling  their thumbs instead of giving him a briefing, which, who knows, given  his lack of respect for the truth, he may have received it already and  just denied it.   It raises many, many questions. First, is it true the President was  not told this information? If so, why not? Was there a concern about  sharing this information with the President? And the President doesn't  seem as outraged as you would think he would be if, in fact, the  intelligence community had this vital and important information and had  not briefed him.   Something--something doesn't smell right here, especially when we  have a President and an administration who has a great deal of trouble  telling the truth. We need answers, and we need them fast. I am calling  for the Directors of National Intelligence and the CIA to immediately  brief all 100 Senators on reports that Russia placed bounties on U.S.  troops in Afghanistan. Among many other things, we need to know whether  President Trump was told this information and, if so, when   Because there has been an alarming pattern in this administration,  dating back to its first days of appeasement toward authoritarian  leaders, especially of Vladimir Putin, President Trump stood next to  Putin on the international stage and accepted his word over the word of  our own intelligence agencies. President Trump has delayed or ignored  congressionally mandated sanctions on Putin. The President has pondered  withdrawing from NATO--the organization whose very purpose is to defend  the free world from Vladimir Putin. Only a few months ago, the  President mused about inviting Russia back into the G7.   If we had learned anything in the past 3 years, it is that President  Trump is inclined to ignore or forgive Vladimir Putin's abuses on the  international stage--even in the face of an attack on our democracy. If  we learned anything in the last 3 years, it is that dictators--whether  Xi or Putin or the head of North Korea--played President Trump for a  fool and got the advantage of him every time.   This means we all need to speak up right now and make sure that  Congress and the executive branch are doing what is necessary to get to  the bottom of these reports. The first step is a briefing for all 100  U.S. Senators.   Despite what some administration officials are claiming, no such  briefing has been scheduled, and I am not aware of any Senator who has  been invited to a White House briefing of any sort.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on COVID-19, unfortunately,  COVID-19 continues to surge in several States. Florida, Texas, and  Arizona are reporting new highs in case numbers. Last Friday, there  were 45,000 new cases nationwide--the most in a single day.   As the public health crisis continues, our country is facing one of  the greatest economic challenges since the Great Depression. Over one- fifth of the workforce has requested unemployment assistance. State and  local Tribal governments are on life support and have laid off over 1.6  million workers. Our perennially underfunded schools are fighting an  uphill battle to prepare for the fall.   As Americans struggle to make rent payments and face potential  evictions, as our healthcare and childcare systems face unprecedented  burdens, Senate Republicans have been missing in action. Senate  Republicans equal MIA.   Over a month ago, Leader McConnell said that Senate the Republicans  ``have yet to feel the urgency of acting immediately.'' It seems like  he really meant it. It has been nearly 3 months since we passed the  CARES Act on a bipartisan basis, 96 to 0, and over 45 days since the  House passed the Heroes Act--legislation that would deliver sorely  needed resources to States, essential workers, American families, and  our healthcare system, but Leader McConnell continues to say that  Republicans ``need to assess the conditions in the country'' and  insists that  [[Page S3630]]  any future emergency relief bill will be written in his office.   Assess the conditions of the country when we have more unemployment  than any time since the Great Depression? When a pandemic is killing  tens of thousands of Americans monthly, ignore that and assess the  conditions? And then for Leader McConnell to say the bill will be  written in his office, has he learned any lessons on COVID 2, COVID 3,  COVID 3.5, the Justice in Policing Act? When you try to do something  major on a partisan basis, nothing happens, and America desperately  needs something to happen.   Leader McConnell knows he has to negotiate if he wants to pass  legislation. He has been around here a long time. He knows that. His  refusal to engage in bipartisan talks on policing reform shows that  maybe our Republican friends are not interested in passing bipartisan  legislation, but that is what needs to happen--bipartisan negotiations  on policing reform and bipartisan negotiations on COVID.   This morning, Speaker Pelosi and I sent a letter to Leader McConnell  urging him to join Democrats at the negotiating table for the next  round of COVID-19 relief legislation.   We are on the precipice of several deadlines: For millions upon  millions of Americans, another rent payment is due this week. States  are planning their budgets right now before the new fiscal year on July  1. The emergency boost in unemployment will run out by the end of next  month.   This week, Senate Democrats will force action on the floor on some of  the most urgently needed measures to help working Americans, starting  this evening, when Democrats will ask consent to pass crucial Federal  support for State, local, and Tribal governments.   I will have more to say about this issue this evening, but I do want  my Republican colleagues to hear the words of State and local officials  across the country.   Today, the Big 7 national associations representing Governors,  mayors, State legislatures, counties, and city managers--all bipartisan  groups, with many Republican Members coming from the deepest red States  to the darkest blue--wrote the Senate a letter pleading--pleading for  Federal support and warning of dire consequences of delay. These are  the seven organizations representing Governors and legislatures and  counties and towns and cities.   Here is what they write:         Previous federal bills responding to COVID-19 provided       important support . . . yet none allow for the replacement of       billions of lost revenue due to COVID-19. More robust and       direct stimulus is needed for State and local governments to       both rebuild the economy and maintain essential services in       education, health care, emergency operations, public safety       and more.        Months have gone by and our communities continue to suffer.       Americans have a history of standing together in times of       crisis and must do so now.    Republican colleagues, please listen to those words. Leader  McConnell, please listen. These are your own States that are included  here. They are demanding relief. To say we still don't see an urgent  need, to say maybe we will get around to it in a month, to say the  legislation will be written in McConnell's office--all setting up for  failure and the desperately needed lack of relief that America needs.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Oregon for  his excellent and eloquent words. I want to thank him for being such a  leader on this issue and so many others. I thank my colleague from New  Hampshire, who will speak after me. I think Senator Menendez is  expected here, as well, to say a few words before the unanimous consent  request that will be made by my colleague from Oregon.   We are a long way off from beating COVID-19. Our communities need  Federal relief as soon as possible. The disease continues to spread in  an alarming rate across much of the South and West, and our country is  facing probably the greatest economic challenge since the Great  Depression.   Yet, for over 2 months, the Republican Senate has chosen to delay,  delay, delay. First, Leader McConnell said another COVID relief bill  was ``likely'' in June. Now, the earliest it could happen is late July,  and, even then, the Republican leader said he wants to ``assess the  conditions in the country'' first before writing a bill ``in his  office.''   I will make two points. The conditions in the country are terrible.  You don't need to wait to assess them. We must act now. Second, if the  leader thinks writing a bill in his office will produce results, I ask  him to look at COVID 2, 3, and 3.5, where, in each case, he wrote a  bill in his office without Democratic input. We insisted that we be  included by not going forward, and we got a much better bill. We hope  that is what he will do from the outset--work with us in a bipartisan  way and work with the House, as well, to get something done.   The time for waiting and the time for partisan posturing is over. We  are on the precipice of several deadlines that require immediate action  from Congress. There are several cliffs, but perhaps the most dangerous  is the cliff for State and local governments, so many of which are  finalizing their budget before the new fiscal year on July 1, in 2  days.   State, local, and Tribal governments have already laid off more than  1.6 million workers and are being forced to cut critical services. At  least 25 States have lost a minimum of 20,000 jobs. Apropos to the  point my colleague from  [[Page S3644]]  Oregon made, there are 25,000 State and local jobs in Florida. What are  we saying to them? There are 29,000 in Kentucky. What are we saying to  them? There are 93,000 in Texas. What are we saying to them?   These are not abstract numbers. They are teachers and firefighters  and busdrivers and healthcare workers and more. It includes so many  public health workers essential to contact tracing so we can lick this  disease once and for all. Without Federal support, those job losses  will continue, and the loss of vital services will continue as well.   So far, the Senate Republican response to this potential crisis has  been a giant shrug of the shoulders. Leader McConnell had once said  that he would certainly be in favor of allowing the States to use the  bankruptcy route. That is the Republican leader telling States, red and  blue alike, why don't you go bankrupt.   That is not acceptable to Senate Democrats. So tonight I am joining  Senators Wyden, Menendez, Hassan, Carper, Gillibrand, and Murphy to ask  the Senate's consent to pass emergency Federal funding so that State,  local, and Tribal governments can keep fighting the pandemic and keep  their communities safe.   Lest people think this is a blue issue or a red issue, I ask  unanimous consent that the following letter be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record as follows:                                 National Governors Association,                                                      June 29, 2020.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       We write today to advocate on behalf of states, territories,       counties, cities and towns, all of which are experiencing       historic budget shortfalls as they continue to respond to the       pandemic. In less than two days, the budget years for 45       states and thousands of local governments will begin. Unlike       the federal government, these state and local governments       must begin their fiscal years on time and with a balanced       budget. If the Senate fails to act immediately to support       state and local governments, our nation's recovery from the       pandemic-induced recession will suffer and millions of       Americans will needlessly be harmed.        Previous federal bills responding to COVID-19 provided       important support, many through well-established grant       programs, yet none allow for the replacement of billions of       lost revenue due to COVID-19. More robust and direct stimulus       is needed for state and local governments to both rebuild the       economy and maintain essential services in education, health       care, emergency operations, public safety and more.        As we move closer to the end of the budget year, furloughs       and job cuts are on the table for many states and localities.       These jobs losses not only affect the provision of government       services, but also add to state unemployment. The damage will       get far worse without federal assistance, forcing drastic       cuts that will further delay and cancel infrastructure       projects, as at least 26 states have announced construction       delays for transportation projects. The loss of such projects       will ripple through states' construction industry, delaying       recovery further.        State and local governments also purchase goods and       services which add to the nation's output, and in 2019, state       and local governments' purchases accounted for 11 percent of       GDP. When these activities slow down, there is an effect on       the nation's economy. Alarmingly, CBO's June letter on its       forecast of Gross Domestic Product for 2020 and 2021 found       that ``state and local governments' purchases of goods and       services fell by $350 billion, making up 9 percent of the       total decline in GDP.        Nearly 15 million Americans are employed by state and local       governments. Teachers, first responders and emergency medical       service workers are on the front lines of this crisis doing       the essential work of the country. Government employment       continues to suffer substantial losses with over 1.6 million       state and local government jobs lost since March.        Leaders in Washington have expressed support for flexible       fiscal aid to states and localities of all sizes. Yet months       have gone by and our communities continue to suffer.       Americans have a history of standing together in times of       crisis and must do so now.

This letter is from the ``Big 7'' national associations.  They represent the Governors, Democrat and Republican; the mayors,  Democrat and Republican; the State legislatures, Democrat and  Republican; the county leaders, Democrat and Republican; and the city  managers. They all got together in a bipartisan way, as this Chamber  should do, and wrote the Senate a letter pleading--pleading--for  Federal support and warning of the dire consequences of the delay.   Let me read a passage from their letter to Leader McConnell and  myself, with a copy to all Republican and Democratic Senators. There  are many organizations from red States signing this letter. This is  what they wrote:         Previous federal bills responding to COVID-19 provided       important support . . . yet none allow for the replacement of       billions of lost revenue due to the COVID-19. More robust and       direct stimulus is needed for state and local governments to       both rebuild the economy and maintain essential services in       education, healthcare, emergency operations, public safety       and more . . . . Months have gone by and our communities       continue to suffer. Americans have a history of standing       together in a time of crisis and must do so now.    Let me repeat those words for every Member of this Chamber to hear:  ``Americans have a history of standing together in a time of crisis and  must do so now.''   I urge my colleagues--and, particularly, my Republican colleagues--to  listen to those words. These are your States, your cities, your mayors,  your counties, and your State governments pleading with you for  relief--not in a month, not later this year, but right now.   I hope my Republican friends will listen to their voices--the voices  of their constituents and State leaders--and consent tonight to pass  Federal support for State, local, and Tribal governments. Blocking it  will send a terrible signal to the American people that this Senate-- this Republican-led Senate--is unwilling to act with any urgency to  pass the relief that our States desperately need.   I now yield to my colleague from New Hampshire, who has been such a  strong leader, particularly pointing out how lost revenues hurt  governments--big, small, rural, urban, suburban, you name it
