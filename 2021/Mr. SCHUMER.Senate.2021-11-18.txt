 Madam President, on NDAA, last night, the Senate began  the process to debate, amend, and ultimately pass our annual Defense  spending bill. With Republican cooperation, we can adopt the motion to  proceed and begin voting on amendments early today.   Let me say it again. With Republican cooperation, we can adopt the  motion to proceed and begin voting on amendments today. We should work  together and complete this important bill before the Thanksgiving  holiday.   Last night's vote was overwhelmingly bipartisan, so there is no  reason we can't come to an agreement very soon to begin debating  amendments.   And there is already one important amendment that I want to mention:  repealing the 2002 Iraq AUMF. This bipartisan measure was reported out  of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this year, and I said  months ago that the Senate should hold a vote on it. The NDAA is a  logical place to do so.   The Iraq war has been over for over a decade. An authorization passed  in 2002 is no longer necessary for keeping Americans safe in 2021. It  has been nearly 10 years since this particular authorization has been  cited as a primary justification for a military operation, and there is  a real danger to letting these legal authorities persist indefinitely.  Repealing this AUMF will in no way hinder our national defense, nor  will it impact our relationship with the people of Iraq.   I want to thank Chairman Menendez, Senator Kaine, Senator Young, and  every Republican and Democratic cosponsor of the bill for working to  bring this issue to the floor. And in the coming days, I hope we can  come to an agreement on other commonsense amendments to strengthen the  Defense bill so we can get it passed through the Senate as soon as  possible.                           Build Back Better Agenda    Madam President, on Build Back Better, now that President Biden has  enacted his once-in-a-generation infrastructure bill, Democrats are  taking the next steps toward passing the rest of his Build Back Better  plan.  [[Page S8408]]    The last year and a half have been unlike any in modern U.S. history.  We have had a once-in-a-century pandemic, followed by the worst  economic crisis since the Great Depression.   We have come a long way this year as we have lifted our country out  of the depths of these crises, but the challenges, of course, aren't  over.   Americans right now want us to lower costs for things like  healthcare, prescription drugs, childcare. We have a responsibility to  pass legislation that will cut costs and improve American lives. That  is why we need to keep working on passing Build Back Better. We know  that passing this critical legislation will lower costs for some of the  most basic and essential things in everyday life. And as economists  from leading rating agencies said yesterday, Build Back Better will not  add to the inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy.   The childcare provision could alone save families thousands of  dollars each year. Families, on average, spend $10,000 annually on  childcare for each child under 4. A generation ago, this was unheard  of. Build Back Better will dramatically lower costs for millions of  families by providing the largest investment in childcare in American  history.   The same goes for prescription drugs. If you are one of the roughly  10 million Americans who relies on insulin to manage your diabetes,  chances are you have been spending more and more as the cost of this  once-affordable drug has skyrocketed. It is truly one of the perplexing  and frustrating trends of the past two decades.   Well, Build Back Better will make it so Americans with diabetes don't  pay more than $35 per month on insulin by enabling Medicare to directly  negotiate prices in Part B and Part D--again, lowering costs, improving  the lives of millions of families.   Examples go on and on of how people will have more money in their  pocket given their expenses.   Build Back Better cuts taxes for parents raising kids. It makes pre-K  universal for the first time ever. It will provide help for small  businesses to invest within the United States and hire American  workers.   And, ultimately, it is the best thing we can do to recapture that  sunny American optimism that has been the key to our country's success.  Creating jobs, lowering costs, fighting inflation, keeping more money  in people's pockets--these are things Americans want and what Americans  need, and it is what BBB does.   We are going to keep working on this important legislation until we  get it done.                          Nomination of Dilawar Syed    Madam President, now, on a much sadder note, Mr. Syed.   The Republican fixation on blocking qualified, uncontroversial, and  essential nominees to fill roles in the Biden administration has hit a  new and shameful low.   Yesterday, every single Republican on the Small Business Committee  boycotted a hearing that would have held a vote on Dilawar Syed's  nomination for the No. 2 spot at the Small Business Administration.   If confirmed, Mr. Syed would be the highest ranking Muslim American  in government. This is the fifth time--the fifth time--that Republicans  have failed to show up to a committee hearing for Mr. Syed.   To date--to date--we have yet heard a single legitimate reason for  their opposition. At one point, some of my colleagues seemed to  question Mr. Syed's allegiance because of his affiliation with a Muslim  voter education group. That is repugnant, and after those objections  provoked fierce criticism, Republicans came up with entirely new  fabrications for their resistance.   But at no point have Republicans explained why Mr. Syed is not  qualified for the job. Frankly, they can't because Mr. Syed is the  definition of a qualified candidate. His nomination has been praised by  hundreds of business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  hardly a liberal crowd.   It is shameful; it is unacceptable; it is ridiculous for Republicans  to keep stalling on Mr. Syed's nomination. He is eminently qualified to  serve in the SBA.   Why are Senate Republicans opposing Mr. Syed's nomination? And let me  ask this again because the question resonates. Why are Senate  Republicans opposing Mr. Syed's nomination?   I ask my Republican colleagues to drop their resistance and allow  this excellent and straightforward nominee to receive confirmation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Democrats have been working in good  faith for several days--actually, for several months, really--to pass  this defense legislation.   The bill before us was produced through a bipartisan committee  process and included the input of at least three-fifths of Senators  from both sides of the aisle. It is unfortunate that we cannot move  forward tonight.   Yesterday, we agreed to delay the initial cloture vote after the  Armed Services Committee's ranking member requested more time to work  on a managers' package to include more input from Members. The  managers' package now include 57--57--amendments; 27 from Republicans,  27 from Democrats, and 3 bipartisan amendments.   Further, we just proposed votes on 18 amendments, 3 of which are  bipartisan and 8 of which are Republican-led amendments. We could start  voting on them tonight, but unfortunately, the other side won't agree-- or some on the other side won't agree.   Democrats have demonstrated all year that we are more than willing to  work in good faith on amendments here on the floor. This year, more  amendments have received rollcall votes than during any of the past 4  years. Members on both sides want to get this done. So these delays are  unfortunate. There is no good reason to keep delaying. We should move  the process forward.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Calendar Nos. 332 and 444; that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume legislative  session.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  nominations.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  [[Page S8541]]  Senate complete its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Friday,  November 19; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to  H.R. 4350, the National Defense Authorization Act, postcloture;  further, that all time during adjournment, morning business, recess,  and leader time count postcloture.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:14 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, November 19, 2021, at 10: a.m.                            ____________________
