 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  the late Senator Kay Hagan. Her loss will be deeply felt by us here in  the Senate, both by those who served with her as well as the many staff  and individuals she worked with over time. Senator Hagan was a  dedicated public servant who touched many lives faithfully serving her  home State of North Carolina.   Born in Shelby, NC, Senator Hagan attended Florida State University  and then returned to North Carolina to attend law school at Wake Forest  University. She worked at North Carolina National Bank, a predecessor  to Bank of America, for 10 years, becoming a vice president in the  estates and trust division. She was a loving wife and mother deeply  committed to her family. She left the bank to raise her three  children--Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie--and became actively involved in  the Greensboro community.   Senator Hagan started early in politics helping her uncle, former  Florida Governor and U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles, paste bumper stickers  on supporters' cars. She was active in North Carolina politics and ran  Governor Jim Hunt's campaign in Guilford County in 1992 and 1996. In  1998, she ran for the North Carolina State Senate and served there for  10 years, where she cochaired the budget committee. During her 6-year  tenure as cochair of the budget, she increased North Carolina's Rainy  Day fund and balanced five straight budgets. I commend her commitment  to fiscal responsibility and achieving a balanced budget. In 2008, she  won the election for the U.S. Senate seat and showed up in Congress  ready to work for North Carolinians back home.   One thing Senator Hagan was known for here in the Senate was the  effort she put in to be as open and accessible to her constituents. As  a dedicated public servant, Senator Hagan made constituent services a  priority and often traveled the State hosting ``Conversations with  Kay.''   It is difficult to pinpoint Senator Hagan's single most greatest  achievement. During her political career at the local, State, and  Federal level, Senator Hagan championed many important issues and  served as a tireless advocate for her constituents.   Representing one of the most military-friendly States in the Nation,  [[Page S6444]]  Senator Hagan advocated for Active-Duty military, veterans, and their  families in her role serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Coming from a military family, Senator Hagan understood the needs of  those who serve our country and their families. Along with Senator  Burr, she was key in getting documents released pertaining to  contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, giving families the answers they  deserved. She was constantly reminding us all to remember and  understand the sacrifices made by our military and their families,  often telling their stories on the Senate floor.   I had the privilege of working with Senator Hagan on issues before  the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. From her  time in the State senate, Senator Hagan was a champion for financial  literacy education, and I greatly enjoyed our work together on  financial literacy initiatives for children. I worked very closely with  Senator Hagan on the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act,  which we offered as an amendment together, along with Senator Hatch, to  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act when it was being  considered in committee. She was instrumental in the creation of a new  pathway for biosimilars, a lower cost alternative to biologic drugs.  Our work together has fostered competition and improved choices for  American patients.   Senator Hagan understood the true value of bipartisan work and  developed strong relationships with Members of both parties. I admired  her commitment to work across the aisle and reconcile shared goals of  bettering the lives of Americans.   She was a committed woman of faith, serving as a Sunday school  teacher for many years. A member of the Presbyterian Church, she was  always one to do what she thought was right rather than what was  easiest.   My wife Diana joins me in sending our deepest condolences to her  loved ones. We hope she will find eternal peace and happiness knowing  she had a profound effect on all that knew her as a colleague, as a  mother and as a friend.                            ____________________
