 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senators Hawley, Cruz, Cramer, Braun, Perdue,  Barrasso, Rubio, Risch, Sullivan, Ernst, Scott of Florida, Daines, and  Fischer for both the House managers, with response from the counsel for  the President.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator Johnson and  the other Senators for both parties:         Recent reporting described two NSC staff holdovers from the       Obama Administration attending an ``all hands'' meeting of       NSC staff held about two weeks into the Trump Administration       and talking loudly enough to be overheard saying ``we need to       do everything we can to take out the President.'' On July 26,       2019, the House Intelligence Committee hired one of those       individuals, Sean Misko. The report further describes       relationships between Misko, Lt Col Vindman, and the alleged       whistleblower. Why did your committee hire Sean Misko the day       after the phone call between President Trump and Zelensky,       and what role has he played throughout your committee's       investigation?    The House will begin.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. First of all, there have been a lot of attacks  upon my staff, and, as I said when this issue came up earlier, I am  appalled at some of the spearing of the professional people that work  for the Intelligence Committee.   Now, this question refers to allegations in a newspaper article which  are circulating smears on my staff and asks me to respond to those  smears, and I will not dignify those smears on my staff by giving them  any credence whatsoever; nor will I share any information that I  believe could or could not lead to the identification of the  whistleblower.   I want to be very clear about something. Members of this body used to  care about the protection of whistleblower identities. They didn't used  to gratuitously attack members of committee staff, but now they do. Now  they do. Now they will take an unsubstantiated, repressed article and  use it to smear my staff. I think that is disgraceful. I think it is  disgraceful.   You know, whistleblowers are a unique and vital resource for the  intelligence community. And why? Because, unlike other whistleblowers  who can go public with their information, whistleblowers in the  intelligence community cannot because it deals with classified  information. They must come to a committee. They must talk to the staff  of that committee or to the inspector general. That is what they are  supposed to do. Our system relies upon it. And when you jeopardize a  whistleblower by trying to out them this way, then you are threatening  not just this whistleblower but the entire system.   Now, the President would like to have nothing better than that, and I  am sure the President is applauding this question because he wants his  pound of flesh and he wants to punish anyone that has the courage to  stand up to him. Well, I can't tell you who the whistleblower is  because I don't know, but I can tell you who the whistleblower should  be. It should be every one of us. Every one of us should be willing to  blow the whistle on Presidential misconduct. If it weren't for this  whistleblower, we wouldn't know about this misconduct, and that might  be just as well for this President, but it would not be good for the  country.   And I worry that future people that see what I am doing are going to  watch how this person has been treated, the threats against this  person's life, and they are going to say: Why stick my neck out? Is my  name going to be dragged through the mud?   Will people join our staff if they know that their names are going to  be dragged through the mud?   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Senate,  there are two responses that I would like to get to, one with regard to  the issue of witnesses and, in this case, the whistleblower.   Mr. Schiff put the whistleblower issue front and center with his own  words during the course of their investigation. He talked about the  whistleblower testifying.   Retribution is what is prohibited under the statute, against a  whistleblower. That is what the whistleblower statute protects, that  there is no retribution. In other words, you are not being fired from  blowing the whistle.   But this idea that there is complete anonymity--and I am not saying  that we should disclose the individual's name. I would be happy to  handle that in executive session or any way you want. But we can't just  say it is not a relevant inquiry to know who on the staff that  conducted the primary investigation here was in communication with that  whistleblower, especially after Mr. Schiff denied that he or his staff  initially had even had any conversations with the whistleblower.   It goes back to the whole witness issue. I want to go to that for  just 30 seconds here. It seems to me that the discussion on witnesses-- I heard what Mr. Schiff said about the 30--we will do depositions in a  week. The Democratic leader said I can have any witnesses I want  yesterday. I got it from the transcript. And you couldn't get all the  witnesses you want in a week. You couldn't get the discovery done in a  week.   But if, in fact--if, in fact, they believe they have presented this  overwhelming case that they have, all--they talked about subterfuge and  smokescreens. The smokescreen here is that they used 13 of their 17  witnesses to try to prove their case, and we were able to use those  very witnesses to undercut that case. So I think we just have to keep  that in perspective.   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
