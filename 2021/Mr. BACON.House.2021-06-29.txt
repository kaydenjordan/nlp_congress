 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Charles Jackson  French, a World War II hero with ties to Omaha who made one of the most  underappreciated sacrifices in American military history   The story of Charles Jackson French is an American story: One of  courage, sacrifice, and hope. Charles, a Black man, was born in a  racially segregated Foreman, Arkansas, on September 15, 1919. In 1937,  Charles enlisted in the United States Navy. After completing his  enlistment, he moved to Omaha, Nebraska, to be with family, but after  the attack on Pearl Harbor, he reenlisted.   According to accounts, on September 5, 1942, Petty Officer First  Class French was serving as a mess attendant in the racially segregated  USS Gregory. As a Black man growing up in 1930's Arkansas, Charles  lived in a time when segregation laws prohibited Black people from  swimming alongside White people in public pools and beaches, yet when  the USS Gregory was attacked and sunk by Japanese gunfire off the coast  of Guadalcanal, it was Petty Officer French who dove into the  treacherous waters of the Pacific to save his fellow sailors who had  been wounded.   Petty Officer French loaded 15 of his fellow sailors into a lifeboat  and saved his injured comrades from drowning. However, Charles knew  that they could not simply float to shores controlled by the Japanese  where they would meet a fate worse than death. Prisoners were often  tortured then executed. Military.com recounted how Charles tied a rope  around his waist with the help of his shipmates and towed his fellow  sailors through shark-infested waters for 8 long hours until they were  finally identified and saved by an American landing craft.   In his book ``Black Men and Blue Water'' Chester Wright recounted his  conversation with Petty Officer French who told him that when he and  the raft full of survivors were rescued, persons aboard the ship told  Charles to go ``where the colored boys stay'' while the crew tended to  the wounded White survivors. Charles further shared that the sailors  rescued by him told the crew: ``He ain't going nowhere. He is a member  of the Gregory's crew and he damned well will stay here with the rest  of us.''   Just like the sailors who stepped up at the time for French, it is  our time to stand up and recognize with full measure the sacrifice and  service of French, whose story has been underappreciated by the Navy  and history. A real-life hero like Charles must be recognized by the  military and the country that he devoted his life to.    In World War II, the Navy gave French a commendation letter. I have  now asked the Navy to review and consider upgrading to a medal, and the  Navy is reviewing this now.   Full recognition of U.S. Navy Petty Officer First Class Charles  Jackson French is long overdue. We owe it to Charles, his family, and  to the millions of Americans who learned from Charles' story.   Last Friday, I also introduced legislation to rename one of Omaha's  post offices after Charles, and I am pleased that Representatives Jeff  Fortenberry and Adrian Smith have joined me in this effort to recognize  a Nebraska hero.   Today, I call on the Navy, Congress, and the White House to recognize  the service and sacrifice of Petty Officer First Class French so that  all Americans, especially our Nation's future leaders and  servicemembers, can be inspired by Charles' display of patriotism and  sacrifice. But also, so the family of Charles can be comforted by the  eternal gratitude of a Nation that Petty Officer First Class French so  dutifully served. This three-decade veteran salutes him.                            ____________________
