 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in observation of World AIDS Day  which is celebrated tomorrow, actually, in the United States and around  the world. Thanks to bipartisan investments in programs like PEPFAR, we  have made significant strides in the fight against HIV and AIDS.   In the 15 years since PEPFAR was passed, over 2.4 million babies have  been born HIV free, and over 14.6 million people have been supported  with antiretroviral treatment. But we cannot let these numbers lull us  into complacency.   The theme of this year's World AIDS Day is ``Know Your Status.'' More  than 9.4 million people living with HIV around the world do not know  their status. In the United States, more than 1.1 million people in the  U.S. are living with HIV; 14 percent, mind you, of whom do not know  their status.   We know that tens of millions of people in the United States and  around the world will require sustained access to treatment for decades  to come. Without robust investments and a strong recommitment to  programs like PEPFAR, Ryan White, and the Minority AIDS Initiative, we  could see a backslide in the important gains that we have made in the  fight against HIV.   We can't afford to let that happen, so I invite you to join me in  commemorating World AIDS Day and recommitting to achieving an AIDS-free  generation.                            ____________________
