 Madam President, I object.    Madam President, reserving the right to object.    Madam President, the Senator is right--I am not going to  engage in a colloquy on the merits of this request or the previous  request. This isn't real. This is a TV show. This is click bait. This  is theater. This isn't an actual attempt to pass legislation.   Senator Lankford approached me about this particular bill on the  floor a week ago and asked to engage in a dialogue with me about it. I  thought it was a legitimate request, and I set my team to the task of  trying to work something out with Senator Lankford. And now there is a  unanimous consent request to pass a bill that is under negotiation and  discussions between serious legislators who actually want to find a  result.   So, no, I am not going to debate the merits of these UCs. This isn't  real.   I object.
