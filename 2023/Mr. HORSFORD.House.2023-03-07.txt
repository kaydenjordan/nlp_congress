 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues in the Congressional  Black Caucus and Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick and  Representative Jonathan Jackson for organizing this Special Hour order  and leading as coanchors this evening.   As chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, I rise today to join  my colleagues in this hour focused on the push for voting rights.   Today, March 7, is the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, which  occurred in Selma, Alabama, at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. That day,  people gathered to march to the capital of Alabama, but they only made  it a few miles before State troopers beat the protesters and shed blood  on the bridge and streets of Selma.   Among the marchers was a 25-year-old young man named John Lewis.  Years before he would come to join us here in the Halls of Congress, he  was a civil rights leader and activist.   Some today might call him woke by their standards, and he was, in  fact, woke: woke to disenfranchisement of Black men and women in the  South, and woke to the fact that in Dallas County, Alabama, where he  marched and where the police beat him, Black folks made up more than  half of the population but somehow only made up 2 percent of the  registered voters.   When the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was arrested in Selma a  few months earlier, he wrote in The New York Times: ``This is Selma,  Alabama. There are more Negroes in jail with me than there are on the  voting rolls.''   In the nearby town of Marion, tensions hit a fever pitch when, on  February 18, 1965, State troopers clubbed protesters and fatally shot  26-year-old Jimmie Lee Jackson, an African-American demonstrator trying  to protect his mother, who was being struck by police.   Civil rights leaders planned to take their cause directly to Alabama  Governor George Wallace on a 54-mile march from Selma to the State  capital of Montgomery.                                time  1945    Although Wallace ordered state troopers ``to use whatever means are  necessary to prevent a march,'' approximately 600 voting rights  advocates set out from the Brown Chapel AME Church on Sunday, March 7.   I was honored to join my colleague, Representative Terri Sewell, and  other Members, at Brown Chapel AME Church just this Sunday.   The demonstrators marched peacefully through downtown Selma. As they  began to cross the bridge spanning the Alabama River, the marchers who  gazed up could see the name of a Confederate general and grand dragon  of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan, Edmund Pettus, staring right back at them  in big block letters emblazoned across that bridge.   Soon after, the melee began and the police took out their batons and  tear gas to attack the peaceful marchers. John Lewis later testified in  court that he was knocked to the ground and was hit in the head with a  nightstick by a state trooper.   What was different from this march, and this fight, was the many  television cameras that captured the brutal moments on film and aired  them across the country. It was a turning point in the fight for civil  rights and for voting rights, just months after the Civil Rights Act of  1964 had been signed into law.   I had the opportunity, as I said, to join some of my colleagues in  Selma, in Birmingham, and in Montgomery this weekend which, I may add,  is now represented by our colleague in the Congressional Black Caucus,  Congresswoman Terri Sewell. I was pleased that President Biden was  there with us recognizing the need for our renewed action on voting  rights for all.   The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would ensure every  American can exercise their vote. As the conscience of the Congress,  the Congressional Black Caucus has always held voting rights at the  forefront of our efforts in Congress.   Let me just say this: This is the first time in nearly 40 years that  reauthorization of sections of the Voting Rights Act have not been  passed in a bipartisan way, in nearly 40 years.   There have been previous Congresses where this was never  controversial; the idea of reauthorizing one of our most fundamental  rights as American citizens, the right to vote.   So my question to my colleagues on the other side is: Why won't you  join with us, as your colleagues in previous Congresses have done, to  reauthorize the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act?   We are calling on you today to join with us to protect and restore  the sacred right to vote. We understand that this legislation must be  passed. This is not a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent issue.  This is not a Black, Brown or White issue. This is a fundamental issue  around voting rights.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time for the Congressional Black  Caucus today and, again, thank all of my colleagues who have joined us  on the floor this evening, and to our great co-chairs, Representative  Cherfilus-McCormick and Representative Jackson for leading this Special  Order hour.   Let's pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act this  Congress.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Horsford for  spearheading our Special Order today.   I now have the privilege of yielding to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Jackson), my co-anchor.
