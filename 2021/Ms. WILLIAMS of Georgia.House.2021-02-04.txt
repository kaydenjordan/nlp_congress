 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  resolution to remove Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from her  committee assignments.   Her words and actions tout dangerous and deadly QAnon conspiracy  theories, threaten our national security, and put the lives of every  person at risk.   On January 6, we witnessed what can happen when our leaders spread  baseless conspiracy theories and spew violent rhetoric that echoes the  same call to violence that resulted in a domestic terrorist attack on  the United States Capitol.    We can't control what Representative Greene does and says, but we can  control how we operate as a governing body that holds its officials  accountable.   I am particularly concerned about her appointment to the Education  and Labor Committee, which not only has oversight of the education of  our children, but also has the responsibility to ensure students have  safe environments to learn.   I watched in horror at the footage of Representative Greene berating  a Parkland shooting survivor, a teenager who came to Capitol Hill  seeking help from lawmakers to put an end to mass shootings and prevent  other high school students from having to witness the senseless murder  of their classmates and teachers.   This is personal for me. As a mom of my Carter, who just started  kindergarten, and as a survivor of a school shooting my senior year of  high school that claimed the life of a classmate, I still live with  that trauma today.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they disapprove of  Representative Greene's actions. However, disapproval without action  means nothing.   This is about doing what is right. As Dr. King stated, it is never  the wrong time to do the right thing.
