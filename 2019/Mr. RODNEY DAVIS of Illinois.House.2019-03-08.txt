 Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition.    Madam Chair, I thank my new colleague,  Mr. Neguse, and welcome him. I am glad he is participating in the  process.   I am going to oppose the gentleman's amendment; not because of the  process, just because it adds another layer of burden to our States and  our localities.   Many States already accept pre-registration forms, and that is within  their State's jurisdiction to do so. I just don't like this top-down  approach which this now upwards of 700-page mammoth bill called H.R. 1  is putting on to our States and our local election officials.   Our county offices, our local officials, they are bleeding from  unfunded mandates from State and Federal Governments, and this is one  more of those.   I agree, we ought to get more 16- and 17-year-olds interested in  government. I have got twin boys who are 18; I try and get them  interested. Sometimes they are not even interested in me and what we  do.   But the key is we, as Members of Congress, ought to go take our  message to the high schools. And I just recently was in Boston with a  bipartisan group in and around our colleague, Joe Kennedy's district.   Joe, Markwayne Mullin, and Lisa Blunt Rochester and I, we visited  numerous high schools. And I hope all four of us standing there in a  bipartisan way actually inspired some young people in the Boston area  to get engaged.   My colleague,   Jimmy Panetta and I visited schools in my district  last fall to do the exact same thing, to show people that we can work  together in a bipartisan way.   Unfortunately, this process in H.R. 1 has been nothing but partisan;  and that is not the message that we need to send to 16- and 17-year- olds.   I have put my hand out with an olive branch. I have accepted many  Democratic amendments throughout the last few days, and not one single  amendment, either in the markup of the only committee that marked this  bill up, House Administration, where we offered 28, not one Republican  amendment to this bill that is now 700 pages has been accepted. Every  amendment has been a Democrat-led amendment.   I thought the new Democratic majority was going to be bipartisan. I  thought the new Democratic majority was going to be transparent. I  thought the new Democratic majority was going to not work with special  interests to write mammoth 700-page bills. But I guess, Madam Chair, I  was mistaken.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank my colleague, Mr.  Neguse, again. I admire his tenacity, and admire his willingness to  come down and legislate. I stand ready to come to his district and talk  to high schoolers with him, and I would hope he would reciprocate, come  to mine. If the gentleman will have his team call mine, we will figure  out a way to work something out. I think that is the best way for us to  send a message to high schoolers to get them engaged, get them  involved.   This is just an administrative burden that is going to affect our  State and local officials. To process--I mean, there are provisions in  this 700-page mammoth bill that don't allow our local election  officials to clean voters off the rolls that they know no longer may  live in their jurisdiction. So we are hindering local officials'  ability to clean up their rolls; and then decide, you know, later on,  that we are going to be ahead and pre-register people that we don't  know, may or may not want to vote in their college town of residence.   So it just is a burden that I think is unnecessary. Although, again,  I respect the gentleman's willingness to come down here and debate;  this is an issue that goes further than Mr. Neguse's amendment.   I am going to oppose the amendment. I urge folks to vote ``no'' on  it. But more importantly, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  bill that is going to eventually cost taxpayers billions of dollars and  add billions upon billions to the campaign coffers of Members of  Congress. That is not what the taxpayers in my district are asking  [[Page H2593]]  for. It is not what the taxpayers of America are asking for. It is only  what the Democratic majority is asking for.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we know this bill is not  going to be signed into law. I look forward to working with the  gentleman on other amendments that we might be able to come up with  some good plans to engage our 16- and 17-year-olds, engage the next  generation of leaders.   I hope maybe a visit that we can do together could inspire somebody  to do what we do one day, and that would be that we would manage to  call ourselves successful in legislating to inspire the next  generation.   This bill, H.R. 1, is not going to inspire the next generation. I  appreciate Mr. Neguse; I appreciate his willingness to serve.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, I welcome back my  colleague, Mrs. Kirkpatrick. It is great to have her back in this  institution.   The gentlewoman's amendment is an amendment that I support. However,  the underlying bill, H.R. 1, is the furthest thing that can be  considered ``for the people.'' This bill is nothing but a bill that is  for loading billions upon billions of dollars into the coffers of  Members of Congress.   I don't think anybody in my district who stops me in the street is  saying, ``Hey, we want you to take taxpayer dollars away from investing  in infrastructure, take taxpayer dollars away from investing in  pediatric cancer research, and you know what, load up your campaign  coffers with that so you can go enrich some political operatives and  maybe buy some more TV commercials and radio ads, send some more mail  pieces that get thrown away immediately when they come into your  house.''  [[Page H2594]]    This has to be one of the worst examples of self-preservation that I  have ever witnessed in my 22 years working for the U.S. House of  Representatives and serving in the U.S. House of Representatives.   I can't think of one person in my district who has come up and said,  ``I want you to take tax dollars away from building bridges and roads,  finding cures for deadly diseases, and put it in your campaign fund.''   That is why this bill is terrible.   This bill has not been open; it has not been a bipartisan process; it  has not been regular order, all the things that the Democratic majority  promised us that they would do when they took over.   This bill was introduced on January 3. I certainly hope every  Democratic Member actually read the bill before they signed on as a  cosponsor, but I think they are reading it now. And there are a lot of  problems, which is why we have so many amendments.   Let me go through some of the process. We requested a CBO score--it  was delivered last Friday; it was updated yesterday--which actually  agrees with me that taxpayer dollars are going to be taken away from  other priorities that we can spend here in Congress, like roads and  bridges, cancer research, Alzheimer's research, and others, and go  toward Members of Congress' campaigns.   Hours before the only committee markup that we saw with the majority,  an amendment in the nature of a substitute with new text, including a  magical, new freedom from influence fund that would supposedly support  the enrichment of Members of Congress' campaigns, it had no details on  how that fund would be filled.   We went through the markup. Only one committee, the smallest  committee in Congress, House Administration, it was the only committee  that marked this up. That is not regular order. Forty percent of the  bill has never gone through regular order.   Yet we see now 72 amendments over the last few days. Twenty-eight of  them that we offered to try to make the bill better in committee were  all turned down on a partisan roll call.   Then we went to Rules. I actually had a good time in Rules. I have to  thank my colleague, Chairperson Lofgren, for that debate during the  Rules Committee.   We again received new text of the bill 10 minutes before I walked in,  10 minutes before, including 51 new pages. Where was this in the markup  process?    After the Rules hearing and before consideration on the floor, we  learned through leaks to the press that the new freedom from influence  fund would be filled with some magical surcharges of corporate fines,  but we had no details.   I had no idea that the Democrats' solution to campaign finance reform  and their goal to take corporate money out of politics was to use  corporate money to now fund our campaigns, which we now legally cannot  accept.   That is the height of hypocrisy. No one is asking for more corporate  dollars to line the campaign coffers of Members of Congress.   This bill and the process are just a sham. Look, a joint committee  report with revenue stream projections for this new magical freedom  from influence fund was not shown to us. It was just submitted for the  Record. We found it. We saw it.   The new CBO report clearly says this fund will be out of money in  just a few years after it becomes activated, because the costs are  going to exponentially rise, and clearly, taxpayer dollars will have to  bail it out.   The corporate fund, even the CBO and The Washington Post realize that  that corporate tax fund, the tax rate of corporate dollars now being  funneled into our campaigns that we can't take right now, those  corporate dollars and fines will take away from being able to be spent  on the priorities of my constituents who stop me in the streets. They  say, ``We want to build new bridges. We want new roadways. We want to  make sure that this bill goes down, because it is a travesty on the  American people and the American taxpayer.''   Madam Chair, vote ``no'' on H.R. 1.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I don't have the best  Nickelback lyrics to introduce my next speaker, but I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), our Republican leader.                                time  0945     Madam Chair, I thank Mr. Golden for his  service to our country. Our country thanks the gentleman, and everyone  in this institution thanks him for that service.   This bill, however, is a very bad idea. Public funding of elections  is a very bad idea.   At the last second before we vote on H.R. 1, Democrats have decided  they are afraid of the CBO score for their massively expensive bill. We  haven't even debated it and want to hide it from consideration in this  Chamber.   So they created this gimmick called the freedom from influence fund,  which is proposed to add an additional 2.75 percent penalty against  law-breaking or malfeasant corporations and officials at corporations.  They claimed it would generate enough funds to pay the massive cost of  funding political campaigns for Members of Congress.   Late last night, we got that CBO report, and the score for H.R. 1  that projects the impact of this new shell game called the freedom from  influence fund and its proposed funding source, corporate fines--again,  voting for this bill will allow corporate money to, for the first time,  lawfully flow into the campaigns of each and every one of us in this  institution.                                time  1000    The CBO score tells a very different story from what Democrats want  you to believe. According to the CBO, this new fund will result in a  reduction of income and payroll taxes, meaning corporations will have  less money to spend on their payrolls, which equates to less jobs.   To quote the CBO report:   [[Page H2597]]              The assessment on civil monetary penalties and settlements       would reduce the base for income and payroll taxes.       Consequently, the revenues from the assessments will be       partially offset by lower income and payroll taxes.    Put another way, H.R. 1 takes American jobs away in order to fund the  campaign coffers of Members of Congress.   Furthermore, the CBO notes that, as a result of this funding source,  less money will be available for other government programs that we want  to prioritize in this institution.   I quote again from the CBO report:         CBO and JCT expect the increased assessment of criminal and       civil penalties would reduce the amount of penalties and       settlements collected under current law.    The CBO report confirms what Republicans have been saying all along:  H.R. 1 is a shell game that will, in the end, hurt taxpayers because  this proposal to publicly fund campaigns will be funded by the  taxpayers.   However, you are going to likely hear Democrats say, instead, that  this fund will run at a surplus over the first few years of its  existence, which is true because they designed the bill to not make any  expenditures for the first 6 years of this program.   But pay very close attention. What the Democrats won't tell you is  that, once the fund starts making its expenditures, the fund will be  nearly broke in 5 years, and that is assuming that the cost of running  campaigns will stay static today and not exponentially increase like it  has.   Again, this Democratic funding gimmick was concocted just to result  in a more desirable CBO score. I don't see that as a result.   The new fund will collect money for 6 years with no expenditures,  resulting in the accumulation of a large balance. Then, once the money  starts flowing to every Member of Congress in this institution, it is  going to run out in 5 years.   Democrats should be ashamed for making this bill H.R. 1.   When Republicans took over this institution, after 50 years in the  minority, our H.R. 1 was the Congressional Accountability Act, to make  Congress work better.   H.R. 1 in the last Congress, put more money in the pockets of middle- class taxpayers, families back home.   This H.R. 1 will do nothing but put taxpayer dollars in the campaign  funds of every Member of Congress, and that is not acceptable to me,  and that is why we should have a ``no'' vote on H.R. 1.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, before I get started, I  ask for a point of personal privilege to have the Members of this  institution and the gallery recognize the Chair as the first Native  American woman to ever chair the House proceedings.    Madam Chair, as my home State President  Ronald Reagan once said: The most terrifying words in the English  language are: ``I'm from the government and I'm here to help.''   I am for the American voter. I support every eligible voter having  easier ways to register to vote and easier access to the polls. What I  am not for is Washington, D.C. taking over our elections.   I have said it before: I agree with my colleagues across the aisle  that there is a role for the Federal Government to play in election  infrastructure, campaign finance disclosure, ballot access,  transparency, and, most importantly, election security. However, H.R.  1, misuses taxpayer dollars, takes power away from the States to  administer their own elections, and threatens to limit Americans'  constitutional rights. I cannot support this legislation.   This bill, a 700-page mammoth bill, takes power away from States  given to them by the U.S. Constitution to designate the time, place,  and the manner of their elections. I know the author of this  legislation said yesterday that H.R. 1 is simply implementing the best  practices of States, but that is federalizing our election system, no  matter how nicely you phrase it.   Congress should partner with the States who understand the unique  needs of their own residents and provide support to increase voter  registration and improve election security instead of federally  mandating, what this bill does, which is a one-size-fits-all approach.   There is a limited role for the Federal Government to play in  elections when patterns of discrimination have occurred, and when we  will continue to address those patterns, we can do it in a bipartisan  way through the Voting Rights Act.   I cannot stress enough that Congress should absolutely be in favor of  increasing access to the polls, but we cannot do that without adding  the necessary checks and balances to ensure that these accesses are  protected.   We should allow States to maintain their own voter rolls to help them  process voters in a timely manner, avoid unfunded mandates, and manage  voter lists to avoid registration and voting irregularities. A few  voting irregularities can change the outcome of a single election.   Just look at what happened recently in North Carolina. A political  operative working for a Republican candidate illegally harvested  ballots which led to the North Carolina State Board of Elections  calling for a new special election. Ballot harvesting is the practice  when a political operative or volunteer can come to your home, pick up  your ballot, and deliver it to the polling precinct. This process,  while illegal in most States like North Carolina, is a perfectly legal  practice in places like California.   Republicans, both at the House Administration Committee markup and at  Rules Committee, offered amendments to prohibit ballot harvesting, and  both attempts were rejected by Democrats. We can no longer be naive to  think that this is a practice that will simply help your elderly  neighbor who can no longer get to the polls. Just ask my former  colleagues from California. Ballot harvesting is an unguarded  instrument that is occurring on a large scale as a practice used by  political operatives to manipulate the outcome of elections.    If we want to improve election security, we must eliminate ballot  harvesting and its risks to taking away the choice of the American  people. Every American deserves their vote to be counted and protected.   H.R. 1 limits free speech and imposes vague standards that  disadvantage American citizens who want to advocate on behalf of what  they believe in. Organizations like the National Right to Life, the  Chamber of Commerce, and even the ACLU have spoken out against this  bill for that very reason. Every American should be able to speak on an  issue that they are passionate about.   We also recently received the revised CBO score of H.R. 1 which  egregiously underestimated H.R. 1's cost to the taxpayers because the  Congressional Budget Office said they needed more time to develop a  comprehensive score. Instead of giving them more time, we are preparing  right now to vote on this 700-page bill.   My colleagues across the aisle are all about transparency--at least  that is what I keep hearing. But I have yet to see it in action,  especially when it comes to funding their own campaigns. H.R. 1 is  creating public subsidies through the new government match program. For  every $200, $1,200 will be going to a politician's campaign. The  majority has changed this provision so many times throughout the last  couple weeks. This money will come from the U.S. Treasury through  corporate fines and go into this nebulous Freedom From Influence Fund,  but the bottom line is it is going into Members of Congress' own  campaigns.   Why are we allocating money to go to politicians when there are so  many other causes like transportation, infrastructure, and cancer  research that our tax dollars, your tax dollars, and the Americans' tax  dollars should be funding?                                time  1045    The Democratic majority claims they want to take money out of  politics but have created a scheme that will, for the first time ever,  make it legal for Members of Congress to take corporate money into  their own campaigns.   This is exactly why we need to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1. It is a  travesty.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    I object.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
