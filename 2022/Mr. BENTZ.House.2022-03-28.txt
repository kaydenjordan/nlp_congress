 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, American businesses and American citizens face a growing  number of cybercrimes. Cybercrime is a particularly complicated form of  criminal conduct and one that costs Americans billions of dollars a  year in theft.   This bill would require the Attorney General to enter into an  agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to develop a method for  categorizing different types of cybercrime. The Attorney General would  also establish a cybercrime category in the National Incident-Based  Reporting System so that States can better report cybercrime data to  the Federal Government.   The bill would also require the Bureau of Justice Statistics to  include cybercrime victimization questions in the National Crime  Victimization Survey. There is no question that we must do more to  bring cybercriminals to justice.  [[Page H3871]]    In August of 2021, the Biden administration released a notorious  Russian cybercriminal early from Federal custody. The individual is  described as, ``one of the most connected and skilled malicious hackers  ever apprehended by the U.S. authorities.'' And for unknown reasons,  the administration let him out of Federal prison early and shipped him  back to Moscow.   We have asked the Biden administration's Justice Department for more  information about this early release of this cybercriminal, but we have  received nothing as of yet. Similarly, we don't have enough information  to determine whether this legislation will bring more cybercriminals to  justice. We haven't heard from relevant stakeholders on these issues,  and we haven't held hearings with experts to determine whether this is  the right step at this time.   This bill would require GAO to submit a report to Congress that  assesses the effectiveness of reporting mechanisms for cybercrime and  disparities in reporting data between cybercrime and other types of  crime.   Why aren't we starting with that?   Why are we making changes to cybercrime reporting mechanisms before  the GAO can evaluate whether the existing reporting mechanisms are  effective?   It makes more sense for us to have hearings, evaluate GAO's findings,  and hear from experts. Then we can examine whether the other provisions  of this bill are necessary and appropriate.   In another instance of putting the cart before the horse, the  Committee on the Judiciary is scheduled to hear from Bryan A. Vorndran,  the assistant director of Cyber Division at the FBI tomorrow. Perhaps  we should have waited to see what he had to say before rushing this  legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3359, the Homicide Victims'  Families' Rights Act of 2021. This bill creates a process for relatives  of homicide victims to request that Federal agencies rereview the case  of their lost family member once the case has gone cold.   To be clear, this bill would only apply to Federal cases of murder,  and it wouldn't apply to murder cases investigated by State and local  law enforcement, which are most cases.   The majority of cold cases at issue under this bill are likely to be  cases arising from Tribal jurisdictions. Fortunately, President Trump  already took steps to try to solve cold cases in Tribal jurisdictions.  In November of 2019, President Trump signed an executive order to  create the Operation Lady Justice Task Force.   In its first year, this task force opened seven offices across the  country to address the number of missing and murdered indigenous women.  The task force held listening sessions, Tribal consultations, webinars,  meetings with law enforcement, and victims' services programs, and  formed domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions.  [[Page H3877]]    The task force put out guidance and protocols, developed  relationships with entities like missing persons clearinghouses, began  training for investigators and volunteers, and started a public  awareness campaign. This was all in 2020.   This legislation is cut from similar cloth as President Trump's  executive order creating that task force. Hopefully, it will motivate  the Biden administration to continue President Trump's good work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1621, the Prohibiting  Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act of 2021.   The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution ensures that criminal  defendants have the right to a trial by jury. This right is so  important that our Founding Fathers preserved it in the Bill of Rights.  It is a hallmark of our great country and one of the many things that  separates us from other countries.   Our commitment to trial by jury means we accept the jury's decision  whether we agree with it or not.   This bill would prohibit Federal judges from increasing a defendant's  sentence based on conduct for which the defendant had been acquitted by  a jury.   In 1987, the United States Sentencing Commission established Federal  sentencing guidelines. These guidelines allow judges to consider  conduct that was not formally charged or proven beyond a reasonable  doubt at a trial, so long as the judge finds the conduct relevant by a  preponderance of the evidence.   There are numerous examples of this happening. Judges have intervened  to overrule the determinations of juries and have handed down harsher  sentences after considering conduct for which the defendants have been  charged and acquitted.                                time  1730    Allowing judges to consider acquitted conduct punishes people for a  crime for which they have not been convicted. It is wrong and violates  the spirit of our Bill of Rights.   Both Justice Kavanaugh and the late Justice Antonin Scalia recognized  the fundamental unfairness of using acquitted conduct at sentencing.  Both said it must stop.   In 2015, as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.  Circuit, then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote: ``Allowing judges to rely on  acquitted or uncharged conduct to impose higher sentences than they  otherwise would impose seems a dubious infringement on the rights to  due process and to a jury trial.''   I agree with Justice Scalia and Justice Kavanaugh.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).    I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
