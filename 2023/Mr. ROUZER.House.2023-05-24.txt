 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Brunswick County  Sheriff John Ingram, who recently retired from his long and  distinguished service in law enforcement.   A proud native of Brunswick County, Sheriff Ingram has continually  dedicated his life to his community. He joined the Brunswick County  Sheriff's Office in 1991, starting as a patrol deputy. He quickly rose  through the ranks and served in many different capacities, including in  the warrant and detective divisions, and then became lieutenant in the  narcotics division and commander of the department's SWAT team.   Mr. Ingram later joined the Columbus County Sheriff's Office, where  he was named chief deputy before returning to Brunswick County in the  same role. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed Brunswick County  sheriff and has earned reelection to the post in each and every  election since.   During his tenure leading the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office, he  expanded the department to accommodate the fastest growing county in  the State. He increased recruitment efforts  [[Page H2550]]  and brought in additional 911 telecommunicators and detention officers  to increase safety.   He also offered a variety of community programs to further the  sheriff's office mission to enhance public safety and education and  promote community-based relationships between law enforcement and the  public, including his support for establishing drug courts where those  battling addiction could be better treated and find the pathway to  healing, productivity, and success.   To facilitate those missions, he created the Sheriff's Citizens'  Academy along with the Sheriff's Volunteer Program. He also launched  the Anchor Initiative Program in 2018 to help those suffering from  addiction start their recovery, providing a hopeful future to break the  typical cycle of continued drug use and crime.   Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Ingram has been recognized  for his leadership on all these fronts. He was elected to the board of  directors for the National Sheriffs' Association and served as  president of the North Carolina Sheriffs' Association.   Most recently, he was awarded the prestigious Order of the Long Leaf  Pine, a recognition considered North Carolina's highest civilian honor.    Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize a no-nonsense individual and  one with such a sense of duty, integrity, and distinguished service to  the people of Brunswick County, North Carolina.   On behalf of the citizens of North Carolina's Seventh District, I  thank him, and I am proud to recognize him for his extraordinary  service and commitment to his fellow man.   May God continue to bless him, his family, and the Brunswick County  Sheriff's Office. I am proud to call him my friend.                            ____________________
