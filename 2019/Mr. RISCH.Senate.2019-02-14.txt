 Madam President, along with my colleagues Senator Mike  Crapo and Representative Mike Simpson, I recognize an important  anniversary being celebrated at the U.S. Department of Energy's, DOE,  890-square-mile site in eastern Idaho.   On February 18, 1949, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission decided to  build the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho.   For 70 years, work done by the scientists, engineers, technicians,  and support staff at Idaho's lab has helped  [[Page S1379]]  promote American prosperity and contributed to our national security.   Since 1967, research conducted at Idaho National Laboratory's, INL,  Advanced Test Reactor has powered and modernized the U.S. Nuclear Navy.   Fifty years ago, the Navy had to refuel its nuclear fleet frequently,  an expensive and time-consuming process.   Today, as a result of experiments conducted at the Advanced Test  Reactor, ATR, the Navy's nuclear fleet can run the lifetime of the  ship--more than three decades--without refueling. That saves American  taxpayers millions of dollars and ensures that our fleet is actively  defending U.S. national security instead of sitting in port waiting to  be refueled.   Roughly a decade and a half ago, Congress designated INL as the  Nation's lead nuclear energy research and development laboratory. This  is fitting because on December 20, 1951, INL first demonstrated nuclear  fission could be used to generate power to light our homes and cities.  Throughout its history, INL has built and operated 52 original nuclear  reactors and helped establish an American industry that today produces  approximately 19 percent of our Nation's electricity and more than half  of our carbon-free electricity. INL has become a world leader in cyber  security research and works actively with government and industry to  protect and make the Nation's most critical infrastructure more  resilient. INL has advanced broader clean energy research, informing  electric vehicle deployment and developing bioenergy solutions that  benefit the environment and our Nation's farmers. Even as we celebrate  INL's 70 years, the lab's leadership and staff are looking ahead. Those  seven decades of service provide a foundation upon which today's INL  will help this Nation build a brighter future. INL leads the effort to  maintain and extend the lives of America's nuclear reactor fleet, while  helping industry develop advanced reactor designs, including small  modular reactors and microreactors. INL's vital national and homeland  security work grows more important every day as our systems become  increasingly automated and interdependent.   As we eye the energy systems that will power U.S. prosperity into the  future, INL's clean energy research is developing breakthroughs that  will help integrate renewables into the power grid and allow our  manufacturing and transportation systems to operate more efficiently  and with less environmental impact.   It is our great honor to congratulate INL and DOE on this important  anniversary, and to wish its employees well as they work to resolve our  nation's pressing clean energy and national security challenges.                            ____________________
