On July 28, 2017, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0K-17 of the inclusion of       four (4) Embedded Global Positioning Units/Inertial       Navigation Systems (EGI) with GPS Selective Availability       Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) and three (3) AN/AAR-47E(V)2       (one (1) for each aircraft and one (1) spare). The EGIs and       AN/AAR-47E(V)2 were MDE. Also included were two (2) CPS Anti-      Jam System (GAS-1), two (2) Missile Warning System sets with       certification and installation in each aircraft, and three       (3) AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispensing Systems (one (1) for       each aircraft and one (1) spare) along with integration,       certification, and installation on each aircraft. These items       were to be used to equip two (2) of the six (6) total EDA SH-      60 helicopters. The inclusion of these MDE items did not       result in a change to the estimated MDE value of $47 million.       The total estimated case value remained $155 million.        On June 26, 2018, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0J-18 of the inclusion of       eight (8) Embedded Global Positioning Units/Inertial       Navigation Systems (EGI) with GPS Selective Availability       Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) and four (4) AN/AAR-47E Missile       Warning Systems (MWS) (MDE items). Also included were four       (4) GPS Anti-Jam Systems (GAS-1), four (4) AN/ALE-47       Countermeasure Dispensing Systems and eight (8) AN/ARC-210(V)       RT-1990A(C) radios. These items were to be used to equip the       remaining four (4) of the original six (6) total EDA SH-60F       helicopters. The estimated value of the additional MDE items       was $4.26 million, but the addition did not result in a       change to the estimated MDE value of $47 million. The total       estimated case value remained $155 million.        On November 16, 2018, Congress was notified by       Congressional certification transmittal number 0T-18 of the       inclusion of four (4) additional EDA SH-60F helicopters (two       flyable/two spares non-flying), including eight (8) T700-GE-      401 C engines (installed). Two (2) aircraft were to be       equipped with the following additional systems: four (4) EGIs       with GPS SAASM, two (2) AN/AAR-47E MWS (both items MDE); two       (2) GAS-1s, two (2) AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispensing       Systems, and four (4) AN/ARC-210(V) RT-1990A(C) radios. The       estimated value of the additional MDE items was $11.6       million, but the addition did not result in a change to the       estimated MDE value of $47 million. The total estimated case       value remained $155 million.        On May 21, 2019, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0K-19 of an increase in       total case value that had not been recently reevaluated. The       total case value increase was based on the following factors.       The previous value was calculated before the open and inspect       phase of the first aircraft. As retired aircraft stored at       the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG),       Spain's aircraft contained more damage that could be       discovered only during a full teardown and inspection, and       the last aircraft had been demilitarized and assessed in       overall poor condition with a planned date to be shredded.       Returning these aircraft to flight condition required       extensive work and greater expense than anticipated. There       was also a cost increase to provide for return-and-repair       services, engineering hours, and spare parts. No additional       MDE was added and the estimated MDE value remained $47       million. The estimated additional non-MDE value increased by       $61 million. The total estimated case value increased to $216       million.        On January 14, 2020, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0A-20 of an additional four       (4) Embedded Global Positioning Units/Inertial Navigation       Systems (EGIs) with GPS Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing       Module (SAASM). The estimated MDE value was $1 million, for a       total estimated MDE value of $48 million. The total estimated       case value increased to $217 million.        On September 7, 2021, Congress was notified by       Congressional certification transmittal number 0S-21 of the       inclusion of three (3) 7.62MM M240D Machine Guns. The total       estimated MDE value increased to $48.7 million. The total       estimated case value increased to $217.7 million.        This transmittal reports the inclusion of six (6)       additional 7.62MM M240D Machine Guns (MDE). The estimated       value of these items is $1 million. The total estimated MDE       value will increase to $49.7 million. The total case value       will increase to $218.7 million.        (iv) Significance: The proposed articles and services will       augment the Spanish Navy's multi-mission, multi-role       helicopters to perform humanitarian missions, search and       rescue, medical evacuations, firefighting, and anti-piracy       efforts.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO ally, which is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.
