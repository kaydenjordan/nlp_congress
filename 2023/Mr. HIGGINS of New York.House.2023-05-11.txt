 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, a racist, hateful  individual traveled to my community of Buffalo, New York, to commit  mass murder at a supermarket on Jefferson Avenue.   Armed with an AR-15 assault weapon, he shot 13 people, killing 10 of  them in less than 2 minutes.   It is often said that the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a  good guy with a gun. Retired Police Officer Aaron Salter, Jr., the  security guard on duty that day, was a good guy with a gun, but he was  outgunned by the bad guy with a bigger gun, and his weapon was no match  for the military-grade body armor the shooter wore. Body armor designed  for war zones has no place in our neighborhoods.   The Aaron Salter, Jr., Responsible Body Armor Possession Act  prohibits  [[Page H2258]]  civilians from buying and selling enhanced body armor. It protects  communities as well as law enforcement answering the call when public  safety is at risk.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  commonsense safety bill for the Buffalo community and for the many  others who have forever been changed by mass shootings.                            ____________________
