 Madam Speaker, today, October 15, is a big day for the  people of Chester and Berks Counties, National Mushroom Day.   Today, we honor the significant contributions Pennsylvania makes to  agriculture. Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, has become known as the  Mushroom Capital of the World, and rightfully so, as 60 percent of the  mushrooms consumed in America are grown right there.   Our community is home to many multigenerational family farms. These  farmers frequently collaborate, and their work has resulted in  meaningful innovations in the mushroom industry.   The industry employs nearly 10,000 workers and brings nearly $3  billion to Chester County--that is billion dollars. That is why I have  introduced legislation that formally recognizes this day and honors the  regions of Chester and Berks County, Pennsylvania, for their  unparalleled contributions to the national mushroom industry.   To all Pennsylvanians and all mushroom fans, happy National Mushroom  Day.                            ____________________
