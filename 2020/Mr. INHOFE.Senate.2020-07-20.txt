 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments. It is  going to be a very significant week. We know pretty much what we are  going to be doing with the defense authorization bill, which I believe,  and most people believe, is the most significant bill each year. We  have things that need to be done. We came to a great agreement prior to  the Fourth of July in terms of the numbers of amendments and the things  we had to get accomplished, and I think there is total agreement with  that.   We had a tragedy that took place during the last 2 weeks while we  were in recess. One affected a friend of mine,   John Lewis. We had a  real interesting--the 100th Congress, we went in, I think, in 1987, and  the 100th Congress had a lot of really great people.   John Lewis is one of them.   John Lewis and I became friends. You couldn't get two guys further  apart philosophically than   John Lewis and me. Yet we were always  close. I watched how peacefully he could get things done. He is someone  I got to know quite well.   We had a lot of others in that class. Jon Kyl has been very active in  recent years. He came back from retirement temporarily. He was in that  class. We had Ben Cardin. He and I became close friends. I think he was  in the State legislature first. Lamar Smith was one who was very, very  helpful to me all those years. Lamar Smith is from South Texas. Freddie  Upton--we referred to him as ``Little Freddie Upton''--is probably the  most recent one we had who is no longer in that same position. But John  Lewis was, and I had the honor of coming to Congress and being in the  same freshman class with him.   Ultimately, he was a courageous fighter in every part of his life. He  fought for the civil rights movement on the bridge to Selma, as a  Freedom Rider, and through his work on the Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee. He consistently did a great and peaceful job.  He fought for his constituents and the causes he believed in. He was a  fighter. He would not take no for an answer.   Up until the very end, he fought cancer. Like everything else, he  fought it with courage and honor.   The conscience of Congress may no longer be here, but his legacy for  his selfless service has been imparted to every one of us who served  with him and got to know him well. It seems like the ones who knew him  the best were those of us who served over in the other body, in the  House.  [[Page S4258]]         I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
