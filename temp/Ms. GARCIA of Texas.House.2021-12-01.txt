 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to a  mounting problem which is affecting every Texan: our deteriorating  infrastructure.   Now, I know a thing about infrastructure. When I was a county  commissioner, I saw firsthand how a lack of investment directly  impacted people in my area. As a State, we regularly have received  scores of C and D on our infrastructure. In my own area, it was even  worse because of the damage that hurricanes and flooding did on a  regular basis.   These deteriorating roads and bridges cost Texans over $700 a year in  damages and extra vehicle maintenance. That is an entire paycheck for  many of the people in my district. On top of that, Houstonians have had  to deal with the twin trouble of decaying roads and rapid growth.   Harris County is now home to over 700,000 more people than it had in  2010. Without significant investment, we are trying to fit more and  more people onto the same deteriorating roads.   Mr. Speaker, the traffic is so bad in parts of my city that I and  many other Houstonians simply avoid entire neighborhoods altogether.  This directly hurts small business owners who depend on infrastructure  for people to reach their stores.   Mr. Speaker, poor infrastructure does more than hurt families'  pocketbooks, it has already cost us lives. Everyone in Texas remembers  the winter storm this past February that left millions freezing in  their homes without power.   The extreme cold weather brought State power systems to the brink of  collapse. Over 200 Texans died in this storm, many of them seniors,  from cold weather exposure. It didn't have to be this way. The State  government had the choice the last time this kind of storm happened in  2011 to take the advice of Federal regulators and prepare our power  grid for winter emergencies. Instead, the State has done nothing and  will have to bear the cost.   Many Houstonians will also remember Hurricane Ike, Hurricane Rita,  and Hurricane Harvey, it comes one after another. Every year, another  ``storm of the century.''                                time  1015    These storms have caused hundreds of deaths, billions in damages, and  displaced thousands from their homes in Houston. Mr. Speaker, I could  go on and on, but the point is clear: my district is facing a clear and  present danger from the failure to invest in reliable infrastructure.   During the previous administration, we heard promise after promise  from Republicans. They were going to address this with the so-called  infrastructure weeks. I can't even remember how many of those we had,  but it certainly stretched for 4 years. Promises made, promises broken.   But I am proud that today I can go back to my district and say that  these critical investments are finally--finally--on their way. Thanks  to President Biden's commitment to working with Congress to get this  done, Texas will receive $35 billion to rebuild our infrastructure.  [[Page H6717]]    For all the problems I have spoken about, the Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act has a solution. This law will invest over $26  billion in funding for better roads and bridges built to last and to  handle future growth. It will also invest $3.3 billion to improve  public transit options that reduce congestion and improve  transportation for everyone. Texans will also benefit from a $3.5  billion program in this law that will protect power systems from  weather emergencies like the winter storm.   But this law doesn't just solve today's problems. It is also about  preparing us for tomorrow's opportunities.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will deliver reliable  internet access to rural Texas communities by investing over $100  million in expanding coverage. This will allow rural Texans to finally  access jobs and commerce that were previously locked away.   This bill will also prepare Texas for electric vehicles of the future  by investing nearly half a billion dollars to build our charging  station network.   Mr. Speaker, Texas is facing serious infrastructure problems. But  this law is the solution. I am proud that this money will soon flow  directly to communities in my State and improve lives.   Thanks to the leadership of President Biden, Speaker Pelosi, Leader  Schumer, and some of our friends across the aisle, this bipartisan  infrastructure bill will send help, and it is on the way.                            ____________________
