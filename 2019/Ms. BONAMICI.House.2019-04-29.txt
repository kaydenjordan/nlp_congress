 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Columbia River  In-Lieu and Treaty Fishing Access Sites Improvement Act. This bill  takes important steps to address an injustice that four Columbia River  Tribes have faced for decades.   Beginning in the 1930s, the construction of the Bonneville, John Day,  and Dalles dams on the lower Columbia River flooded many homes and  traditional fishing sites. The flooding displaced members of the  Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation,  Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Nez Perce  Tribe, and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. The  Army Corps of Engineers designed 31 Columbia River Treaty Fishing  Access Sites and ``in-lieu'' sites along the banks of the Columbia  River to be used primarily for in-season fishing and temporary camping,  but conditions have been extremely unsafe and unsanitary.   This bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to assess and  update electricity, water, and sewer infrastructure at existing Bureau  of Indian Affairs facilities that were constructed to provide treaty  Tribes access to traditional fishing grounds. These Tribes have treaty  rights to fishing access sites on the Columbia River and we must uphold  our obligations to provide safe and sanitary housing and  infrastructure. I thank Congressman Blumenauer and Senator Merkley for  their leadership, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
