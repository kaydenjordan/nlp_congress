 Mr. Speaker, in keeping with my office policy of giving a  floor speech for every State high school champion in the Sixth District  of Virginia, I rise to congratulate the Strasburg High School women's  track and field team for winning the Class 2 State championship, the  program's first State title since 1993.   Finishing with a total of 68 points, the Rams delivered strong  performances needed to win. These talented athletes include Macy Smith,  Claire Keefe, Paige Hiserman, Toni Rhodes, Megan Martin, Maddy  Dofermire, Neila Coughenour, Willow Musterman, and Amanie Hogan.   Junior sprinter and jumper Macy placed in all five of her events,  even winning a State title in the long jump with an impressive leap of  17 feet, 7\1/2\ inches.   Senior hurdler and jumper Maddy also placed in four events, winning  second place in the high jump.   Taking home the State title in the 4 x 800-meter relay were Claire,  Toni, Paige, and Megan, beating the runner-up by over 12 seconds.   Each one of these ladies serves as an inspiration not only to their  peers but to the entire Sixth District, proving that hard work and  dedication can yield tangible results.   Congratulations again to the Strasburg High School women's track and  field team on this incredible accomplishment.    Recognizing North Cross High School's Division II State Championships     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize North Cross High School  men's lacrosse, tennis, and track and field teams for each winning  their Division II State championships.   The men's lacrosse team secured its third consecutive title with an  outstanding 15-6 final score, making this their fourth championship win  in 5 years.   The lacrosse win was propelled by senior Joe Mason's six goals, as  well as by the sticks of seniors Caleb Thompson and Ian Cann, each of  whom added three goals to the tally.   Over on the tennis courts, the Raiders men's team captured its second  State title since 2016 with a 5-4 victory.   The tennis team's historic performance was led by sophomore Henry  Lugar, who dominated the court with a 10-0 win in his championship  singles match and finished the season with a perfect 20-0 record in  singles matches.   Junior Alessandro Perin and Jacob Juneau won their doubles match by  an outstanding 10-2 score.   The Raiders men's track and field team won their State championship  with 93 points. Freshman Jace Rhodes won first place in the triple  jump.   On the track, Rhodes was joined by senior Rhone Burton, junior Moritz  Mittendorfer, and junior Xavier Mitchell in the 4 x 100-meter relay,  taking the title with a sprint time of 43.97 seconds.   Congratulations to all these student athletes, parents, coaches, and  staff on their incredible achievements. They are all champions and have  proven that with hard work and dedication, anything can be  accomplished.                            ____________________
