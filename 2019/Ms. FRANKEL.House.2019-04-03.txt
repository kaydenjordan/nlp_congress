 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of what I consider, and  many consider, one of the most important pieces of legislation that  protects the families of America, the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act, because no woman or man or child should ever be  afraid to walk into their own home because of fear from violence from a  spouse or a dating partner.   So today, I rise on behalf of one of my constituents named Olga, from  Florida, who on her wedding day thought she was entering into a dream  marriage for herself and her two children. But this marriage turned  into a nightmare when her husband became aggressive, violent, and  controlling, imprisoning Olga and her two children in their own home,  not even letting the children go to school.    Olga fled to my hometown and was nurtured back to emotional and  financial health by a local domestic violence organization in my  community.   The Violence Against Women Act helps tackle the epidemic of domestic  violence, stalking, dating violence, and sexual violence.   Since it was first passed in 1994, serious victimization by an  intimate partner has dropped by 72 percent for women and 64 percent for  men. However, it is estimated that as many as 45 million adults will  still experience physical violence, rape, or stalking by an intimate  partner sometime in their lives.   Reauthorizing and strengthening this legislation, expanding  protections, increasing funding, and improving services to survivors  will save lives across America and help protect women like  [[Page H2998]]  Olga and let her children be spared from horrific violence.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this great bill.
