 Mr. President, by 2020, it is estimated that 65 percent of  all jobs will require at least some form of postsecondary education and  training. The National Skills Coalition estimates that nearly half of  all job openings between now and 2022 will be middle skill jobs that  require education beyond high school, but not a four-year degree. While  the number of students pursing postsecondary education is growing, the  supply of skilled workers still falls short of industry demand.  According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, 5.5 million U.S. jobs  are currently vacant, in part, because of a shortage of qualified  workers.   Our current Federal higher education policy must be improved to help  solve this problem. Pell Grants, needs-based grants for low-income and  working students, can only be awarded towards programs that are over  600 clock hours or at least 15 weeks in length. These grants cannot be  used to support many of the short-term occupational training programs  at community and technical colleges and other institutions that provide  skills and credentials employers need and recognize. When it comes to  higher education, Federal policies need to support the demands of the  changing labor market and support career pathways that align with  industry demand. According the Georgetown University Center on  Education and the Workforce, shorter-term educational investments pay  off--the average postsecondary certificate holder has 20 percent higher  lifetime earnings than individuals with only a high school diploma.   Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague, Senator Portman,  the Jumpstart Our Businesses by Supporting Students or JOBS Act. The  JOBS Act would close the ``skills gap'' by expanding Pell Grant  eligibility to cover high-quality and rigorous short-term job training  programs so workers can afford the skills training and credentials that  are in high-demand in today's job market. Since job training programs  are shorter and less costly, Pell Grant awards would be half of the  current discretionary Pell amount. The legislation defines eligible job  training programs as those providing career and technical education  instruction at an institution that provides at least 150 clock hours of  instruction time over a period of at least 8 weeks and that provides  training that meets the needs of the local or regional workforce. These  programs must also provide students with licenses, certifications, or  credentials that meet the hiring requirements of multiple employers in  the field for which the job training is offered.   The JOBS Act also ensures that students who receive Pell Grants are  earning high-quality postsecondary credentials by requiring that the  credentials meet the standards under the Workforce Innovation and  Opportunity Act, are recognized by employers, industry, or sector  partnerships, and align with the skill needs of industries in the  States or local economies. In Virginia, the Virginia Community College  System has identified approximately 50 programs that would benefit from  the JOBS Act including in the fields of manufacturing, architecture/ construction, energy, health care, information technology,  transportation, and business management and administration.   The JOBS Act is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would help  workers and employers succeed in today's economy. As Congress works to  reauthorize the Higher Education Act, I hope that my colleagues ensure  that Pell Grants are accessible for individuals participating in high- quality, short-term occupational training programs that are leading to  industry-recognized credentials and certificates.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN:   S. 212.
