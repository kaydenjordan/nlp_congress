 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentlewoman for yielding the balance of her time to me.   Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of the House companion to S.J.  Res. 34, I rise to strongly urge my colleagues to support the  resolution before us today. Like all of my colleagues in the House, I  care deeply about protecting the privacy of our constituents, but I  cannot support the Federal Communications Commission's  counterproductive rules that will actually harm consumers and stifle  innovation.   For 20 years, the Federal Trade Commission--or the FTC, as we call  it, frequently--oversaw consumer privacy for the entire internet  ecosystem: content providers, advertisers, and internet service  providers, or ISPs. The FTC's privacy program focused on preserving  sensitive consumer data and took the context of a consumer's  relationship with businesses into consideration. The FTC's experience  in implementing a wide range of rules and regulations has resulted in  over 500 cases protecting consumer information, ensuring their privacy  online.   In a flawed political move, absent any finding, complaints, or  investigations to determine whether broadband providers have violated  consumers' privacy or that the FTC had failed at doing its job, the FCC  proceeded with a partisan vote to target ISPs and to expand its  regulatory footprint.   After stripping the FTC of its authority over the privacy practices  of internet service providers, the FCC subsequently adopted rules that  would harm consumers and split the internet, creating an uneven playing  field between service providers and content providers. Congress must  fix this overreach so the new administration can create a  comprehensive, consistent set of privacy protections.                                time  1615    Consumers expect their privacy to be protected the same way no matter  what type of entity holds their data. Having two sets of requirements  creates confusion for consumers and may jeopardize their confidence in  the internet.   Our internet economy has thrived under the privacy regime created by  the FTC. Yet the FCC, under its previous Chairman, Tom Wheeler, wanted  to undermine that success by bifurcating privacy protections to serve  outside political interests, not the American consumer.   By contrast, the FCC's approach did not base its requirements on  consumers' preferences about sensitive information and to set opt-in  and opt-out defaults. Accordingly, its overall approach was top-down,  heavyhanded regulation in stark contrast to the FTC's greater reliance  on markets and consumer preferences.   The FCC's rule has a number of problematic issues:   The first is that the opt-in/opt-out regime reduces consumer choice  and would be detrimental to the survival of many businesses in this  country.   The second is that the FCC would have prohibited unforeseeable future  uses of collected data regardless of what consumers actually preferred  and businesses may need.   Third, the FCC would also have unjustly applied its heavyhanded  approach to broadband providers, treating them more harshly than other  players in the internet ecosystem.   In sum, the FCC's broadband privacy protection approach would have  rejected free markets and ignored sound economics.   Alternatively, the FTC private enforcement is market oriented and  flexible and adaptable to changes in consumer preferences and markets.  It also treats companies and players neutrally, fostering an  environment of competition and innovation.   This resolution rescinds the FCC's rule, but it does provide the FCC  the opportunity to provide oversight more in line with the FTC, which  has been successfully regulating online privacy for nearly two decades.   This joint resolution does not lessen or impede privacy and data  security standards that have already been established. We are simply  restoring a more stable regulatory playing field to ensure that  consistent, uniform privacy security standards are maintained to  protect consumers and future innovation.   Once Congress rejects these rules, the FCC can turn back to  cooperating with  [[Page H2494]]  the FTC to ensure that both consumer privacy across all aspects of the  internet is provided through vigorous enforcement and also that  innovation is allowed to flourish.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the GOP whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, we are thinking that the gentleman's  comments do not pertain to this resolution, that this resolution in no  way is going to allow any of the activities that were described,  whether it is cuddling or anything that is going to get in the way of  any of that or allowed to be sold.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Collins).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We have heard a lot of interesting claims today in the discussion  about this fairly simple resolution to roll back overreaching  regulation from the FCC that were passed late in the Obama  administration's time.   I would remind everybody, Mr. Speaker, that this CRA has nothing to  do with the President's tax return, it has nothing to do with Russian  hacking, and there have been some gross mischaracterizations of what  this resolution does.   Why do we need this resolution?   The three reasons are, as Chairwoman Blackburn opened up at the  beginning:   First of all, the FCC swiped jurisdiction from the FTC.   Second, two cops on the beat create confusion among consumers and  among the ISP providers.   Third, the FTC already has jurisdiction over this space.   Let me close with this: this resolution of disapproval only rescinds  the FCC's rule, but it still provides the FCC the opportunity to  provide more oversight more in line with the Federal Trade Commission,  which has successfully been regulating online privacy for nearly 2  decades.   This resolution does not lessen or impede the privacy and data  security standards that we already have established. We are simply  restoring a more stable regulatory playing field to ensure that  consistent uniform privacy standards are maintained to protect  consumers and future innovation.   Once Congress rejects these rules, the FCC can turn back to  cooperating with the FTC to ensure both the consumer privacy across all  aspects of the internet is protected through vigorous enforcement and  that innovation is allowed to flourish.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
