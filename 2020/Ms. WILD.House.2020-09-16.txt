 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3659,  Danny's Law, and I thank my friends and colleagues, Max Rose and Haley  Stevens, for introducing this important bill.   Across our communities, a national epidemic of suicide has devastated  far too many families. One of the most heartbreaking aspects of this  crisis concerns the loss of children to suicide, often a result of  pervasive, overwhelming bullying by their peers.   Danny's Law was named for Daniel Fitzpatrick, a 13-year-old boy whose  experiences with bullying led him to take his own life.   By directing the President to establish an antibullying roundtable to  make recommendations pertaining to bullying in elementary and secondary  schools, this legislation would make ending bullying a national  priority.   People of all ages, including children, suffer from the effects of  unmet mental health needs, with consequences that can be dire. In  taking the issue of suicide among children out of the shadows, we can  begin to overcome the stigma around mental health challenges, which  remain far too prevalent in our society.   In addition to the sometimes extreme consequences of pervasive  bullying, students who are bullied by their classmates are not able to  fully pursue their education or receive equal access to the academic  and social opportunities their schools provide. Preventing and ending  bullying will remove this major barrier.   Together, Republicans and Democrats alike, let us pass this bill in  remembrance of Daniel Fitzpatrick and in support of his family.   To every young person in our communities who may feel judged or  alone, you will never be alone. You are free to be who you are.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8162) to express the sense of Congress that the Secretary of  Education should provide certain waivers to community learning centers,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8162         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Community       Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FLEXIBLE USE OF SUBGRANT                     FUNDS.         It is the sense of Congress that for school year 2020-2021,       notwithstanding each provision in part B of title IV of the       Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       7171 et seq.) that requires activities under such part be       carried out during nonschool hours or periods when school is       not in session, the Secretary of Education should carry out       the exceptions included in the notice entitled ``Agency       Information Collection Activities; Comment Request; 21st CCLC       4201(b)(1) Waiver Request'', published by the Department of       Education in the Federal Register on September 3, 2020 (85       Fed. Reg. 55002) by providing that each eligible entity that       is awarded a subgrant under section 4204 of such Act (20       U.S.C. 7174) for community learning centers may use such       subgrant funds--        (1) to carry out activities described in section 4205 of       such Act (20 U.S.C. 7175), regardless of whether such       activities are conducted in-person or virtually, or during       school hours or when school is in session; and        (2) to provide in-person care during--        (A) the regular school day for students eligible to receive       services under part B of title IV of such Act (20 U.S.C. 7171       et seq.); and        (B) a period in which full-time in-person instruction is       not available for all such students served by such eligible       entity.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise to speak in support of passing the 21st Century Community  Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief Act of 2020, which I recently  introduced.   This pandemic and economic crisis have disrupted every aspect of life  in our society. As a result of the pandemic, many school districts will  provide academic instruction through remote or hybrid learning models  this school year. Estimates suggest that this fall, nearly 24 million  workers with children between the ages of 6 and 14 will have no at-home  childcare option.  [[Page H4453]]    For parents struggling to care for their children while maintaining  their professional responsibilities or trying to return to the  workforce, this time has been an unprecedented challenge. Those of us  who have the honor of representing our communities in Congress must  act. My commonsense, bipartisan legislation offers a path forward.   My bill expresses a sense of Congress that the flexibility provided  to States through the Department of Education's recent waiver for 21st  Century Community Learning Centers, the only federally funded  initiative dedicated to supporting after-school, before-school, and  summer learning programs, allows subgrantees to provide virtual  programming and school-aged childcare during the workday to help meet  the need of students and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.   These learning centers, which typically operate out of Boys & Girls  Clubs, YMCAs, schools, and other community centers, have existing  trusted partnerships with the school districts that they serve. The  flexibility expressed in my legislation will help school districts  leverage these partnerships to create options for families and to  cultivate environments in which K-12 students could receive additional  academic support, school-aged children could receive safe care during  the workday, schoolday, and working parents would be able to return to  and stay in the workforce.   Over the last several months, I have heard from dozens of parents  across my community who are concerned about how they are going to  tackle this school year, how they will find affordable childcare, how  they make sure their children don't fall behind academically, and how  they will stay in the workforce. I am proud that my legislation  supports flexible, affordable, school-aged childcare options to create  safe, structured learning environments for students to thrive and to  enable parents to get back to work.   Right now, families need options and flexibility. Without it, our  students, our workers, and our economy will all pay the price. Putting  forward solutions to these issues is a national priority, not just for  the sake of children and families across our communities, but also for  businesses trying to retain employees or hire new workers.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in passing  this legislation with a resounding, bipartisan vote.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague across the aisle, Mr.  Van Drew, for supporting this very important piece of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 8162. It is legislation that will provide vital support  for students, for parents, for employers, for schools, and for our  economy as we all grapple with the effects of this pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
