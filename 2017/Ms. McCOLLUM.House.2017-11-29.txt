 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  destructive bill.   This bill undermines bedrock environmental and public land management  laws in order to create a perpetual lease for a foreign-owned toxic  mine. This mine will be on the doorstep of one of our country's last  truly wild places, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.   The Boundary Waters contains 1.1 million acres of unspoiled woodlands  and more than 1,000 pristine lakes. The water wilderness is beloved by  adventurers, canoers, sportsmen, and sportswomen from all across the  United States and around the world.   To safeguard this natural treasure, Congress has prohibited logging,  mining, and even the use of most motorized vehicles on this Federal  land. It has made the Boundary Waters a haven for birds and other  wildlife and the most visited wilderness area in the United States of  America.   These visitors, over 250,000 annually, have helped the economy and  created jobs in northern Minnesota, but the bill we are debating today  puts this all at risk. It paves the way for a massive sulfide-ore  copper mine just a few miles from the Boundary Waters Wilderness.   Sulfide-ore mining is the most toxic industry in the United States.  Sulfide mines pollute waterways with acid drainage, which contain  arsenic, lead, and mercury. This type of mining is particularly risky  in the vast, interconnected watershed that flows throughout the  Boundary Waters into Voyageurs National Park and across the border into  the Canadian provincial park.   The supporters of H.R. 3905 claim that the bill still protects the  Boundary Waters because the mines will be located outside the  wilderness area. Mr. Speaker, this is simply not the case. Let me show  you where the mining would take place here.   This is the site of the proposed mine on the edge of the wilderness  area. The river that you see flows through the Boundary Waters. The  area contains popular Forest Service campgrounds and entry points to  the wilderness. It is a base for scouting and veterans' outdoor  recreation trips. Some of the Superior National Forest's most popular  fishing lakes and hunting grounds are in this area. They are home to  hundreds of people and businesses.   If this bill passes, it will create an industrial wasteland. This  bill poses an unacceptable risk of irreparable damage to a pristine  wilderness.   A 2012 study of American sulfide-ore mines found that all mines have  leaked, and 92 percent of them had experienced failures that negatively  affected the local water quality. Even state-of-the-art sulfide-ore  copper mines consistently pollute their surrounding environments.   For example, in August 2014, a copper mine in British Columbia  released a toxic slurry--10 billion liters of wastewater and 5 billion  liters of tailings--that created a polluted dystopia of dead trees and  contaminated salmon spawning areas.   Because of the risks involved with these mines, the Forest Service  has begun a 2-year environmental review that will determine if the  Boundary Waters is an appropriate place for dangerous sulfide-ore  copper mining or if a 20-year withdrawal of mining rights in the  watershed is appropriate.   This review is the process that Congress established, under the  Federal Land Policy and Management Act, for considering mineral  withdrawal. The review is supported by Minnesota's Governor, tribal  governments, and 79 percent of all Minnesotans. It also has been  supported by both the current and the former administration.   Just this morning, again, I spoke with the chief of the U.S. Forest  Service and thanked him for the administration's commitment to allow  the study to go forward.   But the bill we are considering today stops this established  scientific review process from going forward. Instead, it creates a  loophole for the benefit of a foreign mining interest. It automatically  reinstates two expired and denied leasings dating back to 1966, before  modern environmental laws like the Clean Water Act. It allows permanent  mining leases on national forestland, our Nation's public land,  removing scientific safeguards, environmental considerations, and  public input from the renewal process. It exempts Federal forests in  Minnesota from the protections of the landmark Antiquities Act. It sets  a dangerous precedent and will have consequences all across our  country.   There is simply no justification for Congress to rewrite the rules  for our Federal forests in Minnesota, and that is exactly what this  piece of legislation does. In short, this proposal is a giveaway of  public resources to private interests. One of our Nation's last wild  places becomes collateral damage.   Good people of both parties all across Minnesota and throughout this  country know the importance of protecting this pristine wilderness, and  that is why so many of them have submitted letters to Congress in  opposition to H.R. 3905.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these letters of opposition from  Minnesota's Governor, Mark Dayton; three Tribal nations: Fond du Lac,  Grand Portage, and White Earth Bands of the Minnesota Chippewa; the  Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, the National Wildlife  Federation, and other sporting groups; the Girl Scouts of Minnesota and  Wisconsin; Veterans for the Boundary Waters; and a coalition of dozens  of national organizations that advocate for clean water and public  lands and conservation.                                                 State of Minnesota,                                  Office of Governor Mark Dayton,                                  Saint Paul, MN, November 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: I write in strong opposition to H.R.       3905, which I understand has passed out of Committee and is       being reviewed by House Majority Leadership for a floor vote.       I implore you not to schedule a vote on this bill without a       full vetting of the serious risks to the Boundary Waters       Canoe Area Wilderness from adjacent copper-nickel mining, the       status of the two-year federal study currently underway, and       the wishes of the majority of Minnesotans, who oppose copper-      nickel mining in the immediate vicinity of the Boundary       Waters.        H.R. 3905 is a bill, ``To require congressional approval of       any mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving the       National Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota, to       provide for the renewal of certain mineral leases in such       lands, and for other purposes.'' H.R. 3905 was introduced in       response to the desires of a foreign mining company to use       Congress to circumvent the deliberations of the U.S.       Departments of Interior and Agriculture and their agencies,       the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest       Service (USFS), to determine whether copper-nickel mining can       be conducted safely in this ecologically sensitive part of       Minnesota.        The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BCWAW) is       America's most popular national Wilderness Area, drawing       visitors from all over the world to Northeastern Minnesota to       fish, hunt, and experience its interconnected pristine lakes,       rivers and streams. Additionally, the BWCAW contributes       enormously to Minnesota's social and economic wellbeing.        In January, 2017, the BLM and the USFS began a       comprehensive two-year study to determine whether copper-      nickel mining, with its toxic by-product, sulfide ore, is       appropriate within the watershed and immediate vicinity of       the BWCA. Specifically, this environmental review will       determine whether the Superior National Forest lands next to       the BWCAW should be removed from the federal mining program       to protect the Wilderness from pollution and other       environmental degradation caused by the resulting sulfide       ore. The study considers a wide variety of factors, including       scientific evidence, public input, economic considerations,       ecological characteristics, and recreational value, among       others.        I respectfully ask that you allow the completion of this       important review process. Over 126,000 Americans have       submitted public comments as part of it. Many attended three       public meetings conducted earlier this year by the BLM and       USFS. Moving H.R. 3905 forward at this time would disregard       the input of all Americans, who have participated in the       process, as well as the views of the 79 percent of       Minnesotans, who favor the two-year pause and environmental       review of potential impacts to the BWCAW.        The BWCAW is crucially important to our state, and I       believe strongly that future federal and state decisions       about its future should be made only after the most careful       and objective scientific review. I urge you to reject the       attempts by a foreign mining corporation to short-circuit the       review process underway, and to affirm the importance of a       careful, objective analysis under the existing federal legal       framework.        Continuing this review process is the best way to allow for       well-informed federal and state decisions, which will affect       many future generations of Americans. Industry should not       dictate the stewardship of taxpayer-owned public lands, nor       use Congress  [[Page H9502]]       to short-circuit sound decision-making--especially regarding       pristine Wilderness Areas like the BWCAW.            Sincerely,                                                       Mark Dayton,      Governor.                                   ____           Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Reservation             Business Committee,                                       Cloquet, MN, August 3, 2017.      Re Subcommittee's July 27, 2017 Hearing on Congressman           Emmer's Draft Bill       Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Gosar,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Subcommittee           on Energy and Mineral Resources, Washington, DC.      Hon. Alan Lowenthal,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,           Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairmen Bishop and Gosar and Ranking Members Grijalva       and Lowenthal: I write on behalf of the Fond du Lac Band of       Lake Superior Chippewa to express our profound concerns       about, and strong objections to, the draft bill offered by       Congressman Emmer that was the subject of the hearing on July       27 before the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.       This draft bill would retroactively grant to a foreign-owned       mining company--one that has a history of environmental       violations in its home country--a perpetual lease of federal       mineral rights. It would further eliminate an ongoing       administrative process that is essential to the proper       evaluation of any future development of federal minerals       within this exceptional part of the Superior National Forest       lands. We urge you not to support this measure.        The Fond du Lac Band is a federally recognized Indian       tribe. We hold a Reservation just south of Superior National       Forest which was established for us by Treaty with the United       States on September 30, 1854, 10 Stat. 1109. The 1854 Treaty       further reserved to us the rights to hunt, fish and gather on       lands outside our Reservation. These lands extend into the       Arrowhead region of Minnesota, and encompass the lands within       much of Superior National Forest and the Boundary Waters       Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), including the lands that are       affected by this draft bill.        The BWCAW, the lands adjacent to it, as well as the lands       beyond the BWCAW's buffer zone and within the Superior       National Forest, are pristine. This region--within the Rainy       Lake Watershed--is a unique water-based ecosystem with       thousands of lakes and interconnected waterbodies. The       quality of its waters is high and those waters provide       critically important habitat for fish and wildlife, including       moose and other unique natural resources like wild rice. The       waters, wild rice, fish and game are especially important to       the Chippewa. Such natural resources have sustained our       people for centuries and are the foundation of our culture       and religion. The natural resources in this region play an       increasingly important role in our ability to feed our       families and exercise our Treaty rights, because many of the       waters southwest of this region are impaired (as designated       by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency) from mining       pollutants which have, in turn, destroyed wild rice beds and       led to fish consumption advisories.        Although northeastern Minnesota has a long history of       mining, the mining done to date in the State has been for       iron and taconite. The proposals to develop sulfide ore       mining, for copper, nickel and palladium, would be the first       of their kind in Minnesota. The history of such mines       elsewhere highlights the very serious environmental damage       that they pose from acid mine drainage--risks that Minnesota       has not yet had occasion to address or regulate. Those risks       are especially acute in water-based ecosystems like those in       the BWCAW and the Rainy Lake watershed of Minnesota. And the       proposed development of sulfide ore mines in lands       immediately south of the BWCAW poses a serious and direct       threat to the BWCAW for the very simple reason that the       waters in that region flow north--towards the BWCAW.        Because of the very substantial risks posed by sulfide-ore       mining, Minnesota Governor Dayton made a decision in March       2016 not to permit the use of state lands for mining in this       area, and subsequently the Secretaries of Interior and       Agriculture made like decisions with regard to federal lands.       In particular, these federal agencies declined to renew two       leases of federal minerals which had been made a half-century       ago to the predecessor of Twin Metals Mine, and its foreign       owner, Antofagasta Minerals. One of these leases covers land       that is directly adjacent to the BWCAW. The other is within       three miles of the BWCAW. The federal decision was based on a       determination that the leases posed an unacceptable risk to       the waters and natural resources in the BWCAW. In connection       with that decision, the Departments of Interior and       Agriculture initiated a process to evaluate whether 234,328       acres of federal lands within this ecologically unique region       should be withdrawn from mining.        The federal review process is now underway and should be       allowed to continue. Decisions on whether to allow sulfide-      ore mining, especially in this unique water-based ecosystem,       need to take into account all of the impacts of the proposed       project and should be based on objective science, economics       and the social and related impacts of such development on the       lives and livelihood of Minnesotans, including federally-      protected tribal Treaty rights.        Such analysis should also be done before any decision is       made to reinstate expired, or expiring, leases of federal       minerals in this area. The need for such an analysis is       illustrated by the expired leases for the Twin Metals Mine.       The original leases, which had a 20-year term, were made in       1966, well before enactment of laws that are essential to       protecting the environment, such as the Clean Water Act. The       original leases were also made before the federal courts       confirmed the continued rights of the Chippewa to hunt, fish       and gather in this region, and accordingly do not take into       account the impact of the mineral leases on these treaty-      protected rights. All such matters should be carefully       considered, and the on-going administrative review process is       intended to do this and should be allowed to continue.        The draft bill does not do this. Instead of allowing a       process that would permit informed decision-making, the bill       would eliminate the on-going review process. The bill would       further retroactively reinstate the Twin Metals' expired       leases, while rewriting the terms of those leases to convert       them into ``indeterminate'' leases, while further limiting       the federal government's ability to impose conditions on       these leases--giving to the company what appears to be       essentially a perpetual right to the federal minerals on       these lands. Further, the bill would do the same for all       other unidentified leases that may now exist on National       Forest Service lands within Minnesota, as well as any future       such leases.        The kind of mining that Twin Metals and Antofagasta propose       to develop is dangerous and poses a direct and substantial       threat to what has long been recognized as an exceptional and       extraordinary wilderness. Those threats should be carefully       assessed through the on-going administrative review process.       Congress should not enact laws that preclude informed       decision-making or which blindly re-write leases, but should       allow the federal agencies which have been delegated       responsibility for addressing the terms and conditions on       which federal lands may be leased, to continue to exercise       that authority under existing law. Finally, to the extent       that Twin Metals Mine contends that the federal government's       decision not to renew its leases is wrong, it has already       chosen to raise those claims in federal court, where they are       pending.        We urge Congress not to proceed with this draft bill.            Sincerely,                                              Kevin R. Dupuis, Sr.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           Grand Portage Reservation                                                  Tribal Council,                                  Grand Portage, MN, April 29, 2016.      Hon. Tom Vilsack,      Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Christina Goldfuss,      Director, Council on Environmental Quality, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sally Jewell,      Secretary of the Interior, U.S. Department of the Interior,           Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Vilsack, Secretary Jewell, and Director       Goldfuss: The Grand Portage Band (``the Band'') is a       federally recognized Indian tribe, as one of the member bands       of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe (``MCT''). The Band, along       with two other MCT Bands, Fond du Lac and Bois Forte, retain       hunting, fishing, and other usufructuary rights that extend       throughout the entire northeast portion of the state of       Minnesota under the 1854 Treaty of LaPointe (the ``Ceded       Territory''). In the Ceded Territory, all the Bands have a       legal interest in protecting natural resources and all       federal agencies share in the federal government's trust       responsibility to the Bands to maintain those treaty       resources.        The Band is concerned with the prospect of a series of       sulfide-ore mines being developed in the headwaters of the       Boundary Waters Canoe Area (``BWCA'') watershed. The BWCA       watershed is located on the Minnesota/Ontario border and is       entirely within the 1854 Ceded Territory. The BWCA watershed       is comprised of a vast area of pristine interconnected       waterways that have been used by the Chippewa for centuries.       Low buffering capacity of water and soil and the       interconnection of lakes and streams, make the BWCA watershed       particularly vulnerable to the impacts of mining.        Sulfide-ore mines are proposed to be built in the BWCA       watershed, immediately adjacent to the BWCA and upstream from       it. These mines would threaten to pollute pristine water and       damage the important forest habitat used by many types of       wildlife. Sulfide-ore mining has a consistent record of       devastating environmental harm, including contaminating       waters, degrading forests, and predicted, catastrophic spills       of toxic materials. There are inherent risks to sulfide-ore       mining, and it makes no sense to place what the Environmental       Protection Agency calls the nation's most toxic industry in       the BWCA watershed and within the Ceded Territory upon which       the Band relies.        Therefore, the Band is requesting that the Department of       interior and Department of Agriculture take steps to       permanently protect the Boundary Waters watershed front  [[Page H9503]]       sulfide-ore mining. Specifically, we urge you to:        1. Ensure that no leasing of federal minerals occurs within       the BWCA watershed by denying applications for new federal       mineral leases and federal mineral lease renewals.        2. Withdraw the federally owned minerals within the BWCA       watershed from the federal mineral leasing program.        3. Take any additional measures necessary to protect the       BWCA watershed from the threat of sulfide-ore mining.        We urge you to ensure that the full extent of the risks       posed by large-scale sulfide-ore mining in the BWCA       headwaters are thoroughly considered in order to determine       the best course for the future of the watershed and the       tribal communities who rely on its clean water and intact       forested habitats to exercise usufructuary rights.

Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters, we urge you to OPPOSE H.R. 3905, the so-      called ``Minnesota's Economic Rights in the Superior National       Forest Act'' when it is considered on the House floor.        Simply put, H.R. 3905 is a bill to allow sulfide-ore mining       at the edge of the Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness       (BWCAW), directly threatening one of America's most       accessible and most-visited wilderness areas. At 1.1 million       acres in size, the BWCAW is the largest wilderness east of       the Rockies and north of the Everglades. This interconnected       system of lakes, rivers, and streams provides unparalleled       opportunities for solitude, recreation, hunting and fishing.       The connections between Northern Minnesota's national       forests, Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness, Voyageurs       National Park, and Quetico Provincial Park makes this entire       trans boundary area extremely susceptible to the threat of       pollution from sulfide-ore mining, one of the most toxic       industries in America, according to the EPA.        H.R. 3905 would require congressional approval of any       mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving National       Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota and would       provide for the perpetual renewal of federal mineral leases       in Minnesota, including two that were denied by the Forest       Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The bill       undermines the Antiquities Act, National Environmental Policy       Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Boundary Waters       Wilderness Act, and other laws regulating mineral leasing in       Minnesota's national forests.        Contrary to the bill's title, H.R. 3905 would do more harm       than good for the economy of Northern Minnesota. Economic       analysis by Key-Log Economics LLC shows that sulfide-ore       mining on Superior National Forest lands in the watershed of       the Boundary Waters could lead to the loss of nearly 5,000       jobs in tourism, 5,000 to 22,000 jobs in the rest of the       economy, a $1.6 billion loss in annual income, and a $500       million reduction in private property values.        Specifically, we urge opposition to this bill because it       would:        Renew two expired and undeveloped mineral leases on       Superior National Forest lands next to the Boundary Waters       and along lakes and rivers that flow directly into the       Wilderness, advancing a foreign mining company's interests at       the expense of beloved American public lands.        Void the December 2016 record of decision by the Forest       Service withholding its consent to two mineral lease renewal       requests in the Superior National Forest due to the       unacceptable risks to this watershed, which according to the       Forest Service holds 20 percent of the National Forest       System's fresh water supply.        Undermine the National Environmental Policy Act by limiting       review of these two mineral leases to a 30-day environmental       assessment. Contrary to the bill language, there is no       `pending EA.' However, this section would override the       ongoing two-year Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)       initiated by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management       to carefully consider the potential impacts of sulfide-ore       mining on the Boundary Waters watershed. The ongoing EIS is       strongly supported by Minnesota's Governor Dayton and by the       citizens of Minnesota. More than 79% of Minnesota voters       support the study, while more than 126,000 citizens submitted       comments during the scoping phase.        Amend the 1906 Antiquities Act by mandating Congressional       approval for any national monument designations in       Minnesota's national forests. The Antiquities Act is a       bipartisan conservation law, which has been used by       Presidents of both parties, to protect irreplaceable federal       lands from potential threats. Monument designation under the       Antiquities Act have provided protections for areas including       the Grand Canyon, Acadia, Zion, Muir Woods, and Olympic       National Parks. Quite simply, this attack on the Antiquities       Act is an attack against our national parks and monuments.        Amend the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act       (FLPMA) by mandating Congressional approval for mineral       withdrawals in Minnesota's national forests. Additionally,       FLPMA intentionally left intact the presidential power to       protect public lands as monuments.        Bar the Forest Service from complying with its legal       obligations under the 1978 Boundary Waters Wilderness Act. In       this Act Congress requires the Forest Service to maintain the       high-water quality of the Boundary Waters and a Mining       Protection Area within the Superior National Forest. The       Forest Service concluded that sulfide-ore mining near the       Boundary Waters would be ``contrary to Congress'       determination that it is necessary to `protect the special       qualities of the [BWCAW] as a natural forest-lakeland       wilderness ecosystem of major esthetic, scientific,       recreational and educational value to the Nation.' ''        Make all mineral leases on Minnesota's national forests       essentially perpetual. The `perpetual' nature of these leases       is material change in long-standing mineral leasing law and       policy. The bill would also override the two laws (1946 and       1950) on mineral leasing in Minnesota's national forests that       require Forest Service consent to any mining.        Ignore the request of the International Joint Commission       that environmental review of impacts on trans boundary water       quality and cumulative effects be studied and the requests of       four tribal entities (the area is Ceded Territory).        Thank you for considering our concerns. In order to       adequately protect iconic places like the Boundary Waters,       Voyageurs National Park, and all of Minnesota's public lands,       and bedrock environmental laws like the Antiquities Act and       the National Environmental Policy Act, we urge you to OPPOSE       H.R. 3905.

Dear Member of Congress, I am writing to request you vote       no on H.R. 3905, which is a bill that would stop a 2-year       Forest Service study of environmental, economic, and social       risks to the Boundary Waters from sulfide-ore copper mining       on Superior National Forest lands in the headwaters of the       Boundary Waters Canoe Area.        For over fifty years, Northern Lakes Canoe Base has offered       wilderness canoe trips in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area       Wilderness (BWCAW). I guided Girl Scout canoe trips for five       years and have directed our wilderness program for 7 years       and am writing this letter to describe the strengths of this       program to you and to underscore the fact that this one-of-a-      kind program cannot exist anywhere other than the Boundary       Waters.        Girls who come on our canoe trips may have had basic       camping and canoeing experiences, but few have experience in       wilderness travel. We typically serve 150-200 girls a summer.        In general, girls travel in wilderness areas less than       boys. Even in 2017, girls are taught to think that the       outdoors is no place for a girl because it is hard work,       dirty, and going to the mall is just much easier. We teach       teenage girls, in a girl-only environment, that their       individual strength and the power of teamwork is far greater       than they ever imagined. They also learn that hard work and       dirt is part of the fun on a Boundary Waters canoe trip, and       they leave with an appreciation for the beauty of wilderness       and an understanding of the challenges they now know they can       overcome. Girl Scout wilderness canoe trips bring out the       best in teenage girls; we see how creative, hardworking, and       kind they can be to each other. It doesn't take much       imagination to believe that these traits will follow them       back to their everyday life.        We are a high quality, affordable program and pride       ourselves on our thriftiness. We use our canoes for 20+       seasons and packs and paddles summer after summer. We do this       so we can serve girls from all economic backgrounds,       including local iron range and Native American communities.        For years we have received feedback from participants       crediting their Boundary Waters experience for continued,       life-long growth. Our program cannot exist somewhere other       than the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. No other       place on earth offers the perfect combination of       accessibility and high adventure that the BWCAW offers. Many       of our participants drive to Ely from Chicago, Milwaukee, and       Minneapolis. Many others fly to Minneapolis and then rent a       car to get to Ely. Unlike many other wilderness areas which       may be high on a mountain range or only accessible by high-      clearance vehicles, it is easy for a mom or dad to drive a       van full of girls to the Boundary Waters, send them on a       trip, and then pick them up a week later.        The Boundary Waters is also unique in that, unlike many       other wilderness areas, visitors don't require any previous       experience or training to have a safe, adventurous trip.       Anyone seeking adventure and challenge belongs on a canoe       trip, not just body builders and endurance athletes. We have       even seen that a Girl Scout canoe trip sometimes inspires       girls who may be uninterested in athletics or leadership to       seek out their own creative ways to be active and healthy,       leading to improved confidence and greater aspirations.       Again, it doesn't take much imagination to conclude that       girls who experience wilderness travel will go on to make the       world a better place.        Girl Scouts canoe trip participants always remark that the       solitude they find in the Boundary Waters is unlike any they       have found elsewhere, whether at their own Girl Scout       resident camp or a state or national park. The quiet       environment of a protected wilderness area gives them an       opportunity to reflect on their life in a way that they could       not in a non-wilderness setting. Girl Scouts end their canoe       trip with a swagger to their step, ready to take on any       challenge that comes their way.        Thank you for doing your part to preserve the Boundary       Waters Canoe Area Wilderness by voting no on H.R. 3905. It       means a lot to all of us in Ely whose programs and businesses       are focused around wilderness travel.            Sincerely,                                                    Ann McNally,                                           Northern Lakes Canoe Base      Summer Program Director/Guide.                                   ____                                                  November 28, 2017.        Dear Representative: Representative Tom Emmer's bill, H.R.       3905, is a dangerous piece of legislation that endangers the       public land we as veterans fought to protect. This bill would       allow a foreign mining conglomerate, Antofagasta, to build       dangerous copper-nickel mines in the headwaters of America's       most visited Wilderness Area, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area       Wilderness in Northeastern Minnesota. On behalf of Veterans       for the Boundary Waters, I urge you to vote no on H.R. 3905.        The Boundary Waters is a place of healing for many veterans       suffering from trauma or having difficulty readjusting to       life at home. The peace found in this Wilderness is       priceless, and if destroyed, we will be robbing future       veterans of their chance to heal. One specific camp, Voyageur       Outward Bound School (VOBS), provides vets-only trips to help       veterans readjust to life at home through Wilderness       experiences. This program has been incredibly successful.       Unfortunately, VOBS is located on the same lake as the       proposed mines and, if passed, H.R. 3905 would cause this       camp to shut down, eliminating hundreds of American jobs by       moving to Canada, and eliminating and the opportunity for       veterans to take advantage of these incredibly beneficial       programs.        If passed, H.R. 3905 would have severe negative       consequences for veterans in Minnesota and across the       country. The Boundary Waters and Voyageurs National Park are       public lands that are meant to be protected for veterans and       their families to enjoy. H.R. 3905 would endanger these       public lands and prohibit future generations of veterans from       experiencing these national treasures. We have an obligation       to honor our nation's veterans by protecting the same public       lands they fought for.        Again, please VOTE NO on H.R. 3905.            Sincerely,        Erik Packard, Staff Sergeant U.S. Army and Army Reserve       1996-2004, 2006-2013; Joe Banavige, US Army Officer, Desert       Storm 1st Armored Division; Craig Shaver, US Marine Corps       Infantry, Operation Enduring Freedom; Sergio Manacero, 1st       Combat Engineer Batallion, 1st Marine Division.                                   ____                                                   November 6, 2017.      Re: H.R. 3905.       Member of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Member of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee:       The undersigned coalitions, organizations, and businesses       represent approximately 18 million sportsmen and sportswomen,       282 businesses, and the broad spectrum of users of the       Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness from across America. We       stand united in strong opposition to H.R. 3905.        H.R. 3905 would require congressional approval of any       mineral withdrawal or monument designation involving National       Forest System lands in the State of Minnesota and would       provide for the renewal of two federal mineral leases that       were denied by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land       Management. Specifically, the bill would:        Renew two mineral leases on Superior National Forest lands       next to the Boundary Waters and along lakes and rivers that       flow directly into the Wilderness. The now-expired mineral       leases have never been developed into a mine.        Void the 18-page record of decision by the Forest Service       withholding its consent to two mineral lease renewal       requests. Peer-reviewed science documents that sulfide-ore       copper mining on these lease areas would pollute the Boundary       Waters. An overwhelming majority of the public supports this       decision and by more than two to one, opposes copper mining       near the Boundary Waters (2017 Fabrizio Ward poll).        Undermine the National Environmental Policy Act by limiting       review of these two mineral leases to a 30-day environmental       assessment. Contrary to the bill language, there is no       `pending EA.' The expired mineral leases have never undergone       environmental review. Scientific evidence documents the       potential for negative environmental harm to a national       wilderness area (Boundary Waters) and a national park       (Voyageurs National Park) if mining were allowed on these       lease areas, and NEPA requires unrestricted environmental       review.        Make all mineral leases on Minnesota's national forests       essentially perpetual. The `perpetual' nature of these leases       is material change in long-standing mineral leasing law and       policy.        Over-ride the two laws (1946 and 1950) on mineral leasing       in Minnesota's national forests that require Forest Service       consent to any mining.        Amend the 1906 Antiquities Act by mandating Congressional       approval for any national monument designations in       Minnesota's national forests.        Amend the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act by       mandating Congressional approval for mineral withdrawals in       Minnesota's national forests        Bar the Forest Service from complying with its legal       obligations under the 1978 Boundary Waters Wilderness Act.        Ignore the request of the International Joint Commission       that environmental review of impacts on transboundary water       quality and cumulative effects be studied and the requests of       four tribal entities (the area is Ceded Territory).        The Boundary Waters is the most-accessible and most-visited       Wilderness area in the nation. It draws 155,000 visitors       every year and provides unparalleled backcountry       opportunities. At 1.1 million acres in size, it is the       largest Wilderness east of the Rockies and north of the       Everglades. The vast network of lakes, rivers, and streams       that gives the Boundary Waters its name is the basis of our       strong canoe culture. The Boundary Waters includes 1,200       miles of canoe and kayak routes and 2,000 designated       campsites, and is home to some of the finest backcountry       angling and hunting in the nation. Sportsmen and women ply       the clean waters and healthy forests of the Wilderness in       pursuit of walleye, bass, pike, trout, bear, deer, grouse,       and wild rice.  [[Page H9505]]         The scientific evidence of harm to the Boundary Waters from       sulfide-ore copper mining in the watershed is strong.       Hydrologists say that pollution is inevitable--it is not `if'       but `when.' Hardrock mining is the most toxic industry in       America, according to the EPA. The acid mine drainage       associated with this type of mining harms water, aquatic and       terrestrial species, forests, and soils, and poses a serious       risk to human health. Scientific and economic studies show       that sulfide-ore copper mining along lakes and streams that       flow directly into the Boundary Waters puts at risk not only       our premiere fishing, hunting, and recreation on Superior       National Forest lands, but also the strong, stable economy of       Northeastern Minnesota. Economic analysis by Key-Log       Economics LLC shows that sulfide-ore copper mining on       Superior National Forest lands in the watershed of the       Boundary Waters could lead to the loss of nearly 5,000 jobs       in tourism, 5,000 to 22,000 jobs in the rest of the economy,       a $1.6 billion loss in annual income, and a $500 million       reduction in private property values.        H.R. 3905, an ill-advised effort to advance a foreign       mining company's interests at the expense of beloved public       lands, would gut long-standing and powerful national       conservation laws and undermine recent decisions by the       Department of Interior and Department of Agriculture to take       a two-year pause in mining-related activity to analyze the       risks of sulfide-ore copper mining in the watershed of the       Boundary Waters.        Agriculture Secretary Perdue and Interior Secretary Zinke       support the ongoing Forest Service two-year study. H.R. 3905       would remove authority for them and their agencies to make       appropriate and reasonable decisions to manage the Superior       National Forest and the Boundary Waters.        The ongoing two-year Forest Service study was initiated by       the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management after       careful consideration of the potential impacts of sulfide-ore       copper mining in the Boundary Waters watershed. It is       strongly supported by Minnesota's Governor Dayton and by the       citizens of Minnesota. More than 79% of Minnesota voters       support the study. More than 126,000 citizens submitted       comments during the scoping phase and more than 3,000 people       participated in three Forest Service listening sessions and,       by a margin of nearly two-to-one, testified in support of       protecting the Boundary Waters.            Sincerely,        Sportsmen for the Boundary Waters, By Jason Zabokrtsky,       Chair, Representing 15 hunting and fishing organizations;       Boundary Waters Business Coalition, By Steve Piragis, Chair,       Representing 282 businesses from Minnesota and throughout       America; Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters; By Becky Rom,       Chair; Representing 26 conservation organizations; Veterans       for the Boundary Waters; By Erik Packard, Chair, Representing       military veterans; Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts for the       Boundary Waters, By Ann McNally, Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join them  and to join me in opposing this bill, and I thank the gentleman from  California for the time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I  brought this poster to the floor earlier. I bring it again up here.  This is the proposed area in which the Twin Metals mine has been  looking at doing the sulfide-copper ore mining, which, as I pointed  out, 92 percent of the mines have polluted water quality. All of them  have had leakage or seepage. This is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area up  here. We keep hearing about how it is just adjacent.   Mr. Speaker, this is an underground corridor, and this is an  underground corridor. This is a deposit. This is where all of the  mining activity would take place.   Mr. Speaker, I don't see how open water creates a physical boundary  to stop pollution. The pollution will go up north of the Laurentian  Divide, and it will seep and go into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area,  1,000 lakes, rivers, and streams. This is mining adjacent to a  wilderness that will become forever polluted if this mine is to be  built.
