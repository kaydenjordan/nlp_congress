 Mr. Speaker, I was delighted to read that  President Trump has reflected on his initial instinct to pull our 2,000  soldiers out of eastern Syria based on his conclusion that ISIS is  defeated, and, instead, he is ordering a withdrawal at a proper pace  consistent with American objectives.   To meet our goals of a safe American homeland and progress towards  regional stability, America must first develop a strategy to eliminate  ISIS from northeast Syria along the lower Euphrates valley at the  border of Syria and Iraq.   This plan must include a productive role for our partner and ally,  the Kurds. It is not in America's interest to abandon our long friends,  the Kurds, to Turkish treachery and annihilation.   Recent open-source data suggests there are 30,000 ISIS-related  fighters in the lower Euphrates valley. With our allies, we must press  this villainous band to its inglorious end.   Our leaving with no plan will squander our immense success in cutting  off funding and winning back hard-fought territorial gains from the  occupation of ISIS.   Second, America must block Iran. A key here is a small base and  deconfliction zone at al-Tanf, a small force of 200 anchors that base  along the key highway between Damascus and Baghdad. Not only is this a  strategic imperative, Mr. Speaker, but 50,000 refugees are tenuously  housed in this deconfliction zone at Rukban. Withdraw, and death awaits  them.   Neighboring Jordan can take no more. We must ensure that an allied  force remains at al-Tanf, blocking the Iranian-planned autobahn being  considered from Tehran to Damascus. Withdraw, Mr. President, and you  will leave Israel fully encircled by its greatest enemy, the Ayatollah  in Tehran.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, America must achieve peace and stability in  Syria. Our small elite presence, our supply lines, and our air  superiority offer pressure on the murderous regime in Damascus to reach  a settlement to return Syria to peace and return millions of refugees  to their towns and ancestral homes.   Leave, Mr. President, and you will squander the great moral victory  of your strategic strikes against Assad from his illegal use of  chemical weapons and barrel bombs.   Your early decisive actions made our friends, villagers huddling in  fear and from the Euphrates to Idlib, shout with joy. ``America is  back,'' they shouted.   Leave, Mr. President, with no plan and no strategy, and they will  hang their heads as they did during President Obama's shameful  abandonment.   Mr. Speaker, this unfortunate chapter unfolding in the tragedy known  as Syria foreshadows an unflattering flashback to a time long ago when  Great Britain abandoned a role of stability in the Holy Land and India.   In 1948, Churchill rose in the House to oppose Prime Minister Atlee's  own unplanned precipitous withdrawal from the Holy Land, saying:         A time limit imposed--a kind of guillotine--will certainly       prevent the full, fair, and reasonable discussion of the       great, complicated issues that are involved.    Indeed, as Churchill foresaw, mayhem, terror, and destruction were  the result of Britain's precipitous withdrawal.   It is said that history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. Mr.  President, let's not repeat this historical mistake nor let our actions  even result in a rhyme.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  accomplishments of Colonel Erica Ingram, who recently became the first  African-American female colonel in Arkansas National Guard history.   Colonel Ingram is a native of Wilmar, Arkansas, and a graduate of the  University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. She began her military career as  a second lieutenant on Active Duty with the United States Army in 1995.   Throughout her two decades in the Army, Colonel Ingram has earned the  Meritorious Service Medal, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the  Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Reserve  Components Achievement Medal, the  [[Page H374]]  National Defense Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Global War  on Terrorism Service Medal, the Arkansas Emergency Service Ribbon, and  the Arkansas Service Ribbon.   She has served as the president of the National Guard Association of  Arkansas, and she is a graduate of Leadership Greater Little Rock.   My congratulations and best wishes to Colonel Ingram and her family,  and I thank her for her service to our citizens and her bright future  as a defender of our great Nation.                            ____________________     I thank my friend from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler)  for her leadership on this issue. Thanks for letting us gather together  on the people's House floor tonight and talk about this issue and try  to lay out for the American people who are watching some of the facts  associated with this situation. I am not sure they always get the full  story.   When I came to Congress, I knew the only way to really understand  this border security issue was to go to the border. Since I was elected  in 2014, I have been down on the southwest border four times and am  getting ready to go back in just a few days.   On those trips, I meet with Border Patrol agents, local law  enforcement, county judges, citizens, and community leaders. We all  talk about the issue of what is the definition of border security: the  physical barrier aspect? the technology? the observation? the manpower?  the coordination with local law enforcement?    We always talk about drugs and drug cartels. You have heard from our  leader tonight that they outman and outgun American law enforcement,  Federal and State.   Just last week, I got a note from my good friend that we lost another  young person from my high school due to heroin and fentanyl overdose.   I carry a little packet of Sweet'N Low in my pocket, Mr. Speaker,  because a gram of fentanyl, which is the size of a Sweet'N Low packet,  has enough fentanyl in it to kill 500 Americans. So it is killing our  kids, Mr. Speaker, and it is coming across the border with Mexico.   Physical barriers shape the strategic deployment of our force. That  is why county judges support it, mayors support it, and our Border  Patrol supports it. This is why, over the past 20 years, when President  Bush proposed it, President Clinton proposed it, Bush 43 proposed it,  and Obama supported it, we built fence, starting in San Diego. We see,  where there is fencing, 90 percent reductions in people crossing  illegally.   Fences work. Physical barriers work. Physical barriers shape our  force deployment and allow us to better use our manpower and coordinate  our very understaffed and undergunned forces.   Secondly, it is increasingly frustrating to me that this is a crisis  of politics in this House Chamber and in the United States Senate. It  is utterly hypocritical on the part of our leaders in the House and our  minority in the Senate to not see this need for humanitarian assistance  on the border and physical security on the border. Republicans have  proposed this time and time again last year. We got no Democratic votes  for it last year.   I want my friends on the other side of the aisle to be able to make  the moral distinction between those who come to our country legally and  those who come here illegally. It seems to me that is a straightforward  promise. America is a nation of immigrants. We are the most generous  and welcoming country in the world.   One other point I want to make before I close, my friend from  Missouri, is to talk about people seeking asylum here, people coming to  our border with no papers, no documentation.   There was a news story this week about the Bangladeshi pair of men  trying to come in and cross the border, interviewed on national  television. We see, time and time again, people come from Bangladesh  and from all over the world. They come to Mexico; they come to our  border; and they have no passport.   How do they come into the United States? They have no documents. They  claim asylum, credible fear, and yet here, Mr. Speaker, is a driver's  license handed to me by a Border Patrol agent in Chula Vista,  California, of a Saudi Arabian born in the early 1990s, and yet we have  no record of someone from Saudi Arabia crossing at Chula Vista in the  time frame that this driver's license was found in the Chula Vista  station outside San Diego.  [[Page H446]]    We have a crisis on this border, and when people tell you there isn't  one, they are not telling you the truth. That should terrify us that we  don't know who is coming across our border, Mr. Speaker.   Therefore, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for holding this  hour. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the American people  about the drugs and the impact on our youth and the impact on our  national security by not having a secure southern border.
