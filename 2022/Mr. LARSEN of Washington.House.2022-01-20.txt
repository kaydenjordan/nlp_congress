 Mr. Speaker, people have been traveling  across the Merrill and Ring Creek Bridge in Everett, Washington, since  Herbert Hoover was President of the United States.   Every day, residents drive, walk, pedal, and roll across the bridge  to get to and from work and school in Everett and to catch a ferry in  Mukilteo. Commuters on Everett Transit's route 18 bus rely on the  bridge to access Sounder commuter rail and Amtrak service at Everett  Station.   However, a recent assessment revealed the bridge is not only  structurally deficient; it is vulnerable to collapse in the event of an  earthquake. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, Washington  communities will receive more than $605 million over the next 5 years  to invest in critical bridge repairs.   Last week, Everett officials took me across the Merrill and Ring  Creek Bridge and told me how this bold, long-term investment will  create jobs, drive economic recovery, and keep people on the move.   Mr. Speaker, you cannot have a big-league economy with little-league  infrastructure. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law,  communities in my district now have the resources needed to repair  aging bridges and build a winning game plan for the region's economic  future.                            ____________________
