 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the CARES  Act. Even in rural southern Illinois there are 27 cases in my district.   We need to come together in a bipartisan manner with this bill to  deal with: first, the health of our constituents; second, the health of  their pocketbooks in this bill; third, those businesses where they need  to go back to work, whether it is a small business or a large business.  This bill does that.   Is it perfect? No. But it is the right step forward that we need to  do, and do today.
