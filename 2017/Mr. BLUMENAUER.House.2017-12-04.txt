 Mr. Speaker, I listen to my friend from Arizona, and  I wonder what planet he is on. He is concerned about his little 2-year- old, yet they finance the largest transfer of wealth in our Nation's  history by adding more debt on the backs of his children, our  grandchildren, and generations to come.   They want the public to have more of their money, yet they are not  supporting our motion to instruct that would stop this notion that we  are going to jack up premium prices 10 percent a year by destabilizing  the insurance markets, the notion of these ugly surprises that the  lobbyists have snuck in, and we will find out about them every single  week going forward.   Reject this misguided approach. Let's work together.   Rebuild and renew America? The States can raise a gas tax. We refuse  to acknowledge a straightforward proposition to do that here.   Let's reject this atrocity.
