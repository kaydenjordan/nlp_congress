 Madam Speaker, I am here to correct the Record, to bust  the myth, to make sure that Americans know the truth about my  wonderful, generous, incredible community, El Paso, Texas.   Last night, in this Chamber, as I was seated in the audience  listening to the State of the Union Address, I heard our President  misinform the American public. He said that El Paso, Texas, was once  one of the most dangerous cities in America, and then a wall was built.   Well, Madam Speaker, that is not true. El Paso is one of the safest  cities in America. However, we have been a safe community; we have been  a safe city. We are right on the U.S.-Mexico border, and we have been  safe for decades.                                time  1500    The wall was built in El Paso, Texas, in 2008. Our ranking as one of  the safest communities in America dates back to the 1990s.   Many people wonder why El Paso is so safe. Why is El Paso, which is,  again, right on the U.S.-Mexico border, one of the safest communities  in America? Last night, in those conversations, I pointed to my guest  at the State of the Union Address, Senaida Navar, who is a Dreamer; she  is a teacher; she is an activist; she is exactly the kind of community  member, constituent, citizen who makes El Paso and the country great.   As these debates over comprehensive immigration reform, over border  security, continue to get louder and, in fact, uglier here in  Washington, D.C., El Paso has been, in many ways, at the center of  those debates and those discussions.   I will tell you, they should be. El Paso should be at the center of  that debate.   The reason why El Paso should be at the center of that debate is not  because we were the site of the President's zero-tolerance policy, not  because we were the site of the tent city at Tornillo, not because our  processing center is the site where detainees are right now being  force-fed through a nose tube against their will. We should be at the  center of deciding the future of this country in terms of comprehensive  immigration reform because of our generosity, because of our goodwill,  because of our kindness.   El Paso has absolutely set an example for our country, and we have  done it with the way that we have opened up our arms to everyone and  treated people with the dignity that they deserve.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Sablan for the opportunity to  correct the Record.
