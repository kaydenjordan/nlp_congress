 Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor  of Medicare for All here in the House.   Medicare for All isn't controversial or radical. It is commonsense  policy to ensure that our healthcare is not dependent on where we work.  We all know that Medicare already works in this country for so many  older adults.   When I was mayor of Long Beach, I was proud to have cofounded the  Mayors for Medicare Coalition which brought together leaders from  across the country to support Medicare for All. As mayor, I saw the  impact every day that barriers to healthcare can have on a community.  That is why over 100 local cities and jurisdictions support Medicare  for All nationally.   Medicare for All isn't just a commitment to address injustices in the  healthcare system. It is an investment in the American people. We owe  it to our country to prioritize healthcare, and Medicare for All is the  way.   Healthcare is a human right. Let's pass Medicare for All.
