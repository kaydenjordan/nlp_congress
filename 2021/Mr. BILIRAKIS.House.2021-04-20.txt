 Madam Speaker, I recently met with local and State  leaders about the infrastructure needs of our community, which are  significant. There is widespread agreement that an investment in our  Nation's infrastructure is needed to alleviate traffic, improve  flooding conditions, and address other safety concerns.   Imagine my disappointment, Madam Speaker, to learn that less than 10  percent of President Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure package will be  spent on roads and bridges. Also of concern, less than 2 percent of the  package is allocated for waterways, locks, dams, ports, and airports,  which are all very important to the State of Florida; and less than 50  percent is allocated for much-needed broadband expansion, which would  help to address the digital divide in our country.   These traditional infrastructure projects, coupled with  infrastructure investments that are linked to our Nation's security,  such as safeguarding our energy grid, water systems, and other critical  assets from cyber and other attacks, are the types of projects my  constituents want to see funded.   Unfortunately, President Biden is using the guise of infrastructure  spending, which enjoys relatively high support among Americans--it is  really a bipartisan issue--to push highly partisan and unpopular policy  proposals, such as the Green New Deal. Many of these policies will hurt  American consumers and workers.   The vast majority of spending in the bill consists of non- infrastructure expenditures. For example, the bill contains $400  billion in expansion of Medicaid; $213 billion in spending for housing  initiatives; $100 billion of additional funding for schools, without  any type of requirement for them to reopen; $50 billion for a new  office at the U.S. Department of Commerce; $35 billion for climate  science; and $10 billion for a new ``Civilian Climate Corps.''   Adding insult to injury, Madam Speaker, this astronomical spending  plan would be funded through tax increases. This current proposal fails  to address our Nation's most critical infrastructure needs and falls  short of meeting my constituents' expectations.   We can do better, Madam Speaker, if we work together. My constituents  want their elected officials to work together to get things done,  improving opportunities for our families and our community. They do not  want to see us use our time in Washington to play political games.  Please be assured I will remain focused on this paramount objective.                            ____________________
