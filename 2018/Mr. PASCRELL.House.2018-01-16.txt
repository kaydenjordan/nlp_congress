 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act has historically had  broad bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress as a means to  bolster U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness.   Right now, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act has been expired for  more than 5 years. I am pleased that today we are finally able to  consider updating this bill.   The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act is designed to provide relief to  domestic firms by reducing or lifting tariffs on imported goods, as  long as those goods are not produced here in the United States of  America.   It is estimated that this legislation will provide more than $1  billion in tariff relief to U.S. businesses. Many of these businesses  are needlessly paying more to acquire inputs to manufactured products  here in the United States.   My home State of New Jersey will benefit greatly from this program,  with firms projected to save more than $100 million over the course of  a 3-year program. As a result, these New Jersey companies will receive  a competitive boost and will be able to use their resources more  productively, whether by raising wages or investing in research and  development.   Consider ICF Mercantile, located in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which will  obtain duty relief on high-tenacity rayon yarn, an input for material  used for naval defense systems. Unfortunately, this specialty yarn has  not been produced domestically in 20 years. That means that removing  the tariff here would help, not hurt, U.S. industry.   New Jersey has a robust presence of chemical companies--it is our  largest industry--employing directly or indirectly over 100,000 jobs.  Several of those firms will receive tariff relief from numerous  imported chemicals that I dare not try to pronounce.   All of these folks who like their antipasti, their Italian subs,  salad, or pizza with some extra heat will be pleased to enjoy tariff  relief on little green pepperoncini, either packed in oil or not.   The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act is also intended to carefully  prevent domestic companies from being harmed. Under the current  process, the International Trade Commission and the Department of  Commerce analyzed whether products are currently or could be eminently  produced in the United States. If such production or potential for  production was found, the ITC recommends excluding that product.   The American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, which passed in 2016  with only two votes against it in the House, established the current  process that invites U.S. firms to submit petitions that the ITC, the  Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection  analyze, vet, and recommend to Congress for inclusion or exclusion.   I would like to thank each agency for its hard work in coordination  with Congress throughout the process. Boosting the competitiveness of  American manufacturers and manufacturing workers should be one of our  highest priorities in Congress. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act is a  program that helps do that, and I want to make sure its impact is  maximized.   This bill covers more than 1,600 products compared to the previous  MTB, which covered only half as many products. Because this is the  first time that this new process has been used, I am interested in  reviewing both the process and, more importantly, the results, and  working together with those who have constructive suggestions for any  improvements that can be made.   But I also want to note that this program is not enough. We, as a  Congress and as a nation, need to be doing more in looking for  opportunities to enhance American competitiveness meaningfully. The  global economic environment is not just tough, but it is becoming more  and more challenging and hostile to our companies and our workers.                                time  1700    I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a bill that will  provide some important relief to U.S. firms across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the folks on the other side. We have  worked very closely on this legislation over a number of years, and it  is finally coming to fruition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
