 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I am grateful in unity  with the thousands of dedicated citizens traveling to Washington this  week for the 45th annual March for Life. The vision is of a world where  every life is valued and protected. It is one I support every day in  Congress.   Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to meet with Ryan Bomberger  in Columbia. Although Ryan's biological mother was raped, she chose  life for Ryan and gave him an opportunity to grow up in a loving,  adopted family. His witness and success demonstrate the importance of  ensuring that the unborn have an opportunity for a fulfilling life.   I also appreciate the commitment and enthusiasm of the South Carolina  Citizens for Life executive director, Holly Gatling. Through her hard  work and the efforts from the South Carolina Citizens for Life team,  hundreds of people, including myself, gathered at the statehouse steps  this month for the Stand Up for Life Rally with Bishop Robert  Guglielmone of Charleston and Attorney General Alan Wilson.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations to Republicans Nancy Mace of Charleston and Ashley  Trantham of Greenville for their elections to the South Carolina House  of Representatives.                            ____________________
