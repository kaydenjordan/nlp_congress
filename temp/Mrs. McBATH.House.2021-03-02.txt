 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the For the People  Act, a bill that is critical to restoring elections as the heart of our  democracy.   The For the People Act includes my bill, the Election Official  Integrity Act, which would make it so election officials can't have a  direct stake in the outcome of the election that they are overseeing.  Just like it would be wrong to have a player referee a game, it is  wrong for election officials to participate in Federal campaigns.   As a representative of the great State of Georgia, I know the impact  of our elections, and they are too important and too valuable to the  foundation of our democracy to risk even the appearance of impropriety.  The Election Official Integrity Act is a commonsense step toward  restoring the American people's confidence in our electoral process.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with me in supporting  H.R. 1 and ensuring our Federal election officials work for the people.                                time  0930
