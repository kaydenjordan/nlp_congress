 Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the  passing of a true champion for good--former Congressman, Minneapolis  mayor, and my friend and neighbor--Don Fraser, who died at the age of  95 on June 2, 2019. Those who knew him best described Don as  thoughtful, decent, intelligent, tough, and absolutely wonderful.   Don Fraser was born in Minneapolis, MN, in 1924. He fought in World  War II and later studied law at the University of Minnesota Law School.  He joined the law firm of Larson, Loevinger, Lindquist, Freeman, and  Fraser before he was elected to the Minnesota State Senate in 1954. In  1962, Don was elected to the House of Representatives, representing  Minnesota's Fifth District, where he served for 16 years. Don went on  to serve as mayor of Minneapolis from 1980 to 1994, making him the  longest serving mayor in Minneapolis history.   Don was married to Arvonne Skelton Fraser, who dedicated her life to  improving the lives of women around the world. Together, they had six  children: Thomas, Mary, John, Lois, Anne, and Jean.  [[Page S3248]]    Known as the Quiet Crusader, Don was always ahead of his time. As a  Congressman, he fought for the environment and human rights and exposed  human rights abuses around the world. As mayor of Minneapolis--a job he  believed was truly the most rewarding of his career--he advocated for  early childhood education and put an end to the ingrained politics of  the city's police department. Tom Fraser may have summed up his  father's service best when he said, ``He persuaded people by the power  of his argument, not the volume of his speech.'' Public service was  Don's calling.   My first job in Democratic politics was serving as the volunteer  president of the DFL Education Foundation, a group Don Fraser founded.  His mission? Ideas matter in politics. And he lived that. Don and  Arvonne were the heart and soul of the group.   In this era of sound bites and quick fixes to problems, Don and  Arvonne yearned for something more substantial in the way they talked  about issues. They worked to promote more citizen involvement in  politics.   I remember when Don used to introduce me at events during my run for  Hennepin County attorney, and he used to say, ``I used to work for the  city of Minneapolis.'' In reality, Don has never stopped working for  Minneapolis and his country. Don was a great public servant and an  outstanding mentor to the next generation. He understood that his  public service didn't end with him.   It has been said that it is lucky to have somebody who makes it hard  to say goodbye. It is hard to say goodbye to Don Fraser, but I count  myself lucky to have known him as a friend. My family and I greatly  miss Don. We miss seeing him walking with Arvonne arm in arm in our  neighborhood, and we miss their passion for public service and their  love for their family and friends.                            ____________________
