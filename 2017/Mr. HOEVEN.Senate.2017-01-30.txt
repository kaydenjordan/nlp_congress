 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 245., the  Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments  of 2017.   Over 10 years ago, Congress passed the Indian Tribal Energy  Development and Self-Determination Act. This act was a step in the  right direction to economic self-sufficiency for Indian tribes and  energy independence for our Nation.   It created a process for Indian tribes to govern the development of  their energy resources while reducing costly bureaucratic burdens of  Secretarial review, approval, and oversight. But after more than 10  years, the act has not been implemented in a manner beneficial to the  tribes or efficient resource development.   Bills have been introduced for the past four Congresses to improve  and clarify the process but none of them have been signed into law. It  is past time Congress acts and gets this bill across the finish line to  be signed into law.   The bill that I am introducing today would improve, clarify, and make  predictable the process for tribes to enter energy resource agreements  and development. I would like to highlight some of the key provisions  in this bill.   The bill provides clarity regarding the specific information and time  frames for Secretarial decisions required for tribal energy resource  agreements. This bill recognizes the need to engage tribes by requiring  more robust technical assistance and consultation with Indian tribes in  the planning and development stages for energy resource development.   It would further facilitate the Secretarial approval process for  mineral development by allowing Indian tribes and third parties to  perform appraisals. This bill also includes renewable energy resource  development by authorizing tribal biomass demonstration projects to  assist Indian tribes in securing reliable, long-term supplies of woody  biomass materials.   I would like to thank Senators Barrasso, McCain, Lankford, Moran, and  Heitkamp for joining me in cosponsoring this bipartisan bill. I urge my  colleagues to join me in advancing this bill and getting it signed into  law expeditiously.                                  ______                                         By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Rounds, Mr.          Cassidy, and Mr. Lee):   S.J. Res. 9. A joint resolution providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8, of title 5, United States Code, of the  rule submitted by Securities Exchange Commission relating to the  disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers; to the Committee  on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
