 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I do want to wish  everybody a happy St. Patrick's Day.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour  and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until  6:30.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Mr. Speaker, late votes are likely in the House on Thursday, and  Members are advised to adjust their schedules accordingly.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced at close of business  today.   In addition, the House will consider several critical pieces of the  Republican plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare:   First, H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act,  sponsored by Representative Paul Gosar, creates competition in the  healthcare market by eliminating antitrust protection for insurance  providers.   Next, H.R. 1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act, sponsored by  Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, allows small businesses to pool  together and purchase plans, an important step toward purchasing health  care across State lines.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we will consider the FY 2017 reconciliation  bill, also known as the American Health Care Act. This bill eliminates  the many taxes and mandates of ObamaCare. It gives patients enhanced  tools to take control of their healthcare decisions, and it expands  choice so Americans are free to pick the plan that is best for  themselves and their families.   Mr. Speaker, it is known that ObamaCare is failing, and we have a  responsibility to provide Americans relief. These bills are the result  of much deliberation and hard work, and their passage will help create  a competitive marketplace that provides high-quality care at an  affordable cost.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   And his question, based upon scheduling, and I know there were a lot  of questions in there, so please let me work through and try to answer  all of his questions.   The last question was in regard to the bill itself, and we are  working through the process. It will be in the Rules Committee. As the  legislative process works, there are always ways that you refine the  bill, and I expect that there will be some elements that get refined  inside the Rules Committee before it comes to the floor.   You had about five different questions there if I may follow all the  way through. First, you talked about, and I was happy to hear--I wrote  it down--you are glad to work to help to improve the bill--because when  we were in the more than 26 hours of Energy and Commerce, the  amendments the Democrats offered, we spent a couple of hours on just  the one amendment about a hashtag of renaming the bill. So there is a  change in attitude. I appreciate that from the other side of the aisle  because we are always willing to work with you.    But you are not willing to help with it, then?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me,  and I ask if he would let me finish through.    It seems as though the gentleman has a little short- term memory of how they brought the Affordable Care Act and the CBO  report when it came before us. It was not brought before us until it  came right before the floor.   But let me follow through on all your questions because my response  back was, I was actually excited to hear that Democrats wanted to work  with us, that their attitude has changed from when we were in committee  and they had amendments going forward, that it was no longer going to  be hashtag amendments, it was actually going to be productive  amendments; and I thank you for having that change of attitude.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the transparent process we have taken in  the House, and I think this needs to be reminded to all the American  public.   As I mentioned last week, our healthcare bill is the result of 113  hearings. I know the gentleman on the other side of the aisle, he is  proud of the 72 hearings they had before they did the Affordable Care  Act.   We have now marked up this bill in three separate committees, with  over 18 hours of debate in Ways and Means, and over 27 hours of debate  in Energy and Commerce, and the countless amendments from both  Republicans and Democrats.   By the time we vote on the floor, this bill will have been publicly  available online for 3 weeks. Now, it is only 127 pages. That is a far  contrast to the 2,700-plus pages, if you want to compare it to  ObamaCare.   So far, nearly 590,000 people have visited our website, and over  200,000 have downloaded this legislative text.   So, Mr. Speaker, that means more people have read our healthcare bill  than went to Woodstock. I call that transparency. Republicans have been  committed to repealing and replacing ObamaCare for years, and so now I  think it is time to act.   The gentleman also commented about the CBO. Well, I am actually  excited that you had another person who confirmed what the CBO said  because what the CBO says about this bill is it will lower the deficit  by $337 billion.   It will also reduce premiums by 10 percent by 2026, and it will  secure major entitlement reform by capping Medicaid spending, giving  States certainty and flexibility, saving taxpayers $880 billion, and  making the program solvent for future generations, because that was a  concern in one of the letters.   Now, Mr. Speaker, those are the facts. With regard to the coverage  numbers, the CBO reports that most of that increase would stem from  repealing the penalties associated with individual mandates. Let me  repeat that. Most of the increase would stem from repealing the  penalties associated with the individual mandate.   Now, that makes sense to me, because if we no longer force Americans  to buy something they do not want, one-size-fits-all health care, they  will naturally choose not to buy it.   But, Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman across the other side of the  aisle argues with me about the knowledge that everybody knows ObamaCare  is failing. I would ask the gentleman to visit one-third of the  counties in this country that only have one option.    Or why don't you go to Tennessee, where the President just was  because, you know, 16 counties in Tennessee have no option. But  ObamaCare will penalize you for not having health care when you can't  even buy it.   But if ObamaCare was working so well, why do more people accept the  penalty or the exemption than actually buy ObamaCare? That is a number  that is quite interesting. That is why I am encouraged to see our plan  will decrease the average premiums that people have been asking for.   Now, our goal is not just to sign up people for insurance. Our goal  is to get America better health care.   Now, the gentleman also commented and had letters--and I love to read  letters. I love to listen to constituents because that is what our work  should be. And you read a letter when it came to Medicaid. And I would  not scare people, I would actually talk to that individual.   Medicaid is on an unsustainable path. In one 10-year window, it will  cost $1 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman on the other side knows what $1 trillion  is because that is about the entire amount we spend on discretionary  spending. From all of the appropriations that we go through, that would  take up everything we have.   Well, we know that is not sustainable, so we should do something  about it. That is why we had a meeting with 18 Governors, Republicans  and Democrats. And the number one thing they told us, give us  flexibility to be able to manage. That is exactly what this bill does.   But I like to read some letters. Here is one from Colleen from  Annapolis:         I just received the notice for my 2017 health insurance       policy. It will skyrocket, not by the advertised Maryland       State average of 20 to 25 percent but, rather, by 60 percent.       In addition, my deductible is going up 45 percent. Since the       inception of ObamaCare, my policy has increased 75 percent.        I am a 63-year-old female in excellent health who takes no       medication. My only benefit from the ACA has been two       mammograms, which I paid $12,600 in premiums to get. What a       disaster of a program.        I will be voting Republican this year, in the hope of       finally getting the ACA repealed. I just hope it happens       before my checkbook goes on life support.    Or the letter to the editor from Carl in Lusby, Maryland:         I can't afford my health insurance now under ObamaCare.       It's been a burden on our joint income, which is just above       the limit for qualifying for subsidies; and for 2017, I am       facing a 61 percent rate increase.        I'm faced with either paying a premium that will bankrupt       me and my wife, or paying the tax penalty at the end of the       year, which will also be unaffordable. And there are probably       several million Americans who are in the same boat as I am.    You know what, Carl? We listened to you. We listened, and now we are  going to lead. We have moved a bill from the legislative process to the  rules, what it says, for reconciliation. We have done hours of debate  in three other committees. We will continue the process, as the rules  say. We will go to the Rules Committee and then we will come to this  floor. And for those who have written, change will come.   Yes, the Republican-appointed CBO Director and the Democratic CBO  Director, as the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, from across the aisle says,  agree that the premiums will go down, as so many Americans have asked  for. We will put Medicaid on a sustainable path.   We will give Republican and Democrat Governors flexibility so they  can manage their States in a better form. And most importantly, we will  give America exactly what they asked for, the freedom to choose their  own health care, the options of having more so they can direct what  they want and desire, at the same time, having a lower cost.   So I welcome the gentleman for his questions. I know that wasn't  about scheduling, but I think this is too important, because those 113  hearings we listened to the people before us, and we promised we would  act, and we are keeping that promise as we move forward.    I ask the gentleman which bills he is referring to?    Those will be later in the month. Next week we will  have two of those up that you referred to.    Yes. The committee has marked them up.    I think we both agree that responsible fiscal policy is  important to our country's ability to succeed, and that includes  honoring the full faith and credit of the United States. We expect to  continue working closely with Secretary Mnuchin to ensure that America  is on the right path to a strong fiscal future.   We know the amount of debt that has been added in the last 8 years  has been tremendous. I know that the gentleman, when he looks to what  we do next week--to be able to lower premiums, save more than $300  billion of the deficit, and let people have more choice--that is also a  first step.   Now, I do not have any immediate action to announce, but we will  relay any information to the Members as we move forward.   I thank the gentleman.   Is that going to be your last question?    Before I depart, though, I would like, Mr. Speaker, to  wish my friend from the other side of the aisle a very happy St.  Patrick's Day. I do apologize. I feel bad, when we look at the  basketball round, what happened to Maryland; but if you look at NIT,  Cal State Bakersfield is still on the march, so I have another team you  can root for.    There will be no upsets.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, March 20, 2017,  when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
