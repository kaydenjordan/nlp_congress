 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong  opposition to the Rule for H.R. 3941, ``Schools Not Shelters Act of  2023''.   This bill is an absurd measure to condemn the use of elementary and  secondary school facilities that provide shelter for people caught up  in emergencies, just like we do for other disasters.   Using the facilities of a public elementary or secondary school to  provides shelter for non-U.S. nationals who are not admitted into the  United States should not be politicized, as this is humanitarian issue  and failure of our broken immigration system.   As a Member on the Homeland Security committee, and more specifically  the Border Security and Enforcement subcommittee, I interact with those  at the border and migrants frequently.   I believe that a comprehensive approach is needed to find a lasting  solution to the current immigration crisis.   However, I think it is essential that migrants are brought and  allowed into the country through legal immigration.   I am a strong proponent of humanitarian aid efforts in the  immigration context, from preventing the breakup of individual families  because of a wrongful deportation to ensuring that victims of civil  wars and national disasters around the globe receive a temporary  protected status under the U.S. immigration laws.   We should not condemn the use of public elementary or secondary  schools provide shelter for non-U.S. nationals who are not admitted  into the United States.   I acknowledge that school are places of learning and development for  students, but there are time periods when school campuses are not being  used, such as during school breaks.   Because of this, the space could be used for humanitarian aid  purposes, such as allowing migrants to stay there while they wait for  legal processing and paperwork to conclude.   Other exceptions need to be reviewed, such as whether migrants could  stay at schools when school is in-session, but humanitarian aid should  not be overlooked in the immigration context.   As a leading country on the global stage, it is our duty and  responsibility to assist who we can in a legal manner.   More importantly when it comes to schools in America, we should be  addressing critical issues that are truly impacting our educational  system--namely, the hostile state takeovers of majority-minority school  districts--as is what is happening in my district with the Texas  Education Agency takeover of the Houston Independent School District.   State takeovers in other districts have led to school closures,  layoffs, and no improvements in test scores.   The vast majority of school districts that have been taken over by  state agencies (TEA included) have not improved but declined.   With data ranging back to the late 1980s, researchers found that most  state takeovers don't translate to academic improvements.   We have to stop the State from intermeddling and overstepping into  our educational systems--causing further harm and damage to our  communities,   That is why I have called upon President Biden and the Department of  Education to investigate and take immediate I action to address the  recent systematic and dangerous efforts underway by state and local  officials in Texas seeking to undermine and undo decades of civils  rights protections and advancements in educational institutions and  student populations.   And so, I am here today to say that these are the issues that the  American people truly care about and want us to be fighting for, for  the protection and preservation of their educational rights .   Emergency response agencies have always used school facility  sheltering to provide emergency services to affected individuals and  communities; the use of these facilities as a  [[Page H3657]]  temporary shelter for migrants puts no students in danger.   These school facilities have always been used as emergency shelters  during disasters such as weather-related events.   No colleges or public K-12 schools should lose federal funding  because they provide temporary relief to migrants.   If Republicans are really concerned about measures needed to ensure  school safety, they should support all measures that address gun  violence prevention and mental health issues.   If my colleagues genuinely want to address students' safety, they  should join with us to focus on the real causes of violent deaths in  our country--guns.   Gun violence is decimating our families and communities--mass  shootings in schools, places of worship, shopping malls, concerts, and  urban neighborhoods.   A majority of Americans, including parents, teachers, students, and  educational workers support common sense and meaningful actions that  address the surging violence in our schools and colleges.   All that this bill does is to punish schools that Republicans think  are helping migrants.   By singling out emergency use for migrants, this bill is only about  Republicans' continuous opposition to any effort that provides support  for the migrant community.   That is why I had offered the following amendments to be considered  by the Rules Committee:   Jackson Lee Amendment 13 would simply prevent the enactment of H.R.  3941 until we actually address and enact comprehensive immigration  reform in the United States such that the Federal immigration system  operates efficiently and offers a fair, humane, and orderly pathway to  citizenship.   Jackson Lee Amendment 15 would also prevent enactment of this bill  until my bill the ``Grant Relief for American Children's Elevation  (GRACE) Act of 2023'' is implemented such that the ``exceptional and  extremely unusual hardship'' term as defined in Section 240A(b) of the  Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 12229b(b)) is amended, to  include hardship resulting from separating a family member who is a  United States citizen, a lawful permanent resident or an individual  lawfully admitted to the United States and a family member who is  subject to deportation or removal from the United States.   A study on Facts and Fictions of Race and Family in U.S. Immigration  Policy found that the United States governing framework of family  sponsorship is rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,  also known as the Hart-Celler Act.   The act eliminated the 1924 national origins quotas while maintaining  the principle of numerical restriction by specifying annual caps as  well as per-country limits on immigration.   Under the act, ``immediate family,'' specifically spouses, minor  children, and the parents of U.S. citizens, are admitted without  numerical quotas.   After that, there is a system of hierarchical preferences in which  the claims of U.S. citizens are placed above those of legal permanent  residents.   There is also a ranking of the family relationship that is based on  assessments of familial proximity and of age, especially in the case of  parents and children.   The dominant political narrative of the 1965 act at the time of its  passage was one of national values, family unity, and the American  commitment to ending racial discrimination.   However, according to the Washington Post, the Trump administration's  immigration policies separated more than 5,400 children from their  families, sending families to Mexico to await the chance to make asylum  claims and seeking the chance to detain children indefinitely.   My amendment, the ``Grant Relief for American Children's Elevation  Act'' or ``GRACE Act,'' would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act  to establish certain family separation as an exceptional and extremely  unusual hardship.   The American Academy of Pediatrics has noted that ``highly stressful  experiences, like family separation, can cause irreparable harm,  disrupting a child's brain architecture and affecting his or her short-  and long-term health.   This type of prolonged exposure to serious stress--known as toxic  stress--can carry lifelong consequences for children.''   Just last year, two pediatricians wrote in the Houston Chronicle that  ``this kind of stress makes children susceptible to acute and chronic  conditions such as extreme anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress  disorder, hypertension and heart disease.''   As we take into consideration the long term negative psychological  effects of family separation as the result of immigration, it becomes  abundantly clear that we cannot move forward until this cycle is  stopped.   As a Member on the Homeland Security committee, and more specifically  the Border Security and Enforcement subcommittee, I interact with those  at the border and migrants frequently.   I believe that a comprehensive approach is needed to find a lasting  solution to the current immigration crisis.   However, I think it is essential that migrants are brought and  allowed into the country through legal immigration.   Under the Jackson Lee Amendment 15, the Immigration and Nationality  Act would have no longer subjected human beings to extreme trauma by  separating a family member who is a United States citizen, a lawful  permanent resident, or an individual lawfully admitted to the United  States and a family member who is subject to deportation or removal  from the United States.   And the Jackson Lee Amendment 16 strikes one word--``not'' from Sect.  2(a) such that it reads as follows:    In General.--As a condition on receipt of Federal financial  assistance under applicable program by a public elementary school, a  public secondary school, or an institution of higher education, the  facilities of the school or institution may [not] be used to provide  shelter or housing for specified aliens.    Thus, my amendment strikes the very language preventing the use of  school facilities for the purpose of providing shelter or housing to  individuals as defined by section 101(a) of the Immigration and  Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)) who has not been admitted (as so  defined).   I am a strong proponent of humanitarian aid efforts in the  immigration context, from preventing the breakup of individual families  because of a wrongful deportation to ensuring that victims of civil  wars and national disasters around the globe receive a temporary  protected status under the U.S. immigration laws.   We should not condemn the use of public elementary or secondary  schools to provide shelter for non-U.S. nationals who are not admitted  into the United States.   Whenever appropriate, space in our schools should be made available  for humanitarian aid purposes, such as allowing migrants to stay there  while they wait for processing and paperwork to conclude their legal  residency status.   Other exceptions need to be reviewed, such as whether migrants could  stay at schools when school is in session, but humanitarian aid should  not be overlooked in the immigration context.   As a leading country on the global stage, it is our duty and  responsibility to assist who we can in a legal manner.   More importantly, when it comes to schools in America, we should be  addressing critical issues that are truly impacting our educational  system--namely, the hostile state takeovers of majority-minority school  districts--as is what is happening in my district with the Texas  Education Agency takeover of the Houston Independent School District.   State takeovers in other districts have led to school closures,  layoffs, and no improvements in test scores.   The vast majority of school districts that have been taken over by  state agencies (TEA included) have not improved but declined.   With data ranging back to the late 1980s, researchers found that most  state takeovers don't translate to academic improvements.   Republicans provide no evidence that the academic progress of  students is negatively impacted simply by attending a school which  houses migrants.   H.R. 3941 is distractive, it is uninformed, it is pointless,  provocative, inflammatory, and at best, an absolute waste of time.   Using the facilities of a public elementary or secondary school to  provide shelter for non-U.S. nationals who are not admitted into the  United States should not be politicized, as this is a humanitarian  issue and failure of our broken immigration system.   Instead of denying innocent people temporary humanitarian relief we  should focus on stopping the State from meddling in and overstepping  the boundaries of our educational systems--causing further harm and  damage to our communities.   Lastly, the Jackson Lee Amendment 19 was offered to add the word  ``freeze'' to be included in the definition of ``specified disaster''.   This definition is particularly important to signify the dangers of  deadly and disastrous weather conditions without snow.   In February 2012, my home state of Texas experienced an unprecedented  deep freeze that crippled our state as temperatures dropped to as low  as six degrees.   The freeze triggered the worst energy infrastructure failure in Texas  state history, leading to shortages of water, food, and heat.   More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power,  some for several days and at least 246 people were killed directly or  indirectly, with some estimates as high as 702 killed during the  crisis.   These Jackson Lee Amendments 13, 15, 16, and 19 would have ensured  that unaccompanied minors and migrants in need of temporary relief may  be provided emergency shelter or housing using institutional facilities  where appropriate.  [[Page H3658]]    It is a shame that we not made in order, and that we here with such  an offensive and counterproductive bill, and that we are spending time  on ineffective efforts instead of focusing on real immigration reform  and resolutions for our nation's broken pathways for citizenship.   The text of the material previously referred to by Ms. Scanlon is as  follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 597 Offered by Ms. Scanlon of Pennsylvania         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.  Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of                                H. Res. 178.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much, and I  want to join the stellar Members from so many different backgrounds to  add another 2 minutes to that 30 minutes and emphasize that it is now  32 more minutes than we have had an opportunity to discuss gun  violence--gun violence against our children.   I am reminded of the late John Lewis, and as I look to the front, Mr.  Speaker, where you are, I am reminded of the overwhelming impact that  gun violence had just a couple of years ago when he was alive, so much  so that Members took to the floor--the actual floor--and sat down on  the floor because the pain was so deep.   I remember the tear that President Obama shed as he had to speak  about Sandy Hook. I remember going to Uvalde within days of 19 children  and teachers being slaughtered. Yes, Mr. Speaker, they were slaughtered  with an AR-15 that a young man was able to get online and have shipped  to him without any background check of sorts and without any  supervision. He was able to recklessly shoot his grandmother in the  face and leave his house to go to an elementary school just a few  blocks away.   One could not expect law enforcement initially to know what was going  to happen. One thing we do know is that if that young man had not had  an AR-15, those little babies in Uvalde, where parents are still in  such abject pain, would still be alive.   We also know that as I worship with them, as I hug them, they have  now become, through their own advocacy, absolutely incredulous that we  in this country have not been able to pass bans on assault weapons. I  support bills like the Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act, which  impacted Kimberly Vaughan, a 14-year-old who died in Santa Fe because  another young man was able to get guns that were left at home.   I think I am here as a mother and as a Member of Congress who has  been here since Columbine. I remember being on the Columbine task force  to see what we could do about guns. I have been through Sandy Hook,  Parkland, Santa Fe, Virginia Tech, various churches, synagogues, and  temples that have seen gun violence--and dance studios.   I don't know what it takes for this Congress to come together. No one  is trying to take away anyone's firearms. The Second Amendment is  constitutionally present. It is in place. None of the language in the  Second Amendment prevents us from having a reasonable, safe regulatory  scheme that will help save all of our lives.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much. As the vice chair of the  gun task force and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime and  Federal Government Surveillance, we are waiting and ready to take up  bills as we did with the Protect our Kids Act and the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act. There is still a lapse of real bills that further need  to be in place to change laws. The waiting period, the issue of  universal background checks, and storage bills are really crucial to  saving lives.   The last point I will make is that we often use mental illness. Let  me say that we pray for people who suffer from mental health concerns,  but other countries around the world have people who suffer from mental  health concerns, and I do not label them in generality. These are human  beings who fight every day to survive. That is not a good excuse for  saying that is what is causing gun violence. It is not.   In tribute to my colleagues who come from cities like Chicago and  other cities where there is handgun violence, individual violence, and  domestic violence, you need to have a response to just plain gun  violence. That means we have to debate on this floor and find a common  solution.   A word to my colleagues in the name of the children who have died,  the number one killer of our children in America, and in the name of  places like Uvalde and Sandy Hook that comes to mind, Parkland and  other places where children have died, we can minimally do something to  help our children. Let's do real anti-gun violence legislation. Let's  make our children safe.   Mr. Speaker, today, I speak out in support of my bill H.R. 52, the  Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act.   This bill establishes best practices for safe firearm storage to  protect Americans, especially children, from improperly stored or  misused firearms.   The Kimberly Vaughn Firearm Safe Storage Act is named after one of  the victims of a shooting rampage that took place on May 18, 2018, when  a 17-year-old student went on a shooting rampage, killing 8 students  and 2 teachers and wounding 13 others at Santa Fe High School in  Houston, Texas.   The shotgun and pistol used by the perpetrator belonged to his father  and were available to him at home.   In 80 percent of gunfire incidents at schools where the shooter is  under 18, the shooter obtained the firearm from their home or the home  of extended family or friends.   Texas is the state with the second most mass shootings this year so  far with a total of 50, and the highest number of mass shooting deaths  in the U.S.   Only 3 of 10 adults in households with children report storing all  guns unloaded and locked up.   Safe storage practices are also important to keep firearms away from  dangerous individuals.   In the last decade, nearly two million firearms have been reported  stolen.   An estimated 47,000 guns are stolen each year in Texas alone.   Overall, at least 186,548 firearms were reported stolen in Texas over  from 2007 to 2016, which is more than any other state in the nation.   America's gun epidemic is as deadly as ever.   The frequency of firearm violence can largely be accredited to the  lack of safe firearm storage.   Previously part of the Protecting Our Kids Act in the 117th Congress  with the addition of a tax credit program, the Kimberly Vaughan Firearm  Safe Storage Act is an exhaustive solution to improperly stored or  misused firearms.   Firearm injury is the leading cause of death for children and young  adults in the United States.   American children are twice as likely to be shot and killed as they  are to die drowning.   However, there are more safety regulations for pools than gun  storage.   An estimated 4.6 million minors live in homes with at least one  unlocked, loaded firearm.   One in three U.S. households with children have firearms and firearms  accounted for nearly 19 percent of childhood deaths in 2021, which is a  50 percent increase since 2019.   Securing firearms protects children in preventing unintentional  shootings and firearm suicides.   The spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association noted earlier this  year that, ``the NRA supports safe storage for every firearm owned in  America, and we educate gun owners to keep firearms away from  unauthorized users.''   This is a nonpartisan issue with a bipartisan solution.   On average, 9 minors are killed by improperly stored or misused guns  every day.   In my home state of Texas, more than 4,000 Texans are shot and killed  each year.   The Kimberly Vaughn Firearm Safe Storage Act is an important bill  that will establish best practices for storing firearms.   In particular, the Attorney General is directed to establish  voluntary best practices relating to safe firearm storage and publish  them on a website and in print.   Second, it will require most weapons to have a clear written notice  on the packaging that says, ``Safe Storage Saves Lives'' and how to  obtain the best practices established by the Attorney General.   Additionally, the bill will provide grants to states and local  governments with a ten-year, $10 million grant program to distribute  safe storage devices.   Every year, almost 20,000 children are shot and killed or wounded by  a firearm, and 3 million are exposed to gun violence.
