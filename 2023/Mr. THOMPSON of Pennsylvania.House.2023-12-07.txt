 Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today to  recognize an important day in American history.   On December 7, 1941, our great Nation was suddenly attacked by the  Imperial Japanese Navy, leading to the death of 2,043 American  servicemembers and civilians.   Mr. Speaker, 82 years later, we remember these brave souls who lost  their lives that day defending our very freedoms. On August 23, 1994,  Congress created National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day to honor the  lives lost each year.   Now, on December 7, 2023, we once again recognize and remember every  man and woman who laid down their life for the United States that day.  We are forever indebted for their sacrifices.   In the time of war, our great Nation was able to persevere. Let this  day be a reminder to us that our freedom should never be taken for  granted.   God bless those who lost their lives that day, and God bless America.                            ____________________
