 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the underlying bill  and my amendment to the Parents Bill of Rights Act. The amendment would  require public schools to inform parents on decisions to terminate  college-credit courses, including dual-enrollments and advanced  placement courses.   As the cost of colleges and universities continues to skyrocket, many  students depend on these highly affordable high school college credit  courses. It is an essential tool for students to reduce their time and  their total cost in attending college.   Case in point, I graduated from college in 1983, and the total  tuition to attend Colgate University was $12,000. Today, it is nearly  $80,000 for room and board and tuition, so this is a way to try to  ameliorate that problem with many students who want to seek college  admission and college credit.                                time  0945    However, unfortunately, the woke, radical leftwing school  administrators in States such as New York are working to terminate  gifted and talented programs, including college credit courses, in  their misguided attempt to further their far-left social equity agenda.  These administrators don't actually want equal opportunity, they want  to tear down our top-performing students to promote their diversity,  equity, and inclusion agenda. This is simply wrong.   I have heard from parents across my district who have actually moved  out of their own homes to find schools where their children can attend  that have these college credit courses offered.   Parents should have the right to know if these important programs are  terminated and if they are being eliminated in the name of equity. We  should be forming education policy that allows children to flourish and  not one that is preoccupied with sabotaging those children who choose  to succeed academically.   At the end of the day, sunlight is often the best disinfectant, and I  hope the transparency offered by this amendment ends this harmful  attempt at the far left's social engineering.   I am grateful to the chair, Dr. Foxx, for her support of my  amendment, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  commonsense amendment that is much needed today for our parents to have  equal rights.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
