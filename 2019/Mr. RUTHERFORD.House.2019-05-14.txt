 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the E-2 visa  holders and their families who have been ignored by our Nation's  immigration laws.   E-2 visa holders are required to be business owners, job creators,  and risk takers. They are filled with the American spirit that makes  this country great. And yet, their children are unfairly forced to  leave this country on their 21st birthday.   The E-2 children have no protection, no leniency, and unlike DACA  recipients, they receive no attention from the mainstream media.   We cannot continue to put the children of illegal aliens before the  children of legal aliens. That is why I introduced the E-2 Visa  Improvement Act, which will do two things: create a path to legal  permanent residency after 10 years in the U.S., and allow children of  E-2 visa holders to stay in the country until 26 years of age and to  apply for work authorization.   I urge my colleagues to support these simple, commonsense reforms  that will make a huge difference in the lives of law-abiding immigrants  who are hiring and helping carry our economy forward.                            ____________________
