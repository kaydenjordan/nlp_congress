 Mr. Speaker, we have had an active 2 weeks in which we  have been passing appropriations bills, and the Speaker should be  commended on that. Unfortunately, all the activity with regard to the  new Speaker and appropriations bills has caused the press to have an  excuse not to pay attention to what is going on at the border.   In recently released figures with regard to September, one more time  we see record numbers of people coming across our southern border.  Compared to a year ago, the number of what we call got-aways, which I  think is the most dangerous of the immigrant groups, has shot up from  58 percent to 69 percent, almost a 20 percent increase over last year's  already high figure. Last year they shot up to 49 percent.   I think, as well, not only do we have a huge problem with people  coming across the border that shouldn't be coming across, but we should  also be paying attention to the viewpoint of the people coming across.   John Adams warned that our Constitution was fit for a moral,  religious people and totally unfit for any other kind. As the United  States has to take sides around the world in conflicts, we should be  paying particular attention to how our new wave of immigrants think.                            ____________________
