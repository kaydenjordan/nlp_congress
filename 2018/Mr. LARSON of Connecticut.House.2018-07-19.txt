 Mr. Speaker, let me associate myself with  the remarks of Mr. Neal and talk about what a fraud this whole process  has become.   I have great respect for the gentleman from Louisiana, but can you  imagine never having a hearing on this. Let me tell you who would like  to come to that hearing: Jim Baker, a devout, you know, liberal. You  have George Shultz, Martin Feldstein, Greg Mankiw, Hank Paulson, Art  Laffer, Gary Cohn, Rex Tillerson, to name a few, who say that Congress  ought to at least be open to looking at a carbon tax.   According to the other side, it is a choice between a carbon tax or  not a carbon tax. They don't talk about passing on the benefits to the  consumer. They don't talk about the transition that is needed or  strengthening the pension funds or even from the standpoint of an  infrastructure bill that they have never addressed in 8 years while  China moves ahead of us every single day. Nothing gets done in the  House of Representatives.   Here we have a fake debate and fake legislation that is going nowhere  instead of actual, real hearings. We don't have real hearings on Social  Security and its outcome. We don't have real hearings on gun violence.  We don't even have real hearings here on the state of what is going on  with this administration and the FBI and our intelligence people.   This is the sad state of affairs that we find ourselves in. So if you  see frustration on this side of the aisle, it is primarily because, in  the most demonstrative democracy in the world, not even a hearing, a  suggestion about bringing experts to talk about what this could  possibly do. What a sham.
