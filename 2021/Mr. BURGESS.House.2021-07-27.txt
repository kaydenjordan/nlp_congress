 Madam Speaker, I rise today to demand of the majority  that they restore the use of the resolution of inquiry. Resolutions of  inquiry are used by the House to obtain information from the executive  branch. If a resolution of inquiry is not marked up in committee within  14 days, it becomes a privileged resolution on the House floor.   Now, for a year the majority has turned off the tolling days for  resolutions of inquiry. They said this was because of the pandemic. But  there is no need for this. Committees are open, committees are  operating. The House floor votes have returned to near normal  operations.   This is a request for information. It is not an opinion. It is a  request for information that we, as Members of the House, should have  available from the administration.   But if you want an opinion, yesterday I introduced a resolution of  inquiry directing the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and  Human Services to turn over information on the care of unaccompanied  alien children in the custody of Customs and Border Protection and the  Office of Refugee Resettlement. This used to be something in which the  majority was interested.   There is a crisis along our southern border, and the Biden  administration and the majority should see the importance of having  transparency for the protection of these children that are, by law,  under our care.   I urge the majority to restore minority rights, and turn back on the  tolling days for resolutions of inquiry.
