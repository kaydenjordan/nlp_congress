 Mr. Speaker, as we in Washington argue over the budget  and the depletion of FEMA funds for rebuilding, children in the Virgin  Islands are suffering from excessive heat in classrooms that has  affected the academic calendar year of students in the territory.  Excessive heat has literally contributed to substantial interruption of  the learning at a critical part of the school year.   Students have been so deeply affected by these issues that they have  taken to the streets on the island of St. Croix to protest what they  believe to be the current administration's lack of maintenance of the  school. Our students have embraced the spirit of protest that runs so  strongly in the heritage of Virgin Islanders as a means of challenging  the establishment.   A week ago, St. Croix teachers, led by a local arm of the AFT,  executed a job action and staged a strike to call attention to a myriad  of issues that continue to plague the schools in the territory--lack of  AC units or fans amidst a heat wave, much-needed electrical upgrades,  limited supplies, et cetera. The students themselves joined the  teachers, and I am incredibly proud of the youth.   We need to put pressure on FEMA. We need to work collaboratively  together to get these schools in the order they need to be for the  children. Virgin Islanders must come together for our children.                            ____________________
