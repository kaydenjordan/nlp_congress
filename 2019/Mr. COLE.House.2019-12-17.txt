 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Morelle) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. I also want to  thank him for his very generous remarks. The fact that he was noted for  his civility in New York, that is one of the reasons he was a leader  there, and it is one of the reasons he is becoming a leader here.                                time  0915    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are here at the beginning of what is likely to be a  very eventful week. We are considering two items today as part of this  rule, both of which are bipartisan, full-year appropriations bills.   Today's bipartisan appropriations packages are the culmination of  many months of hard work by both parties and in both Chambers. Though  this was a long road, I am pleased that the negotiations were  ultimately successful. I have often said that funding the government  and keeping it open is one of the most fundamental duties as Members of  Congress that we have.   Together, both packages cover full-year funding for all 12  appropriations bills. This is significant. By advancing full-year  appropriations, that means we are not relying on another short-term  continuing resolution. While funding with the CR is certainly better  than shutting down the government, doing so also abdicates Congress'  ability to adjust spending and policies to reflect the country's  changing needs and priorities.   It is important to remember that, at the end of July of this year,  Congress passed and President Trump signed into law the Bipartisan  Budget Act of 2019, which set budgetary levels for fiscal years 2020  and 2021. This bipartisan and bicameral compromise was the result of a  good faith negotiation between the President and the congressional  leadership of Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader McConnell in the Senate,  Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in the House, and Minority Leader  Senator Schumer in the Senate.   That compromise achieved many wins for the American people, including  a significant and desperately needed increase to support and rebuild  our national defense.   Though the budget agreement was enacted, the authorized spending  could not be realized without full-year appropriations. Fortunately,  that is exactly what we have here today. I want to highlight a few key  provisions, Mr. Speaker.   The bills fulfill the top-line spending numbers Congress agreed to in  the budget deal earlier this year.   H.R. 1158 provides an increase of $19.5 billion for our armed  services over fiscal year 2019, which will allow us to continue  rebuilding America's military. The additional funds will enable us to  remedy our readiness crisis, allow our servicemembers to secure the  valuable training time they need, and give those same brave  servicemembers the largest pay raise they have had in a decade.   On the domestic side, the appropriations package boosts the funding  for the National Institutes of Health by $2.6 billion. This is the  fifth straight year of sustained increases for the NIH. The increased  funding places the United States as the unquestioned global leader in  biomedical research, which will lead to continued efforts to cure  diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer.   The bill also includes a significant increase for the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, America's frontline defense against  pandemics, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and other deadly diseases.   The bill includes substantial increases for various federally funded  education programs like IDEA, title I, Impact Aid, and early childhood  education. There is also a significant increase in funding for Head  Start.   Close to my heart are TRIO and GEAR UP, two programs that help  disadvantaged students, low-income students, or first-generation  college students to succeed. These programs will receive a $35 million  increase over fiscal year 2019, ensuring that still more students are  able to achieve academic excellence.   We are also increasing spending for career and technical education by  an additional $20 million.   Perhaps most critically for rural areas, we are providing a robust  increase for a medical student education program to ensure we are  training more primary healthcare providers who want to work in rural  areas.  [[Page H10311]]    The bill also includes critical tax extender provisions that have  either lapsed or are due to be reauthorized at the end of the year.  This important end-of-the-year package ensures that these important  provisions will be maintained in law, provisions like the Indian lands  tax credit and the Indian employment tax credit, which are both of  critical importance in my district. Typical tax credits provided to  individuals who have been affected by disasters will also be extended  under this legislation.   I am also pleased that three additional provisions of ObamaCare are  permanently repealed in these appropriations bills: the so-called  Cadillac tax, the medical device tax, and the health insurance tax.  These provisions served two insidious purposes, driving up the cost of  healthcare and forcing people to give up good healthcare plans that  they enjoyed. I am thankful that my friends in the majority finally  recognize this and included these overwhelmingly bipartisan solutions  in the legislation before us today.   Finally, the bill maintains important pro-life protections that have  been in previous appropriations bills. The so-called Hyde and Weldon  amendments remain intact. Maintaining these protections are important  to securing bipartisan support for these bills.   Though there is a lot to like in these bills, Mr. Speaker, there are  also some things I would change if it were solely up to me. I don't  think any of us here, Republican or Democrat, would view either of  these bills to be perfect. But what we have achieved here is a  bipartisan compromise.   I think all of us in this Chamber can be proud of the work we have  accomplished here, especially in times of divided government and in an  ever more polarized political environment. Finding compromise across  party lines and between Chambers of Congress and the administration is  no small feat. That we have done so here today is a testament to the  House of Representatives and a reminder that the things that unite us  are more powerful than those that divide us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Roy), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, since my friend is prepared to close, I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the first thing is, I want to serve notice that, if we  defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to  immediately bring up the bipartisan bill H.R. 1869, the Restoring  Investment in Improvements Act.   With 288 cosponsors, H.R. 1869 would ensure that any improvement to  the inside of a commercial building would be treated in the same way  that they have historically been treated. That puts capital back in the  pockets of job creators, which can be used to expand facilities, create  new opportunities, and hire more workers.   H.R. 1869 is a bipartisan solution to a real problem facing American  businesses. Passage will immediately boost job growth in communities  across the country by reviving investment in communities that have been  sitting on the sideline. If we defeat the previous question, we can  pass this bill and send it on to the Senate today.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, while I oppose the rule, I urge support for  the two appropriations measures we are considering today.   Frankly, to be fair, there are many concerns that my friend, Mr. Roy  from Texas, expressed that I agree with, but this is the product of  real compromise. Frankly, in that compromise, each side actually  reduced its spending.   The spending in this bill for defense, while it is a robust $19  billion increase, is $10 billion less than the President asked for in  his original budget. That was the compromise on his side. The spending  on the Labor-H bill, while certainly an increase, is $11 billion less  than my friends introduced in the original House bill. So there are a  lot of give-and-takes in this.   Frankly, as an appropriator, I would not be unhappy to see major  provisions like the repeal of ACA taxes and tax extenders brought under  their own legislation here. That would be better. But repealing those  tax increases and extending those tax extenders are real  [[Page H10312]]  victories for the American people and prevent massive tax increases  that, frankly, bipartisan majorities have opposed in this House from  the very beginning.   The flaw in the ACA bill was funding it with things that even my  friends on their side did not support and have not supported. They are  not for the medical device tax. They are not for taxing people's  insurance plans. They are certainly not for the taxes on so-called  Cadillac healthcare plans, which are nothing more than good healthcare  plans that American people and workers have bargained for.   So I consider these, however imperfectly achieved, real victories for  the American people, real bipartisan compromises.                                time  0930    The most important part of this bill is actually the underlying  appropriations process, and there we achieved what we failed to achieve  last year, as regular governance working for most of the fiscal year:  no government shutdown, thoughtful increases, and, frankly, reductions  in places that, on a bipartisan basis, we were able to agree.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the two appropriations measures we  are considering today. The two bills will fully fund the government for  fiscal year 2020 and represent a truly bipartisan and bicameral  compromise.   I want to applaud all of the Members for the work they have  accomplished on these bills which show what we can do when we set our  partisan differences aside and truly focus on governing our great  Nation together. We will ensure that the government remains open and  operating for our constituents and will ensure that the government  resources are going where they are needed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, obviously, to vote ``no'' on the  previous question and ``no'' on the rule, but I urge strong and  enthusiastic support for the underlying legislation, which I think  achieves many victories for the American people and does so to the  credit of both parties.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
