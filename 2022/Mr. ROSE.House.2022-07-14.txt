 Mr. Speaker, a recent report published by Republicans on  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tells us exactly how the Biden  administration is fueling the southern border crisis and how that  crisis is threatening our national security.   Border Patrol officials tell us two things drive immigration:  economic opportunity and perception of U.S. immigration policy. By  dismantling Trump administration policies, President Biden sent a  message to millions of people, including transnational criminal  organizations, that our borders are open.   There have been 2.6 million migrant encounters since President Biden  took the oath of office. We see a new record set every month. Still,  the Biden administration wants to end Title 42 and the remain in Mexico  policy.   Additionally, on this President's watch, Border Patrol officials have  also seized more than 1 million pounds of illegal drugs. Overdose  deaths in this country are at an all-time high. The President must  enforce our laws and save American lives.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Kelly for sponsoring  this Special Order tonight.   Mr. Speaker, on Friday of last week, President Biden signed an  executive order undermining democratically passed State laws that limit  abortions. His executive order directs the Department of Health and  Human Services to protect access to life-ending abortions including the  dangerous and deadly chemical abortion pill. This goes directly against  the Supreme Court's recent decision that allows the people through  their elected Representatives to decide on this issue for themselves at  the many States.   Unfortunately, the President caved to the extremists who support  abortion up until the moment of birth and is now going against his oath  of office by directly undermining the law of the land. Meanwhile,  pregnancy centers, which provide compassionate support to pregnant  mothers, and churches are under attack by the left.   Where is the executive order protecting these organizations and  institutions?   In America, the first inalienable right is the right to be born--the  right to life. Countless lives have been lost to abortion since Roe  became law. Now is our time to right these wrongs and stand for life.  The President has a constitutional duty to uphold the law of the land,  not undermine it.
