 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  concerning issue of puppy mills throughout the State of Pennsylvania  and across America. If we all care for our canine companions, we cannot  continue to support the horrifying practices at puppy mills.   Mr. Speaker, it is well-documented that puppy mills supply pet stores  with puppies. My home State of Pennsylvania is no exception.   Cutting off the puppy mill to pet store supply chain will decrease  the demand for puppies raised in puppy mills. The inhumane practices at  most puppy mills are shocking, appalling, and unacceptable. We have all  seen the images on television.   Stores that sell commercially-raised puppies operate based on an  outdated and socially unacceptable business model. We need to work to  shift the pet markets towards humane sources, including shelters and  rescues that are burdened with finding families for homeless pets,  thousands of which have to be euthanized in Pennsylvania each year.   President Truman once said: If you want a friend in Washington, get a  dog.   Mr. Speaker, let's show our best friends the love they deserve by  combating the inhumane practice of puppy mills.                                time  1045                           Celebrating Hour of Code     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  school-based initiative designed to increase student interest in the  world of coding. The Hour of Code, which occurs every year during  Computer Science Education Week, has the goal to teach students coding  basics.   The Bristol Township School District is one of several around the  world taking advantage of this program, and they are leading the way in  our community. Bristol Township schools are known for their science,  technology, engineering, art, and math initiatives, and they held  multiple events to allow students to participate in the Hour of Code.   The introductory program uses games to teach younger children. By  showing kids the basics of coding, it can spark an interest in computer  science and engineering, which, as our society becomes more technology  based, can be incredibly valuable skills to have.   I applaud the Bristol Township schools for participating in this  program, and I hope that other school districts across our community  and across our Nation will follow the lead of Bristol Township schools.          Congratulating Roosevelt Elementary's Miller Mean Machines     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the champions  of the Eleanor Roosevelt Elementary School's 10th annual Super Duper  Bowl, the Miller Mean Machines.   Since 2010, Roosevelt Elementary, in Falls Township, has come  together for a flag football tournament. The tournament consists of  fifth-grade students and their teachers coming together for a fun day  outside. The event also acts as a fundraiser, taking donations of both  food and money for the Bucks County Emergency Homeless Shelter and the  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.   Mr. Speaker, any event that brings our community together for a day  of fun, teamwork, and sportsmanship, while also helping those in need,  should be celebrated by this House.   Congratulations again to the Mean Machines, and I thank Eleanor  Roosevelt Elementary for being an educational leader in our community.                            ____________________
