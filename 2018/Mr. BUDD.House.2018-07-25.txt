 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  resolution we are voting on this afternoon, condemning the violence  committed by the government of Nicaragua against it own citizens.   I met with Brenda Lancaster and her husband last week in my office.  She is a constituent of mine who started an organization called ZMI  Family Ministries International, and they have planted ministries in  five different countries, one of those countries being Nicaragua.   Mr. Speaker, Brenda has received hundreds of calls and messages from  people affiliated with her ministry down there confirming the severity  of the situation. She has seen pictures and videos that she wishes no  one would ever have to see.   Luke 9:57 in the Scriptures recounts a man speaking to Jesus saying:  ``I will follow you wherever you go.'' Brenda  [[Page H7172]]  didn't think that she would start a ministry in Nicaragua, but that is  where God led her. And now people who work and volunteer fear for their  lives down there.   America has always been at the forefront of fighting human rights  abuses around the world. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to do everything  in my power to bring awareness to this pressing issue.                            ____________________
