 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member.  I appreciate this opportunity to talk about something that both of  these gentlemen have discussed and support. I appreciate that, so I  thank the gentlemen very much.    Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support as well of H.R. 3749, the  Legal Services for Homeless Veterans Act.   This is a bill that directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  provide grants to organizations that provide legal services to homeless  veterans and veterans at risk for homelessness.   The grant funds will be used to provide legal services related to  housing, such as legal services related to family law; legal services  related to income support; legal services related to criminal defense,  including defense in matters symptomatic of homelessness; and legal  services related to requests to upgrade discharge characterizations.   The legislation also authorizes appropriations of at least $20  million for additional aid to women veterans experiencing housing  instability and homelessness. As you heard from the chairman, women are  the fastest growing group not just of homeless veterans but in the  military and in our veterans' communities. And, as you heard, they are  more likely to be single parents.   While serving as a local prosecutor, before my time here in Congress,  in Monterey County, and working as a board member for the Veterans  Transition Center of Monterey County, an organization which offers  veterans not just transitional housing but, of course, case management  programs to get them up on their feet and back into the communities  where they can continue to serve, I worked firsthand with many veterans  who had certain legal issues that brought them to the brink or pushed  them right into, unfortunately, homelessness.   It is essential that Congress now ensure that our veterans are  properly supported, have access to legal aid, and, yes, get the  benefits that they have earned. We can then keep a roof over their  heads.   For veterans in my district and across this country, this bill will  provide them aid that really can help them during such events as  Veterans Stand Down, a biennial event that we have in our district that  provides much-needed legal assistance and helps our community's  veterans get back on solid ground, be accepted into housing, drive  legally, and make sure that they can find a job.   Madam Speaker, as a former veteran, I do urge my colleagues to  support my bill to provide veterans the resources necessary to help  them resolve legal issues and get back on their feet so that they can  get back to being an integral part of our community and, of course, our  country.   Finally, Madam Speaker, I thank the members of the For Country Caucus  for endorsing this legislation. As a co-chair and founder of this  caucus, the membership and I have worked to provide a platform for  military veteran members to work across the aisle, to improve  governance, and to enact productive policy, just like we have done  here.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to have this bill introduced through the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which I do believe does the exact same  thing, and I thank both of these gentlemen for bringing this bill to  the floor.                                time  1645
