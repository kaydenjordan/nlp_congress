 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6124) to amend title II of the Social Security Act to  authorize voluntary agreements for coverage of Indian tribal council  members, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6124         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Social Security       Fairness Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS FOR COVERAGE OF SERVICES BY                     AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBAL COUNCIL MEMBERS.         (a) In General.--Title II of the Social Security Act (42       U.S.C. 401 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 218       the following new section:     ``VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS FOR COVERAGE OF INDIAN TRIBAL COUNCIL MEMBERS                           ``Purpose of Agreement         ``Sec. 218A. (a)(1) The Commissioner of Social Security       shall, at the request of any Indian tribe, enter into an       agreement with such Indian tribe for the purpose of extending       the insurance system established by this title to services       performed by individuals as members of such Indian tribe's       tribal council. Any agreement with an Indian tribe under this       section applies to all members of the tribal council, and       shall include all services performed by individuals in their       capacity as council members.        ``(2) Notwithstanding section 210(a), for the purposes of       this title, the term `employment' includes any service       included under an agreement entered into under this section.                               ``Definitions         ``(b) For the purposes of this section:        ``(1) The term `member' means, with respect to a tribal       council, an individual appointed or elected to serve as a       member or the head of the tribal council.        ``(2) The term `tribal council' means the appointed or       elected governing body of a federally recognized Indian       tribe.                       ``Effective Date of Agreement         ``(c)(1) Any agreement under this section shall be       effective with respect to services performed after an       effective date specified in such agreement, provided that       such date may not be earlier than the first day of the next       calendar month after the month in which the agreement is       executed by both parties.        ``(2) At the request of the Indian tribe at the time of the       agreement, such agreement may apply with respect to services       performed before such effective date for which there were       timely paid in good faith (and not subsequently refunded) to       the Secretary of the Treasury amounts equivalent to the sum       of the taxes which would have been imposed by sections 3101       and 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 had such       services constituted employment for purposes of chapter 21 of       such Code. No agreement under this section may require       payment to be made after the effective date specified in such       agreement of any taxes with respect to services performed       before such effective date.                          ``Duration of Agreement         ``(d) No agreement under this section may be terminated on       or after the effective date of the agreement.''.        (b) Conforming Amendments.--        (1) Social security act.--Section 210(a) of the Social       Security Act (42 U.S.C. 410(a)) is amended--        (A) in paragraph (20), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (B) in paragraph (21), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; or''; and        (C) by inserting after paragraph (21) the following new       paragraph:        ``(22) Service performed by members of Indian tribal       councils as tribal council members in the employ of an Indian       tribal government, except that this paragraph shall not apply       in the case of service included under an agreement under       section 218A.''.        (2) Internal revenue code of 1986.--The Internal Revenue       Code of 1986 is amended--        (A) in section 3121(b)--        (i) in paragraph (20), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (ii) in paragraph (21), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; or''; and        (iii) by inserting after paragraph (21) the following new       paragraph:        ``(22) service performed by members of Indian tribal       councils as tribal council members in the employ of an Indian       tribal government, except that this paragraph shall not apply       in the case of service included under an agreement under       section 218A of the Social Security Act.''; and        (B) in section 3121(d)(4), by inserting ``or 218A'' after       ``section 218''.        (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the       amendments made by this Act shall be construed to affect       application of any Federal income tax withholding       requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6124, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of my bill, the  Tribal Social Security Fairness Act. This bipartisan bill supports our  community's Tribal leaders and their fair access to the Social Security  system and the benefits they have earned by ensuring Tribal governments  have the same opportunity to participate in the Social Security Program  that so many others across the country rely on. It was unanimously  approved by the Ways and Means Committee in late June.   This bill provides a simple solution to a problem facing Tribal  leaders across the country, including in my home State of Washington.  In Washington State, many Tribal leaders have been paying into the  Social Security system with the expectation of future benefits.  However, a Social Security Administration policy ruling issued in 2006  prevented them from continuing to pay into the program and have their  earnings count toward future benefits.   This problem was brought to my attention a few years ago when I met  with Virginia Cross. Virginia Cross is the chairwoman of the  Muckleshoot Tribal Council in Washington State. After this meeting, we  discovered other Tribal leaders in Washington and across the country  face the same challenges, including the Snoqualmie Tribe in Washington.  Hearing these examples, it just didn't seem fair that those who wanted  to pay into the system could not pay into the system. That is when my  staff and I went to work to find a solution.   Thanks to the dedicated advocacy of the Muckleshoot and the  Snoqualmie Tribes and the leadership of fellow Washingtonians,  Representatives DelBene and Kilmer, as well as Representatives Cole and  Schweikert, we were able to find a bipartisan, comprehensive solution  to the problem. I would also like to thank Chairman Brady and Ranking  Member Neal of the Ways and Means Committee and their staff for all the  hard work they have put in on this most important bill.   I urge my colleagues to join me today in righting this wrong so our  Tribal leaders can receive the Social Security benefits they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  [[Page H7119]]  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6124, the Tribal Social Security Fairness Act, is a  straightforward, commonsense, bipartisan bill. It ensures our Tribal  leaders have access to Social Security benefits that they so deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
