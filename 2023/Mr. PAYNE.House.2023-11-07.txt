 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank President Biden for his  continued commitment to the American people.   Recently, the Biden administration announced billions of dollars in  Federal funding for bridges, subways, and road projects in the  Northeast Corridor.   The funding included $3.8 billion for a new Hudson River tunnel  between New Jersey and New York. The current tunnel is 113 years old,  and any service delays could cost the country $100 million in lost  economic activity and disrupt service for 200,000 travelers a day.   President Biden understands the importance of the project, and his  administration has provided almost $11 billion in Federal funding for  it in the last 4 months.   This funding will help millions of future travelers get to their  destinations faster and safer, and it is another example of his great  work as President.                            ____________________
