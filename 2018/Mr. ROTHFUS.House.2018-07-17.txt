 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and  Ranking Member Waters, as well as members of the Financial Services  Committee from both parties, for this important bipartisan piece of  legislation.   Small and emerging businesses drive our economy, create jobs for  American workers, and are at the forefront of technological change. We  need to create the conditions where these ventures can access the  capital they need to grow.   This legislation builds upon the successes of the JOBS Act and JOBS  2.0. The JOBS and Investor Confidence Act includes reforms that will  make it easier for the next Microsoft or Amazon or the developer of the  next lifesaving treatment to get off the ground. When coupled with the  progrowth provisions of a revamped Tax Code, especially the Opportunity  Zones program, this will bring capital to marginalized areas and create  opportunity for all.   This package includes an important and, again, bipartisan bill that  Congressman Vargas and I introduced. The FIND Trafficking Act directs  the Comptroller of the Currency to study how virtual currencies and  online marketplaces can be misused by bad actors to trade in illicit  goods or facilitate human trafficking. I thank the chairman for  including this bill in the package.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of  the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act.
