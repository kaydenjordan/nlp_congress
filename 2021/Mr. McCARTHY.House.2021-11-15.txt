 Madam Speaker, we are just days away from voting on a  2,000-page bill that will very likely cost $4 trillion; a bill that the  White House Chief of Staff recently bragged, ``twice as big in real  dollars as the New Deal was.''   Can you imagine that? Let that sink in: 2,000 pages, $4 trillion,  twice as big in real dollars as the New Deal was. Given its size,  scope, given its unquestionable impact on American life, the American  people deserve an honest, transparent debate about its true cost and  content.   Yet, here we are, and not one Member of this House can honestly say  they have analyzed, studied, or reviewed it. We know this because the  Congressional Budget Office has made it clear that they won't have the  final analysis on how much the bill costs until Friday, at the  earliest. But even without the CBO report, we already have a pretty  clear idea that the final price tag will be far more expensive than  what Democrats are claiming.  [[Page H6250]]    Now, according to estimates from the University of Pennsylvania  Wharton School--one of the best business schools in the Nation--they  say that new spending would increase by over $4 trillion. Now, that is  twice as much as the Democrats say it will cost. And it is not just the  top-line cost, it is the tax increases, too.   According to Tax Policy Center, a center-left think tank, 20 to 30  percent of middle-income families will see their taxes go up in 2022.  Now, that directly breaks President Biden's pledge that he wouldn't  raise taxes on the middle class.   Let me make sure I state that clearly. According to Tax Policy  Center--now this is a center-left think tank--says 20 to 30 percent of  middle-income families. These are the ones who are already having a  hard time because of inflation, who are already going to celebrate the  most expensive Thanksgiving in their lifetime, paying for gas higher  than they have seen, and inflation, to many of them, higher than they  have ever had in their own lifetime. The President promised them he  would not raise their taxes, but the Tax Policy Center says 20 to 30  percent are going to have their taxes raised.   The Democrats are trying to pull a bait-and-switch on the American  people. Tell them one thing but vote on something else. The American  people obviously know better than to believe a bill of this size would  cost zero dollars.   I have listened to the President say--and I think he is on late-night  TV--who would possibly say this bill would not cost money. The Wharton  School of Business says it is more than $4 trillion. It is only the  President who first claimed, ``if you are middle class, we won't raise  your taxes.''   We know that is not true. Wharton tells us again, yeah, it is not  true what the President says. It is going to cost you $4 trillion.   So in desperation, Speaker Pelosi is demanding the House vote on this  bill even as we do not know exactly how much it will cost or how it  will truly impact our lives. If that sounds familiar to you, it should.  You see, it is exactly what Speaker Pelosi did just 10 years ago while  trying to pass ObamaCare. Remember her famous words? ``We have to pass  the bill to find out what is in it.'' Well, here we go again.   So what is the rush? After all, several of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have been very clear. They want to make sure that  this bill actually matches up with what the White House says it will.   I just watched--before we depart, they wanted these same Members to  pledge and sign a letter that they would vote for whatever this bill  said if the others would vote for the infrastructure bill. Could you  imagine your constituents looking at you, not even asking if you read  what was in the bill because you pledged to vote for it before you  could even read it.   Speaker Pelosi is rushing this bill to the floor because once they  find out that Build Back Better does nothing to lower gasoline prices  or reduce food prices, or fix our broken supply chain, or stop illegal  immigration at the border. It doesn't make our streets any safer or our  schools better for the children. Once they find all that out, they will  reject it overwhelmingly.   Madam Speaker, I know that many of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle understand this. But they truly do not want to vote on this  bill because they know it can't be justified. Madam Speaker, I know  that they know it can't be justified to spend trillions of dollars when  inflation just hit a 30-year high. They know it just can't be justified  to spend trillions of dollars on programs that benefit them politically  while hiking taxes on the middle class. They can't.   Madam Speaker, they know it can't be justified to spend trillions of  dollars for mass amnesty during the worst border crisis in history.  They know it can't be justified to spend trillions of dollars that  would make gasoline even more expensive than it currently is on a 7- year high.    Madam Speaker, they know it can't be justified to spend trillions of  dollars to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to spy on any American who spends  as little as $28 a day. They know it can't be justified to spend  trillions of dollars to make the labor crisis worse by turning the  child tax credit into welfare without any work requirement.   They know it can't be justified to spend trillions of dollars to  abandon the Hyde amendment, allowing for taxpayer-funded abortion on  demand. And they know it cannot be justified to spend trillions of  dollars to dictate our children's education standards so that  Washington has the final say in what our children learn.   On the merits, this bill deserves to be defeated. Fundamentally, it  is anti-worker, anti-family, anti-jobs, anti-energy, and anti-American.  From bank surveillance to bailouts, it takes the problems President  Biden and Washington Democrats have created over the past 9 months and  makes them much, much worse. Its destructive policies should alarm  every American.   Madam Speaker, Democrats aren't just ignoring what is going on  throughout the country. It is worse. They aren't even pretending to  listen. And that is the fundamental difference between Democrats and  Republicans.   Madam Speaker, the Democrats are focused on securing the Speaker's  legacy. House Republicans are focused on solving the labor crisis.   Democrats are focused on so-called equality. We are focused on  quality education.   Democrats are focused on payoffs for illegal immigrants. We are  focused on protecting the border.   Democrats are focused on the Green New Deal. We are focused on  lowering the gas prices.   Democrats are focused on mandates. Republicans are focused on more  freedom.   When you look at those differences, it is no wonder that the American  people want a change in leadership.   Madam Speaker, just this morning, a Democrat in the Texas House of  Representatives changed parties. This comes just two weeks after voters  from Virginia to Seattle rejected the radical Democrats and voted to  return to commonsense.   Madam Speaker, you understand this very well, I know, that Joe Biden  won Virginia by 10 points; he won New Jersey by 16.   Madam Speaker, on that night, it wasn't just Virginia that flipped  but the races in New York; the races in your own State, in Minneapolis;  and in Seattle for the city attorney.   Madam Speaker, there was good news and bad news that night. In New  Jersey, the good news for many people across this country was a  Republican truck driver with less than $200 defeated the second most  powerful elected position in New Jersey--the Democrat Senate President.  That was the good news. The bad news in this new Biden America is we  just lost another truck driver when we need so much more help.   It is not just the message, it is the mandate. Not for left versus  right, but for right versus wrong.                                time  1415    My question is: Will Washington Democrats listen?   So far, Madam Speaker, that answer is no. They are focusing on  themselves and on the demands of Speaker Pelosi.   Madam Speaker, I know today the longest serving Democrat in the  Senate announced retirement. I don't know what plans Speaker Pelosi  has. I know she has been to Europe three times in the last 3 months. I  don't know if she plans on staying longer.   I know in her press conference that she said that this will be the  culmination of her career. Maybe that is why she is pushing so hard for  people to vote on a bill that costs $4 trillion that breaks the  promises of President Biden before anybody could actually read it or  analyze it. I just think that is wrong.   But we have the chance this week to correct course and save America.   Madam Speaker, so many Americans--Independents, Democrats, and  Republicans--went to the polls last Tuesday. It wasn't a little pocket  of one place said one thing and one said another. It was overwhelmingly  resounding, a rejection of the current policies of this majority.   Madam Speaker, this one-party rule of Washington in 1 year has given  us not just inflation but rising gasoline prices, a labor crisis, a  supply chain crisis, chaos, crime, and, worst of all, failure.   As we sit here today, Madam Speaker, Russia brings thousands of their  [[Page H6251]]  military to the border of Ukraine. They feel empowered because they are  able to have a pipeline that President Biden okayed but that America  was denied.   We watch China pressure Taiwan even further.   Madam Speaker, we still have Americans stuck in Afghanistan.   Madam Speaker, it is just a little more than a week away from  Thanksgiving when millions of Americans will gather together. But those  events may be smaller because they may not be able to afford the gas to  drive to see their family. They may not be able to afford the most  expensive Thanksgiving dinner they have ever had. They are looking to  Washington to do better.   Madam Speaker, the worst thing possible we could do is not to listen  to them. They have spoken loudly, and they have spoken clearly that the  path that we are on is wrong. They cannot afford it; they cannot accept  it; and they expect us to do better.   But an idea to rush a bill this large and not have any analysis and  to think the American people won't understand it--they have watched  what happened this year under one-party rule, and on Tuesday, they said  that will change. I just hope, Madam Speaker, that this body listens  and waits for the report because they will not be able to justify a  ``yes'' vote for it.   America cannot afford it. For the good of the country, let's take  ahold of it, and let's defeat this bill.                            ____________________
