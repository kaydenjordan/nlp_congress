 Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from  Massachusetts for his very cogent and important remarks.   Let me just start off by asking the Chair, asking the leader of the  Republican party, what are you afraid of? What are you afraid of?  Health care constitutes one-sixth of the American economy. It impacts  every man, woman, and child in our Nation. Yet we have 13 Republicans,  all men, working behind closed doors to produce legislation that will  be brought to the Senate at the last moment so the American people  don't know the disaster that it is.  [[Page S3586]]    You know, what politics is about or should be about is, if you are  proud of what you do, you tell the world about it. You explain to the  American people and to your constituents why this is what you are  proposing, this is how you voted, and this is why it is good for the  people in your State and your country.   It should tell every American--whether you are a Democrat, a  Republican, or an Independent, whether you are conservative or  progressive, it should tell you something that major legislation is  being written at this moment and that most Republicans don't have a  clue as to what is in that legislation, let alone the Democrats, let  alone average Americans.   So I say to the Republican leadership, what are you afraid of? Bring  out that bill.   I am a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee, the HELP Committee. The HELP Committee is supposed to be the  committee that deals with health issues.   I see Senator Murray is here, the ranking member of that committee.  She will concur with me that the HELP Committee has held zero hearings.   It is the HELP Committee. We have had not one hearing to ask members  of the administration, people throughout this country, what the impact  of this legislation will be on the children, on the elderly, on working  families, on those who have chronic diseases, on ordinary Americans.  What impact will this legislation have on the lives of 300-plus million  people? We have not had one hearing, not one open discussion. I would  think that every Republican would be embarrassed by this. I know many  of them are embarrassed by it.   So before there is any vote on any health care legislation, we need  to have a series of hearings to discuss the implications of what the  legislation is about.   Mr. President, as I think you heard during the debate on the  Affordable Care Act--and I am a member of that committee, and we had 47  bipartisan hearings, not only in the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee but also in the Finance Committee and other  committees. There were roundtables and there were walkthroughs of the  Affordable Care Act. There was consideration of more than 300  amendments. Some 150 amendments offered by Republicans were accepted.   In 2009 and 2010, the Finance Committee held 53 hearings, meetings,  negotiations, and walkthroughs on the Affordable Care Act. That  committee marked up the Affordable Care Act for 8 days. A markup means  you accept amendments and you have debates on amendments. That was the  longest markup in 22 years, and adopted during that process were over  10 Republican amendments.   When the bill was considered on the Senate floor, the Senate spent 25  consecutive days in session on health reform--the second longest  session in history. Oddly enough and interestingly enough, many of my  Republican colleagues, during that process--after 25 consecutive days  on the Senate floor and after numerous hearings in the HELP Committee  and in the Finance Committee, there were Senators who said that wasn't  enough time. They said: This is such an important piece of legislation,  and it is going to impact so many people. We need even more time.   Senator Enzi said that ``cutting off Senate debate and deliberation  with a budget reconciliation process would shortchange legislation with  enormous impact.''   Senator Lamar Alexander said:         I don't think people are going to feel as good about a bill       that restructures one-sixth of our economy, that affects       every single American's health, and the healthcare bill is       being written behind closed doors in the Democratic leader's       office.    In other words, you had Republican leaders thinking that the hundreds  and hundreds of hours of discussion and debate on the Affordable Care  Act was not enough. I find it amazing that those same Republicans seem  to think it is OK for legislation to be written behind closed doors and  not have one single committee hearing.   Now the truth is, I can understand why Republicans do not want open  discussion and open debate on this issue--because the bill they are  working on, which is based on the disastrous bill passed in the House  last month, is a bill that would do incalculable harm to people all  over our country and really should not be considered as a healthcare  bill.   How do you talk about a so-called healthcare bill when you are  throwing 23 million people off of health insurance? When we talk about  a healthcare bill, the assumption is that we are improving healthcare  in America, not doing what the Republican House bill does--wants to  throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance. Surely that is not  improving healthcare for the American people.   Cutting Medicaid by over $800 billion--and God only knows what the  implication of that will be for the children, for the elderly, for  people who are in nursing homes.   You are not improving healthcare when you defund Planned Parenthood.  After all the rhetoric about choice, choice, choice--we want the  American people to be able to go to their provider of choice--oh, 2.5  million women who today get their healthcare through Planned  Parenthood, I guess their choice doesn't matter.   We hear about the needs of working-class people. We had the candidate  Donald Trump who talked about the needs of working-class people. The  House Republican bill--and we think the Senate bill will be very close  to it--substantially raises premiums for older workers. That is why,  among other groups opposing the House bill, the AARP made the point  that this would be a disaster for older workers.   The truth is, this is not a healthcare bill; this is a tax break for  the rich and multinational corporations bill. This is a bill that would  provide over $200 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent. This is a  bill that would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks  to the drug companies and the insurance companies. Last information I  received, the pharmaceutical corporations, the major drug companies,  made over $50 billion in profit, but this legislation would throw  Americans off of health insurance to give drug companies even more  profit.   This legislation, the House bill--and, I think, similarly, the bill  being worked on behind closed doors--is not only opposed by the AARP,  which is the largest seniors group in America, but it is opposed by the  American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American  Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes,  the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the American Medical  Association because the doctors know what a disaster this will be for  healthcare for millions of Americans--also, by the American Nurses  Association and the American Hospital Association. You have all of  these groups that are the pillars of healthcare in America saying: No,  no, this is a disastrous bill. Yet we have the Republican leadership  and a dozen or so Members who are working behind closed doors.   Nobody here has suggested that the Affordable Care Act should not be  improved. In my view, it should be improved. In my view, deductibles  are too high, copayments are too high, and premiums are too high.  Certainly, the fact that we are paying twice as much as any other  country for prescription drugs has to be dealt with also.   The task right now, among sensible people, is to put it on the table  and to be honest about it. What are the problems of the Affordable Care  Act? How do we lower deductibles? How do we lower copayments? How do we  control the escalating cost of healthcare?   Those are reasonable questions that honest people should debate, but  the answer is not to throw 23 million Americans off of health  insurance. That is not a solution to the problem. That is an insult to  the American people.   Let me just conclude by stating this. Our job right now is to make  sure that this disastrous Republican proposal never sees the light of  day. I would urge my Democratic colleagues, on behalf of the American  people--the vast majority of whom know how bad this legislation is--to  stand up and fight in an unprecedented way to make sure that that  legislation never sees the light of day.   After we win that struggle, I would hope that we would come forward  as a nation and join every other major country on Earth, whether it is  Canada--and I live 50 miles away from the  [[Page S3587]]  Canadian border--the United Kingdom, France, or Germany--and say that  healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege. If you are an  American, you are entitled to healthcare. You should not be one of the  23 million people thrown off of healthcare, bringing the total of  uninsured in America to over 50 million people. That is outrageous.   I think you are going to hear the American people stand up loudly and  clearly and demand transparency and demand serious debate on an issue  of this consequence. I think, at the end of the day, this legislation  will be defeated.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
