 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, after months of delay, I am glad Senator  Schumer has finally indicated he will allow the National Defense  Authorization Act to come to the Senate floor this week.   For each of the last 60 consecutive years, Congress has passed an  NDAA to ensure that our servicemembers and military leaders had the  resources they need to safeguard our democracy and our freedoms.   This bill is how we maintain our military bases, modernize our force,  and invest in the next generation of weapons that we hope we will never  need to use but which are necessary for deterrence. It is how we  strengthen our relationship with old allies and forge strong  partnerships with new ones. It is how we address the global threat  landscape and ensure our troops have the training, equipment, and the  resources they need to counter adversaries of today and tomorrow.   From threats by an increasingly hostile Iran to those by an  unpredictable North Korea, there are many challenges on the horizon,  but there is no question that the greatest threat to the world order  and to peace itself is the People's Republic of China.   The Chinese Communist Party has made no secret of its desire to  continue to squash democracy, as they did in Hong Kong, and impose its  economic, political, and military power on the rest of the world.   Here at home, we are intensely aware of how China's aggression can  impact our economy and supply chains for critical components of  everything from cell phones to our fifth-generation stealth fighter,  the F-35. Our dependency on advanced semiconductors manufactured in  Taiwan and in Asia is a threat to America's economic and national  security, but the most urgent and grave threats are against countries  closer to China's borders.   Last week, I had the chance to lead a congressional delegation  visiting Southeast Asia to gain a better understanding of the threats  and challenges in the region. The area spanning from Pearl Harbor all  the way to the western border of India is the largest military theater  in the world and is overseen by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and is  home to 40 percent of the world's population. My colleagues and I had  the opportunity to hear from our military leadership and key foreign  partners in the region and gain a better understanding of ongoing and  anticipated security threats, mainly from China.   China has already co-opted, as I said, a formerly democratic Hong  Kong.   It is building missile batteries and aircraft runways for its bombers  on artificial islands. It threatens freedom of navigation in  international waters. It is guilty of gross human rights abuses against  its own people; namely, the Muslim minority Uighurs. It is engaged in a  border war with India. And it threatens to invade the Republic of  China, otherwise known as Taiwan.   Here at home, there is no question that China is a looming presence,  but it is not in our backyard. We don't see its warships on our  coastlines, or worry about an imminent military invasion on our shores.   But that is not the case in the Indo-Pacific. In the Philippines, we  caught a ride on a Navy P-8 aircraft over disputed waters. Within  minutes of leaving Philippine airspace, we spotted a Chinese spy ship  engaged in intelligence gathering operations off the Philippine coast.   We traveled to India, where we met with Prime Minister Modi and  Cabinet officials to discuss threats posed by China, as well as other  shared priorities. But one of the main topics was the timetable for a  Chinese invasion of Taiwan.   In every way possible, Taiwan is a stark contrast to the People's  Republic of China. It is a true democracy, with elections whose results  are not predetermined. It is a free-market economy that adheres to the  rule of law. And it shares the same basic values we embrace in the  United States: freedom of speech, freedom of press, religion, and  assembly.   Despite the fact that Taiwan has been a self-governing entity for  more than 70 years, the Chinese Communist Party continues to claim the  island nation as part of its territory. But as the Indian Minister for  Foreign Affairs said, Taiwan isn't just a Taiwan problem; it is a China  problem.   In other words, what is at stake here is much larger than the future  of one nation; it is the entire scope of Beijing's power and ambitions  in the region. If China is able to capture Taiwan, there is no reason  to believe that the Chinese Communist Party would stop there.   China also has territorial claims against the Philippines, Japan,  Vietnam, and India. We shouldn't view Taiwan as the CCP's ultimate  goal, but as the first domino in a quest to reach regional and global  dominance. If Taiwan falls, it will not be the end, but, rather, a  beginning.   As the Taiwanese Minister of Foreign Affairs told us, Taiwan is  democracy's outpost standing watch against authoritarianism.   I believe we have a legal and moral obligation to stand with Taiwan  and deter China from invading. And we also have our own national  security at stake.   There is an old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound  of cure. In defense parlance, that means peace through strength;  deterrence. There must be a strategy to dissuade China from an attempt  to seize Taiwan. And there is no question that time is of the essence.   Our delegation met with the commander of the Indo-Pacific Command,  who described the current power dynamic rather succinctly. He said it  is not a question of if China invades Taiwan, but when.   According to our top military leaders, we have an idea of how long  that might happen, because Xi Jinping himself has said he wants to be  ready to invade by 2027.   But we have been wrong before. I remember when people said that the  Taliban--the intelligence community said it would take 2 years for the  Taliban to take over Afghanistan, and we saw that happen almost in the  blink of an eye. No one thought that country would fall to the Taliban  before we even hit the withdrawal deadline, and we certainly did not  expect the withdrawal in Afghanistan to turn into a rapid emergency  evacuation mission.   Taiwan might be safe for 6 years, but we can't operate on that  assumption. We need to work with Taiwan and our friends and allies in  the region to raise the costs, such that the PRC decides it is not  worth its time and effort.   The defense authorization bill is one critical way we can do that. It  includes a bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Duckworth, called  the Taiwan Partnership Act. It would establish a partnership between  the U.S. National Guard and Taiwanese defense forces to strengthen  Taiwan's preparedness.   Should troops need to deploy quickly in the event of a crisis, they  would be armed with the same knowledge and skills as our dedicated U.S.  National Guardsmen.   The NDAA includes other provisions to increase defense cooperation  with Taiwan and equip the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with more  resources. I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  have championed these provisions.   As I said earlier, we have a moral imperative to stand with Taiwan  and show China that the costs of invading are far greater than the  benefits. But we have our own national security interests at stake  because, if the supply of semiconductors from Taiwan were cut off, it  would be a body blow to the American economy and our national security.   I am glad Australia has already signaled its support for Taiwan, and  I hope more of our international partners will follow suit-- particularly the quad composed of Australia, Japan, and India and the  United States.   Beijing can try to exert its muscle around the world, but the United  States has one thing that China never will have, and that is friends  and allies.   I am grateful to our partners in the Indo-Pacific and around the  world who have fought and who will continue to fight to preserve  freedom and democracy. It is an honor to spend time with them. And on  behalf of our entire delegation, I want to thank all of our hosts for  their hospitality.   Our trip to the Indo-Pacific was a timely reminder of the critical  need to invest in our national defense and support our allies, new and  old.   As the Senate prepares to begin consideration of the Defense  authorization bill, I would encourage all of us to keep  [[Page S8232]]  in mind our solemn responsibility to support our national defense. That  is our No. 1 priority. All of our other freedoms flow from our ability  to protect and defend the American people.   Whether our servicemembers are guarding against threats from China,  Russia, Iran, North Korea, or terrorist groups, they need the backing  of a strong National Defense Authorization Act to succeed.   I appreciate the bipartisan work of the Armed Services Committee,  chaired by Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Inhofe, and appreciate  their hard work in getting this bill ready for our consideration. The  committee, during its markup, adopted 143 bipartisan amendments and  reported out the final bill by a vote of 23 to 3. You don't get much  more bipartisan than that around here.   This legislation has been waiting in the wings for months, and I am  glad we can finally begin consideration of this critical legislation  this week.   I hope we can continue the legacy of bipartisanship that guides this  legislation through the Senate. This debate should be about how to  defend our national security, how to deter tyrants and bullies from  around the world, and guarantee the blessings of liberty to all  democracies--those that share our values.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
