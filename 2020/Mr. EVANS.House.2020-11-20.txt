 Madam Speaker, my constituents in Philadelphia need more  COVID relief now. Many of them are worried or scared, but the  Republican Senate is still focused on confirming more Trump judges.   The House passed the Heroes Act, which gives us more of what we need,  an extension of the $600 of weekly unemployment subsidy, not more Trump  judges;   Urgent relief for small businesses like restaurants, not more Trump  judges;   Emergency rental assistance and protection from eviction or  foreclosure, not more Trump judges;   Help for airline workers, not more Trump judges;   Funding, testing, tracing, treatment to crush the virus and reopen  safely, not more Trump judges.   I urge the Senate to pass the Heroes Act now.                            ____________________
