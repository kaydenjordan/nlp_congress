 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate as in morning business.    Mr. President, in recent months, the United States and  coalition forces have achieved major gains against Iraq and Syria.  Building upon the retaking of Mosul in July, U.S. coalition partners  have liberated ISIS's former capital of Raqqa in Syria, the pocket of  Hawija in northern Iraq, and, just days ago, the border town of al-Qaim  in western Iraq. The so-called caliphate that terrorists claimed would  overrun the Middle East is now a shadow of its former self--a shrinking  swathe on a map once defined by an open reign of terror.   Unfortunately, however, our challenges in the region remain daunting  despite these hard-fought tactical victories. Our relentless focus on  destroying ISIS, which is, of course, essential, has obscured a  troubling reality: The United States lacks a clear comprehensive  strategy that addresses the Middle East in all of its complexity.   This is part of the unfortunate legacy the Obama administration left  for its successor, but nearly 1 year into the Trump administration, we  lack clarity on essential questions about our Nation's role, and we are  left to observe as bystanders the intensifying symptoms of a collapsing  regional order. While in some cases we are bystanders who take action,  we do so with unclear and often unstated objectives.   The United States has committed to the sale of over $100 billion of  weapons to Saudi Arabia. We have announced an outline of strategy to  counter Iran while providing only minimal detail. We remain  conspicuously silent on the future of our role in Iraq and Syria beyond  eliminating ISIS, as the Assad regime and its partners consolidate  power.   Our power and influence is diminishing in the Middle East as a result  of our lack of direction, and the vacuum has been filled by forces  working contrary to American interests. Consider the events that have  swept the region in recent months.   In Iraq, Iranian forces are working to sow discord as we recently saw  in Kirkuk, where the presence of the Quds Force commander, Qassem  Soleimani, exacerbated tensions among the Kurds and the government in  Baghdad. Iranian-backed militias continue to gain power and aim to turn  next year's election into a setback that drives American influence out  of Iraq. Meanwhile, the scourge of ISIS remains despite recent military  successes. The terrorist attack last week in Manhattan shows its  persistent appeal. Its rise in the wake of U.S. withdrawal years ago  demonstrates the danger of leaving before winning the peace.   Across the border in Syria, the Assad regime, backed by Russia, Iran,  Hezbollah, and an array of militias, has retaken most of the country,  including many eastern areas that are strategically important. The  consequences of the resulting humanitarian crisis have spilled beyond  its border for years, destabilizing nations far beyond Syria and paving  the way for radicalization. Forces that are hostile to both our  interests and our values are shaping the future on the ground while we  remain silent, focused on the immediate defeat of ISIS.   I want to emphasize, we want to defeat ISIS. We are defeating ISIS,  but that is not our only goal in the Middle East.   On Saturday, the Lebanese Prime Minister, Mr. Hariri, resigned,  claiming that he faced death threats from Iran, leaving the United  States with one less valuable partner in a divided government in which  Hezbollah plays a major role. I happen to have become friends with Mr.  Hariri over the years. He is a good, pro-democratic, outstanding  individual who basically was forced out of office.   A web of Iranian proxies and allies are spreading from the Levant to  the Arabian Peninsula, threatening stability, freedom of navigation,  and the  [[Page S7039]]  territory of our partners and allies, including with advanced  conventional weapons. Iran itself continues to menace its neighbors,  use its sanctions relief windfall to harmful ends, test ballistic  missiles, and spread weapons throughout the region.    According to our allies and partners, just days ago, Houthi rebels in  Yemen launched an Iranian-provided missile at the airport in Riyadh.  Meanwhile, our Arab allies are embroiled in infighting and diplomatic  disputes that weaken regional cooperation and coalition efforts in the  face of these pressing threats.   Saudi Arabia itself is in the midst of monumental change. The recent  appointment of a new Crown Prince, the arrest over the weekend of a  number of prominent Saudi citizens, and the Kingdom's ongoing war in  Yemen, which has spawned a humanitarian crisis of its own, indicate a  forcefulness that promises progress but also raises concern about  internal stability and regional conflict. Ultimately, it could serve to  strengthen Saudi rivals.   In Turkey, President Erdogan continues to consolidate power, abuse  human rights and the rule of law, and stifle democracy, while growing  closer to Russia and straining the relationship with NATO. Meanwhile,  Vladimir Putin's Russia casts a long shadow throughout the region as it  reestablishes itself as a power broker hostile to American interests  and wholly unconcerned about human rights.   These challenges are daunting, confusing, and complex, borne of years  of neglect, punctuated by crises and aggravated by weeks filled with  the events of decades.   The questions a comprehensive strategy must address are formidable:  What are our political and military objectives in the region? How  should we prioritize our pursuit of objectives given the numerous  regional challenges, and how should we measure our success? What roles  and responsibilities should our allies and partners play, and what  support will they need to do so? What should be the size, roles,  missions, and capabilities of U.S. forces in the region, whether in  Iraq, Turkey, the Persian Gulf, or elsewhere? How will the United  States facilitate humanitarian relief, stabilization, reconstruction,  and political reconciliation where possible?   These questions--many of which we require the President and  Department of Defense to answer in the National Defense Authorization  Act--are not academic.   The United States is not involved in the Middle East because we labor  under the illusion that our presence will solve every problem but  because the stability of the region is vital to our national interests  and international security alike. Middle Eastern instability tends to  travel far beyond its borders. The region's importance to the global  economy that Americans benefit from and depend upon cannot be  underestimated, but if we keep sleepwalking on our current trajectory,  we could wake up in the near future and find that American influence  has been pushed out of one of the most important parts of the world,  and that we cannot abide.   The world faces an unprecedented array of challenges, of which  instability in the Middle East is only one. Most importantly, the  United States faces growing threats from Russia and China, both of  which are eager to tilt the balance of power in Europe and Asia toward  them rather than toward us and the majority of the world that favors  greater freedom and openness.   We need to prioritize these critical challenges by rebuilding  military readiness, reorienting our force structure, investing in  needed capabilities to deter near-peer competitors, and strengthening  our alliances with like-minded partners and allies.   If we neglect to consolidate our gains against ISIS and address the  threats to American interests throughout the Middle East, our gains  will easily be overtaken. As my friend and former Secretary of State  George Schultz once observed, ``If you have a garden and want to see it  flourish, you have to tend to it.'' We could find ourselves enmeshed in  conflicts far more costly in lives, power, and opportunity if we  neglect to care for a particularly frustrating part of the world.   Our elected leaders must articulate a comprehensive strategy that  reflects these judgments with specificity and detail rather than  piecemeal offerings and tactical victories. Congress, with our  constitutional role as a coequal branch of government, and, more  importantly, the American people, deserve no less.    Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to  Ronnie Lupe, a foreign war veteran and current chairman of the White  Mountain Apache Tribe in Arizona. Chairman Lupe will be retiring next  year following 50 years of distinguished public service to his Tribe.   Ronnie also honorably served his Nation overseas in Korea. As a young  man, he journeyed far from his hometown of Cibecue to enlist in the  U.S. Marine Corps. He soon found himself across the Pacific and  entrenched in combat. Thankfully, Ronnie returned home safely to his  family and friends.   Ronnie first joined the Tribal council in 1996. Since then, he has  served as chairman of the council for a remarkable nine terms. I have  enjoyed working closely with Chairman Lupe over the years. Ronnie is a  tireless advocate for the principles of Tribal self-governance and  Indian self-determination. He led efforts to resolve the Tribe's water  rights claims and developed a reservation-wide system for clean  drinking water.   Ronnie was also a pioneer in Federal Indian policy concerning  wildlife conservation, expanding Tribal control over reservation land,  its forest, and natural resources. He oversaw the Tribe's response and  recovery in the Rodeo-Chediski Fire in 2002 and the Wallow Fire in  2011--the two worst wildfires in Arizona history. As chairman, he  labored to build and nurture Tribal enterprises like Hon Dah Casino and  Sunrise Park Resort, which today are hubs of tourism and recreation in  the White Mountains of Arizona.   Chairman Ronnie Lupe is a celebrated Tribal leader who brought about  transformative and lasting changes to the people of the White Mountain  Apache Tribe. I am proud to call him my friend. I thank him for his  service.  [[Page S7060]]                                ____________________
