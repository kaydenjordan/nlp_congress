 Madam Speaker, the last thing I would want to see is a  repeat of the other night when my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle laughed and jeered as I described the situation at the border and  what is happening to the children in our custody.   Madam Speaker, the minority leader earlier asked why are we here  again--one word, ``oversight''--``oversight.''   We have seen, as Members of Congress, too often, our desire to  provide oversight, which is a fundamental responsibility, a fundamental  duty of ours, we have seen it thwarted and we have seen it obstructed.   There is no one in this Chamber right now who feels more of a sense  of urgency than the Representative from Texas 16, El Paso, where we  have had a front row to the atrocities occurring at the hands of this  government.   And I will tell you, part of the challenge for many of us who have  worked with goodwill and charity has been witnessing the fact that  Congress has not been able to provide fundamental guardrails for the  treatment of these kids.   What is the main difference between the Senate bill and the House  bill? Ours is far more humane. Ours ensures that money will not be  diverted for things that have turned a challenge into a crisis.   A few examples include ripping children from the arms of their  parents or sending vulnerable populations back into Mexico. In fact,  Madam Speaker, in my district, one of the individuals sent back to  Mexico under this administration's policy was kidnapped and raped. We  have also seen people legally blocked at our ports of entry, sent to  more treacherous crossings. That is why Oscar and Valeria died.   So oversight is why our bill is the better bill.    Mr. Speaker, today I ask that we observe a moment of  silence for the migrants who have died as they have tried to reach the  shores of the America that they dream of.   The photograph that all of us saw this week should tear all of us up,  for those of us who are parents, to see a toddler with her little arms  wrapped around the neck of her father.   There is nothing that we wouldn't do for our children, nothing, to  give them a better life.   Oscar and Valeria represent tens of thousands of migrants who have  died as they have tried to build a better life for themselves, only to  find that they are demonized and locked out of the promise that those  of us who are natural born citizens are so fortunate to enjoy.   In their name, let us never forget their sacrifice and the sacrifice  that so many parents make for the most vulnerable among us.                            ____________________
