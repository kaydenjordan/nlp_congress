 Mr. Speaker, if you drive around Harrisonburg, Virginia,  you are bound to see an officer with the Harrisonburg Police  Department, keeping residents, visitors, and college students safe.   As HPD reminds us, ``So many things have changed since those  handwritten meeting notes of November 12, 1872 . . . when the 700  residents of the town of Harrisonburg at that time wrote the single-man  police department into being.''   By January 1, 1873, the force was comprised of the Chief of Police,  Joseph Kelly, and a ``police aide,'' Officer Willis.   Current HPD Captain Jason Kidd said of the anniversary, ``It is so  important to reach this milestone because the city has grown  tremendously and developed tremendously during these past 150 years.  The growth of the department, personnel, added positions, and  technological improvements have allowed the department to police better  and police smarter and just do the best job they can for the  community.''   To celebrate this milestone, HPD established a 150-year committee,  and the officers will be sporting a 150-year badge to mark the  occasion. HPD will also be building a time capsule to look back on this  milestone in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I join the citizens of Harrisonburg in thanking the  Harrisonburg Police Department for their 150 years of service.                  Thanksgiving Holiday Season Inflation Woes     Mr. Speaker, the American people are all looking forward  to the holiday season.   Unfortunately, the annual pre-Thanksgiving shopping receipt will be a  sad reminder that Washington hasn't been working for them.   Up and down the grocery store aisle, prices have risen on all our  Thanksgiving necessities. Turkeys cost 23 percent more, eggs cost 43  percent more, butter is up 27 percent, and milk up 15 percent. The  overall price of groceries over the last year has risen 12.4 percent.  For those traveling far to see their families and loved ones this year,  airline fares are up 43 percent over last year.   While everyone is having to tighten their budgets, those working two  jobs or on fixed incomes are getting hit the hardest, forcing roughly  one in four Americans to forego Thanksgiving dinner altogether.   An additional $9 trillion in government spending has fueled this  inflation crisis, and hardworking Americans are paying the price.   If we are going to get this country back on track, Congress needs to  cut spending, unleash American energy independence, and push pro-growth  policies.   It is time to fix a broken Washington and save America from this  administration's failed economic agenda.                 Stuarts Draft Cougars Cheer Team Wins Again     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Stuarts Draft Cougars  cheer team for winning this year's Class 1-2 Virginia State  cheerleading championship. This victory marks the program's fifth  straight title in 6 years.   The Cougars faced numerous hurdles to reach this victory, placing  second behind Fort Defiance during the first round.   However, before the second round began, Coach Tammy Carter told the  team to be ``the athletes they trained to be,'' and they did just that.  By focusing on what they needed to improve, the Cougars left it all on  the mat and increased their score by over 30 points, earning the State  title.   These talented young ladies include Lexi Almarode, Addison Colvin,  Jenna Comer, Sofia Coppola, Taylor Huffman, Zoe Mader, Zane Marshall,  Abby Mikolay, Caydence Morris, Tarynn Morris, Baleigh Painter, Eiko  Puckett, Olivia Puckett, Alyssa Sanner, Holly Stevens, A'mya Swats, and  Natalie Thompson.   For six seniors on the team--Mses. Coppola, Mader, Marshall, Mikolay,  Morris, and Painter--this was their last memory of cheering together.  There was an outpouring of emotion hoisting the State championship  trophy for one final time.   Senior Zane Marshall said of her class' historic reign, ``To have  three State championships, I don't even know how to feel. It is  crazy.''   The seniors will leave their high school cheerleading careers with  their heads held high, knowing their leadership and performance have  left a lasting legacy on their team.   Congratulations to all the talented athletes and dedicated coaches on  this incredible victory. They have earned it.  [[Page H8515]]                                ____________________
