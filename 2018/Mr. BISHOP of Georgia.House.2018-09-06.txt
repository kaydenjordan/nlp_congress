 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I be  removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 6417.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a  man who I was honored to call a mentor, colleague, and dear friend,  former Representative Ron Dellums.   Ron was an extraordinary man who wore many hats. He was a determined  public servant who was dedicated to improving the conditions of  humankind. He was also a marine, a social worker, a titan for civil  rights here and across the world, a chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee, and a founding member and past chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus. Representative Dellums was a true advocate  for fairness, human rights, and justice.   Congressman Ron Dellums was an icon. I served with him early during  my career in Congress. He demonstrated courage, compassion, fairness,  character, and dignity as a Member of Congress and as a man. He was a  great role model for people of conscience to emulate. I will be forever  grateful for his wise counsel, friendship, and his legacy of service to  humankind.
