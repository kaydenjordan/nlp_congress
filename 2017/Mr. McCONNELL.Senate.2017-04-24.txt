 Mr. President, over the past couple of weeks, Senators  have had the opportunity to travel to their States, meet with those  they represent, and talk about issues that matter most to their  communities. I think I speak on behalf of each of my colleagues when I  say that this is one of the most important aspects of our jobs. Hearing  from those we represent and engaging in discussions about the issues  they face allow us to better serve as their voices here in the Senate.   It was a productive State work period, and I know we are all eager to  get back to work here in Washington on many important issues. So I  would like to welcome back my colleagues as we head into what is sure  to be a busy work period.   As we all know, bipartisan talks continued through the State work  period on the way forward on government funding legislation. Those  discussions continue this week so we can complete our work on that  issue very soon.   And, today, we will have the opportunity to advance two well- qualified administration nominees. In just a couple of hours, we will  vote to confirm former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue to be our next  Secretary of Agriculture.   Governor Perdue--who grew up on a farm, worked as a veterinarian, and  eventually led a State with a $74 billion agricultural sector--has been  around agriculture his entire life. He is well qualified to oversee and  implement this Nation's agriculture, forestry, and food policies.  Because of his more than 20 years of public service, Governor Perdue  has garnered significant bipartisan backing and was reported out of  committee with a near unanimous vote. This is good news for our  country, and it is certainly good news for my home State of Kentucky.   Kentucky has a strong heritage of agriculture, which plays an  invaluable role in our economy. From traditional cash crops like corn  and soybeans to groundbreaking innovations like industrial hemp,  Kentuckians continue to be on the forefront of agriculture with  cutting-edge research and quality products. In addition, Kentucky is  recognized as the world capital of both bourbon and horses. These  industries contribute to the State's economy and to our tourism. As the  world turns to the Commonwealth for the 143rd Kentucky Derby, our  agricultural sector will be on full display.   I look forward to voting to confirm Governor Perdue later today, just  as I look forward to working with him to continue developing smart  agricultural policies that support both Kentucky and our country.   Then we will take a vote to advance the nomination of Rod Rosenstein  to be Deputy Attorney General. Rod Rosenstein was confirmed to his  current position as the U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland by a  voice vote. He was nominated to that position by President Bush and  retained it under President Obama--throughout President Obama's entire  term of office.   He comes to the Senate with a recommendation of Democrats, like our  former colleague Senator Mikulski and Maryland's Democratic attorney  general, who said that ``[Rod] Rosenstein would be an `outstanding'  deputy attorney general.''   Rosenstein has earned so much bipartisan support to serve as the  Deputy Attorney General that the Judiciary Committee reported out his  nomination with all but one member voting in the affirmative. So,  clearly, there is no need to force additional procedural hurdles on  this nominee. Yet, our colleagues across the aisle have decided to  force an unnecessary cloture vote on his nomination anyway. It is the  latest in a long pattern this year of needless Democratic obstruction  that is not intended to change a result--just delay  [[Page S2474]]  for delay's sake. I would urge our Democratic friends to reconsider  what they are doing.   Mr. Rosenstein is a highly qualified nominee. He is well respected  across the political spectrum and within the legal and law enforcement  communities. He should be confirmed without further delay.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, over the weekend, we  lost one of conservatism's most insightful journalists with the passing  of Kate O'Beirne.   Kate was long a leading voice for conservative principles, and she  served as mentor to so many all along the way. In a town full of class  presidents and big shots, Kate never hesitated to help someone who was  new to Washington or down on his luck.   She was fiercely devoted to her country, to her faith, and to her  family, including her husband, Jim, her two sons Phil and John, her  sisters, and her grandchildren. Beyond her immediate family, Kate  helped to foster a family at National Review with her wit, warmth, and  compassion.   As her family, friends, and many others across the Nation mourn her  loss today, we wish them comfort in this trying time.   As anyone who knew Kate can attest, her impact will not soon be  forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, I would like to  offer the Senate's condolences to a family in the Capitol community who  suffered a great loss during the recent State work period.   Last week, Matthew McClanahan, a well-respected member of the Capitol  community, passed away after a tragic accident near the Capitol  Grounds. Matt worked as a pipefitter for the Architect of the Capitol  and earned a reputation as a hard worker who took pride in his work  here at the Capitol. As those who were closest to him recall, Matt was  ``funny, sweet, and kind'' and ``always the first to show up when  someone needed a helping hand.''   His sudden passing is felt by so many--colleagues, friends, family,  and most especially by his wife, Lauren, and two young children, Evie  and Matthew.   We know that no words can convey the heartbreaking loss they feel,  but on behalf of the Senate and the Capitol community as a whole, I  want to send our deepest condolences to them at this immensely  difficult time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 32, Alexander Acosta to be Secretary  of Labor.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  with respect to the cloture motion be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate resume consideration of the Perdue nomination, as under the  previous order.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I wish to honor my dear friend, Tom  Butler, a longtime journalist from Paducah, KY. After an extraordinary  life, Tom passed away March 31, 2017 at the age of 79.   During his 35-year career at WPSD Local 6, Tom worked as an  announcer, news director, and the vice president of news. John D.  Williams, the general manager of the station, remembered him as  ``probably the most talented journalist I've ever had the privilege to  know.'' Tom maintained a fierce dedication to accurate and fair  reporting. To his viewers throughout western Kentucky, he became a  symbol of trustworthy news.   In his decades in the news business, Tom covered everything from the  weather to U.S. Presidents, but he may be remembered most fondly for  the mentorship he provided. Bill Evans, WPSD Local 6 vice president of  news and operations, wrote ``[a]t one time, all three television  stations in Louisville had prime anchors whom Tom had mentored.'' He  constantly praised those whom he had helped to get their start in the  business, instead of accepting any acclaim himself.   I had the privilege of knowing Tom for many years, and I always  enjoyed appearing on his show ``Accent,'' where I saw his kindness and  professionalism firsthand. I join the entire Jackson Purchase community  in remembering Tom's honesty, passion, and faith. Even after his  retirement from WPSD, Tom continued to serve at East Baptist Church and  as president of the Community Concert Association of Paducah.   Earlier this year, the University of Kentucky Journalism Alumni  Association announced that Tom would be inducted into the 2017 Class of  the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. Tom's long and distinguished  career makes him incredibly deserving of this honor, and I believe it  is an excellent way to pay tribute to his legacy.   Elaine and I send our deep condolences to Tom's wife, Janice, and his  children, Tom, Jr., and Amy. Tom touched so many lives, and we all  stand by the Butler family in their time of grief.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand appointments were made  during the adjournment of the Senate, and I ask they be stated for the  Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until Tuesday, April  25; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for  the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning  business be closed; further, that following leader remarks, the Senate  resume executive session to consider the nomination of Rod Rosenstein,  with the time until 12:30 p.m. equally divided in the usual form;  further, that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to  allow for the weekly conference meetings; finally, that all time during  adjournment, recess, morning business, and leader remarks count  postcloture on the Rosenstein nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:53 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, April 25, 2017, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
