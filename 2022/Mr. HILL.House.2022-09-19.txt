 Mr. Speaker, I thank my two friends from New Jersey for  managing the floor, and I thank my good friend, the Speaker pro tempore  (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle) for working with me on this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of H.R. 6265, the CAPTAGON Act. I  really appreciate Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member McCaul shepherding  this legislation through the committee and now to the House floor. As I  said, Congressman Boyle and I worked collectively on this over the past  year, and I appreciate his leadership on our Friends of Syria Caucus.   The decade of destruction and deteriorating human rights situation in  Syria is well known. But just look at the poster next to me for a  snippet of the headlines coming out of the region as it relates to this  poison, this drug, Captagon.   In addition to regularly committing war crimes against his own  people, the Assad regime in Syria has now become a narco state.  Narcotic production and trafficking in Syria and its neighbors have  become more expansive and more widespread.   The current epicenter of the drug trade is in territory controlled by  the Assad regime. This has been well known now for at least 2 years.  Yet despite that, just last week the State Department and White House  failed to include Syria in their required determinations of major drug  transit and major illicit drug producing countries.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter dated July 15, 2022,  from Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas, Representative Brendan Boyle,  and myself to Secretary Blinken urging that Syria be added to this  determination.                                     Washington, DC, July 15, 2022.      Hon. Antony Blinken,      Secretary of State,      Department of State.        Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing to respectfully request       that your administration review and determine whether Syria       meets the criteria of a ``major illicit drug producing       country'' or ``major drug-transit country'' as defined in       sections 481(e)(2) and 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance       Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. Sec. 2291(e)(2) and Sec. 2291(e)(5)).        Elements of the Assad regime and regime-affiliated networks       have reportedly engaged in state-sponsored amphetamine       production and trafficking. We have seen a troubling increase       in Captagon exports from Assad regime-affiliated networks       relying on a robust pharmaceutical sector and smuggling       routes between Syria and neighboring countries. This uptick       has also coincided with increased Assad-affiliated Captagon       seizures globally.        Not only is this trade a potential source of revenue for       elements of the Assad regime and its affiliates, but the       industrial-scale amphetamine production represents a security       threat to the region itself, particularly as Captagon       production can become methamphetamine with a few changes to       the production process. In response, the House of       Representatives designed an amendment to the National Defense       Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022 to encourage       your administration to develop a multi-agency strategy to       disrupt and dismantle these networks. The Joint Explanatory       Statement for the FY2022 NDAA noted that ``the Captagon trade       is a cause of instability in the Middle East that has       negative implications for the national security of the United       States and its allies and partners. We support development of       a strategy to guide appropriate action against narcotics       production and trafficking and affiliated networks linked to       the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria.''        As you know, section 706 of the Foreign Relations       Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-228) requires       that the President submit an annual report no later than       September 15 of each year that identifies each country       determined by the President to be a major drug transit       country or major illicit drug-producing country. In its most       recent report, the White House did not list Syria among the       22 countries identified as major drug transit or major       illicit drug producing countries. If a country is designated       as having ``failed demonstrably'' in its counternarcotics       commitments, the United States must cease providing certain       categories of foreign assistance (as defined in section       481(e)(4) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; 22 U.S.C.       Sec. 2291(e)(4)) to such country unless the President       determines that the provision of such assistance is vital to       U.S. national interests or that the country, at any time       after the President's initial report to Congress, has made       ``substantial efforts'' to comply with the counternarcotics       conditions in the legislation. This prohibition does not       affect narcotics-related assistance and humanitarian       assistance (i.e., disaster relief assistance, assistance       involving the provision of food or medicine, and assistance       for refugees).        We, therefore, request that you determine whether the       Government of Syria meets the criteria for designation as a       major drug transit country or major illicit drug-producing       country.  [[Page H7908]]         Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. We       look forward to receiving your expeditious response.            Sincerely,                                                    Roger Marshall,                                             United States Senator.                                                     Brendan Boyle,                                                Member of Congress.                                                       French Hill,                                                Member of Congress.     Mr. Speaker, this recent omission tracks with the  administration's diplomacy disconnect from our American values. First,  earlier this year, State erred and did not include Nigeria, leaving  them off as a country of particular concern for religious freedom. And  now it is Syria left off as a major drug-producing country.   Mr. Speaker, this is why this bill is so critical and important at  this time.   We need an all-of-Government approach to addressing the Assad  regime's drug production and trafficking.   Captagon has already reached Europe, and it is only a matter of time  before it reaches our shores. If we do not work with our like-minded  partners to first hinder the narcotics trade and replace it with a  working system of institutions that serve the Syrian people, then Assad  will, in fact, add the title drug kingpin to his recognized global  status as a leading mass murderer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important bill.
