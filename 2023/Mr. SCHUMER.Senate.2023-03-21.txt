 Mr. President, first, a little housekeeping.   I understand that there are three bills at the desk due for a second  reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, today is World Down Syndrome Awareness  Day.   To honor this day, I am wearing a pair of socks given to me  yesterday, in Schenectady, by my friend Sheila Seery. Sheila's  daughter, Anna, is 14 and lives with Down syndrome. These socks come  from a company on Long Island called John's Crazy Socks, run by a man  with Down syndrome, who makes socks to help raise awareness for the  condition. So, not only are they a wonderful pair of socks, they are  also for a great cause.   Today, I am thinking of my friend Sheila and her daughter, Anna, as  well as every family in our country who has a loved one living with  Down syndrome.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the AUMFs, today, the Senate begins  debate on a resolution formally repealing the Iraq AUMFs of 2002 and  1991, bringing us another step closer to ending these war authorities  and putting these conflicts behind us for good.   I want to note last week's vote on cloture--68 to 27. That is a clear  sign of bipartisan support in this Chamber. I hope Republicans will  work with us to keep this bill moving forward, because AUMF repeal in  the Senate is now a matter of when, not of if. It is my hope that we  can finish our work on repealing these AUMFs as soon as possible.   We will have a reasonable amendment process. That said, given last  week's strong vote, there is no reason to drag this out. I am  encouraged that, in the House, Members from both sides of the aisle  seem to be open to taking action once the Senate passes this  resolution, and there are Members of the Senate Republican leadership  who seem very strongly for the bill. That is a very good sign.  [[Page S840]]    As always, I thank my colleagues here in the Senate, on both sides of  the aisle, for supporting this legislation, particularly Senators Kaine  and Young, who did an amazing job in rounding up support. This has been  a dream of Senator Kaine's for a long time, and now it is coming closer  to reality. And I want to thank Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member  Risch and all of the cosponsors of the legislation.   There is no justification anymore for allowing these Iraq  authorizations to remain on the books. Every year they remain in place  is another year a future administration can abuse them to ensnare us in  another conflict in the Middle East. The American people don't want  that. They are tired of endless wars in the Middle East. We owe it to  our servicemembers and our veterans, as well as their families and  communities impacted by the war, to repeal these AUMFs as soon as we  can.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on H.R. 1, over the weekend, the U.N.  International Panel on Climate Change released their most dire warning  to date: Unless the world swiftly transitions to clean energy and curbs  emissions, our planet risks crossing a point of no return sometime in  the next decade. What awaits us on the other side could be severe and  irreversible: droughts, storms, and crop failures at a level we can  scarcely imagine today.    I think of my young grandchildren, and I worry about the world they  are going to grow up in. This is something that should make every one  of us want to do something real about climate change. Unfortunately,  House Republicans seem to think the best solution for our energy needs  is not to help America transition to clean energy. They think doubling  down on more giveaways to Big Oil is the way to go.   I have been very clear about two things: Democrats want to see a  bipartisan, commonsense energy proposal come together in Congress, but  Republicans' H.R. 1 proposal is dead on arrival in the Senate.   Let me just repeat that so they hear it from the other side of the  aisle. H.R. 1 is dead on arrival in the Senate.   So you can do all of the hoopla you want in the House. It ain't  passing. It is not going to change a thing.   No serious proposal would omit, as the House bill does, long overdue  reforms for accelerating the construction of transmission to bring  clean energy to projects online. You can't have a good bill without  some transmission. Transmission is vital to getting clean energy from  where it is produced to where people live, but the Republican H.R. 1  proposal leaves this problem untouched. It is one of the major things  we must do this year.   No real energy proposal would stuff itself with poison pills in the  way Republicans' H.R. 1 does as well. House Republicans want to repeal  everything from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the methane fee-- imagine repealing the methane fee when methane is 10 times as dangerous  as CO2--and the royalty reforms for oil and gas leases.  Democrats just passed these into law--to wide acclaim throughout the  country and throughout the world--through the Inflation Reduction Act.  So to undo them a few months later is ludicrous. It is laughable. It is  not happening.   Until Republicans recognize that permitting reform is an essential  step toward laying the foundation for clean energy and that  transmission is essential, no proposal or package they put forward will  be taken seriously.   Fortunately, there are some on both sides of the aisle in both Houses  who are attempting to put together bipartisan legislation, and it has  my blessing for them to try and come up with something that would be  reasonable, productive, and could pass.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on CHIPS, today, the administration  released a number of proposed guardrails that will ensure the Chinese  Communist Party does not benefit from our efforts to increase chip  production here at home.   We first put these guardrails into the CHIPS and Science bill, which  we enacted into law last summer--something we are very proud of and  that I am very proud of. We put them in because we didn't want to see  companies getting help to expand operations in America and then using  other dollars to expand operations in countries like China. I am glad  the administration is implementing this law with good, strong  guidelines--with good, strong regulations.   Specifically, the Department of Commerce and the Treasury have  proposed new restrictions, which the Senate approved through the CHIPS  and Science Act, on the amount companies receiving CHIPS money can  invest in projects located within countries of concern. That includes  Russia and China. Abusing CHIPS funding to expand projects in China- based markets would be self-defeating, and it would endanger our  national security. This is what we passed into law in the CHIPS bill,  and this proposed rule will implement it in a strong way. If we are  serious about investing in domestic chip production, the last thing we  should be doing is allowing companies to take CHIPS dollars and use  them to build facilities in China that benefit the CCP.   I applaud the administration. I applaud our great Secretary of  Commerce for this proposed rule, which I called on them to fast-track  weeks ago, and I am glad they are doing it.   I am also glad this week that the administration is rolling out  proposed guidance for implementing the CHIPS investment tax credit--the  ITC. I fought relentlessly to get this tax credit into CHIPS and  Science. We knew, without it, our new factories here in America that  are going to make advanced computer chips would not grow as quickly and  as well.   I want to thank Senators Wyden, Brown, Casey, Tester, Kelly, Warner,  Cantwell, and many others for joining me in this effort.   As I have said many times, President Xi and the Chinese Communist  Party are on an all-out campaign to replace the United States as the  global force in the 21st century. Look no further than the headlines  today. President Xi is being wined and dined by Vladimir Putin, leaving  no doubt that the CCP is rooting for Putin to prevail in Ukraine.   But it is not just on military matters that China wants to dominate.  For decades, the CCP has rapaciously stolen American, European, and  Japanese technologies and intellectual property. The CHIPS and Science  Act was designed to halt this bleeding and bring semiconductor jobs  back to our shores. But, if that is going to happen, we can't allow  taxpayer dollars to expand projects in China to begin with. So I  applaud the administration for introducing this proposed rule today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the Norfolk Southern hearing, the many  consequences of Norfolk Southern's derailment in East Palestine  continue to reverberate today. That accident and the many that have  occurred since have forced Congress to confront an ugly realization:  Years of lobbying from rail companies and deregulation under Republican  administrations have empowered the rail industry to put profits over  people and endanger communities' safety.   Tomorrow, the CEO of Norfolk Southern will return to the Senate and  testify before the Commerce Committee. He will be joined by Jennifer  Homendy from the National Transportation Safety Board, as well as by  two colleagues, Senators Brown and Vance, who have pushed the  bipartisan Railway Safety Act.   We have heard Norfolk Southern's CEO say he is sorry for what  happened in East Palestine, but we have also heard him say he is open  to legislative efforts to enhance safety. I hope Norfolk Southern's CEO  follows up his apology with candid answers to some important questions:   One, why did Norfolk Southern, after seeing a record $3.3 billion in  profits last year, pursue billions--billions--in stock buybacks instead  of putting that money toward safety and toward their workers?   Two, why did the freight rail industry spend so much time and money  lobbying for deregulation while also cutting the industry's workforce  by, roughly, 20 percent?   And, three, will the chair of the NTSB, who will testify tomorrow, as  [[Page S841]]  well, also commit to expanding their investigation into Norfolk  Southern to include all class I freight rail companies so we can get to  the heart of the problems that lie within the rail industry?   The Senate needs answers. Communities like East Palestine need  answers. So many others deserve answers as well. I hope we will hear  some tomorrow.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman) and the Senator from  California (Mrs. Feinstein) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 15.    I ask that further reading of the amendment be dispensed  with.    Mr. President, I ask that the Senate be in a period of  morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10  minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Biennial  [[Page S848]]  Report on Americans with Disabilities Act Public Services and  Accommodations Inspections--116th Congress, from the Office of  Congressional Workplace Rights, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, Office of the             General Counsel,                                     Washington, DC, Mar. 21, 2023.      Re: Biennial Report on Americans with Disabilities Act Public           Services and Accommodations Inspections--116th Congress       Hon. Patty Murray,      Office of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Madam President and Mr. Speaker: Enclosed is our       Report on the Americans with Disabilities Act Public Services       and Accommodations Inspections conducted during the 116th       Congress. As provided in section 210(f)(1) of the       Congressional Accountability Act (CAA), 2 U.S.C.       Sec. 133l(f)(l), at least once each Congress the General       Counsel of the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights is       required to inspect the facilities of covered entities in the       legislative branch for compliance with the public services       and accommodations provisions of the Americans with       Disabilities Act of 1990. On the basis of each periodic       inspection, the General Counsel must prepare and submit a       report containing the results of the inspection. 2 U.S.C.       Sec. 1331(f)(2).        While our inspections reveal a significant number of       barriers to access in facilities on and around Capitol Hill,       we have observed substantial progress being made towards       improved accessibility. I believe this progress is the result       of both our cooperative working relationship with the Office       of Architect of the Capitol and other employing offices, and       our focus on educating the legislative branch community       regarding accessibility for individuals with disabilities.        We look forward to continuing this work in the current and       future Congresses.            Very truly yours,                                                    John D. Uelmen,                                                   General Counsel.  Biennial Report on Americans with Disabilities Act Public Services and      Accommodations Inspections--Accessibility Report 116th Congress                     Statement From the General Counsel         Under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA),       as amended, during each Congress, the Office of the General       Counsel (OGC) of the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights       (OCWR) is required to inspect the facilities covered entities       in the legislative branch for compliance with the public       services and accommodations provisions of the Americans with       Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).        The reports that we issue and make public at least once       each Congress summarize the detailed reports we provide to       legislative branch offices throughout the inspection period.       During our ADA inspections, we work with offices to identify       barriers to access by comparing existing conditions with the       2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (the most recent       standards). When we find a condition that is not in       compliance with the 2010 Standards, we make a finding       identifying the condition as a barrier to access and report       it as such. Not all barriers to access are necessarily       violations of the ADA. In some cases, the condition be in       compliance with the 1991 Standards, but not the 2010       Standards, making the condition ``safe harbored'' until the       area is renovated or altered. In other cases, there may be       technical feasibility or historicity issues that render       compliance with the standard extremely difficult or even       impossible. In those cases, we work with the Architecht of       the Capitol (AOC) and other employing offices to find other       ways to address the accessibility issues. While not all       barriers to access are necessarily violations of the ADA, we       believe it is important to identify all barriers to access so       that these issues can be addressed when planning future       projects.        During the 116th Congress, we inspected House Member       Offices to ensure access for constituents and other visitors       with disabilities. We also focused on the Office of Attending       Physician's health units, located in numerous facilities       around the Hill. Access to the health units can be critical       for disabled visitors, and our inspections revealed       opportunities to make them more accessible.        Another important area of focus during the 116th Congress       was the United States Capitol Police (USCP) Headquarters       detention center. It is especially critical to ensure access       here since disability rights groups engage in regular       protests on the Hill. We hope that our inspections here will       result in increased accessibility of the detention center.        For the first time, during the 116th Congress, we looked at       the accessibility of exhibits and display areas. Popular with       visitors, these are located throughout the Capitol campus,       and are especially concentrated in the Library of Congress.       This review was unique for us: though these areas are covered       by the ADA, for many aspects of them, no enforceable       accessibility standards exist. We used guidelines developed       by the Smithsonian Institution to inform our review. We noted       many accessibility successes, including programming designed       for visitors with disabilities. We also observed       opportunities for these facilities to better help disabled       visitors enjoy their experiences.        The 116th Congress saw the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.       Even with this challenge, we were able to carry out ADA       inspections and continue to make substantial progress in       improving accessibility on the Capitol Hill campus. The most       recent report from the AOC, which is attached to this report,       indicates that 64% of the findings from the 115th Congress       have been closed, planned engineering solutions are being       developed for 21% of the findings, and solutions are planned       but not yet completed for the remaining 15%. We once again       thank the AOC and the other employing offices for working       with us to develop and implement solutions to the barriers       that have been identified.                                                 John D. Uelmen,                                                    General Counsel,                          Office of Congressional Workplace Rights.                                Introduction                        OCWR OGC ACCESSIBILITY PROGRAM         Under Section 210 of the CAA, the OGC enforces the public       services and accommodations provisions found in Titles II and       III of the ADA. These provisions mandate that public services       and accommodations, including the facilities where these       services are provided, be accessible to individuals with       disabilities.        The OGC has found that educating the legislative branch       community about the accessibility requirements of the ADA is       one of the most effective ways to improve access. From live       training to video content to the office's Fast Facts       publications series, we provide a range of resources to help       employing offices learn about their obligations under the       ADA. Our goal is to empower employing offices with the       information they need to make their spaces accessible to       individuals with disabilities. We conduct our biennial       inspections of legislative branch facilities and grounds on       the Hill with that goal in mind.        Our inspections help offices identify areas where       improvement is needed and consider suggestions to improve       accessibility. We also use the inspection results to develop       educational resources for use by the offices to improve       access. Since the inception of our inspection program, we       have seen tremendous progress in improved accessibility of       the Capitol complex facilities.        This report highlights some of the most significant areas       of improvement on the Hill and summarizes the results of our       116th Congress ADA inspections.                      ADA BARRIER-REMOVAL SURVEY PROCESS         Since the 111th Congress, the OGC has utilized a barrier       removal survey approach to document accessibility barriers       during inspections. This involves: 1) identifying barriers to       access, as measured against the 2010 ADA Standards for       Accessible Design (Standards); 2) assessing the severity of       each barrier to quantify the need for removal; and 3)       evaluating potential solutions to the barriers based upon       cost and need.        To maximize resources, each biennial inspection focuses on       specific facilities or grounds. Within each facility, we       focus on the areas that are open to visiting members of the       public, such as entrances/exits, restrooms, elevators, and       interior routes.         During the ll6th Congress, the OGC continued its       contractual relationship with Evan Terry Associates, P.C. to       utilize its ADA survey software to implement the barrier-      removal survey approach on the Capitol Hill campus.       Individual barriers are assigned a severity code of either A,       B, C, or D. These codes signify how much the barrier deviates       from the 2010 Standards and the relative impact of this       deviation on individuals with disabilities.        ADA Barrier Severity Codes:        A. Safety Consideration.        B. Blocks Access.        C. Major Inconvenience.        D. Minor Inconvenience.        Consistent with how ADA surveys are usually conducted for       private corporations and government entities, the OGC does       not record D-coded severities in its surveys because the       deviation at issue in these barriers has little impact upon       accessibility. Consequently, the cost to correct the       deviation usually far exceeds any benefit that would result       from correcting the deviation.        In addition to the standard severity codes A-D, barriers       may be assigned a severity code of G, which means that the       element in question did not meet the requirements of the 2010       Standards but did meet the requirements of the 1991       Standards, which, in some cases, are less strict. Under the       ADA, G-coded barriers do not need to be corrected unless the       element in question has been altered or replaced since the       2010 Standards became enforceable. If the element has not       been altered or replaced, it qualifies for the ``safe       harbor'' exception, and the responsible party does not need       to take further action until it alters or replaces the       element. The OGC still notifies employing offices of G-coded       barriers identified in their facilities so that these offices       can better plan for alterations and replacements.                                  Results                      116th CONGRESS INSPECTION RESULTS         During the 116th Congress, the OGC inspected more than 10       facilities on Capitol Hill, with a focus on health units in       the House and Senate Office Buildings, the Library of       Congress, and the U.S. Capitol  [[Page S849]]       Building; Member offices in the House Office Buildings; the       USCP Headquarters' detention center; and exhibit and display       areas in the buildings of the Library of Congress, the U.S.       Capitol and Capitol Visitor Center, the Botanic Garden, and       the House and Senate Office Buildings.        Within these facilities, we identified 163 barriers to       access, plus the barriers identified in the exhibit and       display areas. During this inspection, the Rayburn House       Office Building had the highest number of barriers (41),       followed by the USCP Headquarters (24), and the Library of       Congress Madison Building (22).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Number of     Percentage of                 Facility                     Barriers          Total ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Rayburn House Office Building...........             41*           25.15 United States Capitol Police                          24           14.72  Headquarters...........................

BARRIER CATEGORIES         For identification purposes, we categorize the barriers       into barrier types, which generally reflect the particular       type of object found to be inaccessible or the area in the       facility where we identified the barrier, such as in a       restroom or an elevator lobby. In the 116th Congress, the       most commonly identified barrier category was Single-User       Restrooms. Over one-third of the total barriers (58 out of       163) were identified in this category. We identified 14       barriers, 9% of the total, in the Multi-User Restrooms       category, meaning barriers found in restrooms accounted for       nearly half of all the barriers found during the 116th       Congress.        Restrooms have historically been an area in which our       inspections identify a significant percentage of barriers.       During the 115th Congress, 47% of the barriers we identified       were in restrooms (45% in multi-user restrooms, and 2% in       single-user restrooms). The 114th Congress inspections found       41% of barriers in multi-user restrooms and 0.05% in single-      user restrooms. It is therefore not surprising that restrooms       were again by far the most common location of findings. The       prevalence of barriers found in single-use over multi-user       restrooms during the 116th Congress inspections reflects the       type of facilities on which these inspections focused: the       health units all had single-user restrooms.        After single-user restrooms, the category with the next       highest number of barriers was Interior Route, with 43       barriers identified (27% of the total). The Interior Route       category includes barriers related to the path of travel       being too narrow for a wheelchair user or insufficient knee       and toe clearance at a table.                           WHOLE FACILITY BARRIERS         The Doors and Storage categories each include three ``whole       facility'' barriers. The ``whole facility'' designation is       used when an issue is repeatedly identified across a       substantial number of offices or locations in a single       facility. Whole facility barriers are generally architectural       in nature, such as doors into Member offices that do not meet       ADA standards, and are issues that will need to be addressed       as a whole by AOC or the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO).        During the 116th Congress, we designated a non-      architectural barrier as a whole facility barrier. Portions       of literature racks in House Member offices were outside of       accessible reach ranges. The literature racks, like other       furniture, are supplied to the offices by the CAO. Since the       issue is not within the control of the offices and must be       addressed by the CAO, we used the whole facility barrier       designation.        In contrast, a barrier that is within the control of the       office itself--like a candy dish out of reach range--would be       reported individually, even if present across a large number       of offices.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Number of     Percentage of             Barrier Category                 Barriers          Total ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Single-User Restrooms...................              58           35.58 Interior Route..........................              47           28.83 Doors...................................             *21           12.88 Multi-User Restrooms....................              14            8.59 Storage.................................              *8            4.91 Exam Rooms..............................               4            2.45 Sinks...................................               3            1.84 Telephone...............................               2            1.23 Ramps...................................               2            1.23 Alarms..................................               1            0.61 Business & Mercantile...................               1            0.61 Judicial/Correctional Facilities........               1            0.61 Signage.................................               1            0.61                                          -------------------------------     Grand Total.........................             163          100.00 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *Includes one or more ``whole facility'' barriers                                 Locations                    HOUSE OFFICE BUILDINGS: MEMBER OFFICES         During the 116th Congress, we surveyed Member offices in       the House Office Buildings. (We also surveyed these       buildings' health units, detailed in the ``Health Units''       section beginning on page 15.) We identified a total of 50       barriers in Member offices in the House Office Buildings: 28       were identified in Rayburn, 17 in Longworth, and 5 in Cannon.        For the Member offices, many of the barriers stem from       furniture, furniture layout, and self-service items and are       typically not structural in nature. This means that many       Member office barriers can be resolved easily, quickly, and       sometimes, at no cost. For example, some Member offices have       chairs or tables in the waiting area that obstruct the path       of travel for a person using a wheelchair. These types of       issues can be fixed by moving the furniture as needed. Other       offices have brochures and other self-service items that are       positioned too high or too low for someone in a wheelchair to       access. These issues can be fixed by moving the items to an       appropriate height. Staff in the Member offices can implement       these solutions.        The OCWR has easy-to-understand ADA resources, including a       short ADA inspection tutorial video and a tip sheet on       improving office accessibility, to help Member offices       configure their office spaces in accordance with the ADA       Standards and address common, easy-to-fix issues. Offices may       access these resources on our website at ocwr.gov.        In addition to the less-complicated barriers that are       typical for Member offices, there are some structural issues       in the Member offices in Rayburn, Longworth, and Cannon.       These include doors that are too narrow for someone in a       wheelchair to pass through or doors that close too quickly or       require too much force to open. These barriers generally       affect entire facilities and potentially implicate the       historic fabric of the buildings, which will have to be       considered when developing a solution acceptable to both the       AOC and the OGC.      Rayburn        In Rayburn, we found 28 barriers in Member offices.       Barriers were identified in the categories Interior Route,       Doors, and Storage. Interior Route barriers include barriers       that inhibit maneuvering from one place in an office to the       next, such as having a narrow or obstructed pathway from the       office reception area into the designated meeting space. If a       pathway is too narrow or obstructed by office furniture, a       person in a wheelchair may not be able to proceed into the       meeting area.        Three of the barriers identified in Rayburn are actually       whole facility barriers, present in many offices throughout       Rayburn. Two of Rayburn's whole facility barriers concerned       doors. These were assigned because double doors did not have       at least one leaf that provides enough clear width, and       because many doors required too much force to open and closed       too quickly.        The second whole facility barrier in Rayburn is in the       Storage category. The barrier concerned office literature and       magazine racks that were positioned outside of the required       reach range, such that someone in a wheelchair or other       mobility device may not be able to reach them.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in Member offices in Rayburn       and describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        We found 13 barriers in Rayburn's health unit (see the       Rayburn chart on page 17), bringing the total number of       barriers we identified in Rayburn to 41.        Interior Route (25):        Not enough knee and/or toe clearance at conference/meeting       tables: 17.        Carpet is not securely attached and/or exposed edges of       carpet are not fastened to the floor: 6.        Candy jar requires two hands or tight grasping/pinching/      twisting to operate: 1.        Path for wheelchairs through reception area is too narrow:       1.        Doors (2*):        Office doors close too quickly: Whole facility.        Doors are too narrow: Whole facility.        Storage (1*): Literature in magazine rack is outside of       reach range: Whole facility.        Grand Total (28*):        *Includes one or more ``whole facility'' barriers.      Longworth        In Longworth, we found 17 barriers in Member offices.       Barriers were identified in the categories Interior Route,       Doors, and Storage.        One of the interior route barriers identified most in       Longworth concerns meeting tables and carpets. Six meeting       tables in Longworth lacked adequate knee and/or toe       clearance.        Two of the barriers identified in Longworth are whole       facility barriers. The first is in the Doors category. Many       office reception areas had desks or other nonpermanent       obstructions blocking a doorway's required maneuvering       clearance, making those doors difficult to open from a       wheelchair. This issue could be addressed by rearranging       furniture in these offices.        The second whole facility barrier in Longworth is in the       Storage category. The barrier concerned office literature and       magazine racks that were positioned outside of the required       reach range, such that someone in a wheelchair or other       mobility device may not be able to reach them.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in Member offices in Longworth       and describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        We found 2 barriers in Longworth's health unit (see the       Longworth chart on page 18) for a total of 19 barriers       identified in Longworth.        Interior Route (15):        Not enough knee and/or toe clearance at conference/meeting       tables: 6.        Carpet is not securely attached and/or exposed edges of       carpet are not fastened to the floor: 5.  [[Page S850]]         Clear floor space at literature rack is obstructed by       furniture: 3.        Path for wheelchairs through reception area is too narrow:       1.

Grand Total (17*)        *Includes one or more ``whole facility'' barriers.      Cannon        In Cannon, we found 5 barriers in Member offices. Barriers       were identified in the categories Interior Route and Storage.        The Storage category barrier was a whole facility barrier,       present in many offices throughout Cannon. The barrier       concerned office literature and magazine racks that were       positioned outside of the required reach range, such that       someone in a wheelchair or other mobility device may not be       able to reach them.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in Member offices in Cannon       and describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        We found 2 barriers in Cannon's health unit (see the Cannon       chart on page 18) for a total of 7 barriers in Cannon.        Interior Route (4):        Clear floor space at literature rack is obstructed by       furniture: 2        Not enough knee and/or toe clearance at conference/meeting       tables: 1        Carpet is not securely attached and/or exposed edges of       carpet are not fastened to the floor: 1        Storage: (1*): Literature in magazine rack is outside of       reach range: Whole facility        Grand Total: (5*).        * Includes one or more ``whole facility'' barriers(:).

HEALTH UNITS         Established by congressional resolution in 1928 to meet the       medical needs of Members of Congress, the Office of Attending       Physician (OAP) has expanded its services over the years and       now provides emergency care to staff and visitors at health       units throughout the Capitol campus.        In addition to providing medical clinic services, many of       the OAP's health units contain private areas with cots and       sinks that can be used for lactation, resting, or meeting       other personal health needs. These spaces thus make it       easier--or, sometimes, possible--for people with disabilities       or health concerns to visit the Capitol campus.        The chart that follows lists the to a-1 umber of barriers       we identified in each health unit.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Number of     Percentage of                 Facility                     Barriers          Total ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Library of Congress Madison Building....              22           24.72 Hart Senate Office Building.............              17           19.10 Rayburn House Office Building...........              13           14.61 Ford House Office Building..............              13           14.61 Thomas P.

Most (10)       were found in the restroom, which presents a number of       barriers for people with physical disabilities, including a       mirror that is mounted too high for many users to see       themselves and a coat hook and light switch mounted above       acceptable reach ranges. These barriers can make it difficult       for wheelchair users, people of short stature, or those with       difficulty reaching to use this restroom. Additionally, this       restroom lacks a visual alarm signal. Deaf or hard of hearing       people using this restroom may not be alerted if the       building's fire alarm goes off.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in Rayburn's health unit and       describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        Single-user restrooms (10):        Mirror is mounted too high: 1.        Coat hook is outside of reach range: 1.        Light switch is outside of reach range: 1.        No visual fire alarm in restroom: 1.        Not enough knee and/or toe clearance at sink: 1.        Maneuvering clearance at doorway is less than required: 1.        No directional signage to nearest accessible restroom: 1.        No International Symbol of Accessibility at accessible       restroom: 1.        Raised character and braille room sign is not provided at       restroom: 1.        Toilet paper dispenser is not positioned properly: 1.        DOORS (2): Door hardware requires tight grasping, pinching,       or twisting to operate: 2.        Storage (1): Literature in magazine rack is outside of       reach range: 1.        Grand total (13).      Longworth        We found 2 barriers in Longworth's health unit. One barrier       concerned the unit's front door, which has a power-assisted       door that can be opened by pressing an actuator button, but       the door opener is not connected to a standby power source.       The other barrier was a door handle that requires tight       grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist to operate,       which could prevent anyone with impaired manual dexterity or       strength from opening it.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in i Longworth's health unit       and describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        Doors (2):        Automatic or power-assisted door does not have standby       power: 1.        Door hardware requires tight grasping, pinching, or       twisting to operate: 1.        Grand Total (2).      Cannon        We found 2 barriers in Cannon's health unit. Both barriers       concerned the restroom.        The restroom lacked a sign with raised lettering and       braille designating it. Blind or visually impaired people may       have difficulty identifying this restroom as a result.        The restroom lacked adequate clear floor space at the       toilet, which is needed by wheelchair users to transfer to       the toilet. The restroom itself does have room to provide       sufficient clear floor space, but the space was obstructed by       a coat rack and a laundry bin.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in Cannon's health unit and       describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        Single-user restrooms (2):        Raised letter and braille sign is not provided at restroom:       1.        Clear floor space at toilet is obstructed by furniture: 1.        Grand total (2).      Ford        We found 13 barriers in Ford's health unit. Seven were       identified in the single-user restroom, including grab bars       located in incorrect positions. Throughout this health unit,       door hardware requires tight grasping and twisting to       operate.        The barrier concerning improper positioning of a toilet       paper dispenser is ``safe harbored'' because the condition       complies with the 1991 Standards, but not the 2010 Standards,       and the element in question has not been altered or replaced       since the 2010 Standards became enforceable.        Ford is the only House Office Building that does not       contain Member offices. Its health unit was the only part of       the facility we inspected during the 116th Congress. We       inspected other public spaces in Ford during the 115th       Congress.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in Ford and describes the       specific types of barriers within each category.        Single-User Restrooms (7):        Door hardware requires tight grasping, pinching, or       twisting to operate: 1.        Toilet paper dispenser is not positioned properly: 1.        Side wall grab bar is in incorrect location: 1.        No visual fire alarm in restroom: 1.        Clear floor space at toilet is obstructed by furniture: 1.        Raised letter and braille sign is not provided at restroom:       1.        Rear grab bar is in incorrect location: 1.        Doors (5):        Door hardware requires tight grasping, pinching, or       twisting to operate: 3.        Door maneuvering clearance is obstructed by furniture: 2.        Interior Route (1): Not enough knee and/or toe clearance at       meeting table: 1.        Grand Total (13).                    HEALTH UNITS: SENATE OFFICE BUILDINGS         During the 116th Congress, we inspected the health units       located in the Hart and Russell Senate Office Buildings.       There is no health unit located in the Dirksen Senate Office       Building. We have inspected other public spaces of these       buildings during previous Congresses and did not reinspect       those areas during the 116th Congress. Senate Member office       inspections were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and       therefore did not occur during the 116th Congress.      Hart        We found 17 barriers in the health unit in the Hart Office       Building, 14 of which were located in the restroom. Most       barriers in this restroom present challenges to physically       disabled users, including a doorway without the required       clearance for a wheelchair user to readily open the door, a       door lock too high for many to reach, and a grab bar       obstructed by a wall-mounted sharps box. People with       disabilities affecting their hearing or vision could       encounter barriers in this restroom as well: the room's alarm       lacks a visual component, and the room is not identified with       tactile signage (raised lettering and braille).  [[Page S851]]         The other barriers are in the categories of Exam Rooms and       Doors. The barriers in the Exam Rooms category were located       in a room designated as a resting room. They pertain to a       coat hook located too high for most wheelchair users to reach       and a light switch that requires twisting with a tight grasp,       which can be inaccessible for someone whose disability       impairs the use of their hands.        Two of the barriers we found in Hart are ``safe harbored''       because the condition complies with the 1991 Standards, but       not the 2010 Standards, and the element in question has not       been altered or replaced since the 2010 Standards became       enforceable. These are the barriers concerning inadequate       clear floor space at a toilet and a coat hook outside of       reach range.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in Hart's health unit and       describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        Single-User Restrooms (14):        Grab bar obstructed by wall-mounted accessory: 1.        Seat cover dispenser clear floor space obstructed by       toilet: 1.        Coat hook is outside of reach range: 1.        Trash can requires foot operation: 1.        Door lock is outside of reach range: 1.        No visual fire alarm in restroom: 1.        Maneuvering clearance at doorway is less than required: 1.        Flush control is not on open side of toilet: 1.        Raised letter and braille sign is not provided at restroom:       1.        Rear grab bar is not long enough: 1.        Soap dispenser is outside of reach range: 1.        Toilet seat is too high: 1.        Not enough clear floor space at toilet: 1.        Pipes are not insulated: 1.        Exam Rooms (2):        Coat hook is outside of reach range: 1.        Trash can requires foot operation: 1.        Doors (1): Door is too heavy and closes too quickly: 1.        Grand Total (17).      Russell        Three barriers were found in the health unit in the Russell       Office Building: two related to doors, and one related to the       restroom.        Both barriers in the Doors category pertain to the main       door into the health unit. The door is recessed into an       alcove in a way that makes it challenging for a wheelchair       user to open. The door's hardware requires tight grasping and       twisting to operate. Both of these barriers could be removed       by installing an automatic door opening device.        Our barrier survey format lists one barrier in the       restroom. In fact, the barrier notes clarify that this       restroom does not provide any accessibility features,       including clear floor space for someone using a mobility       device, grab bars, and dispensers within required reach       ranges.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in Russell's health unit and       describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        Doors (2):        Door hardware requires tight grasping, pinching, or       twisting to operate: 1.        Maneuvering clearance at doorway is less than required: 1.        Single-User Restrooms (1): Restroom is too small to comply       with the requirements for an accessible single-user restroom       (for example, clear floor space): 1.        Grand Total (3).          HEALTH UNITS: THOMAS P. O'NEILL, JR. HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING         Our inspection of the health unit located in the O'Neill       House Office Building documented nine barriers, four of which       were found in the restroom. During the 116th Congress, our       inspections in O'Neill were limited to the health unit. We       completed a comprehensive survey of other spaces in O'Neill       during our 117th Congress inspection cycle, and the results       of those inspections will be published in the 117th Congress       biennial ADA inspection report.        The highest barrier total was found in the single-user       restroom. People with disabilities affecting mobility, sight,       and hearing could encounter barriers throughout the health       unit, including its restroom.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in O'Neill's health unit and       describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        Single-User Restrooms (4):        Mirror is mounted too high: 1.        Door is too heavy and closes too quickly: 1.        Raised letter and braille sign is not provided at restroom:       1.        Toilet paper dispenser is not positioned properly: 1.        Exam Rooms (2): Coat hook is outside of reach range: 2.        Telephone (1): Existing volume control is noncompliant: 1.        Doors (1): Maneuvering clearance at door is obstructed by       furniture: 1.        Storage (1): Portions of literature rack are outside of       reach range: 1.        Grand Total (9).                      HEALTH UNITS: LIBRARY OF CONGRESS       Madison        Our inspections for the 116th Congress identified 22       barriers in the Madison Building, where the health unit for       the Library of Congress is located. We have inspected other       spaces in Madison, as well as the other Library of Congress       buildings, Adams and Jefferson, during previous Congresses       and did not reinspect there during the 116th Congress.        The most common barrier type was Single-User Restrooms,       with seven barriers identified in this category. Most of       these are barriers to people using mobility devices or with       other physical disabilities, such as a lack of adequate space       to maneuver a mobility device.        Another common barrier type found in Madison was door       barriers. These each make a door difficult or impossible to       open from a mobility device.        Madison's health unit contains a resting room with a sink,       which is used as a lactation room for visitors. This space       facilitates the use of the Library by a disabled person who       may need a resting room for any number of reasons. However,       barriers we identified in this room--seven in total,       including three pertaining to the sink--could make it       difficult to use.        Some of these barriers are ``safe harbored'' because the       condition complies with the 1991 Standards, but not the 2010       Standards, and the element in question has not been altered       or replaced since the 2010 Standards became enforceable.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in Madison and describes the       specific types of barriers within each category.        Single-user restrooms (7):        Coat hook is outside of reach range: 1.        Trash can requires foot operation: 1.        Raised letter and braille sign is not provided at restroom:       1.        Toilet paper dispenser is not positioned properly: 1.        Not enough clear floor space at toilet: 1.        Clear floor space at toilet is obstructed by trash can: 1.        Pipes are not insulated: 1.        Doors (4):        Maneuvering clearance at door is obstructed by furniture:       1.        Maneuvering clearance at doorway is less than required: 2.        Door stop interrupts smooth surface or panel on bottom of       push side of door: 1.        Sinks (3):        Not enough clear floor space at sink: 1.        Pipes are not insulated: 1.        Sink rim is too high: 1.        Storage (3):        Coat hook is outside of reach range: 1.        Portions of literature rack are outside of reach range: 2.        Interior route (2):        Light switch is outside of reach range: 1.        Counter protrudes into pathway: 1.        Telephone (1): Existing volume control is noncompliant: 1.        Alarms (1): No visual fire alarm in resting/lactation room:       1.        Signage (1): Raised letter and braille sign is not provided       at rooms identified visually: 1.        Grand total (22).                 HEALTH UNITS: UNITED STATES CAPITOL BUILDING         During the 116th Congress, we inspected the health unit       located in the Capitol Building. While we have performed       biennial ADA inspections on the exterior grounds of the       Capitol Building and in the Capitol Visitor Center, this was       the first OGC ADA inspection performed in the Capitol       Building.        We identified eight barriers in the Capitol Building's       health unit. Seven were in the restroom. The one barrier not       located within the restroom was assigned to the doorway into       the restroom, where a sink blocked the doorway's maneuvering       clearance. This prevents wheelchair users from easily opening       a door.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in the Capitol Building and       describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        Single-user restrooms (7):        Sharps box is mounted outside reach range: 1.        Coat hook is outside of reach range: 1.        Raised letter and braille sign is not provided at restroom:       1.        Rear grab bar is not long enough: 1.        Shelf is too high: 1.        Side wall grab bar is in incorrect location: 1.        Pipes are not insulate: 1.        Doors (1): Maneuvering clearance at doorway is less than       required: 1.        Grand total (8).                              USCP HEADQUARTERS         During the 116th Congress, we inspected the USCP's       detention center, located inside USCP Headquarters. Members       of the public may enter USCP Headquarters for various       reasons, whether they are applying for a demonstration permit       or have been detained by the USCP. We inspected other areas       in the USCP Headquarters during the 115th Congress, when we       inspected the first floor customer service area, and during       the 114th Congress, when we looked at exterior routes       adjacent to the building.        Most barriers were found in the two multi-user restrooms.       In addition to other barriers, neither contained a toilet       stall wide enough for a wheelchair user to access.        The second highest barrier total was found in the single-      user restroom. These barriers in fact related to the toilet       fixture inside a detention cell. Accessibility is of unique       importance due to the nature of the setting: someone who is       detained does not have the option to try to find an       accessible restroom elsewhere. Among other barriers, the       toilet was too low to the ground and no grab bars  [[Page S852]]       were provided, so a wheelchair user could find transferring       to the toilet quite difficult or, likely, impossible.        An additional in-cell barrier was found at the bench, where       clear floor space for a wheelchair user was not provided.        Some of these barriers are ``safe harbored'' because the       condition complies with the 1991 Standards, but not the 2010       Standards, and the element in question has not been altered       or replaced since the 2010 Standards became enforceable.        The chart that follows lists the total number of barriers       in each category we identified in USCP Headquarters and       describes the specific types of barriers within each       category.        Multi-user restrooms (14):        Coat hook is outside of reach range: 2.        Door threshold into restroom is too high: 2.        Rear grab bar is in incorrect location: 1.        Rear grab bar is missing: 1.        Side wall grab bar is in incorrect location: 1.        Stall door pull is provided on pull side only: 2.        Toilet paper dispenser is not positioned properly: 1.        Stall door lock requires tight grasping, pinching, or       twisting of the wrist to operate: 2.        Accessible stall is not deep enough: 1.        Accessible stall is not wide enough: 1.        Single-user restrooms (6):        Mirror is mounted too high: 1.        No knee/toe clearance or clear floor space at sink: 1.        Flush control is not on open side of toilet: 1.        No grab bars at toilet: 1.        Toilet paper dispenser is not positioned properly: 1.        Toilet seat is too low: 1.        Ramps (2):        Edge protection is not provided at ramp and ramp landing:       1.        Handrail does not extend far enough beyond bottom of ramp       run: 1.        Judicial/correctional facilities (1): Clear floor space at       detention cell bench is not wide enough: 1.        Business and mercantile (1): Processing counter is too       high: 1.        Grand total (24).                           Spotlight on Exhibits         While we have historically focused on physical       accessibility in campus facilities during our ADA biennial       inspections, equal access to services, programs, and       activities, including exhibits, offered by legislative branch       entities is also required by the ADA as applied by the CAA.       To examine this aspect of accessibility, during the 116th       Congress, we conducted a review of exhibits in the buildings       of the Library of Congress, the U.S. Capitol Building and the       Capitol Visitor Center, the Botanic Garden, and the House and       Senate Office Buildings.        During other OCWR biennial ADA inspections, we measure       accessibility based on compliance with the 2010 ADA Standards       for Accessible Design. For many aspects of exhibits, no       enforceable accessibility standards exist. Though not covered       directly by any set of standards, exhibits are still covered       by ADA regulations, such as those concerning general       nondiscrimination; modification of policies, practices, and       procedures; program access; maintenance of accessible       features; and effective communication. Thus, because the       Standards do not cover many aspects of exhibits and displays       directly, we conducted our review based on how various       features might implicate ADA regulations.        The Smithsonian Guidelines for Accessible Design are a       useful resource for determining how to provide accessible       exhibits and displays and informed our review of CAA-covered       exhibits. The guidelines were developed by the Smithsonian       Accessibility Program in the 1990s in response to a lack of       guidelines for exhibit accessibility. They are based on       construction standards of the Architectural Barriers Act of       1968, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the ADA, and were       developed in consultation with exhibit designers.        We reviewed exhibits and displays in the Library of       Congress Jefferson, Madison, and Adams buildings; the U.S.       Capitol Building and the Capitol Visitor Center; the Botanic       Garden and Bartholdi Park; the Hart, Dirksen, and Russell       Senate Office Buildings; and the Cannon House Office       Building.         At these facilities, visitors with disabilities will find       many accessibility practices already in place. For instance,       at the Library of Congress, visitors can enjoy twice-weekly       ``Touch History'' tours, a program for visitors with visual       impairments that utilizes a specially trained docent to       describe the building using vivid language. At the Capitol       Visitor Center, listening devices with audio description are       used for the orientation film and tours and are available at       the information desks, and an audio descriptive tour is also       available for download onto a personal device. The Botanic       Garden provides a variety of programs and features designed       for visitors with disabilities, including sensory programs       for neurodivergent visitors and raised garden beds that allow       visitors of varying heights and abilities to enjoy, interact       with, and touch the plants in Bartholdi Park.        Our review revealed many opportunities for these facilities       to better help disabled visitors enjoy their experiences.       Models, other interactive displays, and braille should be       positioned within accessible reach ranges. To provide       accessibility for visitors with visual impairments, labels       and signage should use easily readable type size, avoid using       italics, provide adequate contrast between text and       background colors, and be adequately lit. In addition, labels       and signage are most accessible for visitors in wheelchairs       and those of short stature when positioned so that they can       be approached closely for reading, including being mounted at       a low height and not obstructed by seating or other objects.       Consistent staff training will help to ensure that disabled       visitors are accommodated and receive accurate information       about programs available to them.        The ``Mountains and Clouds'' piece in the atrium of the       Hart Office Building presents an excellent opportunity for       enhancing accessible visitor experiences on Capitol Hill.       Designed by American sculptor Alexander Calder, ``Mountains       and Clouds'' is a monumental-scale work comprising a 51-foot       high, 38-ton steel mountain range; suspended aluminum clouds       were removed in 2014 for structural safety reasons. A small       tactile model could be provided so that visitors who are       blind or have low vision could get a sense of the proportion       and shape of the pieces.                                  Updates                        PROGRESS UPDATES FROM THE AOC         At the beginning of each year, the AOC updates the OGC on       its progress with removing identified barriers and improving       accessibility in Capitol complex facilities and grounds. The       AOC uses a third-party consultant to verify that       accessibility barriers have been remediated. Based on the       status of this verification process as of the AOC's January       2023 update (which includes updates through December 31,       2022), the AOC reports that barriers identified in the 111th,       112th, 113th, 114th, ll5th, 116th, and ll7th Congresses have       been verified as closed as follows:        111th Congress: 90% closed.        112th Congress: 97% closed.        113th Congress: 30% closed.        114th Congress: 64% closed.        115th Congress: 61% closed.        116th Congress: 6% closed.        117th Congress: 2% closed.        The AOC also highlights some of its recent key       accessibility improvements made during the 116th Congress,       including:        Installation of accessible lifts to provide access to the       Senate Chamber dais;        Installation of automatic door operators to increase       accessibility at doorways;        Installation of additional ADA-compliant water bottle       filling stations, beyond ADA requirements;        Continued improvement to Capitol campus physical       accessibility, such as installation and/or renovation of       ramps, sidewalks, and curb cuts;        Installation of a significant number of accessibility       improvements during the extensive overhaul of the U.S.       Capitol Visitor Center's Exhibition Hall; and        Continued improvement of internal processes to ensure       accessibility standards are implemented on design and       construction projects.        This update from the AOC is included with this report in       the Appendix.                            BARRIER REMOVAL COSTS         While the OGC has not received cost estimates from the AOC       for this report, the software used for conducting the       inspections and developing solutions generates rough       estimates of the costs associated with the solutions,       adjusting for construction costs in the D.C. area and the       higher costs associated with government construction work.        Based on these software estimates, the total cost for       correcting all the barriers found during the 116th Congress       totals approximately $4.3 million. The actual construction       costs for removing these barriers have not been confirmed or       validated by the AOC.         LIMITED RESOURCES AND COVID-19 REDUCED SCOPE OF INSPECTIONS         Our ADA inspection during the 116th Congress was limited by       several factors. Given that there are 17.4 million square       feet of interior space on the Capitol Hill campus and over       580 acres of grounds, OGC simply does not have the resources       to inspect more than a very small portion of the campus each       Congress. To maximize resources, each biennial inspection       focuses on specific facilities or grounds.        In 2020, many on-site inspections were postponed due to the       COVID-19 pandemic, including Senate Member office       inspections, originally scheduled for the summer of 2020.        Additionally, resources were diverted to produce the       ``House Resolution 756 Joint Report on Accessibility.'' On       March 10, 2020, the House of Representatives passed HR 756--      ``Moving Our Democracy and Congressional Operations Towards       Modernization.'' This resolution required OCWR, AOC, and the       Sergeant at Arms of the House of Representatives to prepare a       joint report regarding the state of accessibility of the       Capitol buildings and grounds and a timetable, plan, costs,       and challenges to achieving full accessibility. To draft this       report, the working group reviewed data from the OCWR's       biennial ADA inspections and assessed the functional       accessibility of the House Office Buildings.                               TRANSITION PLANS         Although Congress has not approved the ADA regulations       proposed by the OCWR Board of Directors, the proposed       regulations follow those promulgated by the Department of       Justice by requiring consultation with members of the       disability community and the development of transition plans       that will determine how and when barriers will be removed and       facilities will otherwise be made  [[Page S853]]       readily accessible for people with disabilities. See 28       C.F.R. Sec. 35.150(d).        Our approach to ADA inspections encourages consultation       with the disability community and the development of thorough       and effective transition plans. The information we provide to       employing offices regarding barrier severity and estimated       solution costs aids the transition planning process, as       employing offices can utilize this information to prioritize       abatement projects.    INVESTIGATION OF CHARGES OF DISCRIMINATION AND REQUESTS FOR INSPECTION         During the 116th Congress, the OGC received four ADA       requests for inspection and charges of discrimination.        Two cases concerned restroom accessibility in the Library       of Congress Madison Building and the Cannon House Office       Building. The responsible employing offices cooperated with       our office in the investigation and removed the barriers to       access.        One case concerned a request for disability accommodation       made to a House Committee. The responsible employing office       cooperated with our office in the investigation, which did       not result in any findings of violations of the ADA or the       CAA.        One case concerned physical accessibility in a Committee       hearing room in the Rayburn House Office Building. Ramps to a       dais were excessively sloped and posed other barriers to       access. The responsible employing offices fully cooperated       with our office and have developed a plan to remove the       barriers to access as part of an upcoming renovation of the       room. We are continuing to monitor this case.                              Acknowledgments         The OGC ADA inspection team during the 116th Congress was       comprised of Shonda Perkins, Occupational Safety and Health       Inspection Coordinator; Crystal Barber, Occupational Health       and Safety Specialist; Christopher Robinson, Senior       Occupational Safety and Health Specialist; Mark Nester,       Occupational Safety and Health Specialist; James Peterson,       Occupational Safety and Health Specialist; and Kaylan Dunlap,       Accessibility Specialist with Evan Terry Associates (ETA).        The OGC appreciates the cooperation of all legislative       branch offices during the inspection process. We particularly       appreciate the assistance and time given by the employees of       the AOC, the Library of Congress, the USCP, the Office of       House Employment Counsel, and the Office of Senate Chief       Counsel for Employment.        Thanks to Beth Ziebarth, Smithsonian Institution's Deputy       Head Diversity Officer and Director, Access Smithsonian, for       providing context and history regarding the Smithsonian       Accessibility Program and Smithsonian Guidelines for       Accessible Design.        Dynah Haubert, OGC Associate General Counsel, is the       primary author of this report.        The OGC also acknowledges the invaluable assistance       provided by ETA. The OGC would not have been able to       implement the barrier removal survey approach to ADA       inspections without ETA's assistance and software.

Appendix                                        Architect of the Capitol,                                   Washington, DC, January 26, 2023.      Mr. John D. Uelmen,      General Counsel, Office of Congressional Workplace Rights.        Dear Mr. Uelmen: The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is       pleased to provide this annual Americans with Disabilities       Act (ADA) progress report for 2022 on removing the       accessibility barriers identified in the Office of       Congressional Workplace Rights (OCWR) biennial reports for       the 111th, 112th, 113th, 114th, 115th, 116th and 117th       Congress. This report includes data for the calendar year       December 31, 2022.        The list below provides AOC's progress in correcting the       accessibility barriers noted:        90 percent (189 of 209) of the 111th Congress barriers have       been remediated.        97 percent (386 of 398) of the 112th Congress barriers have       been remediated.        30 percent (51 of 168) of the 113th Congress barriers have       been remediated.        64 percent (1,589 of 2,477) of the 114th Congress barriers       have been remediated.        61 percent (676 of 1,113) of the 115th Congress barriers       have been remediated.        6 percent (10 of 163) of the 116th Congress barriers have       been remediated.        2 percent (6 of 259) of the 117th Congress barriers have       been remediated.        The unabated barriers identified for each biennial       congressional report are identified following categories:        111th Congress:        Planned, engineered solutions are being developed: 10       percent (20 of 209 barriers).        112th Congress:        Planned, engineered solutions are being developed: 3       percent (12 of 398 barriers).        113th Congress:        Planned but not yet completed: 1 percent (2 of 168       barriers).        Planned, engineered solutions have been developed: 68       percent (115 of 168 barriers).        114th Congress:        Planned but not yet completed: 20 percent (492 of 2,477       barriers).        Planned, engineered solutions are being developed: 16       percent (396 of 2,477).        115th Congress:        Planned but not yet completed: 15 percent (165 of 1,113       barriers).        Planned, engineered solutions are being developed: 24       percent (272 of 1,113 barriers).        116th Congress:        Planned but not yet completed: 66 percent (108 of 163       barriers).

I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, in 1 minute, I will ask unanimous consent  on Calendar No. 24, S. 30. I am just proud to say that there are a good  number of major facilities for Veterans Affairs to go forward,  including the final installation on the Canandaigua veterans facility,  up near Rochester, to complete its modernization. We have been working  a long time on this, and this finally completes that action.   Mr. President, now, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 24, S. 30.    I further ask that the committee-reported substitute  amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a  third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 11 a.m.,  Wednesday, March 22--Members should remember that, 11 a.m.; that  following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired,  the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two  leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning  business be closed; that following the conclusion of morning business,  the Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the  Gallagher nomination; further, that at 12 noon, the Senate vote on  confirmation of the nomination and that following disposition of the  Gallagher nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15 to allow for the  weekly caucus meetings; further, that at 2:15 p.m., the Senate resume  legislative session and resume consideration of Calendar No. 25, S.  316; finally, that if any nominations are confirmed during Wednesday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  actions.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order following the remarks of my Democratic colleagues.    Mr. President, I will note that four of my colleagues  will come to the floor tonight to discuss the success of the ACA. This  is the anniversary of the ACA.   Millions and millions of Americans have gotten good, reasonably  priced medical coverage because of the ACA. It is one of the hallmarks  that this Congress passed in this century. It is doing more good every  year. More people are covered, and costs are going down.   Medical care is so essential to the American people. And here we are.  Despite all the naysayers early on, it is a hugely successful, popular  program that is making Americans more healthy.   I want to thank my colleagues, led by the Senators from Pennsylvania  and New Jersey. I know the Senator from Oregon is coming as well to  discuss the benefits and beauty of the ACA.   I yield the floor.
