 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Edgar E. Lewis of Golden Valley County for his  contributions and impact to the Golden Valley community.   Edgar is a lifelong Montanan. Born on his family ranch in Lavina, he  is the youngest of seven kids. Edgar began running the ranch at a young  age after his older brothers went off to fight in World War II. It  would take Edgar and his father 5 days to move their cattle to the  summer grazing range. These trips made Edgar fall in love with ranching  and are what made him become a lifelong rancher.   Edgar's heart for his country and community is clear in the ways he  has served. Edgar served his country during the Korean war. After the  war, he settled down and bought his current ranch, just north of the  Snowy Mountains. He served on the board of directors on the Montana  Livestock Ag Credit from 1986-1998. Edgar also served as the Golden  Valley commissioner from 1989-2002.   At 86, Edgar encapsulates the Montana cowboy spirit that brings so  much character to our great State. I thank Edgar for giving back to his  community and for continuing the tradition of the Montana  cowboy.                            ____________________
