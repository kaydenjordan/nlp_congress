 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al  Green) for organizing this Special Order.   It is an honor to be here to advocate on behalf of one of America's  citizens. I have the honor of chairing the Asia and the Pacific  Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs. I have been to Vietnam, and I got to  meet with their Prime Minister, with their ambassadors, and with so  many people over there.   The Vietnamese people are a wonderful people. They have a society  that is a communist society, but it is opening up. Vietnam has made  great strides in the last 15 to 20 years, moving in the direction that  we would like to see, with an open society, free markets, as much as  they can be in a communist country.   When I was there, the thing that surprised me was the vibrancy of the  people, their outlook on life. They yearn for freedom and liberties,  just like all people do. That is an innate thing that our creator has  endowed all of us with, that yearning of freedom and liberty.   I became aware of Michael Nguyen's plight. We have intervened on  phone calls. We have written letters. We have talked to the incoming  chair of ASEAN. We just asked them; I am not going to demand. I am not  going to try to have a power game against Vietnam. But what I do want  to do is just talk to them, human to human.   We have an individual who left Vietnam, adopted America, and become  an American citizen.                                time  2030    He has been a model citizen. He is the parent of four children, a  family man, a businessman, and he went over to Vietnam with the intent  of visiting relatives, elderly relatives, and he got caught up in a  situation.   We talked to the Ambassador. We talked to people in the legislature  from Vietnam and said: I don't want to  [[Page H10503]]  interfere in Vietnam law, and, certainly, if this guy is involved in  what you are saying, by all means, prosecute to the fullest extent of  the law because we would do the same thing.   But I think what you have here is a case where a person was caught up  in something. If you look at his past here and his record here and the  people we have talked to in Vietnam, this is a good man. This is a  family man that went over there for honorable reasons. And so we asked  the people of Vietnam to look into this matter and to address this and  do what is right, do the humanly right thing.   If you are a parent, if you are married, you have got a mother and  father. You have got a spouse. Think of your children. If you were to  be removed from your family with no phone calls, no lawyer--and these  are things that we value in this country, the liberties and freedoms  that we have, that we have had and we have been fighting for over 200  years to preserve and protect. To have that taken away from you is just  unthinkable.   I know the pain and the suffering that not just Michael Nguyen, but  his family is going through. Here we are in the Christmas season, and  this is the season that we should all come together.   I am asking Vietnam, the leaders of Vietnam to look into this case  and to rapidly go through it as fast as we can. Because, like I said in  the beginning, we value our relationship. They are our 16th largest  trading partner. We have a military agreement where they have allowed  our military vessels in there for other reasons for national security.   This is something that we want to make sure that our relationship  with Vietnam continues to grow. But I can say this: If human rights  issues get in, as Mr. Green brought up, this is one of our own American  citizens. If Vietnam overlooks these things, it is going to be hard for  us as a nation to move forward with them in relationships.   So I am going to plead with the Vietnamese leadership to expedite the  case of Michael Nguyen and to do what is right. Return him back to  America. Return him back to his family, and let's try to do that before  the end of the year.   I appreciate Mr. Green for doing what he has done. He has done a  stellar job. And I appreciate all of the Members who have stood up for  such people. These are things that happen in Congress that the American  people don't know we do, that they should applaud both sides. This is  not a partisan issue. This is an American issue that we all should be  proud of that we are fighting for somebody who is an American citizen.   I know Vietnam, if they are listening, and I am sure they are, they  will do the right thing, and the right thing is to return Michael.
