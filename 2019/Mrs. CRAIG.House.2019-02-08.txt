 Mr. Speaker, I was proud to be joined by Katie Brenny at  the State of the Union Address this week, a fifth-generation cattle  farmer from Mazeppa, Minnesota.   In order to maintain their farm, Katie and her husband, Ted, work day  jobs to afford healthcare and retirement savings, and farm by  flashlight in the early morning and late at night.   Like Katie's family, too many hardworking and middle-class Americans  face similar barriers to economic security. We should be working in  Congress to find common ground and solutions on the issues that affect  America's working families:   Affordable healthcare no matter where you live;   Reliable options for you to get to work;   Broadband at home;   Farm policy that prioritizes family farmers; and   The promise of retirement security.   I will work with anyone who has a good idea on these issues when it  benefits the lives of Americans. I hope that we take seriously the  spirit of collaboration to get results for the middle class.                            ____________________
