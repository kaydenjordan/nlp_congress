 Mr. Speaker, too often we hear about our country being  divided, and yet when it comes to the Dream Act, the message is clear:  our country is united.   A wide majority of Americans and nearly 70 percent of Republicans  want us to pass this legislation. They want us to provide permanent  legal status to DREAMers--800,000 people who are working hard, studying  in our universities, contributing to our economy, and serving in our  military.   Mr. Speaker, I demand that we bring up the Dream Act for a vote. We  cannot force these young people, who have received DACA, to wait any  longer to know that America wants them to live here.                            ____________________
