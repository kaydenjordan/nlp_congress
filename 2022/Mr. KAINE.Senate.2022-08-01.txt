 Madam President, my remarks are coming about 6 minutes  after I was intending to start. I would ask for permission to complete  my remarks before the vote begins.    I yield the floor.  [[Page S3801]]         Mr. President, for nearly half a century, the Supreme  Court held that the right to make reproductive decisions was protected  by the 14th Amendment. Generations of women have relied on the freedom  to make reproductive health decisions as a matter of fundamental  personal rights. In particular, seminal cases such as Roe v. Wade,  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, Whole Woman's  Health v. Hellerstedt, Griswold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. Baird,  and Carey v. Population Services International established basic rights  to obtain abortion services and access contraception.   The Supreme Court's recent decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's  Health overruled Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern  Pennsylvania v. Casey, the landmark decisions holding that a woman's  right to a pre-viability abortion is constitutionally protected. As the  dissenters in Dobbs observed, this right is ``embedded in core  constitutional concepts of individual freedom, and of the equal rights  of citizens to decide on the shape of their lives.'' The Supreme  Court's decision in Dobbs resulted in immediate abortion bans in  several States and means that millions of women, particularly women who  live in the South, parts of the Midwest, and the West, will live  hundreds of miles from the nearest abortion clinic. In fact,  approximately 17 million women could be forced to travel more than 200  miles in order to obtain abortion care.   Not only does the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs upset decades of  precedent protecting the right of Americans to make personal decisions  about abortion, but it also places in jeopardy many other important  14th Amendment rights, including the right to access birth control.  Because the Supreme Court has abandoned constitutional protection of  reproductive rights, it is the responsibility of Congress to act.   That is why Senators Murkowski, Sinema, Collins, and I are  introducing the Reproductive Freedom for All Act, bipartisan  legislation to guarantee protections for reproductive and contraceptive  care by enacting the essential holdings of the landmark cases Roe v.  Wade, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, Whole  Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, Griswold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v.  Baird, and Carey v. Population Services International. The Reproductive  Freedom for All Act returns Federal law to its pre-Dobbs status by  allowing pre-viability abortions, prohibiting States from banning post- viability abortions necessary to protect the life and health of the  mother, and protecting access to contraception. The Reproductive  Freedom for All Act creates a minimum Federal standard which states  must follow. The bill also ensures that the U.S. Department of Justice  or individuals adversely affected by a State abortion restriction can  challenge any State restriction on reproductive freedom in court.   The Supreme Court's overturning of Roe and Casey goes directly  against the will of the people. More than 60 percent of Americans  believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Support for  reproductive freedom transcends regional, political, ethnic, and  religious differences. Since support for reproductive freedom is  nonpartisan among the public, it is important to have a legislative  vehicle protecting that freedom that can gain bipartisan support.   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the Reproductive  Freedom for All Act. It is imperative that Congress come together to  ensure that decisions as fundamental as reproductive choice are not  determined by the State or ZIP Code where someone lives.  [[Page S3807]]    I thank my colleagues for standing together in support of a  bipartisan solution to the crisis created by Dobbs. I also acknowledge  the work of advocates supporting Michigan's Reproductive Freedom for  All ballot initiative, which informed my work on this bill and which I  hope will inspire similar efforts in other States. We must come  together to pass the Reproductive Freedom for All Act now.   Mr. President, I rise to essentially do a part two of a talk that I  gave on the Senate floor about 2 weeks ago. The first part of my talk  was my analysis of the Dobbs decision of the Supreme Court, expressing  my deep disillusionment with the Court's decision to cast aside a  century of precedent under the 14th Amendment due process clause and,  in particular, casting aside 50 years of using the 14th Amendment to  protect women's rights to make reproductive decisions with regard to  contraception and abortion.   I analyzed the Court's opinion and precedents at that time, but I  sort of left it hanging what needs to be done because while we can  critique the Court decision, and I do view it as completely ahistorical  and not understanding the purpose of the 14th Amendment, nevertheless,  the Court's majority ruling was the protection of reproductive freedom  was now no longer a matter for constitutional protection but was,  instead, for legislatures.   The majority seemed to assume that that would be State legislatures,  but at least one of the concurring opinions acknowledged legislatures  could include Congress.   And I take the floor today in the second part of this talk to discuss  a bill that I have today introduced with three other Senate  colleagues--Senator Sinema, Senator Collins, and Senator Murkowski--the  Reproductive Freedom for All Act, taking the Supreme Court up on the  challenge that what we need to do to protect reproductive freedom is to  legislate to do so.   Let me describe the origin of the bill. Beginning in February, the  Senate has had two votes on a bill that I have cosponsored--the Women's  Health Protection Act, which was designed--written before the Dobbs  case but designed to protect reproductive freedom by disabling State  legislatures from putting schemes and obstacles in the way of women  making reproductive decisions.   The first time we had a vote on that bill, I voted yes. It was in  February. It received 49 votes. We were scheduled to have a second vote  on the Women's Health Protection Act in May. And it occurred to me that  we would likely have the same result; we would get 49 votes.   And I had a strong feeling before that vote that if that was the  case, we would be leaving votes on the table. By that, I understood  from talking to my colleagues that there were more than 49 Members of  this Chamber who wanted to codify Roe and related cases and protect  women's rights to access contraception and abortion services but that  it wouldn't be ideal to send a message that less than a majority of the  Senate was committed to reproductive freedom. And so I began efforts in  May to find additional votes beyond the 49 that I knew would vote yes  on the WHPA. And I began discussions with colleagues, including  Republican colleagues, to look for a way to codify Roe that, yes, might  be different in wording from the Women's Health Protection Act but  would accomplish the same goal of providing a Federal guarantee that  would operate in every ZIP Code in this country to protect women's  rights to make decisions about contraception and abortion.   And today we have introduced that bill, the Reproductive Freedom for  All Act. The name of it is a tribute to a ballot initiative that is  currently under debate in Michigan and scheduled for a vote to be added  to the Michigan Constitution in November, the Reproductive Freedom for  All initiative. And the bill that we have put together fairly closely  tracks--not identically but fairly closely tracks the language of the  ballot referendum in Michigan.   What does the bill do? We worked on the bill between the leak of the  Dobbs opinion and when Dobbs was decided by the Supreme Court right  before our July Fourth recess. And we worked to make the bill as strong  as we could. But then we set it aside because we knew the Dobbs  decision might change from the leaked opinion, and we wanted to see  what was actually in the opinion before we finalized the bill. And it  is good that we waited because there were some aspects of the Dobbs  opinion that were a bit different. They took some sandpaper to some  controversial parts of the case, and they extended other arguments in  the case that needed a response.   And so what we have done since Dobbs is analyzed the opinion but  also, more importantly, looked at life in the United States since that  decision was rendered. I could give many examples, even in the month  since that decision has been rendered, of the tragedy of what I believe  is now post-Dobbs America.   In particular, when a 10-year-old child has to be smuggled across  State lines to receive care following her rape, that is gruesome. That  is not what this country should expect, nor, indeed, what we should  tolerate. And yet that is not an accidental byproduct of the Dobbs  decision. That was a completely foreseeable and even foreseen  consequence of the Dobbs decision that turning it over to 50 States  would lead to a patchwork of horrible examples one after the next.   I have spoken about another example in Virginia. An individual who  was living in Kentucky got a breast cancer diagnosis on the day the  Dobbs opinion was leaked, went to her doctor and found out that her  contraception could potentially cause accelerated growth of cancer  cells. And so she needed to come off contraception to get cancer  treatment. She has two young children. She is worrying about her own  cancer. She is trying to keep herself healthy for herself but also for  her young children. If she were to come off contraception, there would  be the chance of an unwanted pregnancy. The cancer treatments also  would significantly degrade the possibility for a healthy pregnancy,  but she was now living in a State that, post-Dobbs, would not allow her  to have an abortion.   She wrote a piece about this in NBC News. She was fortunate enough to  be able to move and get a new job in Virginia, where she would be able  to make these choices, but these are the kinds of choices, post-Dobbs,  people have to make every day: Do we smuggle a youngster across State  lines or does someone move from one State to the next? Every person in  this country, no matter what ZIP Code they live in, should have a basic  Federal guarantee about contraception and availability of abortion  services.   What the Reproductive Freedom for All Act would do would be,  essentially--we tried to put ourselves in a time machine after Dobbs  and travel back to the day before the Dobbs decision. It was a very  narrow focus. You can look at this in other ways. Some folks didn't  like what the law was the day before the Dobbs decision. But in order  to find some bipartisanship--because, truly, the American public, on a  bipartisan basis, wants to preserve reproductive rights--we looked at  could we come up with a Federal statutory guarantee that would match  the state of constitutional law that existed the day before the Dobbs  decision and protect the rights of all to contraception access and also  protect the rights of all to abortion access as it existed before  Dobbs.   Simply put, that is this; that prior to fetal viability, no State can  pass any statute regulating abortion that imposes an undue burden on a  woman seeking to exercise that right. And post-viability, while a State  can more significantly regulate abortion, no State can deprive any  woman of the right to receive an abortion should she and her health  providers determine that it is necessary to protect her life or health.   That is the bill that I have introduced today with Senators Collins,  Murkowski, and Sinema. I thank them for working to try to show--because  now we have shown that there is not a minority of the U.S. Senate, but  there is actually a majority that wants to codify Roe and related  cases; that we might have some differences of opinion about the right  language to use to do that, but there is a difference between a Senate  where that is only a minority sentiment and a Senate where, like in the  rest of the American public, that is a majority sentiment.   The last thing I will say is this. I am very well aware, as are my  cosponsors  [[Page S3808]]  in introducing that bill, that we do not have the votes today, should  it be put up, to get 60 votes in the Senate for it. We don't. Yet I am  given some inspiration by the fact that we recently passed a gun safety  bill where 2 months before there were not 60 votes either. In fact, for  the 10 years I have been in the Senate, we have been trying to pass  legislation in this Chamber to deal with the scourge of gun violence  and again and again and again have fallen short of 60 votes even to  proceed to legislation. But in the aftermath of tragedies in Buffalo  and Texas, a decision was made by the Members of this deliberative body  that inaction was no longer an option and resolute action to protect  people's rights and safety was a mandate.   I believe the Dobbs decision and what we have seen since is a  catastrophe that, as it plays out over time in State after State, will  also change the dynamic in the article I branch and demonstrate the  need for a national protection for reproductive rights rather than a  50-State free-for-all in a race to the bottom.   It is in that spirit my colleagues and I have introduced this  bipartisan bill today demonstrating that there is now bipartisan  support and majority support in the U.S. Senate to protect reproductive  freedom for all.    Mr. President, for nearly half a century, the Supreme  Court held that the right to make reproductive decisions was protected  by the 14th Amendment. Generations of women have relied on the freedom  to make reproductive health decisions as a matter of fundamental  personal rights. In particular, seminal cases such as Roe v.
