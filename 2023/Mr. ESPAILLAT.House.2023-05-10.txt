 Madam Speaker, New York City is again serving its  traditional role as a beacon of light of opportunity for this Nation  when it comes to the humane and just treatment of asylum seekers.  [[Page H2180]]    Madam Speaker, that lady still stands at the harbor telling us:  ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be  free.'' That message is heard across the country. My family heard that  message.   Madam Speaker, I am sure that even across the country in California,  your family heard this message, a tremendous message that is at the  very center of America, at the heart of America.   Last spring, in an act of political theater, Republican Governors  began transporting asylum seekers to New York City and other cities  across the country. In response, New Yorkers have welcomed them because  this is America. They reaffirmed our commitment to ensuring that the  American Dream is available for all those who want to seek it and want  to make their case before government.   We should allow people to come and make their case before our  government, and then we will determine whether or not they can remain  in our country.    Since last spring, my city has welcomed over 60,000 new New Yorkers  who are seeking asylum in our country. I congratulate and thank Mayor  Eric Adams for his remarkable leadership in taking on this great  challenge.   Over the past year, New York City has opened up eight new  humanitarian response and relief centers and 122 emergency shelters.  These shelters are currently providing over 37,000 asylum seekers with  beds while their cases are being processed.   However, New York City cannot do it alone. We must get the help of  FEMA. This is why I and New York City's congressional delegation fought  so hard to secure nearly $40 million for much-needed Federal funding.   New York is a proud right-to-shelter city. It requires the city to  provide asylum seekers with shelter, along with their families.   This week, I led a letter by the congressional delegation of our city  to FEMA to oversee the immediate release of an additional $360 million  in shelter and services funds. We must get that aid.   Madam Speaker, I will address another issue, the weaponization of  immigration. Every day, right on this floor, we hear some of our  colleagues weaponize immigration for political purposes, particularly  during election season. We hear them weaponize this issue to try to  score some cheap political points.   They try to say that it is the moms who walked for thousands of miles  with their children fleeing violence that are carrying fentanyl and  other dangerous drugs when, in fact, all the evidence from law  enforcement shows us that those drugs are being transported through the  ports of entry.   Madam Speaker, let's invest in making our ports of entry stronger and  safer so that these dangerous drugs, weapons, and human trafficking do  not continue to occur.                                time  1030    This political theater of weaponizing immigration must stop. It  divides the Nation, it makes us look foolish across the world, and it  diminishes us as a beacon of hope and opportunity that has that lady  still on the harbor.   Madam Speaker, I encourage New York and other places in need of  funding for asylum seekers to apply for a variety of benefits made  available to them through the Department of Education, the Department  of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Health and  Human Services.   Madam Speaker, this is a nation of immigrants. Don't allow  immigration to be weaponized. Let's make sure we address the issue in a  comprehensive way.   Keep the faith.                            ____________________
