 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 75,  I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 7) relating to a national  emergency declared by the President on March 13, 2020, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.  [[Page H608]]    The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 7.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 7, which  terminates the March 13, 2020, national emergency declared for COVID-19  under the National Emergencies Act, or the NEA.   The time has come to move past the COVID-19 pandemic. It is no longer  a global emergency as it was nearly 3 years ago. It is that simple.   President Biden said, in his own words, ``The pandemic is over.'' He  said that last September, and our Senate colleagues, with a bipartisan  vote, agreed by passing a resolution last Congress, on November 15,  2022.   The NEA was intended to provide emergency authorities to the  President to respond to extraordinary situations in which the President  must act quickly. We are no longer in that spot.   The national emergency was declared by President Trump at the  beginning of the pandemic, nearly 3 years ago, in March 2020. At that  time, it was a new virus. The American public and the world at large  had little information, and we had to get a handle on the spread of  COVID-19.   Today, we are in a vastly different spot. We have treatments. We have  better methods to track COVID. We have a better understanding of the  virus itself, and the Federal Government has spent trillions combating  the virus and protecting the economy from the fallout of the global  shutdown.   At this point, there is no longer a need for the declaration to  utilize the extraordinary authorities provided under the NEA. It seems  that the White House agrees with this, too, but just thinks we need to  wait until May 11.   That logic and math just doesn't seem right to me. Consider this: The  declaration is scheduled to end on March 1 of this year, so the  President is suggesting he does intend to, once again, extend the  emergency. That is why Congress needs to act on this resolution.   It is simple. Absent the President ceding these emergency powers, it  is incumbent on Congress to rein in the executive branch to ensure  these powers are not abused and that these authorities do not continue  in perpetuity.   America should be fully open. Our kids should be back in the  classroom. Our families should be back at work. Here in the House, we  are starting by removing this emergency declaration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency  Management.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, last year President  Biden acknowledged that the pandemic is over, as has been pointed out.   There is no compelling need for the President to continue exercising  the extraordinary authorities under the NEA. The Senate, on a  bipartisan basis, agreed in November, and here in the people's House I  think it is time that we do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this joint resolution, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
