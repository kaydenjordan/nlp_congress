 Mr. Speaker, a TSA agent along with his wife had to  sell plasma to make ends meet.   A Federal law enforcement employee just received an eviction notice  after trying to explain the shutdown to his apartment manager. In a few  days, he and his family will be kicked out of their apartment if they  do not receive a paycheck in time to pay their rent.   A counselor at a Federal prison is already working under stressful  conditions and not being paid. She and her coworkers wonder how they  can make their Federal student loan payments when they aren't getting  paychecks.   Members of the Coast Guard are working hard every day in dangerous  conditions to keep our coastal communities safe, not knowing how they  will pay their rent or other bills without their next paycheck.   Air traffic controllers work in a very complex field that requires  concentration and dedication to keep the skies safe, and they are  expected to do that without getting paid.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, I rise today because these Oregonians and hundreds of  thousands of people across the country like them are suffering as a  result of President Trump's government shutdown.   For 20 days, the President has held the American people hostage over  his campaign slogan to build a wall along the southern border, a wall  that he promised Mexico would pay for. In those 20 days, I have seen  firsthand how harmful this shutdown has been for Oregonians.   I have spoken with individuals from Astoria, Sheridan, Portland, and  beyond who are worried: How are they going to pay their rent? How are  they going to afford childcare or continue to pay their student loans  if their paycheck does not come through on Friday?   Missing even one paycheck can have catastrophic consequences. It is  far too high a cost for these dedicated Federal employees to pay for a  policy fight that they did not start and have no power to end. This is  unconscionable.   Hardworking Oregonians should not lose their homes or be forced to  sell plasma because the Federal Government is shut down, especially  when they are continuing to report to work and protect our country  without pay.   Since taking the majority last week, the House has taken swift action  to reopen the government. We have passed bipartisan bills to fund  government operations and pay workers who have been furloughed.   The American people have been held hostage long enough. It is past  time for the President to abandon his ill-conceived border wall and  reopen the Federal Government before more people are hurt.                            ____________________
