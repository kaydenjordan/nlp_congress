 Madam Speaker, America is a nation of laws, but in many  parts of our country, the rule of law is under attack. At a time when  the Nation should be reopening and healing, we see rising crime in many  cities across America. And where this rise of crime is most prevalent  is in cities that have decreased funding for its officers.   In 2020, we saw the highest number of murders in over 25 years. And  now in 2021, we have seen a spike in violent crime and attacks against  law enforcement officers. The Defund the Police movement has been the  catalyst behind this rise in crime and attacks on our law enforcement.  It has fueled hatred against our fellow citizens who risk their lives  to protect us from crime. And sadly, there are many progressive members  in this Chamber who have supported this dangerous movement.   The first step in addressing the increase in crime is not banning  guns from law-abiding citizens as proposed by the President. Rather, we  must reject the Defund the Police movement and ask those that support  it to recognize its disastrous impacts on our communities.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2795, the DHS Blue  Campaign Enhancement Act. As vice-ranking member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I know how important it is for us to approach  protecting this great Nation in a comprehensive manner by tackling all  types of threats, including: hackers, terrorists, violent criminals,  and human traffickers.   Criminal organizations use human trafficking to fund their operations  by defrauding, coercing, and exploiting both adults and children,  forcing them into labor and commercial sex acts. The DHS Blue Campaign  enables and empowers the DHS workforce and customer-facing industries  they work with--industries such as airlines--to recognize the  indicators of human trafficking and take the proper steps to alert  authorities.   H.R. 2795 enhances the Department's existing training opportunities  by developing internet-based training programs to train Federal, State,  local, Tribal law enforcement officers, and others as part of the  Department's Blue Campaign. This important piece of legislation also  established the Blue Campaign Advisory Board within the Department to  coordinate Blue Campaign efforts and work cohesively to combat human  trafficking.   Empowering State and local law enforcement to recognize potential  human trafficking is the first step in helping them assist these  victims, many of whom have been told that they have broken the law and  can't seek police assistance by their traffickers. H.R. 2795 does this  and helps disrupt these criminal networks, which is an important  component in dismantling criminals and the terrorists financing their  acts around the world.   I want to thank Representative Meijer for his leadership, and  Chairman Thompson for moving this legislation out of committee, and I  urge my colleagues to support this important bill to further secure the  homeland.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge  Members to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3138, the State and  Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2021.   I thank Chairwoman Clarke, Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member  Garbarino, and my other committee colleagues for their leadership on  H.R. 3138.   Over the past year, we have seen the devastating impact a ransomware  attack can have on our Nation's most critical infrastructure. But we  must not forget that no one is immune from cyber criminals, including  our State and local governments.   I am pleased today that the House is taking action to give our State  and local partners, and CISA, a leg up against these cyber criminals.   This bill will have a tremendous impact on the cybersecurity posture  of State and local governments by focusing important funding and  expertise on the front lines, the State and local levels.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 3138, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
