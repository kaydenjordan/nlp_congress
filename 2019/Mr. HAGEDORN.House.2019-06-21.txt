 Madam Speaker, today I rise to encourage the Speaker of  the House to give expeditious consideration of the United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement. There is progress on this agreement being  made. The country of Mexico, their senate just ratified it. Canada is  looking to move very quickly, and it is critically important that we do  the same.   Along those lines, 1,000 groups in this country: manufacturing,  agriculture, transportation, and processing groups have written us and  said: We need to get this deal done now.   In Minnesota, it is not just agriculture. It is machinery. It is  manufacturing. It is medicine, and people like my friends at the Farm  Bureau, AgriGrowth, poultry, dairy, pork; you name it, everybody wants  it done.   If we can get this Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement with the United  States done, we are going to build momentum for our deals with China,  Japan, South Korea, Colombia, and the European Union.   We should be dropping down the barriers, expanding our trade,  creating economic growth, creating high-wage jobs, and helping the  American people and our consumers.                            ____________________
