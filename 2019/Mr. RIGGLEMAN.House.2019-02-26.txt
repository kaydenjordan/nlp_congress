 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for Kannon Koser, a  constituent and friend of mine who is with his family in the gallery  this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, 3-year-old Kannon is one of 4 percent of children in the  United States who is born with a congenital anomaly--in his case,  hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.   Most health plans provide coverage for congenital anomalies, and many  States require insurers to provide coverage of any health services  related to congenital anomalies.   Despite this, health plans systematically and routinely deny claims  and appeals for any oral or dental related procedures under the  pretense that such service is merely cosmetic.   That is why Representative Collin Peterson and I have joined together  to introduce the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act, a bipartisan bill that  would directly address this issue and ensure that we don't have to tell  children like Kannon that their health condition isn't valued by  insurance companies.    As the original sponsor on the Republican side, I am proud to put my  name on this bill and ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support it.   ELSA would ensure all health plans cover medically necessary  services, including reconstructive surgeries that are a result of  congenital anomalies or birth defects.   If enacted, this life-changing bill will allow the Koser family the  opportunity to save for Kannon's college rather than spend money on  reconstructive surgery.   Commonsense reforms like this will help children like Kannon grow up  healthier and have a better quality of life.   Hi, Kannon. We will see you later, Buddy.
