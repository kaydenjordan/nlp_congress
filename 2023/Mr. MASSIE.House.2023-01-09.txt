 Mr. Speaker, last month we ended the vaccine mandate for  the military, but there are still many unscientific, illogical, and  unconstitutional mandates for vaccines in this country.   If you watched C-SPAN last week, you saw 434 of us in here screaming,  yelling, cheering, speaking--many of us unvaccinated. Most of us  probably not boosted.   Why do we have a double standard?   Why do we make visitors of this country get vaccinated just to visit  their friends and family?   Why are we separating families over this?   We need to end that mandate. We need to end the healthcare mandate.  We need to end all of the mandates, and we need to do this now.                            ____________________
