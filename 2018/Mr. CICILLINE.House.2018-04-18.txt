 Mr. Speaker, yesterday was tax day; and this year,  millions of working men and women filed their taxes knowing that  Republicans want them to bear the costs so corporate special interests  and the wealthiest Americans can get a gigantic tax cut.   Even worse, the new Republican tax law will raise the deficit by more  than $2 trillion, meaning Medicare and Social Security are now on the  chopping block according to Republican leaders.   This is not what we were elected to do. Working Americans deserve a  better deal. Working families deserve a real and permanent tax cut, not  the scam that they got.   It has been decades since we have asked the wealthiest Americans to  pay their fair share. No secretary, no janitor, and no mid-level  employee should have to pay a higher tax rate than the CEO of their  company. It is long past time to fix this broken system and pass the  Buffett rule.   Mr. Speaker, we should be promoting policies that give families the  tools not just to get by, but to get ahead, instead of further rigging  the system to benefit the billionaires, millionaires, and America's  biggest corporations.   It is time for real tax reform and to undo the tax scam that is going  to hurt so many in our country.                            ____________________
