 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I was disappointed last week when  President Trump vetoed the NDAA.   This will be the 60th year that we have had the NDAA. The NDAA is the  National Defense Authorization Act, and I have said so many times,  countless times--on the floor of the House and on the floor of the  Senate--that this is the most important bill that we have. Some people  don't agree with that, but I do.  [[Page S7962]]    That is what we are supposed to be doing here. We are supposed to be  defending America. And there is a lot to do. We are in the most  threatening situation that we have ever been in.   I sometimes look back and think of the good old days of the Cold War  when you had two superpowers out there. We knew what they had; they  knew what we had. Mutual assurance of destruction meant something at  that time. If you kill us, we kill you, and everyone is happy.   But that is living in the past. But anymore now, with the weaponry  that is out there, you can get one outside group that doesn't have any  resources at all, and they have the ability to wipe out another  country. So it is a real threat that we are up against.   I do chair the committee called the Senate Armed Services Committee,  and, of course, I have been very active in the National Defense  Authorization Act every year since--well, since 1987. It is a long  time.   So I am proud of the conference report that we had. The NDAA right  here--our vote in this Senate was 84 to 13. Wow. You can't find that  kind of togetherness in a cause anywhere else. But it puts members of  the families of the military first.   I share President Trump's frustration about section 230. I know that  it is a complicated thing. The majority of people in America don't know  what that is all about, but section 230 is something that has nothing  to do with the military--nothing at all.   The committee that I chair is the Armed Services Committee. That  would be found in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The  Judiciary Committee is chaired by Senator Lindsey Graham. He does a  great job of chairing that. That is where any kind of reform in section  230 should come from.   I agree that the President should have the authority to determine  troop levels. That is what we have in this bill. We have the President  making those decisions. That is why we made sure that the final NDAA  gave the President very broad authority in determining troop levels all  around, and we have looked at them in Western Europe and Eastern  Europe. We have looked at them in Ethiopia--in Afghanistan and other  places around the world.   So we look at what we have done, and I was going to mention--I have  been down here several times talking about the President and what he  has done and the great job that he has done for the United States. And  I am going to wind up with some comments on a card that I put together.  I put this card together back 2 years ago, talking about the top 10  Trump accomplishments. I think it is important that people remember  that. We have a lot of people down here forgetting about all the really  good things that have happened, so I am going to talk about that in a  minute.   But I am here today because we have to pass the NDAA. This would be  the 60th year in a row that we have the NDAA, and it is necessary to  have. It is the most important bill of the year. I have believed this  for a long time. You have heard me say it before.   I always stand with our troops. The military servicemembers and their  families will suffer if we don't enact it for the 60th year. If the  NDAA is not passed, more than 200,000 military families will see  smaller paychecks in January because the special pays and the bonuses  for hazard pay are all part of this bill.   Additionally, it would hurt the areas where the military is having  the most serious problem. In a way, it is kind of a mixed bag because  we have--prior to the pandemic coming along, and that was in about  March of this year--before that happened, we had the best economy, I  could argue, that we have had in my lifetime, and all these things were  very, very good. Then, of course, when that happened everything  changed.   Now, one of the problems you have when you have such a great economy  is that you have a lot of competition. We have to have a military  force. That military force has to have resources. They have to have the  ability to step in because we don't know where the next threat is going  to come from.   And with people with special abilities--now I am talking about  pilots, cyber experts, engineers, and doctors--that is where we have a  problem. We don't have enough of them--pilots. I have been an active  pilot now for longer than most Members here have been alive, and I know  that back during the previous administration, the Obama administration,  we had a real serious problem because we were not able to attract the  pilots at that time because that was when we had a President who--he  wasn't ashamed of it--his top priority was not defending America. He  had other priorities.    So, consequently, we went through a period the last 5 years--the last  5 years of his administration were the years 2010 through 2015, and  during that timeframe he reduced the funding for the military by 25  percent. At the same time he did that, China was increasing theirs in  that same timeframe by 83 percent. So we have China increasing their  military expenditures by 83 percent at the same time we are reducing  ours by 25 percent. So we had serious problems there.   One of the areas, when people are cutting the military, that they do  it where it won't be as noticeable is in the flying hours. So we had  pilots out there, but they weren't flying the hours that they needed to  fly to keep their proficiency up, and, consequently, a lot of them left  and went to the airlines and went other places because they were  wanting to be flying the hours. That is one of the problems that we had  during that time.   So we have the military's ability to recruit and retain  servicemembers who are in the shortest supply. As I mentioned, that  would be things like cyber experts and engineers and doctors, so they  have the skill sets that need to be done out there.   Of course, this President came along, and we started rebuilding the  military. I will always remember being at the White House during a time  that we were talking about what we were going to do with the military,  and he actually looked over at me, and he said: What do you think we  need to do with the military? I said: We are going to have to rebuild  the military. It is going to cost something like $750 billion before it  is over. He said: That is what we should do; we need to start with  that.   And this President, with his leadership, took us with a new priority  in defending America and building our military, and it happened.   So we have the things that will happen if we don't pass this thing-- the education of children for military families. There is a thing  called the impact aid. Impact aid comes about when you don't get the  tax base increase with the added enrollment into the schools of the  children of military families. So they have impact because they don't  pay the taxes.   So the impact aid is the amount of money that supplements that. It is  not just in my State of Oklahoma but throughout the country. It ensures  that children of military families receive a quality education by  supplementing the school districts, the budgets, where they are  required.   If the NDAA is not passed, military construction projects--I have one  in my State of Oklahoma that is one that would--let's see; where is  that? Yes, we have a thing where we have an ammunition depot, a  demolition shop, for one. This is something where we have gone through  a lot of BRAC rounds--that is Base Realignment and Closure  Commissions--and we have increased the size of our ammunition  demolition activities substantially. And we are doing most of it now  right there in Oklahoma. Well, this has a new demolition shop in there  so we can get rid of a lot of these things we were not able to get rid  of.   So we have military construction projects in 38 States, and one  happens to be in the State of Maine. It is very significant that they  be able to do these projects. If the military construction doesn't  happen, both an authorization and appropriation--people don't  understand this because it is kind of talked around, but in order for  something to get done, you have to have it authorized. That is what the  committee that I chair does--authorizes the military projects.   Then it has to be appropriated. The appropriators come along, and  they put the money in there. That is how this system works.   If the NDAA is not passed, the military won't be able to increase the  end strength--or the total number of troops in the military services-- where  [[Page S7963]]  that is needed to address the growing threats. End strength increases  don't happen without authorization. You can't appropriate it.   So if the NDAA should not be passed, the Pentagon loses the ability  to quickly and efficiently process security clearance investigations.  Right now there is a backlog because it takes a long time to do this,  but this has a streamlining provision in it that is going to make that  a lot easier so we will be able to get security clearances.   All these things are tied into this bill. The DOD, if we didn't pass  this thing, would lack the authority to pay the nonmilitary personnel  on hospital shifts. They are the ones who are doing the great job right  now with the COVID response.   That is just kind of a snapshot of what we are counting on to support  our troops in the field, the bare minimum we need. Without the NDAA, we  lose all of that and also lose all the other policies.   Right now, this bill makes China the primary strategic threat. I  think we all understand that. We have strategic threats from Russia and  China. Last year, we had the European part addressed. This year, the  bill that is pending right now that we are going to try to get passed  for this year--and I think we will successfully do that--is going to be  concentrating on the Pacific area; that is, China and the things that  China is doing that people don't--many people don't realize the threat  that is out there.   Right now we are up, as I understand it, to seven different areas  where the Chinese are actually building, creating islands in the South  China Sea. This is something that is different than has ever been done  before. I contend and have always contended it is illegal, but they are  still doing it. They are doing it, and that is the effort that they are  making there.   If you go into these islands where they are rebuilding, it is almost  as if China is preparing for World War III--all of it. This is what is  happening right now.   Right now we know about this SolarWinds hack, the hack that we are  facing. That is something where we have language to deal with that in  the Defense authorization bill.   The new ``hunt forward'' authority that allows our cyber operators to  do more work to find malicious actors proactively, this is something  that we need to get done for the defense of our country.   It implements the Cyber Solarium Commission and the recommendations.  There are 27 recommendations that they have in this commission. And it  establishes a new National Cyber Director.   These are things where it is a moving target. There are a lot of  things that we are doing now that we should have been doing before, and  it took China and Russia to kind of forge ahead of us, as they did in  the previous administration, to remind us that we have these very  serious problems. Our troops need the NDAA. It is our responsibility to  make sure that they have the equipment, training, and resources to  complete the mission and return home safely.    I will close with this one reminder. On December 29, 1777, 243 years  ago today, General George Washington wrote to the Continental Congress  imploring that they needed to provide the resources his troops needed.  He wrote:         I hope that the supplies they will be able to furnish in       aid of those, which Congress may immediately import       themselves, will be equal and competent to every demand. If       they do not, I fear--I am satisfied the Troops will never be       in a situation to answer the Public expectation and perform       the duties required of them.    That is as true today as it was in 1777. We have to do that.   We look at the national security wins of this President. I think  people don't talk about that as much. We have identified China as the  No. 1 adversary. That was in the NDS, the national defense survey. It  was put together by 12 of the real experts--6 Republicans, 6 Democrats.  It has been the blueprint for our military ever since that time, about  3 years ago. They identified China as the major threat.   There is $2.5 trillion to rebuild the military. That is what we were  able to get done. We increased the size of the military, replaced  obsolete equipment, and made new investments in future tech.  Hypersonics is a good example. Both Russia and China are ahead of us in  the area of hypersonics; it is the new ``state of the art.'' There is a  pay raise for the troops.   They took out the terrorist leaders. How many people remember  Baghdadi and Soleimani? They were the top terrorists in the world. They  are gone now. This President, this administration took care of that.   We established the Space Force. The Space Force was the first new  force that was established in many, many years. I wasn't really sold on  it at first because I thought we were doing a pretty good job. It  wasn't coordinated. You had different military units doing it, and they  weren't even really talking to each other. That is what we put  together. This President provided the leadership in doing that.   There is the widow's tax. Everybody remembers that. That was  something that had to be done. Others talked about it. This President  did it.   Then the ISIS caliphate was destroyed. There is the Abraham Accords.  They supported Israel through new security assistance. We know that is  going on today. All these things this President has done and has done a  great job.   I do want to mention this, and I think it is worthwhile, really,  because we know what won't happen if we don't pass this bill. We won't  get the bonuses necessary; I already mentioned that. The impact aid, I  mentioned that. Military construction project authorizations, we would  not have that. Full pay for DOD civilians, that has to be done. That  has been talked about by a lot of administrations but not really done.   I will finalize this by talking about China. Nothing in the bill  helps China any way at all. There is a group called the American  Enterprise Institute. That is a group that is kind of the conservative  conscience that evaluates programs that come along. They said: ``This  bill has the most substantial and consequential China-related  provisions since the 2000 NDAA.'' They are talking about this bill and  what it does for China. It establishes the Pacific Deterrence. We  talked about the European Deterrence last year in the NDAA bill. This  is the Pacific Deterrence. That is China we are talking about. It  shifts the supply chains away from China in semiconductors, circuit  boards, and pharmaceuticals, and it stimulates the economy in those  ways. It brings Chinese malign national security activities into light  so we know what they are doing--who the good guys are, who the bad guys  are.   This supports Taiwan. We have talked about that for a long period of  time. This bill accelerates that program.   It prevents Chinese intellectual property theft.   I have a whole list here.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list be inserted  after my comments.   What I would like to wind up with, if I brought it--I did. Two years  ago, I put this card together. This is when I realized the media hates  Trump. People are not aware of all the good things he did in those  first couple of years. People were not aware of it.   First of all, on the card--I am going to run over these. Biggest tax  cuts. We learned a lesson back there during a Democratic  administration. John Kennedy said the best way to get more revenue in  for the Great Society programs that they were advocating at that time  was to reduce marginal rates and that would increase revenue. It did.  Unfortunately, John Kennedy died before he could reap the benefits that  came with that, but it worked. Of course, others followed him,  including Presidents Clinton, President Bush, and others, by reducing  the rates. That also increased the revenue.   What this President did that was different than the rest of them is  that he did not just decrease the rates--the tax rates--but he also  decreased all the overregulation.   How many people know that, back during the Obama administration, we  had a rule that we were adhering to that said if you were a domestic  oil and gas producer in the United States of America and you were in  competition with China or somebody else, you had to give them our whole  playbook on how we put together our system over here and all the  elements. And that put us at a disadvantage with our competitors in  China and in energy.  [[Page S7964]]    I was happy that I used to say, after Obama got out of office, that  the war on fossil fuels was over for a while. Look at the energy  dominance now. We are the global leader in oil and gas production: a  277-percent growth in crude exports, a 132-percent increase in coal  exports, a 52-percent increase in natural gas exports. These are  exports. That is what we are doing now in the United States as a result  of the efforts of this President and bringing our economy around.   Crackdown on illegal migration. Nobody wanted the wall, they said.  Now people realize that is where a lot of the bad people were getting  in.   We moved the Embassy. Every Democrat and Republican President, in my  memory, tried to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. They all  talked about it. This President went in and did it.   He enacted the infrastructure bill, the WRDA bill, or the Water  Resources Development Act, and the FAA reauthorization.   And on the judges we have, not just Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, but I  think our number is up to about 225 new judges.   He repealed the overregulation of the Dodd-Frank rules. Anyone in  business will tell you that that was one of the major accomplishments  of this President, President Trump--and the record employment.   But then I would say that the 10th and last one I mention to everyone  who will listen is what he did for the military. We went from the time  of dropping down in the last 5 years of the Obama administration by 25  percent, while China was increasing 83 percent. Now we have rebuilt  that military. That is why the NDAA is so significant right now and to  make sure that that gets passed and that we are able to have that. That  is what this vote is all about.   The NDAA, or National Defense Authorization Act, is the most  important bill of the year. That is why we are doing it, and that is  why we are here today during this holiday season   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY WINS         Identified China as #1 adversary in 2018 NDS; $2.5 trillion       to rebuild military; Increased size of military; Replaced       obsolete equipment; New investments in future tech--      hypersonics, AI, cyber; 3.1% pay raise--biggest in a decade;       Took out terrorist leaders (Baghdadi, Soleimani); Established       Space Force; Eliminated widow's tax; Destroyed ISIS       caliphate; Historic Abahram Accords; Supported Israel through       new security assistance; Withdrew from Iran deal; Withdrew       from INF Treaty; Maximized arms sales; Improved military       spouse employment; Rescued 55 hostages in 24 countries;       Secured $130 billion in new NATO spending, growing to $400       billion by 2024.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
