 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of  Reverend Billy Graham, America's Pastor, who passed away on February  21, 2018 to return home to his Lord and Savior. As a nation, we mourn  the passing of Billy Graham, and send our deepest condolences to the  Graham family. Billy Graham preached the Gospel, and his influence can  hardly be quantified. His ministry career and crusades inspired and  motivated millions, and carried out his mission to save souls around  the world.   Early in his career, Reverend Graham served the Midwest as a pastor  in Western Springs, Illinois. He attended Wheaton College and in 1981,  they opened a center in his honor. During his time in Illinois, Graham  took on a radio ministry program based in Chicago and expanded his  activism. From there, he began to completely transform American  religious life through his compelling sermons and preaching. Billy  Graham went on to serve across the country, in many ways and on many  platforms. He provided spiritual counsel to every President of the  United States from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, and was a strong  figure in the civil rights movement urging for integration.   Mr. Speaker, Billy Graham was a humble servant to the Lord who  changed countless lives for the better. His was a life well lived. And  I know his legacy will live on forever. Today, let us look up in the  sky and give thanks to our faithful, steadfast friend who is finally at  home with God and resting in eternal peace.                            ____________________
