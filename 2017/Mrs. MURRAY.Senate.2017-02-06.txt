 Madam President, over the last few weeks, people across  the country have continued to make their voices heard in opposition to  the nomination of Betsy DeVos--moms and dads, grandmothers and  grandfathers, students young and old, and cities, towns, urban,  suburban, and rural communities. People are standing up and they will  not be silenced. Thousands upon thousands have joined protests in their  communities. Hundreds of thousands have emailed or called their  Senators, jamming our phone lines, swamping the voicemail system, and  shattering records. Millions have engaged on social media, sharing  information with their friends, signing petitions, and pressuring their  elected officials.   It has made a difference. Every single Democrat will be standing with  their constituents and opposing Betsy DeVos. Just last week, two  Republicans announced their opposition as well. I can tell you I know  for a fact there are other Republicans who are feeling the heat and  could come around.   This nomination is dead even right now, on the razor's edge. Fifty  Senators, Democrats and Republicans will vote to reject Betsy DeVos. We  need just one more Republican to join us, to stand on the side of  students, parents, and public education in America and say no to Betsy  DeVos.   I come to the floor to kick off the final day of debate on this  nomination. On Friday, I spoke at length, making my case for why the  Senate should oppose Betsy DeVos. Democrats will hold the floor for the  next 24 hours, until the final vote, to do everything we can to  persuade just one more Republican to join us.   I strongly encourage people across the country to join us. Double  down on your advocacy, keep making your voices heard for these last 24  hours.   Over the past 3 weeks, I have heard a number of Republicans wonder  why Democrats and so many parents and teachers across the country were  so focused on this nomination in this moment. President Trump has done  so much in these first few weeks, and so many of his people he has  nominated to run critical agencies have not been people I can support,  but what is it about Betsy DeVos that has inspired so much grassroots  energy and opposition across this country?   I think I understand. It is very clear to me. For the vast majority  of people across the country, public education isn't just another  issue, it is different. For those of us who owe everything we have to  the strong public education we received, for those who saw our children  and grandchildren move through our public schools, for those of us who  walked into a public classroom ourselves to teach or have friends or  family who have dedicated their lives to teaching, for those of us who  see the role strong public schools play in our communities, especially  our rural communities, often offering an educational and a community  resource where it simply wouldn't otherwise be offered, we believe that  a commitment to strong public schools is part of America's core, the  idea that every student in every community should have the  opportunities that strong public schools offer. This is a notion that  is embedded in our values. It is who we are. It is in our blood.   For those people across the country who feel that way, who believe  those things, the nomination of Betsy DeVos truly hits close to home.  It was a slap in the face because she doesn't approach this the way  most of us do. She doesn't cherish public education. She doesn't value  it. She is someone who has dedicated her career and her inherited  fortune to privatizing public schools, to tearing down public  education, to defunding it in order to push more taxpayer dollars into  private schools and for-profit charters. She has called public  education ``a dead end.'' Where she sits from a distance, she has  called it ``an embarrassment.'' She has disparaged those who work in  our public schools, saying our best and our brightest ``steer clear.''  She has said education is ``an industry.''   An industry? Well, for someone such as she, a billionaire, rightwing  activist who spent her career and inherited fortune buying and selling  companies, she just doesn't understand an ``industry'' that isn't  focused on profits and that doesn't exist in the free market. When  people across the country hear someone such as Betsy DeVos say these  things about public education, when they hear a rightwing conservative  billionaire more focused on her antigovernment ideology than helping  our students, when they see that someone who spent her career trying to  destroy public schools has been nominated to lead the Federal Agency  dedicated to public education, they start to pay some attention.   In a Senate hearing, when they see that person so clearly lack any of  the issues, when they see her unable to explain basic concepts in  education policy, unwilling to make basic commitments to not  privatizing or defunding our public schools, confused about the need  for Federal protections for students with disabilities and so committed  to a rightwing agenda that she pointed to the need for guns in our  schools to protect against ``potential grizzly bears'' in response to a  question from a Senator representing the Newtown families, people  across the country pay even more attention, and they start to make  their voices heard.   I am not surprised that opposition to Betsy DeVos has caught fire  across the country. I am not surprised people are talking about it to  their friends, writing letters to the Senators, and showing up to  protest when they have never done anything like that before because  this is about their kids, their schools, and their communities. It is  about the core idea that we are a nation that invests in strong public  education and one that strives to guarantee the promise and opportunity  it affords to every student in our country--not that public education  is perfect, of course not. We have a lot of work to do, but that work  should be directed toward strengthening public schools, not tearing  them down. Public education is something that should be valued as an  important piece of the fabric of this Nation and the expansion of our  middle class, not scorned and ridiculed by billionaires who never had  any use for it themselves.   Friday I spent a lot of time on the floor laying out my case in  detail opposing Betsy DeVos. I talked about the open questions that are  remaining regarding her tangled finances and potential conflicts of  interest. I ran through the strong concerns with her record, her lack  of experience, and her lack of clear understanding of basic education  issues. I discussed my strong belief that her vision for education in  America is deeply at odds with where parents, students, and families  across our country want to go. I went through the process of how  Republicans jammed this nominee through our committee, cutting corners  and doing everything possible to protect her from scrutiny. I will not  go through all of that again now, but I do want to make one more point,  one I hope will be compelling to my Republican friends who are still  resisting pressure from their constituents and sticking with Betsy  DeVos; that is, no matter what you think about Betsy DeVos's policy  ideas, no matter what you think of her qualifications to run this  agency, no matter  [[Page S688]]  what you think about her personal understanding of the issues or her  financial entanglements, one thing is very clear; if she is confirmed,  she would enter this job as the most controversial and embattled  Secretary in the history of this Department. She would start this job  with no credibility inside the agency she is supposed to lead, with no  influence in Congress, as the punch line in late-night comedy shows,  and without the confidence of the American people.   A vote for Betsy DeVos is a vote for a Secretary of Education who is  likely to succeed only in further dividing us on education issues and  who may try to take steps to try to implement her anti-student agenda  but would do so with people across the country. So many of us in the  Senate are on guard and ready to fight back.   I urge my Republican friends--and we just need one more--let's cut  this off right now. Let's ask President Trump to send us someone who is  qualified, who understands the issues, and who truly cares about public  education. Together, let's stand with our constituents and say no to  Betsy DeVos.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the course of this debate, over the  last 9 hours, plus 6 hours on Friday of the 30 hours that we have on  this, many Senators have come to the floor to talk about their concerns  about the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education.   There are open questions about her extensive financial entanglements.  There are open questions and a clear concern about her lack of  understanding of basic education issues. We have heard that time and  again, as well as the many ways in which her vision for our education  system is really at odds with where families and communities nationwide  want us to go.   But let me take just a moment to focus on one major concern in  particular. It is a public health threat that I know is deeply  concerning for families and communities across this country, and that  is the epidemic of sexual violence on our college campuses. One out of  five women and 1 out of 71 men are sexually assaulted while in college.  In 2013 alone, college campuses reported 5,000 forcible sex offenses,  and a recent study indicated that number could be much greater.   There should be no question that sexual violence on our campuses is a  great, widespread, and unacceptable problem--one that I expect any  incoming Secretary of Education to be informed about, to be concerned  about, and committed unequivocally to confronting head-on.   Much of the discussion so far has been about the commitment of a  Secretary of Education to our K-12 system. Serious concerns have been  raised, but it is important to know in this debate that the Secretary  of Education also has responsibility over our higher education  institutions.   In our hearing, Betsy DeVos actually agreed with me that President  Trump's horrifically offensive leaked comments from 2005 describe  sexual assault. She was clear. But I was deeply disappointed, to say  the least, in Mrs. DeVos's responses to simple questions about whether  she would seek to continue the Obama administration's work to protect  students and stand with survivors. When she was asked whether she would  uphold the guidance issued under the Obama administration to hold  schools accountable for stronger, more effective investigations of  sexual assault, she wouldn't commit to that. She would not commit to  that. When I asked her whether she would continue key transparency  measures, like weekly public reports on active investigations into  potentially mishandled sexual assault cases, she dodged the question.    These answers are especially concerning given that Mrs. DeVos has  gone so far as to donate to an organization dedicated to rolling back  efforts to better support survivors and increase accountability. Let me  tell you that again. Mrs. DeVos has gone so far as to donate to an  organization dedicated to rolling back efforts to better support  survivors and increased accountability.   Let's be clear. The epidemic of sexual assaults on our college  campuses means that in States across the country, students' basic human  rights are being violated. I am deeply proud to see the work that has  been done on this issue over the last few years. Survivors have bravely  stepped up to make clear they expect far better from their schools and  their communities. By speaking out, by being courageous and speaking  out, they have shown other survivors they are not alone.   Key university leaders have made fighting campus sexual assault a top  priority by developing new partnerships in their communities and  prioritizing prevention. New measures to increase transparency and  awareness went into effect in 2013 thanks to the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act. These are hard-won steps forward on an  issue where some Democrats and Republicans have finally been able to  find common ground.   There is much more to do. The next Department of Education should not  be standing on the sidelines, much less taking us backward on an issue  that is so critical to student safety on campus.  [[Page S727]]    So I hope that as my colleagues are listening to the debate here  today, tonight, and tomorrow, that they consider what Mrs. DeVos's  leadership at the Department of Education means on this issue, the  issue of making sure men and women on our college campuses can go there  to learn and not be worried about being a victim of sexual assault and  having nowhere to turn and not have the confidence that their voices  will be taken seriously.   On another area, nominees for Secretary of Education have largely  been people, over the past, who were very committed to our students,  who had long careers dedicated to education, and who were focused on  keeping public education strong for all of our students and for all of  our communities.   Public education is a core principle that our country was founded on,  that no matter who you are, where you come from, or how much money you  have, this country is going to make sure all young people get an  education. That is how our country has been strong in the past. That is  how our country has to be in the future. Free public education.   Well, Betsy DeVos is a very different nominee. She has spent her  career and her fortune rigging the system to privatize and defund  public education, which will hurt students in communities across our  country. She is not personally connected to public school--except, by  the way, through her work over the years trying to tear them down. She  has committed herself for decades to an extreme ideological goal to  push students out of our public schools and weaken public education.   I can talk at length about Betsy DeVos's record of failure and her  devastating impact on students, but all people really need to do is  watch her hearing in our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee. Just go back and watch the hearing. This was a hearing that  people across the country heard about--and for good reason--from local  newspapers, to local news, to ``The Daily Show,'' to ``The View,'' and  posts that went viral on social media. A lot of people in our country  heard Betsy DeVos for the first time in that hearing. They were not  impressed.   She refused to rule out slashing investments in our public schools.  She was confused that Federal law provides protections for students  with disabilities. She did not understand the basic issues in education  policy or the debate surrounding whether students should be measured  based on their proficiency or their growth. She argued, as we have all  heard, that guns needed to be allowed in schools across the country to  ``protect from grizzlies.'' Even though she was willing to say that  President Trumps's behavior toward women should be considered sexual  assault, as I just talked about, she would not commit to actually  enforcing Federal law protecting women and girls in our schools. Her  hearing, quite frankly, was a disaster. It was so clear to millions of  families how little she really understood about education issues.   I have to tell you, as a former preschool teacher myself and a former  school board member, someone who got my start in politics fighting for  strong public schools, as a Senator committed to standing strong for  public education in America, as a mother and a grandmother who really  cares deeply about the future of our students and our schools, I know  that we can and we must do better for our children and our students and  our parents and our teachers.   The decision we are making here on whether to confirm Betsy DeVos for  Education Secretary will help set the course for our public education  system for years to come. So I hope, again, that our colleagues are  listening to this debate and thinking about it and not just voting  rotely on this. This is so important.   Quite frankly, I am disappointed that our Republican colleagues have  moved us so fast into this debate. I have been in the Senate a long  time. I know what the usual practices are when we go through hearings  and listen to nominees from Presidents who are Republican and Democrat,  Republican majorities and Democratic majorities. I was here when the  Senate was 50-50. There are practices we have to make sure that all  Senators get the information they need so they can make a wise decision  with their vote for which they will be held accountable.   Quite frankly, the usual practices here were really being ignored.  The right thing to do was being ignored. This nominee was jammed  through like I have seen none other. Corners were being cut. The  minority was being brushed aside. I really think that is wrong.   Earlier this month, Republicans on the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee scheduled Mrs. DeVos's hearing even though she had  not yet finished her standard ethics paperwork and even though she had  not and still, by the way, has not answered my questions about her  financial disclosures to our committee. In fact, when we started the  hearing, the Republican chairman, the senior Senator from Tennessee,  whom I have worked with greatly--we worked together to pass the  replacement of No Child Left Behind. I have a tremendous amount of  respect for him. But I was shocked and surprised when he preemptively  declared that he would be limiting questions for each Senator to just 5  minutes--a shocking and disappointing breach of committee tradition,  clearly intended to limit public scrutiny.   Mrs. DeVos is a billionaire. She has extraordinarily complicated and  opaque finances, both in her own holdings and those in her immediate  family. We know that she has invested in education companies, for- profit companies, for decades. Over 100 conflicts were identified. Her  ethics paperwork raises questions about the company in which she plans  to remain invested. She still, by the way, has not fully answered my  questions about her committee paperwork.   As I told the Republican chairman at our markup, the process that has  taken place on Mrs. DeVos's nomination is a massive break in the  tradition of this body. We should not have had a vote in this committee  until all Senators had received appropriate responses to reasonable  questions and until a second hearing was held so that Senators could  get these serious concerns addressed and do their job scrutinizing the  nominee.   Understand, we had a hearing. We were limited to 5 minutes each. And  we did not have all of the paperwork, so we could not do our homework  to make sure we were asking the questions we needed that needed to have  a public debate. So, again, that is another reason I am deeply  concerned about this nominee. We do not yet know whether there are  conflicts of interest.   For a Secretary of Education who wields tremendous power over our K- 12 system and our higher education system--as we all know, there have  been tremendous questions over the past decade about access to higher  education; whether you go to college and get the degree you have been  promised; whether institutes have been responsible and accountable; and  how we as the Senate and House can come together to make sure that when  a student takes out a student loan or invests in a higher education  institution, they know they are getting their money's worth and if  there are taxpayer dollars involved, that the taxpayers are getting  their money's worth as well. So conflicts of interest are extremely  important to this nominee. To this point right now, here we are voting  tomorrow, and we don't have the answers to those questions.   So these are just a few things. I have been out here on the floor to  talk about them. We have heard from many of our other colleagues. It is  no surprise to me that this has lit a firestorm across the country.  Having a Secretary of Education, someone who is responsible for our  children's education--schools are the center of our community.  Community members own those schools in their minds. This is where they  send their kids to school, where they have basketball games, music  concerts. It is where the community comes together. Yes, we all  complain about public education. Who hasn't? But at the end of day, we  love our local schools, and we want them to know that the Secretary of  Education--the highest person in the land to oversee them--has that  love, too, and is there because they want to make them better, not  because they want to tear them down.   So, yes, this nominee has taken off like no other because of her  hearing, because of her conflicts, because she has attacked and gone  after basic public education, which so many people  [[Page S728]]  are proud of in their own communities and want to make better. So I,  like everybody else, have heard from many of my constituents, more than  I can ever remember in my entire Senate career. This has ignited a  public storm. I want to share some stories from my constituents who  have reached out and urged me to vote against Betsy DeVos because they  know better than anybody why their school is so important to them, why  their teachers are so important to them, why their children's public  education is so important to them.   One of the major concerns I have continued to hear from my  constituents about is her disconnect from the working class.   A woman from Marysville, WA, said: Betsy DeVos, a billionaire  herself, does not represent the working class and certainly not her  family experience with public education.   Betsy DeVos never attended public school or even sent her own  children to public school.   In Olympia in my State, an employee at a high-poverty public school  says she works with some of the most in-need children in the area. She  is very concerned that Betsy DeVos's push toward a privatized public  school system would only benefit those in wealthy communities and leave  her most vulnerable students behind. She believes Betsy DeVos would  absolutely not look out for their best interests.   In our rural communities, there is no private school to get that  voucher and send your kids to. The policies she is pushing only mean  that those schools will have taxpayer dollars taken away from them to  send to other kids with vouchers to go to private schools, who live  nearby or have the additional resources to use those vouchers to go to  school.   A teacher in Seattle wrote to me with a story that I can't get out of  my head. It really inspires me to keep going in this fight. This  teacher serves preschoolers with special needs who face a number of  challenges. She teaches at a title I school, where most families are  low income, and many of them are immigrants and non-native English  speakers.   She believes that her children deserve access to the best educators  out there and that if DeVos's agenda was put in place--a system of  privatized public education--her students would be failed, because  without strong public schools, we would fail students who are low  income or living with disabilities or impacted by trauma or who belong  to racial or ethnic minorities. She says Betsy DeVos does not have her  students' best interests in mind, and her students deserve the best, as  I believe all of our students do, no matter their financial status,  their race, their religion, or any other difference they might have  from their peers.    A mother in North Bend wrote to me expressing her worry that vouchers  only benefit the wealthy, leaving the middle class and poor without the  benefit of a good education. Being part of a middle-class family  herself, she is proud that her first grader is already mastering  addition and subtraction and is reading and writing sentences all  because of her local public school.   My constituent in Auburn said that money and ZIP Code should not  determine who gets a better education, and she said that Betsy DeVos's  worrisome policies would make that the case. She is strongly urging me  to reject a nominee who doesn't look out for those who are the most in  need.   A man in Kelso wrote in, saying that the public school system is what  ensures we all get a good education. It is what gives so many parents  hope that their child can have an even better life than they had, that  public education is a great equalizer for everyone to have a chance to  succeed, and I couldn't agree more.   Those are just a few of the letters I have gotten from people who are  worried that the nominee's push for taking public tax dollars and using  them for private schools and for-profit schools only, robbing our  public schools of the resources they need, will not be the right choice  for public education.   I wanted to share a few other letters from my constituents who wrote  to me regarding Betsy DeVos's nomination. One of them was from Seattle.  She emphasized how important it is that our Secretary of Education be  dedicated to providing a quality education to all students and to  strengthening our public education institutions. She strongly believes  that Betsy DeVos will not be that kind of Secretary.   A retired teacher in Federal Way asked me to work as hard as I can to  protect public education because she believes every child's right to a  free and quality public education is at risk with Betsy DeVos's  nomination.   Many constituents expressed their disbelief that the nominee for  Secretary of Education has absolutely no experience in public  education. Her children never even attended a public school.   One, a teacher in Bellingham, is fearful of an Education Secretary  who doesn't truly understand what the needs of kids look like today.  She asked how someone with no experience can be expected to lead our  country's education system.   A woman in Puyallup wrote to me, saying that education is the  greatest gift we can give to our children, and she thinks that  confirming Betsy DeVos, with her plans to weaken public education, will  rob so many children of that gift.   Mr. President, those are just a few of the letters I am getting.  There are many more, and later this evening, I will be reading from  some of those letters because they tell the story better than I do.   I know some of our colleagues are wondering why this woman set off  such a firestorm when her nomination came up and why so many people are  calling and writing and rallying and letting their voices be heard.   It is not easy to rally the public. This came from within. This came  from many people in this country who understand, as so many of us do,  that public education and the right to an education, free--free  education is critical and fundamental and a core philosophy of this  country that all of us want to be successful and want to be great  again.   To have a Secretary of Education who doesn't agree with that, who in  fact promotes the exact opposite, who has said that our public  education system is a dead end, who has proposed, promoted, and paid  for campaigns to take public tax dollars to send to private, for-profit  schools, that is not what our country was built on. It is not the  foundation that our forefathers put out in front of us.   They said: We are going to build a system unlike any other, where no  matter who you are or where you come from or how much money you have or  what you look like, in this country, we are going to make sure you get  an education, a free education, paid for by all of us, to go to school  in your community and to be who you want to be. That is a dream of this  country, and we will not stand by and give our votes to a Secretary of  Education who does not share that philosophy.   That is why there is a firestorm. That is why parents and teachers  and students and grandparents and community leaders and superintendents  from across the country are writing us and asking us to vote no. It is  not too late. If we have one more Republican who votes no, then we will  be able to say to the President: Mr. President, we reject this nominee,  and we ask that you send us one who will work with all of us to make  sure our public education system is a core principle of this country,  is valued by this country, and is pursued by the top person in the  Department of Education, our Secretary of Education. It is not too  late.   With that, I have many more letters that I will be reading later. I  know some of our other colleagues will be over here. Again, I ask  everyone to stop and think. This is a critical nomination. It has hit a  chord in our country because people do care. They want our country to  be strong. They want this country to be great, and they know our public  education system is an absolutely critical part of that.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New  Jersey, who has given us such a compelling reason to remind all of us  why we are here at almost midnight and why we all intend to keep  talking and keep working and keep trying to convince one more Senator  to say no to this nominee. He reminds us of the basic principle in this  country that our forefathers dreamed of and that they put into our  Constitution and that we have fought for, which is that every child  should have dignity and every child should have a public education.  That is why it is so important that we have someone who leads this  agency who shares that conviction. I really want to thank Senator  Booker for his tremendous words tonight.   As the ranking member on this committee, who has been here throughout  the Friday debate and through the 12 hours of debate we have had  tonight and we will continue to have up until the vote tomorrow, I have  had the opportunity to hear many Senators speak passionately. Senator  Tester was here on Friday. He is from a very rural State, and he was  speaking about how important it is to not have funds robbed away from  the public education systems in those small little school districts to  go to students with vouchers for private schools that don't exist in  those rural communities. He talked about the importance of our public  schools and our public school institutions in a slightly different way  than the Senator from New Jersey did. He talked about how, when his  grandparents settled in Montana, instead of being ranchers like those  before them, they were wheat farmers. There were cattlemen and wheat  farmers who were fighting and at odds with each other in the community,  and where they came together was in their schools, because both  cattlemen's kids and ranchers' kids were in the same school, and they  played basketball together, and it healed the wounds of that community.  [[Page S740]]    The Senator from New Jersey just talked about the Office of Civil  Rights and why it is so important--that no matter what we look like or  what this country stands for, this country says you have a right to an  education. It is in our public schools where kids from all strata and  all economic lives, with different backgrounds and different colors and  different religions and different thoughts come together and heal our  communities.   That is what is at risk with this nominee, and that is why so many  Senators on our side have said: To one more Republican Senator, send  this nomination back to the President who campaigned saying: Let's heal  this Nation; let's bring people together; send us a nominee who  actually does that.   Again, I want to thank the Senator from New Jersey and all of the  Senators who have been here to speak about how important it is to have  a public education.   I wouldn't be in the Senate tonight without a public education. I  come from a family of nine, and my father, who was a World War II  veteran, got sick when I was in junior high. He was diagnosed with  multiple sclerosis. My mom had been at home taking care of seven kids.  She didn't have a job. She didn't have skills. We didn't know what was  going to happen to us. But we had a public education system that was  there for us. Our country was there for us with a public education  system--not with a voucher that said you can go to a private school  that we couldn't afford even with it or to be able to get one, but a  public education school in our community that gave the education to  each one of those kids in my family--all seven of us. Then it allowed  us to go on to college with Pell grants and student loans, because our  government was there for us, even though my dad was sick and my mom had  to stay home and take care of him. We had food stamps for a while, and  it was tough, but we made it because this country had a commitment to  public education for every student, no matter where you lived or where  you came from or what challenges you had at home.   That is why I am here in the Senate, and that is why many of us are  here in the Senate. It is why this nominee has sparked such an interest  across this country. Like many Senators--I think, like all Senators--my  office has been inundated with mail and phone calls and emails and  rallies and people saying: Please, stop this nominee, and send us  someone who can actually work for all of us, because education is a  critical piece for each one of us. It is across the country.   I want to share some of the letters that I have received about this  nominee. I have received 48,000 pieces of mail opposed to Mrs. DeVos;  the number of pro-DeVos emails and letters is in the teens. I have  48,000 pieces, and they are all personal. These aren't rote emails and  letters; these are personal pleas. Why and how? Because these people  saw this nominee at this hearing, and their expectations for our  education system in this country are high. They want someone leading  the Department of Education who knows the issues, who believes in  public education. They were appalled at what they heard, and they said  no.   Mrs. Mary Ann Whittaker, a woman from Longview, WA, a small rural  community:         Dear Senator Murray,        As an educator of 30 years and a mother who has helped to       raise and educate five children, I was shocked and dismayed       by the lack of knowledge and depth of understanding that Ms.       DeVos has about education. Our education system needs a       leader who can be a true leader in this arena, with the       background and backbone to do what is in the best interest of       the children of this great country--please do everything in       your power to make sure this woman is not allowed to gain       this position. Thank you--on behalf of thousands of children       and educators in the state of Washington!!    I heard from Joel Puchtler of Seattle, WA. He said:         Please do everything in your power to stop DeVos from       becoming Secretary of Education. She is transparently       incompetent, and will be destructive to the nation's       education system through both intent and ineptitude. Demand a       competent appointee from the president-elect.        I am an educator. My wife is an educator. My grandfather       was the first Commissioner of Education (so called at the       time) under the Johnson administration. He would be thrilled       to see a competent woman in this appointment, but       categorically horrified at the possibility of DeVos, just as       I am.    These are the kinds of reactions I am hearing from my constituents.  Why? Because we had this nominee come before our committee. We were  allowed 5 minutes each to ask her questions. She has a very complex  financial background. We were not allowed to look at those financial  background papers before we had a chance to talk to her, so we only had  some information. The only thing we could do was ask her questions  about what she believed in. Her answers were astounding, and many  people saw them, whether it was about IDEA and the ability of children  with disabilities in this country to get an education, whether it was  about policy debates we are having on education, or what she saw as her  drive and her ambition. People in this country want someone who feels  passionate about public education, not someone who has used her vast  amounts of wealth and her experience to go after what she calls an  education system that is incompetent and, in her opinion, needs to go  away. Her drive has been to take the funds out of public education and  go for private, for-profit education.   I can understand that a woman who is a billionaire with a lot of  money invested in companies wanting companies to succeed, but our  public education system is not a company. Our public education system  is something that is derived from the communities that it is in, from  the teachers who are there, from the parents who participate as school  board members and teacher volunteers. It is the driving passion of our  communities. It is not something people want ripped away, torn apart,  or degraded. That is why this nominee has touched a nerve across the  country.   I heard from Mrs. Rebecca Blankenship. She lives in Gig Harbor. She  said:         Dear Senator Murray,        I am writing to urge you to oppose the nomination of Betsy       DeVos as the Secretary of Education. As a certified teacher       who has taught for many years in Public schools and as a       parent of two young girls in the Peninsula School District, I       find DeVos to be completely unqualified for the position as       she has no public school experience, has actively funneled       money away from schools in need and lacks the fundamental       educational background to make decisions that impact millions       of students.        There is no issue more important to me than our education       system.    I heard from Ms. Carol Pelander, a former teacher, from Tacoma, WA:         As a retired public school teacher, who continues to work       part-time training new teachers, I am extremely concerned       about the potential damage that will be done to public       education if Betsy DeVos is confirmed as the Secretary of       Education. Our mission as educators includes teaching our       kids how to live and work together effectively in a diverse       community, and the proposals brought to the table by Ms.       DeVos to privatize education will further divide us as a       community and significantly reduce our already limited       resources. She is not qualified for this important leadership       position.    I have been in the Senate for a long time. I have gotten a lot of  emails, a lot of phone calls, talked to a lot of constituents, and been  to a lot of community meetings. These thousands of letters that we are  getting are not form letters. These are letters of people telling  stories. They are passionate about their public schools. They have  spoken louder about this nominee than any other, saying: This is not  what I want for my country.   I have heard from many people in our rural communities who are so  concerned about privatizing our public education system because they  don't have a private school to send their kids to, even if the voucher  that she espouses were enough to put them into one.   I grew up in a rural community. I grew up in the small town of  Bothell. Coming in to town, I remember the sign that said 998 people,  and I remember the day it said that 1,000 people lived in Bothell. Our  schools were the heart and soul of our community. It is where your met  your neighbors. It is where you sent your kids to play basketball.  Everybody showed up for the football games and the music concerts. It  was our community. We loved it, and we owned it. Did we say it was  perfect? Did my parents say it was perfect? No. But it was the heart  and soul of that community, and they did not want to lose it, just as  so many other parents in this country want a Secretary of  [[Page S741]]  Education who wants all kids to have a good education.   I have so many letters here. I have one from Adam Brickett, from  McClure Middle School in Seattle. He says:         Thank you for your years of service representing our state.       I have never contacted an elected official before--    By the way, many of my letters start with that.         I have never contacted an elected official before but with       the changes happening in our country I feel the need to now.       I'm writing specifically to you today about the nominee for       Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos.        As a middle school teacher for Seattle Public Schools I       work hard every day to ensure that my students get the best       education possible to be successful in their future careers       and lives. I am concerned that Ms. DeVos does not have the       experience necessary nor the best intentions for our nation's       students and schools to be our Secretary of Education. I       believe she would put profits and money ahead of students,       schools and teachers. I felt this way before her nomination       hearing and feel even more strongly after her hearing. I am       worried about the damage she could do to an already fragile       public education system. I know I am not alone as virtually       all the colleagues I have spoken with have expressed similar       dismay with her nomination.        Her record of attacking public schools and funneling money       to charter and parochial schools with little to no oversight       is troubling. Her lack of experience whatsoever with public       education is also very disturbing. Not only has she never       been an educator or administrator but she has never even       attended or enrolled her children in public education.        A high quality, public education is one of the most       powerful tools a society has. Please don't allow someone with       no experience and who is fundamentally against public       education to become the person in charge of it. I       respectfully ask you and your colleagues in the senate to do       what is right by our nation's students and reject Ms. DeVos       as Secretary of Education.        Thank you again for your tireless service to the residents       of Washington.    I have 48,000 letters. My staff handed me a pile of them. They are  all very similar. They are very heartfelt. They are not just writing a  rote letter to us. They watched the hearings, they listened, they care  about our public schools, and some of them are Trump supporters. They  want this President to support our public schools.   They did not in this past election have a debate about whether we  should privatize public schools. We talked about the debate--and I know  my candidate didn't win. But in this country, I never heard a debate  about taking public education away, about voucherizing our public  schools, about having someone who is the top person--the Secretary of  Education--espouse positions that are so fundamentally opposed to what  I grew up with and obviously to so many parents, teachers, students,  family members, superintendents, people involved in schools, and  business leaders. They are writing to us now because they saw the same  thing we did in this hearing.   Let me read a letter from Trina Whitaker from Mukilteo Schools. She  says:         This is my 16th year of being a teacher in our public       school system in WA State. I am an advocate of public schools       as I feel strongly that all our students deserve the right to       free and quality education.        I am opposed to the nomination of Betsy DeVos for the       Secretary of Education system. Her past actions and beliefs       clearly demonstrate that she is not an advocate for our       public schools. It would be so damaging if we move in the       direction of privatizing public education.        Please consider opposing the nomination of Betsy DeVos in       the best interest for our public school system.    Let me read another letter from Rachel Guim of Seattle. She says:         As a committed public school teacher, I believe in our       neighborhood public schools, which open their doors to all       children, because unlike Betsy DeVos, I see them work for       children and their families every single day. We as a       community are being undermined by charters, vouchers, for-      profit schools and online schools. Precious tax dollars are       being wasted creating a parallel school system (when we're       already underfunded and not meeting the legal requirements)!       Our democratically governed schools--we, the people you have       vowed to represent--need your commitment and support. Choice       is a disguise for school privatization, nothing more. Stop       the takeover of our democratically governed schools. . . . Do       not vote to confirm Betsy DeVos.    And she goes on. Again, there are so many letters from so many people  from so many different walks of life, all concerned about having a  Secretary of Education who doesn't represent the best values and the  best beliefs of our country.   Ms. Amanda Smith, a Kindergarten teacher, wrote to me and said:         Hello,        I am a kindergarten teacher in a public elementary school.       I am very concerned about Betsy DeVos' potential nomination       as secretary of education. As someone who never attended       public school, didn't send her kids to public school, does       not have an education degree and has never taught, she hardly       seems like a fitting candidate for secretary of education.       Can anything be done to stop this nomination?    From Gina McMather, a teacher in Port Townsend, WA:         Dear Patty Murray,        As a recently retired public school teacher, I especially       urge you to fight against Betsy DeVos's nomination for       education secretary. She is not in any way qualified for the       job. Her commitment to charter schools combined with a lack       of experience with public schools could destroy our nation's       educational system.        Public school teachers provide an education for all of our       students. Teachers need more respect and remuneration. We       need the very best college graduates to be attracted to the       profession. I have known so many dedicated and effective       public school teachers during my 25-year career and those of       us retiring baby boomers need the best successors possible.       They need your support. Don't let this undermine our efforts.        Thank you again for all your [work].    What I hear from people over and over again is that they want  somebody leading our public school system in this country who actually  believes in public schools, who has the education, the experience, the  compassion, the willingness to understand what our forefathers did when  they created this country and said: We are going to have a country--a  democracy--that has a public education system paid for by all taxpayers  to assure that everyone, no matter who they are or where they come  from, is not denied a public education. They can learn to read and  write and communicate and get the skills they need to be successful.  They can dream who they want to dream to be and be there.    We do not want to go backward, and we are one vote away from changing  where we are on this nomination, sending this back to the President,  and asking him to please send us a Secretary of Education who can get  the votes in the Senate, who will be an Education Secretary for all  people, from all walks of life, from our rural communities and our  urban communities, no matter who they are or where they come from.  That, I think, is a great possibility and would be a great outcome.   I know that my colleague is on the floor and is ready to speak as  well. Again, I have so many letters from so many people--48,000--who  have voiced their opinion on this, more than I have ever had with any  other nominee in my memory or any other issue in my memory. I thank all  those who have written in and spoken out and stood up for public  education. It is the foundation of our democracy, and it is our  responsibility, our goal to continue that for them.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have been so impressed by the large  number of Senators who have come to the floor to tell their stories of  why public education is so personal and important to them and to their  constituents.   I want to thank all of the staff who were here all night long--our  clerks, pages, people in the cloakrooms--everyone who has given time of  their own to be here to support us to be able to talk about this  critical important nomination, the Secretary of Education.   I think all of my colleagues will agree with me that there has been  an unprecedented outpouring of concern from across the country about  this Cabinet nominee. Why is that? Why is it that the Secretary of  Education has brought such emotion and discussion to this country? For  a very important reason: Education is a critical part of everyone's  life.   The Founders of this country knew that when they determined we in  this country were going to have a free public education system. Why?  Because they want to make sure that every citizen had the opportunity  to read and write and participate in this democracy, a core principle  to assure that all of us would have a voice in who our President and  elected officials were so we would understand and be educated and make  the right decisions.   That core principle is so important to this country and has allowed  us for centuries to be the kind of country where we have a middle  class. People who are born into poverty know there is a school they can  go to, to learn to read and write and get the skills they need to be a  participant in our democracy and in our economy. That is what is at  stake in this nomination. People across the country are writing in,  calling, holding rallies, talking to their neighbors and friends, and  letting us know how important this is because they do not want to lose  that principle. In this nominee who has been sent to us is a threat to  that very basic core value that so many people believe in, in this  country; that no matter who you are or where you grow up or how much  money you have and who your parents are, you will have that public  education, that public school in your community that you will be able  to go to.   I was a school board member before I was a U.S. Senator, before I was  in the State senate. Those school board meetings were jammed with  parents who wanted to know what was happening in their schools, who  would call me at midnight and complain about a school policy and what  was going on. As a school board member, I had to listen and respond to  that. People value their schools. They want to know they are there. Our  schools are the heart of our communities. It is where people from  different backgrounds who may be fighting with their neighbor across  the street during the day, show up Friday night to cheer together for  that football team. It is the center and epicenter of our communities.  It is the epicenter of our country, and that is what is at stake in  this nomination.   People want the Secretary of Education to be a champion for their  public schools. In this nomination that has been sent to us by the  President, Betsy DeVos, we have someone who values and speaks out for-- and has used her fortune to fight for--something very different. She  has denigrated public schools. She says they need to end. She advocates  giving our young kids a voucher and telling them to find a private  school, leaving behind kids who can't afford to go hours to another  school or to pay the extra money the voucher doesn't cover, leaving  kids in poverty, robbing really critical money from our schools and  from the kids who would be left behind.   Yes, our kids want choices. This is not a debate about charter  schools. Many States, including mine, have charter schools, but the  difference is, in those States--in my State and many--those charter  schools are held accountable, just like the public schools so you know  your child is getting the education they have been promised and that it  is held accountable to taxpayers. Mrs. DeVos refused in our committee  to say that those charter schools, those private schools, if they take  taxpayer dollars--which a voucher is--would be held accountable to the  taxpayers. To the parents in those communities who showed up at my  school board meetings to tell what they thought of their schools and  what we should be doing and had a voice, it would not be accountable to  them. I find that wrong, as a principle in this country and our  democracy and what we have fought so hard for. That is why so many  parents are speaking out. That is why so many Senators have been here  on the floor. That is why we have been here all night long and will be  here until noon today during this vote.    That is what is at stake. In our higher education system, all of us  know that so many young people today want that ticket to success and  student loan debt is such an incredibly huge challenge to so many  people, a barrier to getting the education they need. They want someone  who is going to head up the Department of Education who understands  that.   Betsy DeVos has no experience in higher education, none. And she is  going to lead the agency and be the voice and be the vision? That is  why  [[Page S804]]  parents, students, teachers, community leaders, superintendents, school  board members, and families across the country have stood up and said  no.   This is so close. We are within one vote of sending this nomination  back and asking the President to send us a nominee who can be supported  by Members on both sides of the aisle, who can set a vision, who can  fight for public schools, who can be that champion and that leader who  sets us apart in the world as a country, who values the core principle  that every child--no matter who they are or where they live--will get a  good education.   The Secretary of Education is not a figurehead. The Secretary of  Education spends his or her days trying to make the right decision and  being a champion across the country on issues across the board.   They oversee the Office for Civil Rights. Last night I had the  opportunity to listen to Senator Booker speak about the importance of  their office and what it meant to him and what it means to so many kids  today to know that there is in this country an agency, the Office for  Civil Rights, embedded in the Department of Education to assure that  they will not be denied an education because of the color of their  skin.   Isn't that a value we all want to continue? That is why people have  spoken out and written letters and made phone calls and had their  voices heard. So many parents in this country today want to make sure  the basic education law that we have fought for for so long, IDEA,  which assures that students with disabilities get a good education, is  not put in jeopardy.   When Mrs. DeVos came to our education committee and was asked about  this, she had no idea that it was the law of the land. She said to our  committee: The States can do that.   Well, no--why is it the law of the land? Why is it a principle of the  United States of America to assure that no matter where you live, if  you are someone with a disability, you will get access to an education?   I listened to Senator Hassan last night talk about her own young son  and the challenges he has had. He is a bright man, but he is unable to  speak or move, but he got an education in this country. He can give  back, and he can participate.   Disabilities come in all sizes and all different shapes and all  different forms. I assure you, when you are a parent of a disabled  child, you are passionate and you want to make sure that your child has  access to education, and you want a Secretary of Education, the top  person in this land to be your advocate, too--not someone who doesn't  know the law, not someone who isn't directing her staff to make sure  that no matter where you are, if you are a student of disability, you  get access to public education and are not denied.   Our country is great because we have these principles. Our country is  great because we value each individual. Our country is great and will  continue to be great if we continue to do that, but it will not be  great if this body gives their imprimatur to a Secretary of Education  who doesn't value that.   What does that say to young kids across the country, to parents with  students of disabilities, to young people in this country living in  poverty or living in a community or having family issues who wants to  know that they, too, live in a land of opportunity?   That is why we have heard from so many parents and so many  administrators and so many community leaders. This is a core value of  our country--the ability to know that you can get an education.   Again, this is not a debate about charter schools. There are charter  schools in many States. This is a debate about taking as much as $20  billion from our public education system and using it for vouchers for  private schools that are not accountable to taxpayers.   If nothing else, I appeal to my Republican colleagues to think about  that, to think about the fact that taxpayer dollars will not be held  accountable under Mrs. DeVos's plans and policies. If you give  a voucher to a student and they go to a school and they are not  teaching what they should be, there is nowhere to go for those parents.  It is their taxpayer dollars, and it is our taxpayer dollars. That is  why this nominee is so important. That is why so many have stood up on  our side and two Republicans have stood up and spoken out against this  nominee.    Title IX makes sure that we protect students and makes sure that  their rights are protected and that women have the opportunity to go  and get a degree without being challenged or being put down or being a  victim of sexual harassment. We need a Secretary of Education who knows  that law and will enforce it so that students across the country know  there is a champion at the top office in this land who is telling their  staff to enforce this law and to back up those students. That is what  this debate is about.   I heard some of my colleagues on the other side talk about the fact  that we have a GI bill, which they essentially called in the debate a  voucher for men and women who served our country to go to higher  education and likened that to the voucher system they are talking about  in K-12. That is not equal. That is given to members of our service,  rightly so, to say: You served our country; we will make sure you get  an education.   In our country, we value every student in every community. To give  them a voucher and say ``Go find a school'' is not a way of providing  education. Ask any school board member in this country. Ask any parent  in this country. They want that public education school, that school in  their community that is valued. They don't want that money taken away  from that school, and they want every child to know that just as our  Founders said, a public education will assure that every child has that  opportunity.   This is an important debate, and we are very close to the hour when  we are going to have a vote. It will take only one more courageous  Republican to say: You know, I have thought about this. I listened to  her testimony--the short testimony that we had. I have looked at her  answers to their questions, and I, too, want to send a message to this  country that the value of public education is critical.   The President has other people he could send over, a lot of them who  value education, who have had experience--unlike this candidate--who  will send a message to this country that, truly, we do value public  education.   I hope that in the next few hours we can take pause and have that  happen. It will not be the end of the world. It will not be the first  nominee who doesn't get the votes they need in the Senate, but it  virtually will be a moment in the history of this country where we will  stand up and are proud to say: Not on our watch; not on our watch. We  want a head of the Department of Education who actually values  education for all students, public education for all students.   I have a colleague behind me who is ready to speak, and I thank him  for being here this morning. We will yield him the floor. I want to  say, again, thank you to all the parents, students, family members,  school officials, community leaders, and so many people who have called  and written and spoken up. Your voice matters. Your country matters.  Public education matters. I am so proud to stand with all of you and to  fight to make sure that this country remembers that and votes right at  the end of the day.   I yield to my colleague.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, again, I am on the floor, and I want to  thank all of our staff and clerks and everyone who has been here  throughout the last 20 hours. I thank everyone for speaking from their  hearts about the issue of public education, why it is so important to  them, and why they want a Secretary of Education who has that value and  promotes that value and has the vision of that value, which is really  why so many people in this country have spoken out and sent us letters  and held rallies and inundated our phones. And I thank all those people  who have done that. It has made an impact here and has made a  difference. I think it has woken up each one of us to what we care  about in this country and what we value and what we want.   Like many people, I received so many letters from my constituents,  over 48,000 letters. That is just the letters--not phone calls--that I  got, and I want to share some of them with you because they come from  people's hearts. They are not form letters. They are not something they  got from somebody else and forwarded. These are personal. And I think  it is important that we hear these people.   I thank Marie Carlsen from Federal Way. She sent me a letter, and she  said:         Dear Senator Murray,        Thank you for your continuing efforts at trying to prevent       Betsy DeVos from becoming the head of the Department of       Education. I have a child who has just started his schooling       in our public school system, and from everything I have read       or listened to about this woman, she has no business in       education at all. She has no knowledge of the laws and       protections guaranteed to our children, no comprehension of       what our educators deal with on a daily basis, and would       regress, gut, and otherwise destroy our educational system if       she were allowed to become the head of the Department. I fear       for my child's education, his safety, and his ability to       compete in a global community in the future. I stand with you       and thank you again for your efforts.    I thank Marie for writing in. Like so many people across the country,  she watched the hearing Mrs. DeVos came to where she spoke to our  committee. We were only allowed 5 minutes each, which I really regret  because I think it is important that we see who is going to be leading  this agency, and our inability to ask her questions with full  information really gave just a shallow picture of who she was. But like  many people, my constituents and those across the country watched and  were just shocked that somebody who had been nominated to head the  Department of Education had such little experience and knowledge and  understanding of the agency they had been tapped to lead.   I heard from Ms. Ina Howell in Seattle. She wrote to me, and she  said:         I am writing to express opposition to the nomination of       Mrs. Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary. Mrs. DeVos does not       have any experience in the field of education and, as a       result, will not effectively lead the Department of Education       in maintaining and improving public education in the country.       She did not seem to possess a basic understanding of key       education policies, including the responsibilities of the       IDEA Act.        She did not understand the difference between student       proficiency and student growth measures. She did not       understand simple facts and figures, like the percent       increase in student debt from 2008 to 2016. She failed to       adequately answer questions on equal protection for LGBT       students and their civil rights, confronting campus sexual       assault and the regulation of the for-profit higher education       industry.    This is Ms. Ina Howell--she happens to be with the National Alliance  of Black School Educators--expressing deep concerns that the nominee  doesn't have the basic issues and knowledge that she should have in  running this agency, nor the passion for it, which is so important as  the leading spokesperson in the country.   I heard from Dana Hayden from Poulsbo, WA, and she said:         Dear Senator Patty Murray,        I have been an educator in our State since 1984. I have       seen your positive efforts for the citizens of WA firsthand.        Last night, we found out that our family will be welcoming       our first grandchild in July--a girl. I am so joyful, yet       quite worried about the world she is coming into.  [[Page S809]]       Then I saw you on the news. You give me hope! Thank you!        I wonder what kind of school experience the next generation       will have if DeVos is allowed to decimate our education       system, the way Trump is decimating our Nation with orders.    These are people who have not written in before. They are writing  long letters, many of them pages long, speaking from their hearts about  the value of public education, what it means to them and their  grandchildren. They know this country was built on a system of public  education that ensured every child would be provided a school in their  community to go to so that they could have the opportunity their  parents and grandparents and great-grandparents had.   I could read through so many of these. Here is one from Miles Erdly  from Kent, WA. He says:         My name is Miles Erdly, and I am the principal of Horizon       Elementary in Kent. As a strong supporter of public       education, I ask that you vehemently oppose the confirmation       of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of the U.S. Department of       Education. Educators and students deserve a Secretary who can       commit to supporting every student in all public schools, and       a leader who will work tirelessly to promote a public       education system that provides each child with the optimum       conditions for teaching and learning. Betsy DeVos's past work       in education and her performance at the recent confirmation       hearing demonstrated neither a depth of experience nor       knowledge base in education policy and on critical issues       facing the community. As a principal, I have spoken with       teachers, parents, students, and community members across the       political spectrum, and there is widespread agreement that       Betsy DeVos is not the right person for the job.    This is Miles Erdly, a principal, and he watched the hearings, like  so many people did, and was so concerned that we had in front of us a  nominee for the Secretary of Education who didn't share that core value  of public education for all students.   Ms. Gabrielle Gersten from Seattle, WA:         As a college student, the idea of Betsy DeVos becoming the       Secretary of Education concerns me for multiple reasons. She       obviously has been fortunate enough to go through school and       a higher education without a worry about money, but that is       not the case for most college students. I, myself, am lucky       enough that my mom saved money for me to attend college, but       many of my friends are working hard on their own to pay for       college education themselves. Also, her zeroing the funds for       title I is worrisome because every State should be held to       the same standard to give children in poverty access to an       education. An educated nation is a stronger nation. Not       everyone can afford to go to private school or have the       opportunity to attend one, whether that be the money or even       finding a way to get to school. She has goals, but they are       not as easy to achieve for everyone, and I don't think she       keeps that in mind.        Additionally, title IX is very important to me, as a female       college student, and the rest of my peers. She needs to       support title IX and keep universities accountable to it.    Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. Title IX is critically  important in our higher education system. We have worked on a  bipartisan basis to ensure that title IX is enforced. And to have a  nominee for Secretary of Education who came before our committee, did  not understand title IX, didn't have a commitment to title IX, sends  shock waves through students across this country and their parents who  have pushed and pushed for us to make sure that title IX is overseen in  a way that makes sure our students at schools have the support they  need from our highest education person in this country.   I could go on forever. I know several other Senators are going to be  here on the floor shortly. Let me just say this: I have had the  opportunity to be out here on the floor to hear from so many Senators  who gave their personal stories about what education meant to them.  Young people growing up in poverty knew that school was there for them.  They knew they had teachers and friends who were there for them. Not  everyone was perfect. Certainly not every school is perfect. Certainly  all of us who have been involved in public education strive for better  every day, but that school was there for them.   The thought that we have a Secretary of Education nominee who doesn't  share that basic value, who wants to change the system to privatize  it--she has said herself that she wants to end public education.  Privatizing schools, having some kind of corporation running our  schools, is just not what our country is about, is not what we want. We  are not even leaning in that direction. They want our country to lean  in the other direction--to strengthen all of our public schools, to  have taxpayers across the country investing in every student, and that  those schools be held accountable and that we ask our elected  representatives to hold them accountable. That is not the vision that  this nominee has presented to us, and it is a vision that I have worked  passionately on through all of my life, and really that is why I am  here to oppose this nomination.    I want to thank everybody who has written in and called and been  passionate about public education in this country, and I encourage them  to keep using their voices to fight for that passion. It is well worth  the fight.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his  passionate remarks on this topic. I have had the opportunity over most  of Friday and over the last 23 hours, to listen to my colleagues come  to the floor and speak passionately about an issue they care about,  speaking against DeVos. We heard very little passionate speaking for  Betsy DeVos, but we heard a tremendous amount of passion against.   I want to thank the Senator from Ohio, in particular, speaking to the  issue of the fact that Mrs. DeVos does owe a fine to Ohio that has not  been paid. I find it incredulous that we are just dismissing that here  and the Senators are voting for her.   The Senator from Ohio spoke passionately about what vouchers would  mean for students with disabilities, and their ability to get a good  education could be in jeopardy over the vision that this Secretary is  about to put forward.   A few moments ago, I listened to the Senator from New Mexico speak  about our tribal schools and the fact that this Secretary of Education  has no knowledge of tribal education and her role in being in charge of  that with no experience and no idea of what that means or how that will  be enacted.   Again, I want to just say that we heard from so many people in our  States because we clearly have a nominee to run the Department of  Education with no experience and a background that is really in  opposition to what most of us have stood up for and fought for most of  our lives. I have mentioned throughout this debate--as I have spoken  numerous times about the tremendous amount of letters that have come to  me through our mail over the last several weeks since this nominee came  before our committee and the public had a chance to see Mrs. DeVos at  our hearing, without the knowledge she needs to lead this agency, with  the tremendous conflicts of interest that were portrayed over and over.   I want to again go back and read some of those letters as we get into  the last hour of this debate because I think they are quite telling.   I have one from Dr. Jennifer Kay Lynn of Olympia, WA. She says to me:         Thank you for your understanding Betsy DeVos would       devastate U.S. public education. Betsy DeVos's Senate       confirmation hearing underscored how unprepared she is to       serve as America's Secretary of Education. Mrs. DeVos has no       experience in public schools, either as a student, an       educator, administrator or even as a parent. Mrs. DeVos       doesn't understand key policy issues, like proficiency versus       growth, or the Federal role of the Individuals with       Disabilities Act.        Mrs. DeVos would not even commit to upholding current       guidance on preventing sexual assault under title IX. Mrs.       DeVos has no idea of how the arts and public education are       critical for human development, education. All of the arts       help our students grow emotionally, with dedication to task       or more and more connections with the brain, and perhaps,       most importantly, find out how much the arts enhance their       lives. We need a Secretary of Education who will champion       innovative strategies that we know how to improve success for       all students, including creating more opportunities and       equity for all.        Betsy DeVos is not that person, and I urge you to vote       against her for Secretary of Education.    Those aren't my words. I didn't talk to Jennifer Lynn. She wrote to  me because she saw this candidate come before our committee. She has  looked at her record and has said: This is not what our country is  about.   I got a letter from Jamie Michaelson of Oroville, WA, very small  community.         Senator Murray, as a public school administrator, I am       extremely concerned about Betsy DeVos' lack of knowledge and       support for public schools. Having never been a teacher or       administrator is bothersome enough, but to have not attended       a public school herself, nor sent her kids to one, makes her       ill-equipped to making educational decisions.        Furthermore, I worry about her understanding of small,       rural districts. We have our own unique needs, which include       funding professional development for teachers, Federally-      funded programs for at-risk youth, and support to recruit and       retain high quality teachers.        As a strong supporter of public education, I ask that you       oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of the       U.S. Department of Education. We must have a Secretary who       can commit to supporting every student in our public schools,       and provide leadership that will help our neighborhood       schools succeed. Betsy DeVos' record in education and her       performance at the recent confirmation hearing proves she is       the wrong candidate for the job.        As a principal, I have spoken with teachers, parents,       students and community members, who agree that America's       future depends on a strong investment in our Nation's public       schools.        Thank you for your attention to this matter. I understand       that you are being inundated with emails concerning Cabinet       picks. I feel the nomination of Betsy DeVos is political.       Students, families and educators deserve a highly-qualified       candidate that understands our complex educational system. I       am not writing to you because I have a political motivation.       Instead, I am looking for the best of the best for the       Secretary of Education position. Unfortunately, in my       professional opinion, Betsy DeVos is not the right person for       this job.    I couldn't agree more. Shouldn't we have the best of the best at the  top of our education system today? That is what my constituents are  asking--and I know many across this country are hoping that just one  more Republican Senator will agree. That is what will occur in about an  hour.   I see my colleague on the floor who has come here to talk. I  appreciate him being here, and I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have had the opportunity over the last  almost 24 hours now to hear from a wide swath of our Democratic  conference speak out against the nomination because they feel so  strongly that in this country public education is a core principle. I  know a number of my colleagues will be participating with me in these  last few minutes, but I want to thank, again, everyone who has written,  who has called in, who has expressed their opinion on this critical  nominee that this President tapped to oversee education policy.    I yield to the Senator from Hawaii for a question.    Well, I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his question.   He is absolutely right. I did ask Betsy DeVos, when she came before  our committee, if she would commit to not privatizing our schools or  cutting a single penny from public education, and she would not do  that. She would not do that.   To me, that sends a very clear message, and it did obviously to  parents, students, and administrators across this country, that she was  not committed to the core principle of public education, that our tax  dollars in this country always have and should continue to be to make  sure that every student, no matter where they are, will have the  opportunity to participate in education. Her answer clearly meant that  she was going to take money from our public education system, from our  schools--big, small, rural, urban, and suburban--to go to private  schools. That would mean a devastation for many communities.   So I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his question.    I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire.    Mr. President, I deeply share the concern of the Senator  from New Hampshire. She came to the floor last night to speak  eloquently about the challenges that our students with disabilities  have and the promise that this country has made now for decades that if  you are a student with a disability, you will be able to go to a public  school and get the education that you need.   She spoke eloquently. For everyone who didn't hear her, I ask you to  go back and look at the Record and listen to it.   Yes, I am deeply concerned that this nominee whom this President has  sent to us is not committed to that basic premise that, no matter who  you are or where you come from or what you look like or if you have a  disability, you get a public education. But I am not only concerned  that she doesn't have a commitment. I am deeply concerned that she  didn't even understand that it was current Federal law.   How can someone be a Secretary of Education in this country and not  understand that basic premise and not give that commitment to people  across the country that, if it is your child or someone you love or  someone you know, they, too, can go to school and get what they need.   So I want to thank the Senator from New Hampshire. And, yes, I am  deeply concerned, as we all should be in this body and across the  country, that this nominee is not prepared or qualified to make that  basic assurance for all students in this country.    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from  Minnesota, who came the other night to talk passionately about her own  mother, who was a teacher and her favorite course to teach was about  the monarch butterfly and how she would come dressed up as a butterfly  and how she impacted a young student in her classroom who is now a  young adult and still remembers the learning experience that her  mother, as a teacher, gave to him. That spark is so important for every  child in this country--that spark for education--no matter who you are,  your disability, or what brings you to school that day. That is what is  so important about the term ``public education.'' Every child in this  country deserves a public education and to reach their full potential,  no matter what they look like, how they come to school that day,  whether they have been fed or have a disability. That spark is what is  so important.   That is why so many people have spoken out in this country about this  nominee, who knows nothing or very little about IDEA--not even that it  is a Federal law that is under the jurisdiction of the Department that  she is seeking and that she would oversee and protect those students.  That, to me, is deeply disappointing. It says to me that this President  should say: I don't want this nominee to go forward. I will send you  someone who understands this law.   I appreciate the question from the Senator from Minnesota.    I yield for a question.    The Senator is correct. The essence of what she has  promoted and used her vast wealth for and has worked for throughout her  experience is to take money away from public education and put it into  private schools.    I thank the Senator for her question. I just want to say  that she is absolutely right. The money is not magic. It doesn't just  get printed to give vouchers to schools. It comes from our public  schools. As she stated so eloquently, there are many schools--some in  rural areas, some in urban areas, or mostly in rural, and there is no  private school to send your kids to. That voucher money, that public  money, those taxpayer dollars will come away from those schools. They  will have less money, but it won't go to the advantage of those  students, and they will be left behind.    I yield for a question.    Well, I want to thank the Senator from Michigan for that  question because it is at the heart of what this entire debate is  about. We  [[Page S819]]  have a nominee who has come forward who is quite successful in private  business--a billionaire herself--whose idea and vision for our Nation's  education comes from a private business perspective.   The Senator from Michigan is absolutely right. Our schools are not  about profits. They are not profit centers, and we can never run them  that way because there is a core principle that this country was  founded on that our forefathers very wisely thought of. They wanted to  make sure that every young person in this country, no matter who they  were and how much money they had, would get a public education.   You can't run that as a for-profit business because there are kids  who come to our schools who are very hard. Maybe they come without  having had a parent home the night before, they come hungry, they come  with disabilities, they come with challenging education experiences. We  can't throw those kids out because there are other kids who come with  parents who are very active and are really bright and we want to keep  them because they are better for profit. We have to run our public  education schools so every child has that opportunity because who knows  who that young child is going to be who takes that nugget of public  education and ends up sitting here in the U.S. Senate. That is the  foundation of our country.   I really appreciate the Senator from Michigan for raising that  because that is the core essence of why so many people have spoken out  against this nominee, who stood up and have written us letters and made  phone calls and stood at rallies and spoken out--many people who have  never spoken out on issues before who have never really paid attention  before, but this is about the core principles our country was founded  on, a public education for all--not a profit education for all but a  public education for all.    I will yield to the Senator from Oregon.    Let me thank the Senator from Oregon for his question  because he raises a very important point. No one is debating whether we  want our kids to have a choice. The debate here is about whether or not  those schools that take taxpayer dollars through a voucher system are  accountable to the taxpayers who are paying for those vouchers.   This nominee came before our committee and very clearly stated that  she would not equally hold accountable private schools. Now, I was a  former school board member, and I can tell you, I was there late many  nights listening to parents who stood before us and talked about the  fact that they wanted to make sure that their school had good teachers  or their school had good policies, and we were accountable to that  because we were an elected board, and we had to make decisions based on  what our constituents thought was important.   These are our constituents who are paying their tax dollars to this  country, and they want to know that their taxes are used accountably.  Yet we have a nominee before us at the Department of Education who has  said she wants to take those taxpayer dollars--your money--and send it  on to private schools with no accountability. What does that mean? That  could mean that those private schools don't necessarily have to provide  a strong curriculum in specific topics. It means they can let kids out  of school and say: We don't want to keep you here anymore. You are too  tough to teach.   It can say that they will not keep records of dropout rates so we  know whether or not they are encouraging these tough kids to go to  another school. They can actually deny access to students with  disabilities or who come from tough backgrounds who may not meet their  standards, and they will not be held accountable under the policies  that Ms. DeVos proposes. So the Senator raises an absolutely critical  question. At the end of the day, each elected official in this country  is held accountable to their taxpayers to assure that the money they  give out in their taxes is used in a way that our country agrees on,  and this Secretary of Education says: Nope. We want to change that. We  want your tax dollars to go to schools that are not accountable to you.    Mr. President, we have a number of Senators who have  been on the floor who are here now and who would like to speak, and I  ask unanimous consent that I continue this dialogue with Senators until  a quarter to 12, and the last 15 minutes be equally divided between the  chairman of the committee and myself.    Mr. President, let me revise my request. I ask unanimous  consent that we continue to have this conversation until a quarter to  12 p.m.; that at a quarter to 12, I will give my final remarks and  divide equally the last 15 minutes so the chairman of the committee has  the last 7\1/2\ minutes.    I will yield to the Senator from Illinois.    I want to thank the Senator from Illinois, who is an  amazing new and great Member of our Senate. She comes from Illinois.  She comes from an incredible background and is asking a critical  question about whether our students with disabilities should have  access to education.   It is a passion many of us have feelings about, it is a principle  that our country has supported, and it is a principle that this nominee  is uniquely unknowledgeable about and, to me, that is reason enough for  any of us to vote against that nominee.    I will yield to the Senator from Minnesota for a  question.    I say thank you to the Senator from Minnesota, and I  want to thank him for being a committed part of our committee, really  helping us all recognize that this nominee is not qualified.   I see the Senator from Hawaii who has, I believe, the last question.    I will yield to the Senator from Hawaii.    I thank the Senator from Hawaii, and I think that is the  question all of us should be posing to ourselves as we get down to the  final few minutes. Is this the best of the best?   Is this a knowledgeable candidate who understands the Federal law?   Is this a candidate who comes to us without conflicts of interest?   Is this a candidate who is willing to stand up and be the defender of  all young children in schools?   To me and to many of my colleagues who have been out here speaking,  she is not.   I want to thank all of my great colleagues who have been out here  speaking from their heart about a passion that they have in this  country for a candidate to lead the Department of Education who is  qualified, who is prepared, who is ready to stand up and fight for  every child no matter where they live or where they come from.   With that, Mr. President, I believe we are down to the last 15  minutes before the vote, with the time equally divided.    Mr. President, as I noted, Democrats have been here on  the Senate floor for the past 24 hours straight, talking about the  importance of public education, sharing stories from parents and  students and teachers in our home States, highlighting all of the  reasons for Senators to stand with us and stand with their  constituents, stand with other Republicans who are doing the right  thing, and urging them to say no to Betsy DeVos and her plans to  privatize public school and destroy public education in America.   But I come to the floor today to make one final push before this  vote, to make the case one last time, because we are so, so close and  because this is so important and also because we have a real shot right  now to show people across the country that the Senate can actually  listen to them, that their voices matter, and that their Senators put  them and their kids and their families and their futures above loyalty  to a party or a President.   I have talked about my frustration with the fact that Republican  leaders did everything they could to jam this nominee through the  Senate. They cut corners and rushed into a hearing before her ethics  paperwork was in. They blocked Democrats from asking more than 5  minutes of questions, forcing a vote before all of our questions were  answered about her tangled finances and her potential conflicts of  interest, and rushed straight from the committee vote to the shortest  possible floor debate they could manage.   So I won't spend more time on that today because the truth is that  despite Republicans' best efforts, people across the country have  learned a whole lot about Betsy DeVos over the past few weeks, and the  more they have learned about her, the less they have liked and the more  outraged they have become.   Over the past few weeks, people have learned about Betsy DeVos's  tangled finances and potential conflicts of interest and how she and  her family have given hundreds of millions of dollars to Republicans  and extreme conservative groups. They have learned about her failed  record, how she spent her career and her inherited fortune pushing  anti-public school policies that have hurt so many students in her home  State of Michigan and across the country. They have learned about the  extreme rightwing ideology that drives her, how she wants to bring her  anti-government, free-market-above-all philosophy to an education  system that she has called nothing more than ``an industry, and a dead  end.''   When people saw her in her hearing, they learned even more. When they  watched Betsy DeVos in that hearing room, when they saw it live on the  evening news, on ``The Daily Show,'' on ``The View,'' and on many other  shows covering it, and one of the many clips that went viral on social  media or shared by a friend or a family member, a whole lot of people  were introduced to Betsy DeVos for that first time in that hearing, and  they were not impressed. People across the country saw a nominee who  was clearly ill-informed and confused, who gave a number of very  concerning responses to serious and reasonable questions.   In that hearing, Betsy DeVos refused to rule out slashing investments  in or privatizing public schools. She was confused that Federal law  provides protections for students with disabilities. She didn't  understand a basic issue in education policy--the debate surrounding  whether students should be measured based on their proficiency or their  growth. She argued that guns needed to be allowed in schools across the  county to ``protect from Grizzlies.'' And even though she was willing  to say that President Trump's behavior toward women should be  considered sexual assault, she would not commit to actually enforcing  Federal law protecting women and girls in our schools. Those were just  a few of the moments in that hearing that made it clear why Betsy DeVos  is not qualified to do this job. There were many more.  [[Page S821]]    What people saw in that hearing wasn't just a nominee who didn't  understand the issues; they saw a nominee for Secretary of Education  who clearly didn't think about public education and public schools the  way they do. For most people, public education hits really close to  home. It is part of who we are, our families, and our communities. So  many of us owe everything we have to public education. We have watched  our kids and our grandkids and our neighbors get on the bus to go to  their local public school. Many of us have taught in public schools or  have family or friends who walk into classrooms every single day to  help our students learn. And so many of us believe in a commitment to  strong public schools that offer an education and opportunity to every  student. It is a core part of the American promise.   So when we saw someone nominated to this position who knows so little  about public education, who so clearly cares so little about public  education, whose strongest connection to public schools is through her  dedication to tearing them down, that struck a real chord with a whole  lot of people, and they decided to make their voices heard.   Over the past two weeks, we have seen an unprecedented level of  engagement from people on this nomination--tens of thousands of calls,  thousands of letters, hundreds of people calling in, social media, and  many of them have never been involved or made their voices heard  before. It made a difference. Right now, every single Democrat is  opposing this nomination, and two Republicans who listened to their  constituents are joining us. So we are dead even--the first time in  history that the Vice President will be called on shortly to cast a  tie-breaking vote on a Cabinet nominee. We just need one more  Republican to join us to prevent that from happening, one more to help  us show the people across this country that their voice matters in this  debate, one more to stand with people across the country and say no.   So I am here to finish this debate where we started--standing with  students and parents and teachers, with the people of my home State of  Washington and across the country who strongly support public schools  and true education opportunity for all, and with Democrats and  Republicans across the country who have poured their heart and soul  into opposing this nominee. I stand with you.   I urge one more Republican to join us.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I stand here today to give a voice to the  thousands of people who have contacted me in recent weeks urging me to  vote no on this nomination. First, I need to express my frustration and  outrage about what happened here on the floor last night.   In the middle of a debate about the next Attorney General--someone  whose job it will be to defend the rights of all Americans; whose job  it is to defend people from discrimination, inequity, and unfairness;  whose job it is to defend women, to defend people of color, to defend  all those who are too often told to sit down, stand down, be quiet--we  saw the Republican leader selectively use the rules to silence our  colleague, a woman Senator, who was reading the words of an African- American woman and a historic civil rights leader, reading the words of  someone who embodies the fight for justice, for freedom, for equality,  and for civil rights in America; someone who all of us should be  looking to for lessons in these times, not someone whose words should  be silenced because she said something people may not enjoy hearing.    At a moment when we are engaged in a debate about how best to defend  our fellow citizens from discrimination and fight back against forces  that seek to demean others in order to gain power, I was stunned. I  respect the decorum that the Senate strives to maintain, but there are  times when you cannot stay silent. This is one of those times. We will  not be silent.   So I want to say that I stand with my friend, the Senator from  Massachusetts. I stand with the words of the late Coretta Scott King,  and I stand with the many people who have contacted me about this  nominee that we are debating here today. I can tell you that the day  President Trump announced he had picked Senator Jeff Sessions to lead  the Department of Justice, the phones in my office lit up. People from  across my home State of Washington contacted my office to express their  shock, their outrage, and their fear.   The calls came from people who help LGBTQ youth experiencing  homelessness; groups who have tirelessly advocated for necessary  criminal justice reform; families caught in a broken immigration  system; civil rights advocates and community leaders who have fought  for decades to create a more just society; advocates and nonprofits  trying to help women escape domestic violence. The list goes on.   That was in November. And in the weeks and months since the President  made his choice for Attorney General known, those concerns have not  died down. In fact, they have only gotten louder and more urgent as the  public gets a better look at Senator Sessions' long record, what he  stands for, and where he wants to take this country. I share their  concerns.   It is why I will oppose Senator Sessions' nomination to be Attorney  General. I urge my colleagues to join me to reject this nomination, and  send a message to the new President about the rule of law in this  country. Send a message to the new President, who came into office  showing blatant disregard for our traditions of transparency,  traditions that tell us the President has a duty to put the needs of  the American people before the needs of his bank account. Send a  message to someone who, just weeks into his term, has displayed  shocking disdain for the U.S. Constitution and the separation of  powers, the  [[Page S934]]  same President who fired an Acting Attorney General because she refused  to ignore the law, to approve his hateful and unconstitutional  Executive order barring refugees; the same President who ridiculed a  well-respected Federal judge in Seattle, a George W. Bush appointee,  because the judge didn't rule the way he wanted.   The U.S. Attorney General is often the last line of defense for our  Constitution within an administration. And they need to be the first to  stand up to our President when our President is wrong.   Senator Jeff Sessions is not that kind of nominee. The people of this  country expect and deserve an Attorney General who will protect their  civil and constitutional rights and liberties. They deserve someone  committed to the principles of inclusiveness and justice--someone who  will fiercely defend the rights of all Americans to be treated equally  under the law. The American people need an Attorney General who  continues to make the fight against racism, discrimination, and hate  crimes a core part of that Department's mission. We know Senator  Sessions is not the person for that job.   More than 30 years ago, he couldn't even pass muster in a Republican- majority Senate. During his confirmation hearing, Senators cited his  racially charged comments and his shameful record on civil rights as a  U.S. attorney as reasons they could not support him. And as my late  colleague Ted Kennedy said at the time: ``It is inconceivable to me  that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.S. attorney, let  alone a U.S. Federal judge.''   I ask my colleagues who are inclined to support his nomination today,  What has changed? I have served alongside Senator Sessions for years,  and I know his record all too well. And like my constituents who  started sounding the alarm back in November, I am deeply concerned by  his agenda that would take our country backward.   Senator Sessions has dismissed one of our bedrock civil rights laws,  the Voting Rights Act, as ``intrusive,'' while pushing restrictive  voter ID laws and fueling conspiracy theories about voter fraud. I  watched as he refused to work with a bipartisan majority of the Senate  on immigration reform and instead pushed extreme policies that would  punish the most vulnerable members of our communities. And that, by the  way, included DREAMers across the country who have never known another  home besides America. His personal passion on that issue and his years  of advocacy against commonsense immigration policies cause me great  concern about whether he would use the Department of Justice to pursue  his extreme anti-immigration agenda.   On criminal justice reform, he beat back efforts from within his own  party to address the exploding race of incarceration across this  country. The injustice of these laws falls disproportionately on  communities of color.   Time and again, he has defended laws that favor throwing nonviolent  offenders in jail rather than working to rehabilitate them, even though  it has been consistently proven that prison is not a means of  rehabilitation. This nominee's views on criminal justice reform are so  out of the mainstream, his position is even at odds with the Koch  brothers.   At the very time our Nation engages in a critically important debate  about ensuring equal treatment under the law, as we continue the  struggle to make sure equality shines through our education system, our  justice system, our economy, and our country, Senator Sessions remains  dismissive of the very tools our Justice Department must use to move us  forward.   When I joined so many of my colleagues in the Senate to reauthorize  and improve the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act to protect women  across the country, Senator Sessions worked against us to tear it  apart. As someone who has sat face-to-face with survivors of domestic  violence and fought to increase protections for those dealing with  sexual assault, I can see why people would question whether Senator  Sessions has any intention of enforcing the laws that protect them  because I wonder that myself.   This nominee's track record of trying to undermine women's  constitutionally protected reproductive rights is horrifying and  should, by the way, scare every woman in this country.   I have heard from so many members of the LGBTQ community who are  terrified that Senator Sessions would be tasked with protecting their  rights. His votes against repealing don't ask, don't tell and expanding  hate crimes definitions to include LGBTQ Americans confirm those fears.   This alone has to give my colleagues pause when so many Americans-- our friends, our family members, our coworkers--fear that their  government will look the other way as they endure violence,  discrimination, and marginalization just because of who they love or  how they live. We must fight back with everything we have.   When this President attacks the independence of our judges--judges  who have declared the obvious, that the Muslim ban Executive order is  unconstitutional--we cannot put the person who Steve Bannon calls ``the  fiercest, most dedicated and most loyal promoter'' of the President's  agenda at the head of the Department of Justice. This is not who we  are.   Senator Sessions is not the Attorney General this country needs. I  urge members of the Senate to stand up for the Constitution, to stand  with your fellow Americans. The stakes are far too high to make Senator  Sessions our next Attorney General.   I urge you to join with me in voting against this nomination. Now  more than ever, we need an Attorney General who will be independent and  willing to stand up to President Trump's illegal and unconstitutional  actions whenever they happen.   The last thing this country needs right now is a rubber stamp to  validate this administration's illegal actions.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
