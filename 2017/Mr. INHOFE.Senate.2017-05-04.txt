 Mr. President, I would like to recognize Thursday, May 4,  as Waste Management National Career Day and share with you the  importance of hiring and promoting women in nontraditional female  positions as drivers and technicians. I believe it is important that we  support and encourage women to pursue these career opportunities that  have been historically populated by men.   Women comprise only 2 percent of current drivers and technicians.  Waste Management National Career Day will provide an opportunity to  share stories of women who have held these positions successfully and  moved up into management.  [[Page S2771]]    I support this initiative because I believe, as we continue to  highlight economic opportunities for women, it is imperative that the  private sector develop platforms where women can learn about careers  they normally would not consider. This national career day is an  excellent example of waste management being proactive in creating ways  to increase the number of women in these types of careers across the  country.   Without a doubt, investment in women in nontraditional careers brings  about significant returns. Women contribute every day to our skillful,  effective, and talented workforce. I commend waste management for  building a platform where you can increase hiring of females as  drivers, technician, frontline management, and give them opportunity  for advancement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, small businesses play an integral  role in Oklahoma's economy. They consist of over 52 percent of all  employees in Oklahoma. Additionally, within Oklahoma, over 84 percent  of all exports come from small businesses. Today I have the distinct  honor of recognizing one of the many successful small businesses in my  home State of Oklahoma for National Small Business Week. While there  are many businesses worthy of recognition, I am particularly proud of  HydroHoist.   For over 53 years, HydroHoist has been not only a leader but an  originator and industry innovator of the market for boat lifts,  personal watercraft--PWC--ports, and boat protection packages. Their  products range from 900-pound drive-on docking platforms for PWCs, to  lifts with the holding capacity for 130,000 pound watercraft.  HydroHoist launched half a century ago by an Oklahoma marina owner in  Grand Lake, OK. By 1971, the company moved into an old World War II  munitions plant in Claremore, OK, where it is still located today.  HydroHoist's technology revolutionized the boating industry, and  remarkably, some of these original hoists are still in use today.  HydroHoist has expanded far beyond America's borders to international  waters, too.   I want to congratulate and thank president and CEO Mick Webber of  HydroHoist for his outstanding and devoted work in creating a shining  business model with over 4 distribution warehouses and over 600 dealers  throughout the world. Mr. Webber's dedication to making these products  in America should not only make Oklahomans proud, but all Americans.  HydroHoist's success should be an example for all businesses, and I am  proud to recognize their hard work and dedication.                            ____________________
