 Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Virginia.  Continuing resolutions are a growing threat to our national security.  Yet, for the past 17 years, Congress has forced the Department of  Defense to begin the fiscal year under a continuing resolution 13  times.                                time  1900    Continuing resolutions are designed to temporarily fund the Federal  Government if more time is needed to debate and finish remaining  appropriations bills; however, they inhibit the Defense Department  planning for the future. Not only do they harm us and our ability to  deter and defend against emerging threats, but they also put our  national security in a gridlock.   Supporting defense programs through prior year funding levels is  wasteful and inefficient. Think about it. Are our family's or business'  needs the exact same as they were last year? the year before that? Of  course not, because as we grow and develop, our needs change.   The short-term fixes of continuing resolutions ultimately obstruct  and hinder the military and its responsibility to secure our Nation.  The consequences of shutdown politics will ultimately compromise the  Department of Defense by inhibiting our military's ability to pursue  long-term projects and reforms.   The Department of Defense relies upon multiyear contracts for fighter  jets like the F-35, missile defense systems, and other advanced  weapons. This is because contracts are usually the most cost-effective  means to pay for military equipment.   At Luke Air Force Base, which is in my district, I have heard  repeatedly how uncertainty in the defense budget and the restrictions  that come from continuing resolutions have stalled the Air Force's F-35  fighter jet program. This is not acceptable. We must change how we do  business and fund our single most important responsibility in Congress:  our national defense.   We all agree that we must provide a common defense for our country,  and we need to stop letting political grandstanding get in the way of  that. We have worked too hard to begin rebuilding our military in a  meaningful way to let shutdown politics put our Nation at risk.   While I am pleased and proud at what the House has done, that we have  done our job and voted to approve both the National Defense  Authorization Act and the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for  fiscal year 2019, our work is not done. We must work with our  counterparts in the Senate to ensure these bills are signed into law.   We cannot stop falling back on continuing resolutions to determine  our military's defense budget. We must keep working for the men and  women who put their lives at risk every day to defend our freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Virginia, Representative  Wittman, for his commitment to our military.    Mr. Speaker, yes, we have Luke Air Force Base in my  district in Arizona. And it is not only a powerful base for the defense  of our Nation; it is the largest training base for our fighter jets in  the entire Nation. We have F-35s. Prior to that, we had F-16s.   Just like everything else, just like a family, we need to know what  our budget is long term, because we need to train our fighter pilots.  We need to know how many hours of funding we have to do that. We need  to have a reliable amount of money that we can depend on in order to  enter contracts.   So this whole continuing resolution thing, we really need to get past  that.   I was the senate appropriations chairman in Arizona, and I heard over  and over and over again from businesses that: We just need something to  rely on. We need something that is steady.   And that is what we need. We need to pass a budget that really puts  the defense of our country front and center because, after all, that is  Congress' number one job.
