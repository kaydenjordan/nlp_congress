 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about our economy and  the state of the American workforce.   With reforms enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as needed  regulatory relief, nearly every economic indicator is pointing up. The  latest U.S. jobs report shows our economy is at its strongest rate in  13 years. Unemployment is at a record low across the board. Wages are  growing at the fastest level in over a decade. Business investment is  strong. Best of all, American families are keeping more money in their  pockets. But new success brings a new set of challenges.   The number of job openings in the U.S. hit a record high last month  of 7.3 million. We have gone from, ``Where are the jobs?'' to, ``Where  are the workers?'' While it may seem positive that there are more jobs  open than workers to fill them, I fear that, without addressing the  needs of our workforce, we will stifle our incredible economic growth.   According to a study conducted by the National Federation of  Independent Business, 22 percent of business owners cite the difficulty  in finding workers as their single most important business problem. I  hear this from every employer I meet with in my district. The number of  job openings is staggering and must be addressed.

These individuals operate companies that fill positions ranging from  temporary to permanent work in various industries. Between these  staffing companies, they would be able to fill thousands of jobs today  if they could find the necessary workers. Every day, these positions go  unfilled and opportunities are lost.   To help alleviate this situation, I plan on introducing legislation  to help build a workforce pipeline.   One bill, the USA Workforce Tax Credit Act, which I will be  introducing next week, encourages charitable donations for community- based apprenticeship initiatives, career and technical education,  workforce development, and K-12 educational preparedness.   Enacting this proposed legislation will help meet the urgent need to  ensure the preparation of current and future workers for the changing  needs of the U.S. economy. Job creation and job preparation must go  hand in hand.   Another area we must evaluate to help fill out workforce shortages is  our Nation's visa system. Our current system spans the spectrum of  foreign work visas, but does not address a main driver of illegal  immigration.   My bill, the Workforce for an Expanding Economy Act, would help  address the gap in the spectrum. This legislation will create a market- driven immigration visa program targeted to workers in occupations that  do not require a college degree, otherwise defined as ``less skilled''  to do year-round, non-farm work, creating a new ``H-2D visa.'' This H- 2D visa would only go into effect if the unemployment rate is 5 percent  or lower in the metropolitan area where an employer is seeking  employees.   Moreover, this bill would implement a two-track system in which  employers and potential immigrant laborers are both required to receive  a permit to work in the U.S.   Much like our other visa programs, employers will have to prove they  are unable to hire a U.S. worker after undergoing the required market  tests. Employees are only allowed to work for an approved employer, at  the approved location, in the specific job that was approved, and all  employers will be required to use E-Verify.   While just a start, Mr. Speaker, I believe these bills will help  strengthen our workforce and help meet the needs of employers to  continue supporting our economic growth. I urge my colleagues to  support them and to help continue our country's track record of success  and keep us on the right economic path.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, March is Women's History Month, and I am  proud to honor some remarkable women in my district.   Today, I would like to recognize Ms. Joan Espenshade, a woman from  Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who gave back to our community by creating an  extraordinary program to feed those in need.   In 2005, Joan learned that some local children were food insecure on  weekends when the school's free lunch program was not available to  them, so she decided to step in and help parents make better use of  their limited food dollars.   She founded the Power Packs Project to provide food and nutritional  information to low-income families. Not only did she help those  families, but Power Packs now extends to 45 schools in 13 districts  with 350 volunteers.   Joan stepped down as president of Power Packs after 9 years in 2014,  but her vision and impact can still be seen as the program continues  today.   We are thankful for people like Joan who remind us of the importance  of caring for those in need. It is an honor to recognize her today.                            ____________________
