 Mr. President, today, I want to remember Bill  Coors, who passed away on October 13, 2018, at the age of 102 years  old. I want to recognize Bill's dedication to the State of Colorado and  the Coors Brewing Company, which he helped build.   Bill was born on August 11, 1916, and started his work at Coors after  finishing a graduate degree at Princeton University; by 1959, he had  become chairman of the company. During his tenure, he was known for  innovation and creativity. As if pioneering the aluminum can weren't  enough, Bill then strengthened similar recycling efforts through  buyback programs for returned cans.   ``Barley is to beer as grapes are to wine.'' These are words that  Bill uttered often and emphasized his understanding that only the best  ingredients can make the best beer. He was committed to relationships  with barley growers in the San Luis Valley of Colorado, some of whom  have been growing for Coors since 1949. For Bill's 100th birthday in  2016, barley growers honored his commitment to them by naming a barley  strain after him, known as the Bill Coors 100.   Bill believed in family values, and his employees were a part of his  family. He placed great emphasis on working together, saying, ``We  don't believe in a `you' and a `we'. We believe in `us'.'' With this  commitment to driving progress as a whole, Bill was able to transform  Coors from a once regional brewery to one of the most recognized names  in beer across the country.   The values and morals that Bill instilled in the Coors Brewery  Company are the same that we hold dear in Colorado. Bill will be  remembered for his dedication to Coors and for the work he did to  advance the prosperity of our great State.                            ____________________
