 ``Aloha.'' I send a question to the desk for the House  managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Hirono for the House managers reads as  follows:         In contrast to arguments by the President's counsel, acting       White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney stated that       President Trump held up aid to Ukraine to get his       politically-motivated investigations. He claimed: ``We do       that all the time with foreign policy'' and ``Get over it.''       What was different about President Trump's withholding of aid       to Ukraine from prior aid freezes? Are you aware of any other       Presidents who have withheld foreign aid as a bribe to       extract personal benefits?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, Senator.   I will respond to the question, but let me begin with something in  the category of: You can't make this stuff up.   Today, while we have been debating whether a President can be  impeached for essentially bogus claims of privilege for attempting to  use the courts to cover up misconduct, the Justice Department, in  resisting House subpoenas, is in court today and was asked: Well, if  the Congress can't come to the court to enforce subpoenas because, as  we know, they are in here arguing, Congress must go to court to enforce  its subpoenas, but they are in the court saying: Congress, thou shall  not do that, so the judge says: If the Congress can't enforce its  subpoenas in court, then what remedy is there? And the Justice  Department lawyers' response is impeachment--impeachment. You can't  make this up. I mean, what more evidence do we need of the bad faith of  this effort to cover up?   I said the other day they are in this court making this argument;  they are down the street making the other argument. I didn't think they  would make it on the same day, but that is exactly what is going on.   Now, in response to the question about how is this aid different,  this hold different from other holds, it is certainly appropriate to  ask that question.   The laws Congress passed authorizing this appropriation did not allow  for the hold by this President. And as the GAO--the Government  Accountability Office--found, it violated the law to hold the aid the  way it did.   Once the Department of Defense, in consultation with the Department  of State, certified that Ukraine had met the anti-corruption benchmarks  required under the law, there was nothing that would allow for a hold.  The money had to flow.   And that was intentional. Military assistance to Ukraine is critical  to our national security. It has overwhelming bipartisan support.   And recall that in the spring of 2019, the Defense Department  certified Ukraine had met all of the anti-corruption benchmarks. The  Department of State sent the Senate a letter saying that the benchmarks  had been met. It issued a press release saying that the aid was moving  forward. It began to spend the funds to help Ukraine, but then the  President stepped in. Without legal authority, he secretly had placed a  hold on the aid.   Now, the President's counsel, in their presentation, gives specific  examples of past holds, as if we cannot distinguish one for a corrupt  reason and one that is for a policy reason.   In many of their examples, the law explicitly provided the executive  branch the authority to pause, reevaluate, or cancel foreign aid  programs as the situation in a recipient country evolved.   For example, with regard to foreign assistance to El Salvador,  Honduras, or Guatemala, the law explicitly allows  [[Page S702]]  the Secretary of State to ``suspend, in whole or in part'' that  ``assistance'' if at any time the Secretary deems ``that sufficient  progress has not been made by a central government.''   On a host of priorities, from respecting human rights to upholding  the law, those are the priorities that you, the Senate, agreed to, and  the President was required to implement them; similarly, aid to  Afghanistan, the subject of periodic reevaluations by law. And the law  explicitly directs the Secretary of State should ``suspend assistance  for the Government of Afghanistan'' should be it assessed that the  Afghan Government is ``failing to make measurable progress'' in meeting  certain anti-corruption, human rights, and counterterrorism benchmarks.   The overthrow of the democratically elected Government in Egypt, we  have had that brought up as another example. Members of this body,  including Senators McCain, Leahy, and Graham, pressed the Obama  administration to suspend military aid. It wasn't hidden from the  Senate. It was urged on the administration by the Senate. Senators  pressed for that aid to be withheld because the law was clear, in  instances of a military coup, aid must be suspended. Senators McCain  and Graham wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post:         Not all coups are created equal, but a coup is still a       coup. Morsi--    That is the deposed leader of Egypt.       was elected by a majority of voters, and U.S. law requires       the suspension of foreign assistance.    I could go on and on with examples. No one has suggested you can't  condition aid, but I would hope that we would all agree that you can't  condition aid for a corrupt purpose, to try to get a foreign power to  cheat in your election.   Now, counsel says that if you decide the prosecution has proved that  he engaged in this corrupt scheme, if you decide, as impartial jurors,  that the Constitution requires his removal from office, that the public  will not accept your judgment. I have more confidence in the American  people.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.    Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Hawaii.    I send a question to the desk for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Hirono is for the House managers:         Can you talk about what has happened to whistleblowers when       they have been outed against their will? What are the       consequences of revealing their identity, particularly when       we have a President who has tried to bully and threaten       impeachment witnesses?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, I don't know that we can give you  examples of whistleblowers who were the subject of retaliation,  although I have no doubt that there are many. We can seek by the latter  part of this evening to get a list of some of the whistleblowers that  have confronted retaliation.   But I--this does give me an opportunity to speak a little more--in a  more fulsome way about a point I made earlier about the unique  importance of whistleblowers in the intelligence community.   Our area of intelligence is unique in this respect. If you are a  whistleblower who wants to blow the whistle on a fraudulent contract in  a transportation project, you can go public. If you are blowing the  whistle on misconduct in the area of housing, you can go public. You  can have a press conference, and you can declare the wrongdoing that  you have seen.   If you are a whistleblower in the intelligence community, however,  you cannot go public. You have no recourse to bring to the public's  attention wrongdoing, except one of really two vehicles. You can go to  an Intelligence Committee or you can go to the inspector general.   And in this area, where our hearings are in closed session, where you  don't have outside stakeholders that can point out the flaws in what an  agency is representing, if you are on the Transportation Committee and  someone comes in and they say: This high-speed rail project is on time  and under budget, you have outside validators and stakeholders that can  say that is just not true.   In the intel world where our hearings are in closed session, there  are not outside stakeholders that are listening, that can hold those  agencies to account. And so we are uniquely dependent when there is  wrongdoing on two things: self-reporting by the agencies and the  willingness of people of good faith to come forward and blow the  whistle.   And we do injury to that when we expose those whistleblowers to  retaliation. I don't think any of us would have imagined a circumstance  in which a President of the United States before now would have called  a whistleblower a traitor or a spy or suggested that people that blow  the whistle on his wrongdoing are traitors and spies, and we should  treat them as we used to treat traitors and spies.   I don't think we could have imagined a circumstance where a President  of the United States would have told a foreign leader that the U.S.  Ambassador--our anti-corruption champion in Ukraine--was ``going to go  through some things.'' I don't think we could have imagined that  happening before this Presidency. And sometimes you just have to step  back and realize just how striking and abhorrent this is and what a  risk it is to civility, to decency, to our institutions.   We have become inured to it through endless repetition of attacks on  anyone who will stand up to this President. And, of course, the risk  is--the very reason we have a whistleblower protection, the very reason  why whistleblowers should enjoy a right of anonymity, is that in the  absence of that, misconduct and wrongdoing will proliferate. If there  is not a mechanism for people lawfully to expose wrongdoing, you can  bet that wrongdoing is going to increase. And that is why there have  been great champions, like Senator Grassley, of whistleblower  protections, Senator Burr and Senator Warner, and many others, because  we all understand--at least we did heretofore--the vital importance and  contributions that are made by American citizens who bring wrongdoing  to our attention.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.
