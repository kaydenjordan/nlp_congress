 Mr. Speaker, I rise with a message on the  passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that I shared with my beloved  synagogue, Congregation T'chiyah, on Zoom during Saturday's Rosh  Hashanah service just before we said the Mourner's Kaddish.   We have to resist what may be our first impulse over the loss of  Justice Ginsburg, the horror of it. When people die, it is hard to step  back from their circumstances, the circumstances of their death, in  order to imbibe the lesson of their life, isn't it? Especially in  circumstances like this.   Instead, let us consider this woman. A tiny person. A modest person.  A young wife who helped her husband with his schoolwork, only turning  to her own in the middle of the night. A woman who, nevertheless,  finished at the top of her law school class. A brilliant lawyer no law  firm would hire because she had ovaries, and heaven forfend, was a  mother.   A person then pushed into teaching and given the space for advocacy.  The system, by discriminating against her, set up a mighty campaign to  fell discrimination.   The very architect of the assault against legal discrimination  against women who, following in the footsteps of Thurgood Marshall, the  lawyer, not the Justice, carefully disassembled the wall excluding  women from all manner of rights, brick by carefully chosen brick.   The appeals court judge who was not President Clinton's first choice  to join the Supreme Court, but who blew him away with her charismatic  anti-charisma, her directness, lack of artifice, and legal brilliance  so plain that it shone Sun-like.  [[Page H4890]]    For nearly three decades, a Supreme Court Justice who hammered out  brave decisions and dissents that shone a light toward the future of  dignity and justice for all, for which we all long, and on these High  Holy Days we reaffirm faithfully is a possible and, indeed, necessary  future.   A teacher-Justice, who crafted these decisions in a manner not only  meant to make law in the moment, but to teach future Justices, lawyers,  and the general public how law and power function in the real world.   In the end, the Justice-turned-icon, Notorious RBG, the most unlikely  rock star, whose seeming diminutive frailty was the falsest thing about  her, hiding a will of steel, that galloping mind, and a glint in her  eye that told every girl: I am with you; and indeed: You are me; we are  one.   Why must we breathe in the full measure of this person before we turn  to the tragedy of her death at this incredible low point in the history  of our Nation? Why can't we just turn with anxiety and determination to  the next fight, the fight over RBG's replacement? Because in pausing to  appreciate Ruth Bader Ginsburg fully, we see the importance of  brilliant strategy and steely determination and good humor.   Reflecting on her astounding accomplishments, we realize that justice  can win in the end. Amidst our tears, we realize we have no choice but  to listen to her, and to John Lewis, and others we have lost in a  moment of turmoil when we need them most, to study their ways, pick up  their tools, and march on towards justice.   You want a Rosh Hashanah that tests your faith? Try losing RBG to  start things off. You want to make 5781 a year of hope and joy? Try  taking immense pride in the outsize accomplishments of this tiny Jew  and vowing to make her proud of us. Only then, after we immerse  ourselves in prayer, reflection, and intention-setting, will we be  fully ready to meet the coming moment.                            ____________________
