 Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Indiana (Mr.  Hollingsworth).                      Costly and Burdensome Regulations     Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons for taking this  time--and it was only about 3 weeks ago we actually took the leadership  hour and we did a series of presentations on what was happening in debt  and the excessive spending in the Federal Government, what was driving  it and what was happening with mandatory spending. Then the very next  morning, CBO issued an update.   Have you ever had one of those moments in your life where you just  spent almost an hour on the floor walking through the numbers, and you  get a document and you start digging into it, and you find out a number  of the things you presented just 14 hours earlier were wrong? But,  sadly, they were wrong in the wrong direction, if there is such a way  to phrase it.   Think of this: From January's Congressional Budget Office number  until June's number, the U.S. debt deficit this year, the U.S. deficit  this year, grew by $134 billion as our projection for the end of the  year. So, functionally, the deficit for 2017, the fiscal year we are  in, we will come very close to $700 billion this year.                                time  1900    It is going to be 693 is the projection. And if anyone saw--I think  it was yesterday or the day before--Mick Mulvaney over at OMB, was  projecting, from the White House's calculations, that the deficit this  year was going to be about $704 billion.   So we put together this slide next to me just to make it clear how  much that is, to just sort of understand what is going on and trying to  put this in perspective.   Okay. So we are going to use the CBO number because, you know, it is  the Congressional Budget Office. So $693 billion is going to be  borrowed for 2017, the year we are in right now.   Well, think about that. That is $1.89 billion every single day. That  is $79 million every hour; $1.3 million every minute. And, what, $1,900  every second? And that is what we are borrowing. So if I take up an  hour here, you all get to make a decision if my hour here was worth $79  million of borrowing.   Why is this sort of devastating in the numbers when you really start  to dig into this CBO report?   Well, first let me give you one of the things that bothered me the  most. This is a big deal when, from January to June, our excessive  spending and borrowing number actually increases by 25 percent and it  got almost zero press.   We are living in a society right now where, if there is a shiny  object, a tweet, another story, the press, even a lot of the Members of  this body, run talk about that. And I will make you the argument that  the greatest systemic threat to this society are these numbers because  the fact we are going to borrow $134 billion more than we were already  projecting, it is worse than that.   If you were to step back 1 year ago, 1 year ago we thought this  year's deficit was going to be about $450 billion. I mean, it is still  outrageous. In a year's time that number now is kissing up to $700  billion this year.   To understand the scale of that, we are going to actually do some of  our slides. And the first one we are going to put up is the slide from  3 weeks ago, and the punch line on it is the numbers are worse than  this. I just wasn't going to use up a whole bunch of ink and print a  new one. But this is important to understand.   So this is where we think we are going. This is what is in the CBO  report. But do you see actually the blue areas? That is sort of  spending that is on autopilot. When we say autopilot, it is by formula.  You reach a certain age, you get certain benefits. You fall below a  certain income, you get certain benefits. We borrow money, we pay back  the interest. You have served honorably in the military, you qualify  for certain benefits.   But this is 2026, so this is functionally 9 budget years from now.  Understand where we will be. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, other  things that are formula driven, you fall below a certain income, you  get interest on the debt.   And you start to realize only 22 percent of all spending in 9 years  will be things that functionally get voted on here. Everything else  will be by formula. Your government is very quickly becoming a health  insurer with an army, an insurance company with an army.   What is fascinating is--think about this--this year we are going to  kiss up close to $700 billion in borrowing. That is more than all  discretionary spending on nonmilitary discretionary spending. So think  about that. If you came to me and said, ``David, I want you to only  spend exactly what you are taking in right now,'' you get to help me  make a decision. If I am not allowed to touch mandatory spending, the  entitlements, do you remove the entire military, or do you remove  everything else you think of as government, the Park Service, the FDA,  the FBI?   Everything else is government because all of that is living on  borrowed money. And somehow we desperately must find a way for the  American public to understand the scale and how quickly these numbers  are moving away from us.   In 5 years, so those folks who are 60 years old today, they are at  the peak of what we call the ``Baby Boom.'' So in 5 years from now, we  actually hit the peak of our brothers and sisters who will receive  their retirement benefits, if they take them at 65. And you start to  look at the numbers. And we are going to--let's switch to the next  slide. And you will actually start to see that curve steepening.   We are going to show a slide in a couple of boards from here that  starts to show you at what point we are running these trillion-dollar  deficits.   The next point I also wanted to make that was here in the CBO report  is, when we borrow an additional $134 billion on top of what we already  projected--so close to $700 billion this year--that is now part of the  rolling debt. That is part of--now we are going to be paying interest  on that for generations because our inflection point to  [[Page H6035]]  pay down the debt is moving farther away from us every day because--you  saw the previous slide--every day we are borrowing pretty close to $1.9  billion every single day.   So why this slide is important is--just understand--in 9 budget  years, if you said, ``David, I want you to deal with the debt. I don't  want you to do it today because I don't want to lose any benefits. I  don't want to talk about the complications of what happens if we had to  deal with the reality of trying to make the combination of making the  economy grow and having to deal with entitlement reform,'' but in 9  years, only 11 percent of the budget would be nondefense, non- entitlement.   And the amazing thing is, that number will stay almost identical for  the next 10 years. So almost all the growth, a trillion-plus dollars of  growth in those 9 years is coming almost solely from Medicare,  Medicaid, Social Security, interest on the debt, veterans' benefits,  but mostly Medicare.   It is really difficult to talk about, but if you actually look in the  CBO numbers, you understand, we have a couple of our key trust funds  that start to run out of money within the 10-year window. So let's  actually switch slides and try to--and a couple of these are going to  be repetitive for a point, so it starts to become more absorbable of  what is actually really going on in these underlying numbers.    So we put this one together just to sort of have a sense of what has  happened. What happened from when we were estimating in 2016, the  Congressional Budget Office gave us a number, so this is a year ago. We  were building our budgets. We were building our projections. We were  building our cost analysis on how much interest financing, these  things. This is a year ago. We thought we were going to borrow $544  billion, still an outrageous amount of money.   Here we are a year later and we are going to come close to $700  billion. Then in January, from a year ago--so this last January--it  moved up to, hey, we are going to borrow $559 billion. Not a lot of  movement. And then 6 months later, it blows off the charts. And now all  of a sudden, we know from the CBO number, it is $693 billion of  borrowing this year.   The OMB number, I know the chart over here I think is saying 702. I  could swear I saw 704, but let's just call it $700 billion.   This is an intense frustration because, if you actually listen to  many of us as we get behind these mikes, we will argue and fight and  fuss often on things that, when you actually add them up, are pretty  small, sometimes bordering on petty, that don't really have a  multiplier effect into the future.   Yet, how much discussion have you heard behind these microphones in  the last 3 weeks, since the CBO report came out, the update came out  that, hey, from January to June, somehow the number just grew by 25  percent; we just added another $134 billion of borrowing this year?   This isn't way off into the future. It is this year. And guess what.  We are going to be financing that for as long as anyone who is probably  watching this or listening to this in this room is alive.   Can we go to the next slide. We are heading toward a time where the  growth of this debt, the growth in mandatory spending is moving to  crushing everything else we care about. So if you happen to be someone  who is a Member of this body and you care passionately about education,  you must understand that the mandatory spending is going to crush it.   If you care about the environment and other programs, the finding  resources to pay for those things is gone.   If you care desperately about defense, defense is going to be  competing for scarcer and scarcer dollars because those dollars are  promised in our mandatory spending, our entitlements.   So the only reason I threw this one up was just getting a sense that  just the movement from January to June--the chart may not look like a  big deal, but we are dealing with hundreds of billions of dollars here.   You see that little separation between the red line and the blue  line?   That separation is 6 months. This isn't a game. It shouldn't be  partisan. The numbers are the numbers, and Congress cannot continue to  exist in a math-free zone.   So--and I am sorry. This is actually--I have toned down my charts  because I was getting made fun of by making too many of them, and,  actually, I was. I think I killed one of the big printers here on  Capitol Hill, but that is another discussion.   So let's actually sort of look at this one. This is functionally 2017  to 2027. So the 10-year window, which we use constantly around here.  Just understand what this constant growth of the debt does in the mix  of our priorities that we are able to pay for.   Where is the money? Where does it ultimately come from? Where does it  go?   So if we are here right now, the first bar is spending. The second  bar is revenues or pay-fors or mechanics. You know, some of it is  borrowing, some of it is payroll taxes, and other things. Then the same  thing for 2027.   So let's first take a look at where we are at right now, and this is  by gross domestic product. So they tell me this is a much more elegant  way to sort of understand how much of our society's economy is going  into finance government--is going into finance government's debt. And  none of these numbers have State and local. This is just us at the  Federal Government level.   So take a look. This year, hey, about 1.4 percent of our GDP, of the  economic muscle of our society is going into financing our excessive  spending, our debt. In 10 years, it is 2.9 percent. So it is the entire  economy, close to 3 percent of it is going to be grabbed just to pay  for debt.   But when you also start to look at--you see that black portion on the  top? In 2017, the excessive spending here, without revenue--so it is  borrowing--is 3.6 percent of our entire GDP went to borrowing. In 10  years, it is 5.2, and it keeps growing, and it really starts to take  off.   Remember we had the comment ``in 5 years, we hit the peak of the Baby  Boom moving into retirement.'' And if you see the curve, it steepens  and, over the next couple of decades, it blows off the charts.   So you actually start to look at the mix of: What are our resources?  What do we have?   Well, let's just go to the 2027. So that is this. So, functionally, 6  percent of our entire economy will be going to Social Security; 6.9  percent of our GDP will be going to healthcare programs. Another 2.5  percent of our society's GDP will be going to other mandatory programs.   Only 5.4 will be going to everything we call discretionary, and part  of that is also defense. So about half of that will be defense and half  of that will be other discretionary programs.                                time  1915    This is where we are moving prioritywise. The growth of these  programs consume everything in their path.   One of the things we actually talked about 3 weeks ago when we were  behind this microphone--look, there are demographic changes, but when I  was a kid, $4 were spent for young people for every dollar that was  spent for our, what we will call, seniors. Today, that is reversed.  Today, we will spend $4 for seniors for every dollar spent for young  people, and that curve continues to move away from us. So just  understand, that is the decision this body, this society, has made as  our priorities.   Now, why this slide is so incredibly important to understand, if you  see the blue there--and, look, I am blessed to be on the Social  Security Committee in Ways and Means. We just had the actuary report,  and Social Security has problems, but it is not a crisis. It is  fixable. As a matter of fact, any well meaning people, a handful of  them could get in a room and in a day fix the unfunded liabilities,  which I think is 22, $24 trillion over the 75-year window for Social  Security.   What should terrify you are the numbers I am about to point out that  are actually within Medicare. Let's actually just sort of reach over  here, and forgive me for leaning over. Let's say you are 50 years old  today. We are going to use 65 as the benchmark for retirement. You are  going to be retiring in 2030. You see the gray here? Over your career,  over your work life, the average person who will be retiring in 2030  will have put in $179,000 into Medicare.  [[Page H6036]]    But do you see this side? They are going to receive $621,000 in  benefits. The person who is 60 years old today, in the average, and  these are means, the person who is 60 today, retiring in 5 years, will  have paid $179,000 in part of their FICA tax going to Medicare. Over  their years of retirement, because of longevity, because of healthcare  costs, because of a series of different things, they are going to take  out $621,000.   Now, I need you to start to multiply those types of differentials  where we put in this, we are taking this out, and multiply it times 76  million of our brothers and sisters who we define as baby boomers.   Do you see the math problem?   This slide isn't from some conservative group. I believe it is from  the Urban Institute. This is just reality.   Let's say you happen to be my most liberal constituent, and you care  desperately about the preservation of these entitlements and of  Medicare. You should be the first one lining up with me and others  around here from both sides of the aisle saying: We must do two key  things. We must adopt policies that maximize economic growth, because  whether it be tax reform, whether it be regulatory reform, whether it  be immigration reform, all these things, but primarily tax reform, we  must do those policies that drive economic growth, because a growing  economy solves a lot of problems, but it doesn't come close to dealing  with these types of shortfalls.   So the second thing that must be done, and it is going to take fair- minded people on both sides of the aisle, we are going to have to do  entitlement reform. It is just the math.   When someone gets behind one of these microphones or is running for  office and they say, ``Well, if we just get rid of waste and fraud, or  if we just get rid of foreign aid, or if we just get rid of this,'' I  am sorry, they need to go out and invest in a calculator. That is not  what the underlying numbers say.   And to try to double down on a couple of these points, to understand  how fast these numbers are moving away from us, in 2022--it sounds like  a long time from now, but, look, we are working on the 2018 budget  right now. So, what, four budget years from now? Every year, we are  going to be running a $1 trillion deficit, and it grows and grows. That  $1 trillion of borrowing in 2022 has to be financed.   We are working on this chart. It is a little more complicated, so you  are not going to see it for another month or so. As you are borrowing  more money and interest rates go up, you do understand it is not just  the money we are borrowing this year. When we move up the interest  rates because we are out there in the markets sucking up the capital,  pulling the capital in, when we raise interest rates, there are about  $2.5 trillion of our $14-plus trillion of publicly held debt that is  refinanced every year. So it is not just the interest we pay on new  borrowing. Like, right now, almost $1.9 billion had to be borrowed  today. It is not just the interest we are going to pay on that, but it  is the effect on everything that is refinanced every year, every day,  every month, every quarter, because as those interest rates move up, we  have to change the financing.   Just understand, when you look at this chart just how fast--and this  is just the borrowing number--how it explodes away from us. So in 2027,  10 years from now, annual deficit, $1.463 trillion of just borrowing.  That is 9 budget years from now.   You realize, if you add that up, I believe that is more than all  military and all other discretionary spending we are spending today.  Please understand how fast these numbers are moving away from us and  start demanding that we, as Members of Congress, toughen up and do  those things that are really difficult, really hard, and the  willingness to tell the truth of what is driving these debts and  deficits.   My primary reason for putting up this chart is that I am a huge fan  that we have to do sort of this holistic approach, that it is now  incumbent upon us as policymakers to do everything and do everything at  once. You can't just have us say we need to do healthcare reform  because almost no one in the country who is outside that world is  paying attention to what it is doing to the debt and deficit, blowing  them off the charts.   Then we have those of us who are focused right now on doing tax  reform. We talk about our book of specialty, and people who care about  immigration, care about this, care about that. The reality is we have  to do it all. We have to do it all at the same time to maximize  economic growth.    The GDP indicator today from the Atlanta Fed, we call it GDPNow--it  is a wonderful website. It is a great app--I think has us at 2.5  percent GDP. Okay. That is better than we have been.   The new CBO baseline built into this next 10-year projection is  saying 1.9 percent GDP growth. That is unacceptable because these  numbers continue to remain incredibly ugly if we grow at that speed.  But if we were to be at 3, 3.5, the numbers get much easier to deal  with. But this chart is really important and a little tough to absorb,  but it basically demonstrates, even with additional growth, we are  still going to have to do entitlement reform, and it is going to have  to be on a fairly large scale.   Growth makes it just a lot easier and makes it so we can do a much  longer onramp for our brothers and sisters who are right now planning  for retirement or other benefit programs that are out there.   So in this next slide, I wanted to show it because I wanted to  actually use it to talk about--I know right now there is a lot of  consternation of what is happening over in the Senate in regards to  healthcare, and I think constantly there is a lot of misinformation  about the healthcare bill we did here in the House, what I have read of  what has been worked on in the Senate.   So let's first get a couple things very clear. If you hear a  commentator, if you are someone behind one of these mics, talk about,  ``Well, it is one-sixth of the economy and that is what is in this  bill,'' they didn't read the bill.   The ACA replacement is almost exclusively about the small portion of  our society that is in the individual market. They don't get their  healthcare from an employer. They don't get their healthcare from  Medicare. They don't get their healthcare from the VA. They don't get  their healthcare from Indian Health Service or TRICARE or all these  other ways. They are the plumber. They are my wife and I when we were  running our own business.   In my congressional district, it is only 2 percent of my population.  In my State, it is only 4 percent of my population. That was the  population that was having great difficulties if they held a  preexisting condition. Well, this society now, we have all come to  terms, we are a guaranteed-issue society. That was in our bill when it  passed. But that is still a tiny portion of the society that is in that  individual market. In a State like mine, Arizona, you have a single  choice, huge price hikes, and none of that was what was promised.   When you start to look at the math on the deductibles and then the  price, so many of our brothers and sisters out there who should be in  that individual market are basically saying: I would rather pay the  fine; let them try to catch me. Because we have already talked about  them. We did a whole presentation, I think, about 6 weeks ago, 2 months  ago, that were in this ratcheting problem. Half of our population who  should be in that individual market, let's just call them the healthy,  50 percent of that population who only use about 3 percent of the  healthcare dollars, they basically said: It is too expensive; I am not  buying.   But every time someone who is a part of that healthy portion of the  curve says ``Yeah, you have mandatory purchase, but I am still not  going to buy'' and doesn't purchase, you end up in this ratcheting  effect. And the ratcheting effect, it gets more expensive, so more drop  out; gets more expensive, more drop out. And that has been the crisis  that is the ACA. Most people know it as ObamaCare, but to be  respectful, let's call it the ACA.   It has an actuarial, structural death spiral. So our attempt was:  Could you do a series of things that would lower the premiums enough  for that 50 percent of the population who only uses 3 percent of the  healthcare dollars to get them to actually buy? Mandatory. Hasn't  worked. Maybe really well-priced coverage would work, because when they  participate, the curve flattens out. Because right now, it looks like a  hockey stick, and we know there  [[Page H6037]]  is functionally a tiny percent of our population, I think it is like 5  percent of the population, equals almost 50 percent of all the  spending.   So the reason this chart is up here, we were trying to find an  elegant way to try to say those of us who, like myself, I have fairly  severe asthma, but folks with chronic conditions, diabetes,  particularly if it is not managed, other things, that is actually 84  percent of all healthcare costs.   When we did the risk-sharing amendment for the ACA replacement bill,  we were trying to fixate on that continuity of care. How do you finance  that continuity of care for our brothers and sisters, particularly  those who have those chronic conditions, to make sure that is  continuity of care between themselves, their doctors, their healthcare  institution, the insurer? I thought we did a fairly elegant job of  drafting that and then putting real resources behind it.   But this is important to understand, the outlier of our brothers and  sisters out there, those of us who have preexisting conditions or who  have chronic conditions, end up being the cost drivers in our  healthcare.   So our ability to be creative, our ability to say: If you have one of  those in your pocket, can this actually be part of your healthcare  management? Are we going to accept the reality that someone with a  chronic condition should be allowed to pick up their phone and use  FaceTime to talk to their doctor?                                time  1930    Should a poor person be allowed to use their phone to consult their  doctor? Should they be allowed to wear sensors and other things? There  are some incredibly creative things rolling onto the market there to  help our brothers and sisters with chronic illness. This body needs to  be prepared to adopt them, because here is the punch line: whether it  had been the ACA, whether it had been a replacement, had almost nothing  actually to do with healthcare. It had to do with who pays. This was  about the money: who pays, who gets the money.   Because remember, it was in 1986--31 years ago--a piece of  legislation was passed basically saying you cannot deny someone medical  services. You show up to the emergency room, you show up in the  hospital, you are getting your medical services, and you can actually  see this in the data. For the last 30 years, the number of procedures,  particularly the stuff it costs, has been laid much the same.   So when you have people saying, ``Oh, you are not going to be able to  get healthcare,'' we have been a society for 30-plus years that has  sort of a guarantee of delivery of health services. The great battle is  who pays.   Do you remember a few years ago when we had the great consternation  of dispro share, uncompensated care. I worked on those issues. And now  all of these years later, we are basically trying to make an argument  of who pays, how do we pay, how do we get more healthy--that is 20-,  30-, 40-year-olds who are healthy, how do we get more of them,  particularly in the individual markets, to participate?   Then the second half is Medicaid. This is a strange city because it  is one of those cities, when you actually look at the dollars, even  though the dollars are going to continue to grow and grow and grow, so  many people define that as a cut. But remember, we were looking at the  exploding deficit debt numbers. We have to deal with the reality. We  are in real trouble, and we are going to have to step up and start  being honest with each other about what is happening in the underlying  math here.   So I know this is a little diversion from what was in the CBO report,  but once again, you saw on the charts that the healthcare and  healthcare entitlement numbers were substantially driving the deficits.  Now you actually sort of see what is in the underlying part of that  population.   We will go back to the beginning again. Hopefully, I haven't spoken  for a whole hour, for your sake and mine. But one more time: this year,  according to CBO, 3 weeks ago--and you have heard lots of talk about  it, right? That was me being sarcastic--$193 billion of borrowing this  year. We are going to borrow almost $1.9 billion every day, $79 million  every hour. I have been here an hour. Has this been worth $79 million  to you?   But think about it--and I know I misspoke earlier, so that is one of  the reasons I wanted to put this board up. It is $21,900, $21,900 every  second of borrowing.   I have a 21-month-old. It is the greatest gift the good Lord has ever  given my wife and me.   I pray for the birth mother every night, saying, ``Thank you.''   But if you look at the charts, when she hits her peak earning years,  her tax rates are going to be double, maybe even more, of what I would  pay today.   The economic growth is probably crushed by the amount of debt; and a  lot of the calculations, if we step out 30 years, the computers can't  even model them anymore. Because, understand, there are some amazing  numbers in here that functionally, in 9 budget years, we are at 91  percent debt to GDP on publicly held debt. That is not the money we  borrowed from the trust funds.   So the question I ask--I love my little girl. How many of you love  your kids? How many of you love your grandkids? How many of you love  this country? How many of you want this country to have an amazing  future, because it can. This is all fixable. Just every single day we  wait, we make it so much more difficult.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
