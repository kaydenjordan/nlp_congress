 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise to oppose  antisemitism as well as all forms of hate on college campuses and  wherever else it may exist.   Today I address the Congress to associate myself with the comments  made during debate on H. Res. 927 by the Honorable Jamie Raskin and the  Honorable Kathy Manning. Both of these esteemed leaders highlight the  nuance necessary when discussing issues of campus speech and  antisemitism. Representative Raskin's and Representative Manning's  remarks are insightful, and I, generally speaking, endorse their  sentiments as sufficient explanations for my vote against the  resolution.
