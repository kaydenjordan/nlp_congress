 Mr. Speaker, abandoning the commitments we made  in the Paris climate accord is a massive self-inflicted wound to our  environment, our global influence, and our economy. The damage caused  to our economy and environment by leaving the Paris Agreement is  undeniable, but it was also completely foreseeable. That is why the  first piece of legislation I wrote as a member of Congress called for  our country to keep the pledges we made in this agreement, the promises  we made to the world, and to ourselves.   Through his decision, the President is ceding American leadership in  the green economy to China, and kneecapping the global effort to  counter the effects of climate change. While the President has made his  choice, the rest of us can make ours.   We must continue to resist global climate change by expanding our  commitments to green technology and sustainable practices. If we do so,  we will not only address the challenges of our time, but also embrace  its opportunities.                            ____________________
