 Mr. President, before talking about some good news, I  think, for so many of us across the country, I want to just thank  Senator Murray for all of her leadership in the devastation she is  describing in Washington State. I know that our Presiding Officer, with  what is happening in Maui--the people of Hawaii are so fortunate to  have you and Senator Hirono, who are out every day describing what  needs to happen and pushing hard to make it happen.   We have a lot of issues that are really important, a lot of  devastation, a lot of extreme weather events; and we certainly  understand that the climate crisis is adding to all of what we are  seeing right now and the devastation. And it is critical--it is  critical--that we keep focused on that.
