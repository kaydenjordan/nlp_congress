 Mr. Speaker, last week, I voted in opposition to one of  the most radical attacks on the unborn that Congress has ever seen.   H.R. 3755, the abortion on demand bill would create a dangerous  national standard that would allow the execution of innocents solely  because of their race, sex, or disability.   Our Nation denounces those who devalue life. We condemn China and  North Korea for their human rights abuses, and yet, we must reconcile  with the fact that some of our Nation's leaders are devaluing the life  of American babies.   It is simple. Abortion is murder, and murder is wrong. ``Thou shalt  not kill'' is not a statement to reject for the sake of politics.   As a Catholic and a father, I will always defend the unborn. As a  conservative Congressman, I will continue fighting to keep taxpayer  dollars from being used to fund these violent procedures.   May God have mercy on us all.                            ____________________
