 Madam Speaker, and back to the subject of the resolution on  the floor, which is discrimination against any and all Americans on the  basis of their race.   As the proud Representative of the State and district with the  highest percentage of Asian Americans in this country, I rise today in  strong support of H. Res. 908 to condemn any and all forms of anti- Asian discrimination during and beyond this terrible pandemic.   Our country confronts not only the novel coronavirus but also a virus  of racism and hate. We cannot allow the one to feed off the other.   On behalf of all Americans, we have a moral responsibility to call  out and condemn this wave of racist hate speech, harassment,  discrimination, and physical violence driven by fear, disinformation,  and even purposeful exploitation.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  resolution without reservation and speak out against racism against any  group in any form at any time.
