 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I begin my remarks about the  nomination, I want to acknowledge that tonight, as we are here, there  are fires in many places across the State of Colorado. There are people  who are out of their homes and out of their communities, who have had  to evacuate their towns, and there are first responders on the ground  in Colorado who are fighting these fires bravely every single day.   They have been stretched all summer through a fire season that has  lasted into the fall because of our inability to deal with our forests  and because of climate change. My hope tonight, as we are here, is that  the snow that has fallen is going to be more of a benefit than a curse  to everybody who is out there.   So, with that, I thank the Presiding Officer for recognizing me, and  I will now give my remarks about this confirmation
