 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this measure. A collection of  minor, flawed bills was presented to our Subcommittee on Water, Oceans  and Wildlife a few months ago, and instead of correcting the flaws,  they have simply been repackaged and rebranded as a landmark climate  change bill.   The net result is the climate is going to continue to change and our  country will be about $1.5 billion a year poorer for it.   Take, for example, H.R. 1023 included in this package, it creates a  new Federal fishery monitoring program for the Great Lakes Basin. Well,  the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service already conduct similar fishery studies right now. Instead,  this bill would task an agency that has little experience in fishery,  science, and management, the U.S. Geological Survey, to do basically  the same thing.   And this is especially baffling since we are currently paying NOAA  some $28 million a year for ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes research,  and another $2.9 million for interjurisdictional fisheries grants,  which could be used for Great Lakes management and science.   Another measure is H.R. 2405, this reauthorizes NOAA's Sea Grant  Program, bumping it $10 million higher than currently appropriated, and  then increasing that authorization by nearly 5 percent annually  thereafter. This program is one that the President rightly sought to  eliminate in his budget in order to free up funding for NOAA to  complete its most important core functions.   Another bill in this package purports to modernize and enhance the  Coastal Zone Management Act. This is my favorite. What it actually does  is to place the seaside resort of Washington, D.C., into the Coastal  Zone Management Act. Now, I don't deny that Washington is a world-class  swamp, but it is not a coastal community, and placing it in a coastal  zone doesn't make it one. What it does do is to rob legitimate coastal  communities of funding and influence, and it opens the door to further  encroachments as more and more inland cities seek to claim coastal zone  status.   Another measure thrown into this package is H.R. 3115. This bill,  which never had a hearing and was rushed through markup, costs over  $631 million and inserts Federal priorities into coastal zone  management, which counters the CZMA's original intention of assessing  coastal management needs according to the unique and diverse conditions  and desires of the communities along our coast.                                time  1500    Another measure thrown into this package is H.R. 1314, which  reauthorizes the Integrated Ocean Observing System. Now, this system is  good. It provides data to coastal communities and local fishermen on  weather conditions. It is critical. So far, so good.   But then it follows up on very good public policy with very bad  fiscal policy by providing open, limitless authorization of funds for  the program. It should be amended to set specific authorization limits,  as Senate versions of the measure have done.   Madam Chair, I fail to see how this package would provide new  benefits to coastal States other than, apparently, the coastal  community of Washington, D.C. Further, NOAA already does most of the  work that this package claims to authorize. This is duplicative and  wasteful of our resources at a time when the Nation is running  dangerously high deficits.   And, as I said, it is going to require another $1.4 billion of  Federal spending; that is about $11 from the earnings of every family  in the country. I think that is an expensive press release for  something that does so little that we are not already doing.   And, with that, I would ask that the bill be rejected.
