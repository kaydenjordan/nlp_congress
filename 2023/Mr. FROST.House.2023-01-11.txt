 Madam Speaker, we heard the word ``shameful'' a lot during  this debate, but what is really shameful is the fact that my Democratic  colleagues and I are willing to both say we condemn all violence and  also put it on paper.   With my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, all we hear is  talk. They are not willing to condemn all violence in this resolution.   It is a one-sided resolution meant to fan the flames of anti-abortion  and anti-freedom sentiment in this country.   See, my district in central Florida sees these sentiments in action  as our Governor has passed an abortion ban and looks to go even  further.   As someone whose birth mother made the brave and difficult decision  to put me up for adoption, I recognize that that decision was deeply  personal and can often mark one of the most vulnerable points in a  person's life. No one should take advantage of that, and the Federal  Government should actually protect it.   I will continue to fight for civil rights, personal freedom, and  bodily autonomy of women and childbearing adults in this country, and I  hope the rest of this Chamber will join me in voting ``no.''
