 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, President Biden has  continued his fabricated excuses for Bidenomics. His message is not  reality understood by American families.   According to the New York Post op-ed by Brian Riedl, senior fellow at  the Manhattan Institute: `` `Bidenomics' is a record of failure,'' and  the President will spend $5 trillion over the next decade. This  spending is ``driving prices upward by more than 16 percent . . . since  the President took office, at a cost of more than $10,000 for the  typical household,'' and hourly compensation has fallen by 5 percent.  ``When incomes cannot keep pace with inflation and families are falling  behind, few other economic variables matter.''   Biden fails to recognize that inflation reached the highest rate in  40 years under his watch of borrow, tax, and spend, and it is failing  families and destroying jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.                            ____________________
