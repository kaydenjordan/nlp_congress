 Madam President, first of all, I want to thank Senator  Smith for her leadership on this issue. This involves 1.2 million  contract workers who could very well not only lose their pay from the  35 days of the Government shutdown but not have any mechanism to  receive that backpay.   Senator Smith has filed legislation that is fair legislation, it  works, and it is the right thing for us to do. These workers did not  lose their pay because of anything they did wrong. These are the same  as government workers because they are performing government work. They  are maintaining our buildings, cleaning our buildings, providing  security for government buildings. In some respects, these are very  similar to our direct Federal workforce.   We know that this 35-day, dangerous, outrageous, and unnecessary  shutdown caused tremendous harm. We know the harm it caused 800,000  Federal workers. Over half were forced to work without pay, but they  showed up and worked because they are patriotic Americans who believe  very much in the mission they are doing on behalf of this country, the  noble service of public service on behalf of their fellow citizens. Can  you imagine trying to figure out how you are going to find money to put  gasoline in your car so you can drive to work to do your service and  not get paid for that day of work or how you are going to pay for your  daycare or how you are going to pay for your daily expenses? But they  are loyal, patriotic people who showed up every day for work. Close to  400,000 were furloughed and locked out without pay.   As Senator Smith said, this body, with the help of the House and the  signature of the President--S. 24, legislation I authored with Senator  Smith's help, the Government Employees Fair Treatment Act, makes it  clear that in the event of a shutdown, our Federal workforce will get  their paychecks. They will not get them timely. They are still going to  be inconvenienced. They are still not going to be able to pay their  bills. But they will know that at the end of the day, when government  reopens, they are going to get their paychecks, as they should and as  every Member of this body agreed is the right thing to do, because our  Federal workforce was not responsible for this shutdown.   But it goes beyond just 800,000. It even goes beyond our contract  workers. Our economy itself suffered. I had an opportunity to be the  ranking Democrat on the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.  I can tell you that small businesses throughout the country were very  much impacted by this 35-day shutdown. I am talking about small  businesses that didn't have a direct relationship with the government  or contract with the government--small businesses near our national  parks.   I had a meeting with Senator Van Hollen in Montgomery County, MD,  with small businesses in the community. Because there were so many  Federal workers who had been furloughed without pay and contract  workers who didn't have paychecks, the average business that was there  that day--there were many there--their business was down 20 to 60  percent. They are not going to be compensated for this.   Of course, the American people were denied the services they needed,  whether it was the FBI in full force to keep them safe or food  inspectors doing their work. This was a disastrous shutdown.   We can do something for the contract workers. As I said, these are  people who are doing work on behalf of this Nation. They are working in  our buildings. They are keeping our buildings safe. They are keeping  our buildings clean. They are working for modest pay. These are not  highly paid jobs.  [[Page S905]]  They were not paid during those 35 days, and unless Senator Smith's  legislation is passed, they will not get compensated.   I want to thank Senator Smith for S. 162, the Fair Compensation for  Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act. It is well-drafted using existing  mechanisms to compensate low-paid contract service workers. It is the  right thing to do. We estimate that as many as 1.2 million people could  be affected by this. This has had a major impact on their lives and on  our economy.   During the shutdown last month, I received a letter from Robert  Conrad, president and CEO of LJT & Associates. LJT & Associates is a  midsized firm based in Columbia, MD, that is the top contractor for  NASA's Wallops Island flight facility on the Eastern Shore.   Mr. Conrad wrote: ``The shutdown has had a significant negative  impact on our business and, more importantly, our employees and their  families . . . As a result of this lengthy government shutdown our  company has not been paid by NASA and other agencies for work performed  in November and December 2018 and this lack of payment continues to  worsen by the day. As a result, we are faced with decisions to furlough  or lay off our valuable employees. Unlike federal civil servants, our  employees will not receive pay for suspended work during the shutdown,  making the impacts of the layoff a permanent financial burden for them  and their families.''   Well, let's respond to Mr. Conrad. Let's respond to those 1.2 million  Americans who are doing work on behalf of all of us. The shutdown was  not their fault. As we compensated our Federal workforce, let's also  provide a safety net for those who lost their compensation as a result  of this shutdown, the low-wage service workers.   I hope we can find a way to quickly pass S. 162, and I again thank  Senator Smith for her leadership.    I yield the floor.    Madam President, I want to thank Senator Smith, who  called me during the holiday recess and said: We have this problem. How  do we fix it?   I really appreciated the phone call I received from Senator Smith.  She recognized that we had to build support for the legislation but  also make it work right because it is much more complicated to figure  out the target group we are trying to help to make sure it is drafted  in the right way. She reached out to get that type of help on drafting,  as well as getting support among the stakeholders to make sure the bill  was properly drafted. It took some time, and now we have a bill that we  can all be proud to support.   So once again, I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota for the  manner in which she has gone about presenting this legislation.    Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator  Wicker to bring your attention to our proposed Dental Loan Repayment  Assistance Act. This legislation will provide incentives for dental and  dental hygiene graduates to remain as dental school faculty by  eliminating certain loan assistance benefits from being counted as  taxable income. We rely on dental faculty to train the next generation  of oral health providers, but too often, these educators find  themselves pushed to work in private practice in order to pay off their  student loans. The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act will ease some  of this financial burden and allow faculty to stay where they are most  needed.   There are currently over 5,000 dental health professional shortage  areas nationwide--areas where it is hard to find a dental provider even  with insurance coverage. By 2025, the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) projects that the United States will have a national  shortage of 15,000 dentists. We can only hope to solve this problem if  we can recruit and retain enough faculty to train the next generation  of dentists and dental hygienists. Crippling educational debt should  not prevent our Nation from having the oral health care providers it  needs, and this bill will help address that.   I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge that  February is National Children's Dental Health Month. Since 1981, this  month has afforded us the opportunity to acknowledge the importance of  children's dental health. We recognize the significant strides we have  made, but we also acknowledge the work that remains to be done. I  invite my colleagues to join me to use this month to renew our  commitment to ensuring that all children in our country have access to  affordable and comprehensive dental services. To echo Former U.S.  Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, ``there is no health without oral  health.''   Despite being largely preventable, tooth decay is the single most  common chronic health condition among children and adolescents in the  United States. It is four times more common than early-childhood  obesity, five times more common than asthma, and 20 times more common  than diabetes. Among children in families living below the federal  poverty line, 52 percent have cavities. Children with cavities in their  primary or ``baby'' teeth are three times more likely to develop  cavities in their permanent, adult teeth, and the early loss of baby  teeth can make it harder for permanent teeth to grow in properly. If  tooth decay is left untreated, it not only can destroy a child's teeth;  it can have a debilitating impact on his or her health and quality of  life.   Many have heard me speak before about the tragic loss of Deamonte  Driver, a 12-year-old Prince George's County resident, in 2007.  Deamonte's death was particularly heartbreaking because it was entirely  preventable. What started out as a toothache turned into a severe brain  infection that could have been prevented by an $80 extraction. After  multiple surgeries and a lengthy hospital stay, sadly, Deamonte passed  away--twelve years ago this month.   Even in less tragic cases, tooth and gum pain can impede a child's  healthy development, including the ability to learn, play, and eat  nutritious foods. Recent studies have shown that children with poor  oral health are nearly three times more likely to miss school due to  dental pain, and children reporting recent toothaches are four times  more likely to have a lower grade point average than their peers  without dental pain.    Tooth decay and oral health problems also disproportionately affect  children from low-income families and minority communities. According  to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 80 percent of  childhood dental disease is concentrated in 25 percent of the  population. These children and families often face inordinately high  barriers to receiving essential oral health care and, simply put, the  consequences can be devastating.   In 2009, Congress reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance  Program (CHIP) with an important addition: a guaranteed pediatric  dental benefit. Today, CHIP provides affordable comprehensive health  coverage--including dental coverage--to more than 8 million children.  Thanks to CHIP, we now have the highest number of children with medical  and dental coverage in history. In addition, in 2010, Congress included  pediatric dental services in the set of essential health benefits  established under the Affordable Care Act.   I am very proud that my State of Maryland has been recognized as a  national leader in pediatric dental health coverage. In a 2011 Pew  Center report, ``The State of Children's Dental Health,'' Maryland  earned an ``A'' and was the only State to meet seven of eight policy  benchmarks for addressing children's dental health needs. In addition,  in the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, every qualified health plan  now includes pediatric dental coverage, so families do not have to pay  a separate premium for dental coverage for their children and do not  have a separate deductible or out-of-pocket limit for pediatric dental  services. I am pleased to say that our actions have been working, and  our numbers are improving. In 2004, nearly 23 percent of all children  had untreated tooth decay. In 2016, that number dropped down to 13  percent.   I urge my colleagues to join Senator Wicker and me in supporting the  Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act to help address our critical  nationwide shortage of dental healthcare providers and especially  dental faculty. We will not continue to allow crippling graduate  student debt to deprive the American people of the teachers and mentors  we need to train the next generation of oral healthcare providers.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Harris, Ms. Smith, Ms. Klobuchar,          and Mr. Blumenthal):   S. 366. A bill to shorten monopoly periods for prescription drugs  that are the subjects of sudden price hikes; to the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
