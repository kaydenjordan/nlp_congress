 Mr. Speaker, I rise today against this Republican ruse,  the default on America act.   This legislation is not a serious proposal. It is a MAGA wish list  that demands a 22 percent cut of essential Federal programs that  support working families, seniors, veterans, public safety, schools,  and housing assistance.   If passed, this bill would cost an estimated 780,000 jobs, many in  the clean energy sector, all across this country.   What we need is simple: A clean bill to avoid a default, to ensure we  protect the full faith and credit of the United States.   If my Republican colleagues want to show Americans they can govern,  then pass a clean bill and show us your budget, a real budget, like the  President has released.   Every day Republicans wait brings us closer to brinksmanship and  hurts the American people and the global economy. I urge my colleagues  to reject this bill.
