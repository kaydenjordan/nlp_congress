SEC. 14. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5706.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5706, the Stop Sexual  Assault and Harassment in Transportation Act. The number one goal in  the transportation of people, whether it is across town or across an  ocean, must be safety. No matter how much progress we have made in  increasing the safety of our transportation system, we must always  strive to do better.   But as we have seen over the course of the last several years, much  more work remains to be done. And unfortunately, the pandemic has only  served to exacerbate the problem. For instance, there were more than  5,700 reports of air rage incidents on U.S. airlines in 2021 compared  to a typical year of 100 to 150 cases. Many of these incidents included  sexual assault and harassment.   In fact, last August, a passenger was arrested for punching a  Frontier Airlines flight attendant and groping two others on a flight  from Philadelphia to Miami. On another flight from New York to San  Francisco last year, a plane was diverted when a passenger engaged in  erratic behavior, including sexually harassing another passenger. The  risk of an unwelcome and even threatening environment has never been  more real for both passengers and transportation workers alike.   This risk existed long before the pandemic. According to a 2018  study, 68 percent of flight attendants on U.S. airlines say they  experienced sexual harassment, and 18 percent experienced some type of  physical sexual abuse from passengers during their careers; 68 percent  sexual harassment, 18 percent physical sexual abuse.   Moreover, this type of misconduct is not just limited to aviation.  For example, sexual assault is by far the most frequently reported  crime on cruise ships, with 101 incidents reported in 2019, the last  full year before the pandemic shut down much of the industry's  operations. While we don't have a comprehensive set of data for public  transit, a March 2020 survey of students at San Jose State University  found that 63 percent of respondents had experienced some form of  harassment while using transit.   In recent years, there may be no other industry this issue has  plagued more than transportation network companies. In 2019, Uber  released its first-ever report documenting sexual assaults among users  of its ride sharing app. The company documented over 6,000 reports of  sexual assault incidents in a 2-year span. That is an average of almost  10 sexual assaults in an Uber per day. Just last October, Lyft released  its first-ever report documenting 4,158 sexual assault incidents over a  span of 3 years. These results highlight the need for the Federal  Government to do much more to root out the scourge of sexual assault in  our transportation system.   But we can't effectively respond to these incidents until we fully  understand the scope of the problem. Unfortunately, there is no Federal  clearinghouse for transportation-related sexual assault and harassment  incidents. The data that the Department of Justice and the Department  of Transportation collect on sexual assault and harassment in  transportation are largely of incidents that were directly reported to  them, not from transportation providers. This information gap leaves  lawmakers, policymakers, and transportation providers themselves  unaware of areas where laws and policies should be improved.   That is why the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure passed  my bill, H.R. 5706, the Stop Sexual Assault and Harassment in  Transportation Act. This bill will require transportation providers to  establish formal policies addressing sexual assault and harassment;  direct employees to receive specific training for not just how to  handle sexual assault or harassment incidents, but also how to  recognize and respond to potential human trafficking activities; and  direct the Department of Transportation to establish the first-ever  Federal clearinghouse for transportation-related sexual assaults and  harassment data to allow us and the traveling public to fully  understand the scope of this problem.   We can no longer allow sexual violence and abuse to persist on our  roads, our waters, or in our skies. We must ensure our transportation  system is safe for those who work in it and those who wish to use it.  This bill, which will allow us to finally track, respond to, and  ultimately prevent sexual assault and harassment within all areas of  our transportation system, brings us one step closer to attaining that  goal.   I want to acknowledge and express my appreciation for the many  supporters of this bill. In particular, the bill has been strongly  endorsed by the Air Line Pilots Association, American Association for  Justice, Association of Flight Attendants, Association of Professional  Flight Attendants, National Center on Sexual Exploitation,  Rights4Girls, Survivors for Solutions, Transportation Communications  Union, Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO, and Transport Workers  Union of America. I would also like to thank my Republican colleagues  for their help in strengthening this bill by expanding its requirements  to State-regulated for-profit vehicles.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                         Commitiee on the Judiciary,                                        House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, March 18, 2022.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: This letter is to advise you that       the Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 5706, the ``Stop Sexual Assault       and Harassment in Transportation Act,'' that fall within our       Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on       those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to       your including them in the bill for consideration on the       House floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to       forgo action on H.R. 5706, with the understanding that we do       not thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.  [[Page H3988]]                                          ____          Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, March 21, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 5706, the Stop Sexual Assault and Harassment in       Transportation Act. I appreciate your willingness to review       the legislation.        I acknowledge that by foregoing formal consideration on       H.R. 5706, the Committee on the Judiciary does not waive any       future jurisdictional claims to provisions in this or similar       legislation, and that your Committee will be consulted and       involved on any matters in your Committee's jurisdiction       should this legislation move forward. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving provisions       within this legislation on which the Committee on the       Judiciary has a valid jurisdictional claim.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation,       and I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.       5706.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.     Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, I urge my colleagues  to support this bill. Hopefully, we can move it out of the House  unanimously and get the Senate to act in the near future. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 400) to designate the headquarters building of the Department  of Transportation located at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, in Washington,  DC, as the ``William T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Federal  Building'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 400         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``William T. Coleman, Jr. and       Norman Y. Mineta Department of Transportation Headquarters       Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION.         The headquarters building of the Department of       Transportation located at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, in       Washington, DC, shall be known and designated as the       ``William T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Federal       Building''.       SEC. 3. REFERENCES.         Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper,       or other record of the United States to the building referred       to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the       ``William T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Federal       Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 400, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 400, as amended, a bill to  name the headquarters building of the Department of Transportation  located at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, in Washington, D.C. as the  William T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Federal Building.   The text we are considering today represents an agreement reached  with the Senate and reconciles the differences between S. 400 and my  bill, H.R. 4679, which passed the House last November. This compromise  language pays tribute to two American patriots, William T. Coleman, Jr.  and Norman Yishio Mineta.   William T. Coleman, Jr. led a life of extraordinary achievement. He  attended a segregated elementary school, graduated summa cum laude from  the University of Pennsylvania, and was accepted into Harvard School of  Law. He left in 1943 to enlist in the Army Air Forces, trained with the  Tuskegee Airmen, after which he returned to Harvard Law School and  graduated first in his class.   He was the first African-American clerk on the Supreme Court. He also  worked with Thurgood Marshall on the legal team preparing the briefs in  Brown v. Board of Education, served as president and chairman of the  NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and argued 19 cases before  the Supreme Court. Mr. Coleman was the second African American to serve  in a White House Cabinet, after being appointed Transportation  Secretary by President Gerald R. Ford in March 1975.   Norman Y. Mineta also has an extraordinary life story. He, along with  his family, suffered the grave injustice of being forcibly relocated  and interned during World War II, but he was not bitter toward his  government. Instead, he spent his career serving his country by  participating in and improving government.   For almost 30 years, Norm represented San Jose, California, on the  city council, then as mayor, and from 1975 to 1995 as a Member of  Congress. He served on the Committee on Public Works and Transportation  during his entire time in Congress. He chaired the Subcommittee on  Aviation, the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, and he chaired  the full committee for one full term.   Norm's skills and accomplishments were widely recognized. He was  President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Commerce and President George W.  Bush's Secretary of Transportation, where he was the longest-serving  Secretary of Transportation in U.S. history.   Following the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, Secretary Mineta  guided the creation of the Transportation Security Administration, an  agency with more than 65,000 employees, the largest mobilization of a  new Federal agency since World War II.   For their contributions to this institution, to our government, and  to the field of transportation, Secretary William T. Coleman, Jr. and  Secretary Mineta deserve this recognition. I strongly support this  legislation and urge my colleagues to join me.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3989]]         Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   I have already spoken strongly for this bill, for the Department of  Transportation building to be named in honor of William T. Coleman and  Norm Mineta.   I just want to add a personal note. I served with Norm Mineta for 8  years, and he was a great chairman and mentor. Between him and Jim  Oberstar, I owe them a lot for my success in Congress and for the  leadership in this committee, so I am really pleased that we can do  this today. I would expect it will pass the House unanimously, but  there are inane people on the other side of the aisle who insist on  voting on everything for no apparent reason, so I expect we will end up  with a recorded vote, but I expect that will be unanimous.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
