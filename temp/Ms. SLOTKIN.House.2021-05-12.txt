 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the PAWS for  Veterans Therapy Act. I am incredibly proud to be co-leading this  bipartisan bill to connect veterans with service dogs in their  communities through a new pilot program at the VA.   There are two organizations in Livingston County in my district that  train dogs and place them with veterans in need: Veteran Service Dogs  in Howell, and Blue Star Service Dogs in Pinckney, Michigan.   In 2019, I had the chance to visit Blue Star Service Dogs. It was  incredible to see these dogs in action and to hear directly from the  veterans about how these remarkable animals are helping them heal from  depression, PTSD, and so many other invisible service-related wounds.   The bill sets up a pilot program through the VA to partner with local  nonprofits, just like the ones in my district, to create work-therapy  programs for veterans to train and potentially adopt service dogs.   The issue is extremely personal to me. I am an Army wife, married to  a 30-year Army officer and Apache pilot. I have a stepdaughter  currently on Active Duty and another stepdaughter who is a doctor at  the VA. I am also the mom of two wonderful rescue dogs, Rocky and  Boomer.   I have seen how big of an impact service dogs can have on people's  lives when it comes to dealing with mental illness, and that is why I  am so passionate about this pilot program.   When we make the decision to send men and women in to fight for our  country, we make the decision to support them for the rest of their  lives.   The PAWS for Veterans Service Therapy Act helps us honor the  commitment and will have a real impact on the day-to-day well-being of  our veterans.   I want to thank Representative Stivers for his leadership on this  issue, and wish him all the best as he departs Congress. He is a  Republican, but much more concerning for me, he is from Ohio, and we  have still managed to work closely together on this issue.   To my colleagues, if I can work with a graduate of Ohio State  University, you can get on this darn bill. I urge both sides to join me  in supporting the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative  Demings, for holding this Special Order hour in honor of fallen law  enforcement officers.   It is National Police Week, a time to recognize and honor the men and  women who have answered the call to protect and serve our community.  Their service puts them in harm's way every single day, and we owe them  a debt of gratitude for their willingness to sacrifice for us.   Last November, it was my privilege to speak in this Chamber in honor  of Caleb Starr, a Michigan State Police Trooper from my district, who  was killed in the line of duty while responding to a call. I spoke  about the community of Mason, Michigan, where he was born and raised,  coming together to support the Starr family.    Tonight, I am proud to recognize an organization in my district that  has continuously provided support to the loved ones of our fallen  officers.   The 100 Club of Greater Lansing was founded in 1984, after the death  of Officer James Johnson of the East Lansing Police Department. Every  year, Members of the 100 Club contribute dues of $100 to provide  immediate assistance, as well as long-term support, to surviving  families of those who have died in the line of duty.   In the nearly 40 years the 100 Club has been doing its work, it has  helped the family of Officer Johnson, as well as the families of  Officer Dean Whitehead of the Lansing Police Department; Officer Julie  Engelhardt of the Lansing Parks Police Department; Sergeant Paul Cole  of the Ingham County Sheriff's Office; Deputy Grant Whitaker of the  Ingham County Sheriff's Office; and so many others.   In addition, the 100 Club keeps the spirit of those heroes alive by  establishing a scholarship fund for qualified survivors, providing an  annual honor award to officers, and funding an annual scholarship for a  student enrolled at the Mid-Michigan Police Academy at Lansing  Community College, where I visited just a couple of months ago.   During National Police Week, we honor fallen heroes who have given  their lives while on duty. To them we owe so much. As long as we keep  their memory alive, they remain with us. With these words, they will  remain in the permanent Record of the people's House so that their  contributions can live on.   I am grateful for their selfless courage and for my colleagues  tonight who have served. Thank you for taking the time to honor,  respect, and remember them.                                time  1745
