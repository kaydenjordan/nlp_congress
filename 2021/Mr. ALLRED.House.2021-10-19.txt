 Madam Speaker, our Nation's future depends on protecting  our wireless networks from vulnerabilities and untrusted vendors like  Chinese-backed companies. That is why today I rise in support of my  bipartisan bill, the Open RAN Outreach Act.   This bill encourages the administration to provide outreach and  technical assistance to small communications network providers  regarding how to use Open Radio Access Networks, or Open RAN  technologies, including those produced in my district in north Texas.   Many carriers use a closed or proprietary network, meaning that they  need to use one vendor or manufacturer. This can place a substantial  cost burden on smaller carriers to reduce costs, potentially by using  cheaper, Chinese-owned alternatives like Huawei.   Open RAN allows different components to be produced by different  companies, leading to a more diverse and competitive supply chain. My  legislation ensures smaller carriers have the tools they need to deploy  Open RAN if desired, helping secure our wireless networks.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' in support  of this bill.
