 Madam Speaker, on October 3, Ian Alan Cochran, a talented  young man from Brandon, Mississippi, joined our Heavenly Father after a  courageous fight with a rare form of brain cancer.   Ian graduated as an A student from Brandon High School in 2018, where  he also excelled in extracurricular activities. He was a member of the  tech club, served as president of the chess club, and was a talented  soccer player.   Ian was well liked for his humor, talent, and high-spirited attitude.  Everyone who knew Ian remembers his lighthearted and friendly approach  to life.   As members of their Brandon Baptist Church family, my family and I  joined Ian's parents, Joel and Kim; his sisters, Hope and Kayla; his  grandparents; and his extended family and friends in remembering and  celebrating his life and the positive mark he left on all of us who  knew him.   Madam Speaker, I now ask this body to join me in a moment of silence  to remember Ian Cochran and to thank our Heavenly Father for the joy of  Ian's life.                            ____________________
