 I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for 1  minute.    The latest political ploy by the Democrats is to paint  the Senate majority leader as an obstructionist because he hasn't moved  to consider certain bills passed by the other body.   Well, let's think about that for just a minute. They can hardly use  that talking point anymore.   Yesterday, the Senate majority leader moved to take up the House- passed appropriations package, and the Senate Democrats blocked that  motion.   The Senate isn't obliged to consider every partisan bill from the  House, and the House doesn't have to consider every bill that is passed  by the Senate. But if there is any House bill that the Senate has the  responsibility to take up, to debate, and to amend, it is the annual  spending bills to keep government operating. We have to fund the  government, and that is what we are doing.   So I hope we don't hear any of this bellyaching anymore when we have  a House bill that the Senate doesn't somehow take up.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
