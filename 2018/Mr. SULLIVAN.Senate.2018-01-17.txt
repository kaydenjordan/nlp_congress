 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                             Funding Our Military     Madam President, I was just in the Presiding Officer's  chair and saw my colleague and my friend for whom I have a lot of  respect, the Democratic whip, talking about some of the issues we are  looking at right now, in particular, military spending and the  appropriations we need to fund our military. He mentioned it was a  priority. Certainly, it should be a priority. It is probably the most  important thing we do here in the Congress. He said they are focused on  it. We should all be focused on it.   I just thought I would reply a little because I think the facts of  what has been going on here on the floor of the Senate the last couple  of years would make one skeptical of that claim that it has been a  focus of theirs.   Let me just give a few examples. I know the Presiding Officer is very  familiar with all of these. In the last administration, from 2010 to  2016, military spending for the United States was cut by almost 25  percent. That was led by the previous President, despite the fact that  there is no one who doubts that national security threats to our Nation  have increased: We are going to cut defense spending by 25 percent-- when there are threats around the world, and we know what they are-- ISIS, Iran, China, and Russia. A lot of people like to talk about  Russia, which is definitely a threat, but we are cutting defense  spending by 25 percent. That makes no sense, but that is what has been  going on.   When I got to the Senate, one of the first things that happened was  that the previous administration decided that they were going to cut  the Army by an additional 50,000 troops--Active-Duty Army troops. The  Presiding Officer remembers the spring of 2015 and the big announcement  that we were going to cut 50,000 more troops. That made no sense.   A number of us were very concerned about the direction the country  was going, the Congress was going, and the administration was going  with regard to our military. The good news is that there has been a  bipartisan recognition that the cuts were way too dramatic and the  increases and threats to our Nation have risen so significantly that we  have to do something about rebuilding our military, rebuilding  readiness, and rebuilding serious funding.   In this year's National Defense Authorization Act, led by my good  friend from Arizona Senator McCain, we actually authorized increased  funding by up to $700 billion. That was very bipartisan. As a matter of  fact, there was a unanimous vote to move that out of the Armed Services  Committee, on which I have the honor to serve with the Presiding  Officer. Then, it was unanimous on the floor of the Senate. It was very  bipartisan to authorize increased defense spending, but we haven't  appropriated the dollars. So there is a difference there in terms of  authorization and appropriations.   This has been a bipartisan failure of this body for years. How has it  been working? We see how it has been working. We have these giant  omnibus spending bills, usually, at the end of the year. If we can't do  it, we do a CR, or a continuing resolution. It says that we will keep  funding the government as is, and then we will do this giant bill with  all of the spending for the year.   These CRs are really hurting our military. They hurt all kinds of  Federal agencies because there is no predictability, but the one  element of our Federal Government that really gets hurt by continuing  resolutions--by these omnibus bills--is the men and women in the U.S.  military.   As the Presiding Officer knows, general after general and civilian  leaders in the military, whether Democrats or a Republicans, come to  the Congress and to our committee, and they say: These CRs are killing  us; they are killing our readiness. We all say: Oh, yes, we know it is  important. Then, this body does nothing. So it is not from a lack of  effort.   I am going to tell a story that I think the other side doesn't want  to remember, but I think it is really important to remember,  particularly given what the minority whip said earlier today. When a  number of us were elected in 2014, it was a big wave election. Twelve  new Republican Senators came to this body, and they took control of the  Senate. The one thing we said is this: We need to fix this  appropriations process, which is clearly broken. We need to do  [[Page S222]]  it the way it was intended--not with these smash-up derby, giant bills  at the end of the year. We need to have a focused, disciplined approach  to funding our government.   Everybody knows how it is supposed to work. You have the funding  bills, 12 of them, and the Appropriations Committee, a very important  and powerful committee, debates those for different sections of the  Federal Government. They get voted on out of committee. Then, they come  to the floor, and we vote on those 12 appropriations bills.   In 2015, a lot of us--particularly, the new Senators, and the  Presiding Officer is one of them--said: We need to fix this. Let's do  it the right way. And then we did. A lot of people don't remember, but  the Appropriations Committee worked really hard under the Chairman, the  great Senator from Mississippi, and they produced 12 appropriations  bills in the spring of 2015.   As you know, most of those bills were bipartisan. Most of those bills  came out of committee with really strong bipartisan numbers--so far, so  good. We are trying to focus on this. We are trying to be disciplined.   The next step is that you bring the appropriations bills, one at a  time, down to the floor. You debate them, and then you vote on them.  Then, you try to get it over to the President to sign it--not a smash- up derby omnibus that is 5,000 pages, and nobody knows what is in it,  but an appropriations bill on a singular subject.   That is what we tried to do. It came out of committee. We started  bringing all those bills down to the Senate floor. Guess what happened  at the next step? The minority leader was Harry Reid back in 2015. He  decided that he was going to filibuster every one of those  appropriations bills. Why? We said: Certainly, he is not going to  filibuster things like the appropriations bill that came out of  committee unanimously that funds our military. We have troops in  combat. We have threats all over the world. That came out of committee.  Let's at least vote on that one. Let's at least vote on the  appropriations bill that came out of committee unanimously to fund our  troops.   So what happened? The other side, led by the previous minority  leader, Harry Reid, filibustered funding our troops. Let me repeat  that. He filibustered funding our troops on a bill that was already out  of committee unanimously--when our troops are at war.   So when I hear my colleagues on the other side say that they really  care about funding the troops, I get a little skeptical. A number of us  were quite upset about that. We went to our leader and said: Let's keep  bringing this up. We guarantee you that if the people back home in any  district in the country, your constituents--whether you are a Senator  who is a Republican or Democrat--knew that they were filibustering  funding the troops for no reason, they would get a little upset.   We brought that bill to the floor five different times over the  course of a couple of months, trying to get the singular appropriations  bill to fund our military--which passed out of the Appropriations  Committee unanimously--a vote on the Senate floor. Guess what. The  other side filibustered it five times.   The Presiding Officer and I were on the floor with a bunch of our  colleagues making the argument that this is outrageous, and then we  asked the other side to come down and tell the American people why they  were filibustering the funding for our troops. A lot of people here  like to do the process thing, where they don't think people are  watching--people in the Gallery, people on C-SPAN--and they never once  came down and said: Here is why we filibustered funding for the troops  five times in a row. They didn't want their constituents to see it  because they knew their constituents--whether Democrats or  Republicans--were going to say: You are doing what? You are  filibustering the appropriations bill for the men and women who are  fighting to defend our Nation? That is what you are doing?   Well, that is what they did. Yet they never explained it.   Again, when I hear the minority whip saying: We really care about  funding the troops, I get a little skeptical. I am still waiting for  the answer: Why did you do that?   As you know, we have a system right now that is broken. The budget  system--the way we fund the government right now--I think, is a  bipartisan failure. The normal way we appropriate and authorize is not  working. It leads to what we are doing right now: these giant  omnibuses, these continuing resolutions. It has happened so long--these  year-end, smash-up derbies, where essentially, the leadership in the  House and Senate--Democrat and Republican--and the White House go off  somewhere, make a deal, and come back with this huge bill. It is not  how the system is supposed to work. It is not doing our country  justice.   Again, the good news is that there are a number of Senators-- particularly some of the newer ones, a bipartisan group, by the way, of  Democrats and Republicans--led by my friend and colleague from Georgia,  Senator David Perdue, who are looking at a bipartisan way to fix this  problem.   Right now the way we fund the government is that we have these end- of-the-year smash-up derby, massive, thousand-page omnibuses. When we  can't get there, we do another CR, which really impacts our military  negatively and a bunch of other elements of the Federal Government. We  need to do better.   I am going to be working with my colleagues who are focused on this.  It is going to be hard. It is not going to be easy. A lot of people  like the smash-up derby approach, but it is not worthy of the American  people who we are supposed to represent.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
