 Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for their  work on the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act.   To Chairman Pallone, to Chairman Doyle, to Congressman Latta, and  everybody that has been involved in this, I think we have come to a  really good agreement here, and it will help stop the illegal  robocalls; hopefully, all 47.8 billion. Let that number sink in.   Last year, in America, 47.8 billion calls were made to all of us, and  they were mostly all illegal, and we are going to do our best to stop  them.   You will be hard-pressed to find a technology that is more personal  than your phone; whether it is the phone you carry in your pocket or,  for some, a landline at home, and how we communicate on these devices  is essential in the way that we connect to one another.   Yet that personal connection is being violated by bad actors that  have compromised our country's communications networks and who hide  their tracks with their own hardware and software.   These criminal parties have done significant harm to Americans, both  personally and professionally. Those that engage in such illicit  behavior should be treated and prosecuted for what they are, criminals.   From the outset of our legislative effort to address this problem, I  stated we must make a clear distinction between parties that have ill  purpose, as opposed to those who do not. After all, we don't want to  shut off legitimate uses of these new technologies, such as protecting  the anonymity of a women's shelter assisting at-risk individuals or  alerting you to a fraudulent use of your credit card or providing you  the simple convenience of interacting with your ride-share service.  Those are legitimate purposes.   Our clearest and quickest path for passing legislation, along with  our friends in the Senate and, ultimately, to become law, is to go  after those that have malicious intent; and to go beyond that could  undermine services  [[Page H7298]]  Americans depend on every day. So I think we have found the right  balance here.                                time  1430    By taking all this into account, we can achieve the same kind of  bipartisan, bicameral success as exemplified by the RAY BAUM'S Act last  Congress, which, notably, provided us with the launching pad for where  we are today.   Now, that law provided the FCC with more authority to go after bad  actors who utilize calls and texts. Our work from then was echoed by a  broad bipartisan group of attorneys general from across the United  States calling for the FCC to move on updating its own rules.   Now, we know communications and technologies are constantly evolving,  and, unfortunately, the bad actors' tricks have evolved beyond our Do  Not Call Registry, and I am sure they will continue figuring out a way  to get around this effort. However, the more friction we can create  against illicit behavior, the more focused public-private partnerships  we can create among industry, consumer groups, and government that will  help us root out this problem, prosecute these criminals to the fullest  extent of the law, and make great strides in regaining Americans'  confidence in their communication devices.   Now, in the 35 townhalls I have held in my district this year and  phone calls I get to my office, people ask one question. I bet they ask  it of you, Madam Speaker.   What are you going to do to stop these robocalls?   I will tell you what. This is a number you can answer, 3375. That is  the number of the bill. Pick it up; answer it; vote ``yes''; and we  will put an end to these robocalls--at least for now.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1058, the  Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support  Act, or Autism CARES Act. This important bill, led by Representatives  Chris Smith and Mike Doyle, reauthorizes the Interagency Autism  Coordinating Committee along with funding for research, public health  surveillance, and workforce development programs that directly impact  patients with autism spectrum disorder. Reauthorization of these  important initiatives demonstrates our commitment to provide a  coordinated federal response to the needs of individuals diagnosed with  autism and related neurodevelopmental disabilities. I'd like to thank  Representatives Smith and Doyle for their tireless work on this  important legislation and I urge my colleagues to vote yes.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2035,  the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act. This legislation, led by  Representatives James Langevin and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, reauthorizes  critical grants to states to implement coordinated systems of respite  services for caregivers, provide planned and emergency respite  services, recruit and train workers and volunteers, and provide  information to family caregivers to help them access these critical  services. Many of us have had a loved one with a caregiver--this bill  provides those caregivers with the support they need and deserve. I  urge my colleagues to vote yes on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 776, the  Emergency Medical Services for Children Program Reauthorization Act,  sponsored by Representatives Peter King and Kathy Castor. This  legislation reauthorizes grants that focus on addressing the unique  needs of children in emergency medical systems, with the ultimate goal  of reducing the prevalence of morbidity and mortality in children that  may occur as a result of acute illness and severe injury. This is  really critical legislation for parents and children in our  communities--no one should have to know the pain of losing a child. I  urge my fellow House members to support this bill.
