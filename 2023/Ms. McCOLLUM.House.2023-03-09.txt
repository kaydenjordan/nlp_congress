 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 27,  which would overturn a recent Biden Administration regulation  clarifying protection of America's waters under the Clean Water Act.   Communities in Minnesota and across our Nation need reliable access  to clean water. Without clean water our communities don't have access  to safe drinking water, farmers can't grow the food we eat, and our  nurses and doctors can't clean their hands before a procedure. Clean  water touches every facet of our daily lives, and our communities  cannot thrive without it.   If passed, H.J. Res. 27 would block the latest waters of the United  States (WOTUS) rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  and the Army Corps of Engineers. The rule that the Biden Administration  is proposing would broaden definitions of waterways subject to  protection under the Clean Water Act to include connected waterways  such as wetlands. The new rule also seeks to provide clarity and  predictability for famers and developers while protecting our nation's  water quality and supply. H.J. Res. 27 would block this clarified rule.   For over 50 years, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to  protect and restore America's waters using the authorities granted in  the Clean Water Act. Members of Congress today have a responsibility to  protect this important legacy. Preserving the health of America's  wetlands and streams is essential to Minnesota, a state with more than  10,000 lakes and over 69,000 miles of river. Clean water touches every  aspect of our daily lives, and Americans cannot survive without it.   Mr. Speaker, let me be clear, H.J. Res. 27 is an attack on clean  water in communities all around the country.   It should be rejected.
