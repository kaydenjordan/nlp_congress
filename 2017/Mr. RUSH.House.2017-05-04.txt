 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a true hero in  my heart and the hearts of so many in my hometown of Chicago, Illinois:  Father George H. Clements.   Father Clements, yesterday, celebrated the 60th anniversary of his  ordination into the Roman Catholic Church. His path towards divinity  began early in life when he became the first Black graduate of  Chicago's Quigley Academy Seminary in 1945. From there, he went on to  pursue his education and earned a bachelor of arts degree in sacred  theology and a master of arts degree in philosophy from St. Mary of the  Lake Seminary.   Mr. Speaker, after ordination, Father Clements continued his role as  a trailblazer when, in June of 1969, he became the first Black priest  of Holy Angels Catholic Church, which we in the First District of  Illinois are proud to claim.   Mr. Speaker, from that position, Father Clements has had a tremendous  impact on lives all across the city of Chicago and all across our great  Nation. One such incident of tremendous significance to me personally  are his actions that he undertook in the aftermath of the assassination  of my dear friend and deputy chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the  Black Panther Party, Fred Hampton.   On December 4, 1969, Fred Hampton was assassinated. December 4, 1969,  is a dark day in the history of the civil rights movement and in the  struggle for social justice here in our great Nation. Mr. Speaker, that  is the day that Fred Hampton, as I said before, was assassinated by  members of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, who worked in  conjunction with the Chicago Police Department and the Federal Bureau  of Investigation.   Mr. Speaker, it is only by the grace of God that I escaped that same  fate. Knowing that I was being pursued as a target of the FBI, the Cook  County State's Attorney's Office, and the Chicago Police Department,  this same extraordinary priest, Father George Clements, offered me  protection under the very old ecclesiastical right of sanctuary that  has been honored throughout many centuries here and all across the  world in a church not  [[Page H4174]]  only in America, but in Europe, Asia, and Africa.   Mr. Speaker, if not for the heroic actions of Father Clements on that  day, I would not be standing here in the well of the House on this very  day.   Father Clements just didn't stop on that infamous day of December 4,  1969. Throughout the years, countless others have also benefited from  Father George Clements' boundless love for humanity. In 1980, he  started the Catholic church's first One Church One Child program, an  effort to increase the adoption race of African-American orphans. He  took this noble, gigantic step so to heart that, in 1981 he himself  adopted a child; something that had been unheard of in the history of  the Catholic church: a Catholic priest adopting a child.                                time  1445    He did not stop there, Father Clements. He has taken personal  responsibility for and adopted other children. He has been an excellent  father to four wonderful children: Joey, Friday, Stewart, and Saint  Anthony.   Father Clements' selfless devotion to humanity did not stop there.  After retiring from the Holy Angels Catholic Church in 1994, Father  Clements made his way to our Nation's Capital. He came here to  Washington, D.C., to establish the One Church-One Addict program  beginning here in our Nation's Capital.   Mr. Speaker, as some of us more seasoned folks in this Chamber may  recall, this was a time when our Nation's Capital was known as the  ``murder capital'' of America. This fact did not deter Father Clements  from seeking to help those in need, from trying to be a solution to a  highly recognized problem. Father Clements' unboundless love was in  full effect once again. Even after all of his years of selfless,  sacrificial, hard work, Father Clements still had more to give.   In 1999, he established the One Church-One Inmate program, which was  a shared effort to help prison inmates and their families by helping  inmates transition from incarceration to a life as productive and  ``spiritually healed,'' law-abiding citizens.   What a remarkable man Father George C. Clements was, and what a  remarkable man he is this very day.   The Nation, Hollywood has recognized this glorious man. They made a  movie after him, called, ``The Father Clements Story,'' where the  award-winning actor Lou Gossett starred as Father Clements.   In short, Mr. Speaker, Father Clements has been a beacon of light  during the dark days of our Nation. He has been a community leader, a  selfless advocate for the downtrodden, and above all, he has been a  true and loyal friend to those who are in need. He is a religious man  who walks the walk just as he talks the talk.   I can speak no better words for this great American hero, Father  George C. Clements, no better words than those that are taken from the  Bible, from Holy Scriptures. Let me close, Mr. Speaker, with these very  words taken from the Book of Proverbs at 22:9. The Bible says: ``He who  has a generous eye will be blessed, for he gives of his bread to the  poor.'' This is the manner, the mind of the man, Father George C.  Clements.   Mr. Speaker, I honor, I love, I am grateful for, and I am indebted to  the remarkable love and work, commitment and dedication of my friend  Father George C. Clements.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K.  Davis), my colleague, my comrade, my cohort, my coconspirator, my  friend from the Seventh District of Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 58 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, May  8, 2017, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
