 Mr. Speaker, you can tell from the previous  speaker how eager our Democratic colleagues are to shut down this  government: Get the votes to keep this government open because we won't  provide them; get the votes to keep funding our military and security,  but we won't provide them; get the votes to provide healthcare long- term for our children and families, because our Democratic colleagues  won't provide not one vote; get the votes to delay the damaging impact  of ObamaCare taxes, the health insurance tax, the Cadillac tax, and  medical device; you get those votes, Republicans, because we are not  going to give you even one of them.   These taxes are so damaging to our families, to our workers, and to  our job-creators, it is sending jobs out of America overseas.   Get the votes, Republicans, because we claim we support this, we just  won't support it with our votes.   It is regrettable because these are bipartisan issues, and politics  are shutting this government down.   I urge my Democratic colleagues to stand with Republicans on behalf  of children, and families, and workers. Keep this government open.
