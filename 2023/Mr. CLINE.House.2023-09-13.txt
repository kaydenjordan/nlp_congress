 Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago, the White House press  secretary said that President Biden has ``done more to secure the  border . . . than anybody else.'' She could not be more wrong.   The Biden administration's open border policies have created the  worst illegal immigration crisis in our Nation's history, and it is  making our communities less safe while the Mexican cartels thrive.  Deadly fentanyl has poured across our southern border in record-high  amounts, endangering countless American lives. Criminal cartels are now  making $13 billion a year smuggling illegal immigrants into our  interior.   Even more troubling, the Department of Homeland Security has admitted  that 40 percent of illegal migrants  [[Page H4274]]  caught and released into our communities have disappeared, with no way  to track them.   A secure nation requires a secure border, which is why earlier this  year House Republicans passed H.R. 2, Secure the Border Act, the  strongest border security legislation that Congress has ever  considered.   While President Biden and DHS Secretary Mayorkas have no plans to get  this chaos under control, we are fighting to stop it. It is far past  time the Senate stops stalling and passes our critical bill to restore  the rule of law in our Nation.   To help them act, we should make border security a condition of any  continuing resolution when the fiscal year ends on September 30. The  American people demand and deserve nothing less.   Congratulating the Northside High School Softball Team on Winning Class                               3 State Title     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Northside High School  softball team for winning the Class 3 State title, the program's first  State championship victory since 2010 and their second in program  history.   After working hard all season, the Vikings left it all on the diamond  and beat the York Falcons 3 to 1.                                time  1045    These talented student athletes include Baylee Compton, McKenzie  Taylor, Leila Aguilar, Sydney Jordan, Karlee Austin, Zoe Mason, Chloey  Lafon, Shelby Ellis, Maddelena Shepher, Bonnie Ellis, Carsyn Michaels,  and Abbie Caldwell.   Northside senior Baylee Compton pitched a five-hitter for the  Vikings, striking out 16 and walking 1. In the top of the fifth, the  Vikings scored twice and grabbed a 2 to 1 lead. Then in the final  inning, Sydney Jordan hit an RBI signal, scoring the championship  winning run.   Congratulations, again, to the Northside High School softball team,  Head Coach Kassie Brammer, parents, faculty, and staff on this  incredible achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 387.
