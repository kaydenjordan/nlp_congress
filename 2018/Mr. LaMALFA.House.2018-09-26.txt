 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the passing of a  great man from California's First District, Michael Ciafardoni, who  died at the age of 94.   He was born in Nepezzano, Italy. Michael immigrated to America in  1939.  [[Page H8897]]  Although not yet even a United States citizen, he then served in the  U.S. Army in World War II as a member of the 803rd tank destroyer  battalion as a heavy machine gunner. He was the last surviving member  of his company.   He earned five Bronze Battle Stars fighting some of the most  consequential battles of the war, including the Normandy invasion and  the Battle of the Bulge.   Michael insisted his proudest wartime experience was not one of those  major engagements but, rather, the liberation of a small town in  Czechoslovakia near the end of the war. Jewish prisoners were being  held in the town of Volary, where they awaited transfer to a Nazi  concentration camp. Fortunately, Michael and his company got there  first, and they liberated them. To the people of Volary, these men were  heroes.   When the 803rd was leaving town a few days later, they were ambushed  by German soldiers. Indeed, the last soldier killed in Europe, Private  Charles Havlat, was riding a tank directly in front of the one Michael  was in. The Germans unconditionally surrendered just a few hours later.   To this day, the town holds an annual celebration to pay tribute to  the American soldiers who risked their lives to free them.   I am told that Michael's one wish was to be honored for his wartime  service in Europe. That is a wish that we are fulfilling right here  today on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, he was a hero for a country that he wasn't even yet a  citizen of. In October of 1946, he earned U.S. citizenship for his  service to his new country, his new home.   Before he died, he asked to see his Certificate of Naturalization,  which brought a proud smile to his face. Michael is as American as any  of us.   God bless him and his family.                            ____________________
