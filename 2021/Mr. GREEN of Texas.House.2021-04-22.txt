 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. And today, I rise  with love of country at heart.  [[Page H2078]]    I rise to announce that I will not allow this issue to become so  complicated that the American people might be confused because the  truth is we will be voting for one thing: whether we are for taxation  without representation or whether we are against taxation without  representation. It is really that simple.   As for me, I will be voting with the patriots. I will be voting with  those patriots from 1773 who confronted the government, those patriots  who were there at the Boston Harbor, those patriots who were there for  the Boston Tea Party.   I will be voting against taxation without representation. I believe  that this is what the American Constitution and the American way are  all about. Since 1773, it has been said, and today, I will respect it  with my vote.    Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise today  because I am deeply saddened.   I am saddened because today represents the day in the life of a  constituent that she will never forget, that her husband will never  forget.   I rise to call to the attention of the world the words of a  constituent. These words were printed in the Houston Chronicle. I am  grateful to the Chronicle for publishing this story because this story  speaks to a circumstance unlike that with George Floyd. I will say more  about that in just a moment.   But I rise, grateful to the Chronicle, with the words of a mother.  Here are her words: ``Our son was killed before George Floyd, but we  are still waiting for answers.''   Their son lost his life 1 year ago today in Houston, Texas, in my  congressional district. He lost his life several houses down from his  home, the  [[Page H2098]]  home of his parents. He lost his life while housesitting for a  neighbor. He was 35 years of age, well-liked.   I spoke to many of his neighbors, many of his friends, many of the  people in the neighborhood. I never heard one unkind thing said about  him. He was a person who was always there to be of service. He lost his  life while housesitting, trying to help a friend, a neighbor.   He served in the military. Here is a photo. He served in the  military, a graduate of a local high school, Westbury High School. He  loved the Dallas Cowboys. He was a typical young person. His name was  Joshua Johnson.   Joshua's parents, the Bearys, Mr. and Mrs. Beary, are grieving. They  have been grieving since he lost his life a year ago. They have been  grieving because the circumstances are questionable.   But these circumstances, unlike the circumstances that we had with  George Floyd, are circumstances where there was no body camera. There  was no witness to record what happened. These circumstances occurred  early in the morning, perhaps around 6 a.m., 1 year ago.                                time  1400    The parents were not present. Mr. Beary took his wife to work. He  returned home, and she received a phone call. Here are her words: ``It  was April 22, 2020, around 7:30 a.m., when my husband, Richard, who had  just dropped me off at work an hour earlier, called me and said the  words that changed my life and his forever. He said, `Someone shot and  killed Josh.'''   They would go as close as they could to the actual scene, which is  just a few houses down from where they lived, and they would encounter  a peace officer.   I like the term ``peace officer'' as opposed to ``police officer.''  Both are good terms, but to me, the term ``peace officer'' carries with  it something that I think is important for us to consider, as we  consider the great issues of our time.   Policing is one of the great issues of our time. A peace officer is  always there to make peace, to help us acquire peace, to help us  maintain the peace, to do the peaceful thing whenever possible. I know  that it is not always possible, but whenever possible.   So, they went as close as they could to the scene, and they  encountered an officer who was investigating. They wanted to know what  happened to their son, which is what any parent would want to know:  What happened to my son?   It is not an unreasonable question. It is not unusual, by the way,  for parents to have some emotional characteristics at the time they are  posing questions because they just lost their son. They don't know what  happened.   This officer proceeded to explain to them that their son approached  an undercover officer, that their son approached this officer, who was  seated in a vehicle, and when he approached this officer, he had his  phone in one hand and a gun in the other hand.   There were persons who were with them at the time the officer was  explaining this. These persons sought to intercede and said he had a BB  gun. The officer acknowledged that it was a BB gun.   They were told by this officer that the officer who was seated in the  vehicle, the officer who was undercover, around 6 a.m., that he told  the son to lower his BB pistol--he didn't say BB pistol, but to lower  what he thought was a gun.   The story gets murky, but the officer who was undercover said to the  son: Lower your pistol. Lower your gun.   He said that their son, Josh, did not do so, that he, in fact, raised  it, and the officer responded by shooting him--not once, but twice.   The parents were obviously moved by what they were hearing. By the  way, all of this is recorded. What I am saying to you now was being  recorded. I have the recording.   They were moved by what was said, and they were wanting more answers.  This officer told them that this is how it happened. Maybe not in these  exact words, but Ms. Beary quotes him as saying: ``This is how it  happened,'' and there is ``no reason to believe it happened any other  way.''   Well, let's examine that statement, ``no reason to believe it  happened any other way.'' The officer investigating said this without  the benefit of a body camera, unlike the George Floyd case where there  were multiple cameras, and we saw different angles. No body camera; no  camera recording by someone who was a witness standing by; no camera  available to the officer who now, within a few hours at most, is giving  this rendition of what happened to their son.   He said what he said without the benefit of speaking to a medical  examiner. The medical examiner had not arrived. He came to his  conclusions without the benefit of what would ordinarily be an autopsy  that would be performed at a later time. No autopsy had been performed,  so he couldn't have come to these conclusions after perusing an autopsy  report.   He came to these conclusions without speaking to the officer who shot  her son. No autopsy report; no ballistics report; no conversation with  the medical examiner; no body camera. But he indicated that ``this is  how it happened,'' and there is ``no reason to believe it happened any  other way.'' No other way?   You haven't had a conversation with a medical examiner. You haven't  talked to the person who actually did the shooting. You have no body  camera. No other way?   You have no ballistics report. No other way?   That story became the actual story that has been published and  republished, and it causes great grief for this family because they  believe that there has to be a better investigation, that this officer  was too quick to draw these conclusions.   In court, we call these things a rush to judgment, a rush to judgment  within just a few hours, without having completed an investigation.   He didn't do a walkthrough, hadn't done the walkthrough. For those  who may not be familiar with walkthroughs, this is where the officer  gets with the person involved, the officer who was in the car, and they  walk through and point out certain things that may have happened. He  couldn't have had the walkthrough because he didn't talk to the officer  who did the shooting.   The family, desperate for help, finally contacted my office. I was,  quite frankly, amazed myself when I heard the recording of this officer  who was investigating.   By the way, before we go any further, I need to say this: This is not  an indictment of all police officers, not an indictment of all peace  officers. We are talking about a circumstance that happened in my  congressional district.   So, they came to me, and I decided that I would, at a very minimum,  go out and see what they were trying to call to my attention.   I was a judge for a quarter of a century of a lowly justice/small  claims court. I was known to go out and look at things, to go to the  scene of things that occurred, so I went. Thank God I did.   After going out to the actual site, things became even more murky. I  was there, getting an understanding as to where the officer was  supposed to have been at the time the encounter with their son took  place. The son is Joshua, and I am not going to call the name of the  officer who did the shooting. At the time the encounter took place and  the shooting occurred, it became difficult to comprehend some evidence  that was found in a location many feet away, over behind some cars,  near a garage, across a street, behind not one, not two, but three  cars.    It became difficult to understand how this piece of evidence was at  this location, difficult to understand because the piece of evidence  was a bullet, a bullet that was fired from the shooter's weapon, made  its way to this very difficult location, hit the garage, and bounced  off onto the pavement.   This was found the same day that the investigation was taking place.  It is difficult to comprehend how it got there, given the angles  involved and the location of the garage. It is difficult to understand.   Later on, after talking to more people, we concluded that it would be  appropriate to ask the sheriff for a visit. The sheriff was very  generous with his time. He did visit with the family, and he brought  others with him, another person with him. They had a visit.  [[Page H2099]]    We talked, and the sheriff gave assurances that there would be a  thorough investigation.   After having that conversation with the sheriff, something else was  discovered. This family had a camera. We didn't know about the camera  at the time they heard from the initial officer who was investigating.   So, there is a camera that monitors the street that runs past their  home. This camera picked up what appears to be the shooting officer,  who was undercover, parked on the street. It picked him up as he left  the scene. This is important.   Their son is shot twice. Apparently, based upon what has been said  and what the evidence seems to reveal, he walked away after he was hit  twice. He went over to a car, his car, parked some feet away. He made  his way into his car, sat on the driver's side, under the steering  wheel. Apparently, having done this--this is, without question, he did  these things. Apparently, he is shot twice. The officer drives away  after shooting him twice. He leaves the scene, and the person shot, to  go out to some other location.   Now, if this is true--and I say ``apparently'' because you look at  the cars and then you have to draw conclusions. But if this is true,  what kind of officer--assuming that all of what he said was the case,  do you really leave the scene? Do you leave a person who is armed, if  you believe the person to be armed? Do you leave this person who you  believe to be armed to be out, such that someone else might be harmed?  There are a lot of questions to be answered.                                time  1415    There a lot of questions to be answered. The family needs to know. I  have some of the questions that the family would like to have answers  to. I am going to share a few of these questions with you because it is  a year later. They have not had any indication that they will receive  justice in the near future, perhaps, but not the kind of indication  that they are looking for.   Here is a question: How could an investigating officer present an  accurate assessment of the facts to Mr. and Mrs. Beary, near the scene,  within a few hours after Joshua, their son, was killed, before having  done the walk-through, without talking to the deputy who did the  shooting, without the benefit of a camera recording, before the medical  examiner examined the body of their son, before an autopsy report was  completed, and, in fact, an autopsy was performed, before a ballistics  report was produced? How could he present an accurate assessment?   And this assessment has been published and republished many times.   Second question: How did the bullet hit this garage of the neighbor  across the street with no clear path from where the shooter indicated  the shooting took place or where it was indicated by someone that the  shooting took place?   Third question: Why would the deputy leave the scene immediately or  sometime shortly after firing those shots?   This is a questionable circumstance. It is not comparable to what  happened to George Floyd.   And the question that we are going to have to grapple with is: What  happens when the cameras are off and no witnesses are available, and  you have evidence that seems to contradict the story of the  investigating officer, that was given before he had an opportunity to  perform a fair and accurate investigation?   What happens when you don't have what we have in the George Floyd  case?   Notwithstanding all that we had in the George Floyd case, I don't  know of a single person who thought that there would be a guilty,  guilty, guilty; who thought that the officer would be found guilty on  all three of the charges. I don't know of a single person. Perhaps you  do.   But notwithstanding all of the evidence that we saw, all of the  testimony that we heard, there were people--I was among them--who  literally had great concern for what the verdict would be and how it  would be responded to. I had my concerns. I think they were legitimate  concerns to have in this case, given our history in the case of  questionable shootings, police-civilian encounters, and a person ends  up losing his life.   I heard the verdict with my colleagues right here on campus in this  facility, and I believed it after a moment of disbelief. It wasn't  something that you just automatically, axiomatically believe. But it  was something that I believed, but I had a moment of disbelief. But I  knew that verdict could be a seminal moment in time that will impact  the rest of time.   I believe that those jurors will be treated very kindly by history. I  think that history is going to show that they were people who rose to  the occasion. Jurors do this, they can rise to the occasion. These did,  and I am grateful to them.   I believe that those officers who testified rose to the occasion.  They separated themselves from that which is perceived to be egregious,  and that is being kind, but they separated themselves from that  conduct. History will be kind to them.   But there was overwhelming evidence, and we know what happened with  overwhelming evidence. This case has not been ruled upon or judged by a  grand jury, and, as a result, we don't know what will happen. All we  know is that this family is still grieving. It has been a year since  their son lost his life--a year today, around 6 a.m.--and they are  still waiting for a decision.   I have some concerns now about the decision. Hear my concerns.   Let us assume that it goes before a grand jury, this case. When I say  ``it,'' I mean this case goes before a grand jury. And let's assume  that it results in a no bill, the grand jury does not indict. It does  not return a true bill, which would be an indictment. Let's assume this  is a no bill in this case. What happens before the grand jury stays  with the grand jury. This family won't have answers.   There was supposed to be a ballistics report.   Will they have the opportunity to read the ballistics report?   I hope so. But the grand jury works in secrecy. It is shrouded in  secrecy. And I am not antithetical to grand juries. But my point is,  will this family get answers if there is a no bill?   The system has got to change. You cannot leave a family under these  circumstances with more questions than answers after the case has made  its way through the judicial system. You can't leave them like this.  They will suffer the rest of their lives. They have got to know what  happened.   The system has to change. There has to be a way for these families to  know more about what happened when the cameras are off and no witnesses  are available. There has to be a way for them to at least know what  happens when the case is presented.   They are not allowed to be there when the grand jury deliberates. I  am not going to quarrel with this. I understand that grand jurors have  a right, to some degree, of protection because what they do can bring  harm to them. But what I don't understand is why we don't have a system  that allows for the evidence to be made available to people who have  lost someone near and dear, someone that they love.   In Texas, there is another way that would be perceived as novel. It  is only in Texas, by the way. Only in Texas. There is something called  a court of inquiry. In Texas, if you believe that a crime has been  committed, you can take your evidence to a district court judge, and  you can ask that judge to review what you have. And if that judge  believes that there may have been a crime committed, that judge would  go to an administrative judge. We will call this person a presiding  judge. And then that judge can require--that second judge--so you have  two judges involved--happens to concur. And then witnesses can be  called, and we can examine what happened. But this is only in Texas.    I am looking at legislation to give us the opportunity at a national  level to do something similar to what we can do in Texas, because  people need to know. These parents would feel much better and get  through the grieving process, something that we all will go through at  some point in our lives if we live long enough. It would give them--if  they had the transparency, if they could just know what was said, what  was the decision really based upon if there is not a true bill, an  indictment. They need to know.   But they represent many other families who have circumstances where  [[Page H2100]]  they have lost someone; questionable circumstances, no camera, no  witnesses; and in some cases where there are witnesses who are not  believed; in some cases where the camera reveals what others would have  us not believe when we see it with our own eyes. There are some cases  where we have had video, but we are told that we can't believe our  eyes.   Thank God the jurors in the George Floyd case believed their eyes,  believed what they saw, believed those officers who gave testimony.   I hope that we will, at some point in our history, reach a time when  we won't have a Member of Congress have to engage with family members  under these circumstances, but some things have to change before we  will get to this time.   One of the things that will have to change is a belief that has been  called to our attention by some people who have been demeaned and  vilified. And the belief is that Black lives matter.   This is a powerful movement.   Are there some persons who associate with the movement who may have  done some things that I don't approve of?   Yes, many have.   But this is a powerful movement. We have got to have persons who are  armed, those who have the power of life and death, believe that Black  lives matter. We have got to have them believe that you don't have the  right to punish a person after you have arrested the person.   Notwithstanding what you heard a former President say, you don't have  the right to punish after you have arrested. And you know he said it.                                time  1430    He told peace officers--I like peace officer as opposed to police-- when you are arresting a person you don't have to be nice.   Madam Speaker, once you have a person within your care, custody, and  control, that person's well-being is in your hands. You don't have the  power or the right to punish them. You may have the power, but you  don't have the right to. You don't punish 9 minutes and 29 seconds, a  knee on a neck--cruel and unusual punishment. You don't have the right  to do this. You may have the power, but you don't have the right. If  Black lives matter, then you wouldn't do it.   Not all police officers--not all peace officers--I prefer peace  officer to police--not all, but those who do have to be punished,  because we have got to let the world know that Black lives matter and  that you have got to treat people with the same level of dignity and  respect that you want your child to receive and that you want your  mother to receive, the same level of dignity and respect because Black  lives matter.   I will be with the Bearys this weekend. There will be a vigil in  Houston, and I will be there with them. My hope is that we will have  heard something about their son's demise from the officials who are  charged with the responsibility and an obligation to perform a just and  fair investigation. My hope is that this will happen and that they will  have some closures.   Madam Speaker, I want Mr. and Mrs. Beary to know that I am never  going to give up on this. Their son's life mattered to me. I never met  him, but his life mattered. I will be with them. I will be with them  until the end. His life mattered.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
