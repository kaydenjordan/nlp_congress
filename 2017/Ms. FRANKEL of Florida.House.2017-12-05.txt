 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  bipartisan Taylor Force Act, which eliminates United States aid to the  Palestinians unless they end payments to terrorists. I thank my  colleagues, the chair, and the ranking member for their leadership.    Today we are condemning an evil system that rewards terrorists based  on how many innocent civilians they maim or kill. In recent decades,  1,600 people have been killed by Palestinian terror attacks, like 17- year-old Liana Sakiyan, a high-spirited girl, a friend to many. On a  break from exams, she and her friends were in line for a night of  celebration at a discotheque in Tel Aviv when a bomb went off,  instantly snuffing out her life and 20 other innocent young Israelis.   As a reward for this heinous attack, the suicide bomber's family  received thousands of dollars from the Palestinian Authority--this  authority which continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars to  terrorists and their families, a part of the so-called martyrs' fund.  This legislation, which correctly exempts humanitarian and democracy- promoting programs, tells the Palestinian Authority: No more pay to  slay.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill.
