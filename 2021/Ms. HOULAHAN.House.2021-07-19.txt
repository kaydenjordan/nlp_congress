 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1158) to provide women and girls safe access to sanitation  facilities in refugee camps.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1158         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Refugee Sanitation Facility       Safety Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. SECURE ACCESS TO SANITATION FACILITIES FOR WOMEN AND                     GIRLS.         Subsection (a) of section 501 of the Foreign Relations       Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (22 U.S.C. 2601       note) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (6) through (11) as       paragraphs (7) through (12), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (5) the following new       paragraph:        ``(6) the provision of safe and secure access to sanitation       facilities, with a special emphasis on women, girls, and       vulnerable populations.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1158.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1158, the Refugee  Sanitation Facility Safety Act of 2021.   Mr. Speaker, according to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, by  the end of 2020, there were at least 26 million people worldwide living  as refugees, the highest number ever recorded.   As people who have been forced to flee their home countries because  of persecution or because of violence, refugees are amongst the globe's  most vulnerable populations. To make matters worse, these people must  often settle in areas that are inadequate in terms of necessities such  as access to water, shelter, and sanitation.   Simply put, the conditions that refugees regularly endure are  unacceptable. People should not have to surrender their access to  sanitation in exchange for their own safety.   That is why I support the Refugee Sanitation Facility Safety Act.  This bill would ensure that refugees have safe and secure access to  sanitation facilities, with a special emphasis on women, girls, and the  most vulnerable populations.   By providing for safe and secure sanitation facilities, this bill  will not only improve the health and safety of tens of millions living  in refugee settlements, but it will also allow these same people to  focus more of their energy and ingenuity into rebuilding their lives.   I thank my colleague from New York, Representative Grace Meng, a  tireless champion for the rights of vulnerable people, women, and  girls, for authoring this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, this is lifesaving legislation. By helping ensure that  women and children, who make up the majority of refugees around the  world, have access to safe and secure sanitation facilities, this body  will dramatically improve the health and quality of life of millions of  people who have already suffered so much.   Again, I thank my friend, Congresswoman Meng, for introducing this  invaluable legislation. I urge my colleagues to give it their full  support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 826) to require consultations on reuniting Korean Americans  with family members in North Korea.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 826         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Divided Families       Reunification Act''.       SEC. 2. CONSULTATIONS ON REUNITING KOREAN AMERICANS WITH                     FAMILY MEMBERS IN NORTH KOREA.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The division of the Korean Peninsula into South Korea       and North Korea separated thousands of Koreans from family       members.        (2) Since the signing of the Agreement Concerning a       Military Armistice in Korea, signed at Panmunjom July 27,       1953 (commonly referred to as the ``Korean War Armistice       Agreement''), there has been little to no contact between       Korean Americans and family members who remain in North       Korea.        (3) North Korea and South Korea first agreed to reunions of       divided families in 1985 and have since held 21 face-to-face       reunions and multiple video link reunions.        (4) Those reunions have subsequently given approximately       24,500 Koreans the opportunity to briefly reunite with loved       ones.        (5) The most recent family reunions between North Korea and       South Korea took place in August 2018 and did not include any       Korean Americans.        (6) The United States and North Korea do not maintain       diplomatic relations and certain limitations exist on Korean       Americans participating in face-to-face reunions.        (7) According to the most recent census, more than       1,700,000 people living in the United States are of Korean       descent.        (8) The number of first generation Korean and Korean       American family members divided from family members in North       Korea is rapidly diminishing given the advanced age of those       family members. More than 3,000 elderly South Koreans die       each year without having been reunited with their family       members.        (9) Many Korean Americans with family members in North       Korea have not seen or communicated with those family members       in more than 60 years.        (10) The inclusion of Korean American families in the       reunion process, with the support of international       organizations with expertise in family tracing, would       constitute a positive humanitarian gesture by the Government       of North Korea.        (11) Section 1265 of the National Defense Authorization Act       for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 407)       required the President to submit to Congress a report on       ``efforts, if any, of the United States Government to       facilitate family reunions between United States citizens and       their relatives in North Korea''.        (12) The position of Special Envoy on North Korean Human       Rights Issues has been vacant since January 2017, although       the President is required to appoint a Senate-confirmed       Special Envoy to fill this position in accordance with       section 107 of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22       U.S.C. 7817).        (13) In the report of the Committee on Appropriations of       the House of Representatives accompanying H.R. 3081, 111th       Congress (House Report 111-187), the Committee urged ``the       Special Representative on North Korea Policy, as the senior       official handling North Korea issues, to prioritize the       issues involving Korean divided families and to, if       necessary, appoint a coordinator for such families''.        (14) In the report of the Committee on Appropriations of       the House of Representatives accompanying H.R. 133, 116th       Congress (House Report 116-444), the Committee urged ``the       Office of North Korean Human Rights, in consultation with       Korean American community organizations, to identify Korean       Americans who wish to be reunited with their family in North       Korea in anticipation of future reunions''.        (b) Consultations.--        (1) Consultations with south korea.--The Secretary of       State, or a designee of the Secretary, should consult with       officials of South Korea, as appropriate, on potential       opportunities to reunite Korean American families with family       members in North Korea from which such Korean American       families were divided after the signing of the Korean War       Armistice Agreement, including potential opportunities for       video reunions for Korean Americans with such family members.        (2) Consultations with korean americans.--The Special Envoy       on North Korean Human Rights Issues of the Department of       State should regularly consult with representatives of Korean       Americans who have family members in North Korea with respect       to efforts to reunite families divided after the signing of       the Korean War Armistice Agreement, including potential       opportunities for video reunions for Korean Americans with       such family members.        (3) No additional authorization of appropriations.--No       additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated to the       Department of State to carry out consultations under this       subsection.        (c) Additional Matter in Report.--The Secretary of State,       acting through the Special Envoy on North Korean Human Rights       Issues, shall include in each report required under section       107(d) of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22       U.S.C. 7817(d)), a description of the consultations described       in subsection (b) conducted during the year preceding the       submission of each report required under such section 107(d).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 826.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 826, the Divided  Families Reunification Act, introduced by my colleague, Representative  Grace Meng, who has been a tireless champion of reuniting divided  Korean-American families.   This bill encourages the State Department to engage with the South  Korean Government and Korean-American families regarding opportunities  to reunite those families with their relatives in North Korea.                                time  1530    Many Korean Americans have been unable to see or hear from their  loved ones for over 70 years, a unique heartache that very few of us  can really understand.   Family is the bedrock of our society. Tragically, for thousands of  Korean Americans, their sisters and brothers and even daughters and  sons have been painfully out of reach through no fault of their own.   While there have been 21 family reunions held between North and South  Korea since 1985, Korean Americans with family members in North Korea  have been unable to participate.   As many of these Korean Americans are aging, we must advocate for  humane and commonsense policy to help Korean-American families reunite  with their loved ones in North Korea. We have the resources and the  technology to reunite these families. What we need now is action to  implement a more compassionate policy.   This is an important measure. I support it, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, for decades Korean Americans have been unable to see or  speak with their family members in North Korea, and for too many, time  is running out. This heartbreaking reality has taken a huge toll, and  it is time to take action.   This bill, introduced by my colleague, Representative Meng, would  spur the State Department into finding opportunities to reunite them  with their loved ones and to address this humanitarian issue that has  caused so much heartache for countless Korean Americans.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 294) encouraging reunions of divided Korean- American families.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 294         Whereas the Korean Peninsula, with the Republic of Korea       (in this resolution referred to as ``South Korea'') in the       South and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (in this       resolution referred to as ``North Korea'') in the North,       remains divided following the signing of the Korean War       Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953;        Whereas the division of the Korean Peninsula separated more       than 10,000,000 Korean family members, including some who are       now citizens of the United States;        Whereas there have been 21 rounds of family reunions       between South Koreans and North Koreans along the border       since 2000;  [[Page H3653]]         Whereas Congress signaled its support for family reunions       between United States citizens and their relatives in North       Korea in section 1265 of the National Defense Authorization       Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181), signed into       law by President George W. Bush on January 28, 2008;        Whereas most of the population of divided family members in       the United States, initially estimated at 100,000 in 2001,       has significantly dwindled as many of the individuals have       passed away;        Whereas the summit between North Korea and South Korea on       April 27, 2018, has prioritized family reunions;        Whereas the United States and North Korea have engaged in       talks during 2 historic summits in June 2018 in Singapore and       February 2019 in Hanoi; and        Whereas many Korean Americans are waiting for a chance to       meet their relatives in North Korea for the first time in       more than 60 years: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the United States and North Korea to begin the       process of reuniting Korean-American divided family members       with their immediate relatives through ways such as--        (A) identifying divided families in the United States and       North Korea who are willing and able to participate in a       pilot program for family reunions;        (B) finding matches for members of such families through       organizations such as the Red Cross; and        (C) working with the Government of South Korea to include       American citizens in inter-Korean video reunions;        (2) reaffirms the institution of family as inalienable and,       accordingly, urges the restoration of contact between divided       families physically, literarily, or virtually; and        (3) calls on the United States and North Korea to pursue       reunions as a humanitarian priority of immediate concern.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 294.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 294, a resolution  encouraging reunions of divided Korean-American families, introduced by  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).   The Korean war claimed millions of lives and left the Korean  peninsula and its people absolutely devastated. Though an armistice  ended hostilities between North and South Korea nearly 70 years ago,  many of the wounds inflicted by the war have never fully healed, in  part because more than 10 million Koreans were separated from their  family members during that conflict.   Today, there are still thousands of Korean Americans who live waiting  and hoping for the chance to see their relatives living in North Korea.   Mr. Speaker, the pain of being separated from your family does not  dull with time. This resolution would give peace of mind to many by  identifying families in the United States and in North Korea who are  willing and able to participate in family reunification.   This resolution would also allow for organizations like the Red Cross  to assist in reuniting families and working with our allies in South  Korea to reunite families through video reunions.   We must act now because the number of surviving relatives is  declining, and time is running out to right the wrong these families  have suffered. There is an urgent humanitarian need to reunite Korean  Americans with their war-torn loved ones and to provide much-needed  healing, closure, and restoration of bonds broken seven decades ago.   By passing this humane, bipartisan resolution, this body will provide  Korean Americans the precious opportunity they have been denied for too  long. I thank Representative Bass for authoring this important  humanitarian legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass), my great friend, who is a champion of these  issues.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, for nearly 70 years, Korean Americans and their  relatives have hoped and prayed to one day be together again. We cannot  allow any  [[Page H3654]]  further delay in reuniting these families with their loved ones. This  resolution is commonsense, bipartisan legislation that is long overdue,  and it will make an invaluable impact on the lives of thousands of  Korean Americans and their families.   I thank Representative Karen Bass for working so diligently on this  essential humanitarian resolution. I ask all of my colleagues to give  it their support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2118) to authorize United States participation in the  Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2118         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing America From       Epidemics Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Due to increasing population and population density,       human mobility, and ecological change, emerging infectious       diseases pose a real and growing threat to global health       security.        (2) While vaccines can be the most effective tools to       protect against infectious disease, the absence of vaccines       for a new or emerging infectious disease with epidemic       potential is a major health security threat globally, posing       catastrophic potential human and economic costs.        (3) The COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than       119,960,700 individuals and has killed at least 2,656,822       people worldwide, and it is likely that unreported cases and       deaths are significant.        (4) Even regional outbreaks can have enormous human costs       and substantially disrupt the global economy and cripple       regional economies. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa       killed more than 11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses in       the affected countries alone.        (5) While the need for vaccines to address emerging       epidemic threats is acute, markets to drive the necessary       development of vaccines to address them--a complex and       expensive undertaking--are very often critically absent. Also       absent are mechanisms to ensure access to those vaccines by       those who need them when they need them.        (6) To address this global vulnerability and the deficit of       political commitment, institutional capacity, and funding, in       2017, several countries and private partners launched the       Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).       CEPI's mission is to stimulate, finance, and coordinate       development of vaccines for high-priority, epidemic-potential       threats in cases where traditional markets do not exist or       cannot create sufficient demand.        (7) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI seeks to bring       priority vaccines candidates through the end of phase II       clinical trials, as well as support vaccine platforms that       can be rapidly deployed against emerging pathogens.        (8) CEPI supported the manufacturing of the United States-      developed Moderna COVID-19 vaccine during its Phase 1       clinical trial, and CEPI has initiated at least 12       partnerships to develop vaccines against COVID-19.        (9) CEPI is co-leading COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the       ACT-Accelerator, which is a global collaboration to quickly       produce and equitably distribute safe and effective vaccines       and therapeutics for COVID-19.        (10) Support for and participation in CEPI is an important       part of the United States own health security and biodefense       and is in the national interest, complementing the work of       many Federal agencies and providing significant value through       global partnership and burden-sharing.       SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION.         (a) In General.--The United States is hereby authorized to       participate in the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness       Innovations (``Coalition'').        (b) Designation.--The President is authorized to designate       an employee of the relevant Federal department or agency       providing the majority of United States contributions to the       Coalition, who should demonstrate knowledge and experience in       the fields of development and public health, epidemiology, or       medicine, to serve--        (1) on the Investors Council of the Coalition; and        (2) if nominated by the President, on the Board of       Directors of the Coalition, as a representative of the United       States.        (c) Reports to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit       to the appropriate congressional committees a report that       includes the following:        (1) The United States planned contributions to the       Coalition and the mechanisms for United States participation       in such Coalition.        (2) The manner and extent to which the United States shall       participate in the governance of the Coalition.        (3) How participation in the Coalition supports relevant       United States Government strategies and programs in health       security and biodefense, including--        (A) the Global Health Security Strategy required by section       7058(c)(3) of division K of the Consolidated Appropriations       Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-141);        (B) the applicable revision of the National Biodefense       Strategy required by section 1086 of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (6 U.S.C. 104); and        (C) any other relevant decision-making process for policy,       planning, and spending in global health security, biodefense,       or vaccine and medical countermeasures research and       development.        (d) United States Contributions.--Amounts authorized to be       appropriated under chapters 1 and 10 of part I and chapter 4       of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.       2151 et seq.) are authorized to be made available for United       States contributions to the Coalition.        (e) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this section,       the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2118.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2118, the Securing  America From Epidemics Act.   I thank my colleague, Representative Ami Bera, chairman of the  Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia and Nonproliferation  for championing this important bill that will save the lives and  protect the United States from the threat of future pandemics.   This bill would authorize the United States to participate in the  Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, a private- public partnership that helps accelerate the development of vaccines  against emergent infections, including Ebola and COVID-19.   The COVID-19 crisis has shown just how interconnected our world is  and how important vaccines are to ending one of the greatest  catastrophes of the 21st century. By developing vaccines and enabling  countries to administer vaccine doses effectively, we can end  pandemics. We do this by ensuring vaccines get into the arms of the  most vulnerable, and by instilling confidence in people that the  vaccine saves lives.   Now more than ever with the rise of the deadly delta variant, and  COVID-19 cases ravaging clusters across the country where vaccination  rates are low, the collective resources of the private sector,  multilateral organizations, national governments, civil society, and  health experts are all vital to ending the pandemic.   By supporting CEPI, we demonstrate the value of leveraging individual  strengths towards collective action and create a leading global  framework of developing an effective vaccine response to stop future  pandemics.  [[Page H3655]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 has demonstrated the need for collective global  action to end pandemics. The Securing America From Epidemics Act  authorizes the United States to galvanize that collective response by  partnering in CEPI so that we may lead in building a more effective  global framework.   We call COVID-19 a once-in-a-century pandemic, but we all share  concerns that with the world growing smaller and smaller every day that  these outbreaks will only become more and more frequent and clearly  more catastrophic. There is an urgent need for the public-private  global action H.R. 2118 would help accelerate, not only for COVID-19,  but God forbid, for any other future pandemics.   I thank my colleague, Representative Ami Bera, for his leadership in  championing this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1079) to establish an interagency working group to develop a  comprehensive, strategic plan to control locust outbreaks in the East  Africa region and address future outbreaks in order to avert mass scale  food insecurity and potential political destabilization, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1079         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Desert Locust Control Act''.       SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to prioritize efforts       to control the ongoing desert locust outbreak in East Africa       and other affected regions, mitigate the impacts on food       security, economic productivity, and political stability,       improve interagency coordination to prevent future outbreaks,       and promote resilience in affected countries.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States Agency for International Development       reports that countries in East Africa are currently suffering       the worst desert locust outbreak in decades, which will       devour crops and pasture and destroy local livelihoods across       the region.        (2) As of December 2020, the Food and Agriculture       Organization reported that there were 42 million people       experiencing acute food insecurity in East Africa, which       numbers are projected to increase if the desert locust       outbreak is not controlled.        (3) The desert locust outbreak in East Africa, particularly       in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, is negatively impacting food       security, local livelihoods and economic productivity, and       may threaten political stability in the region.        (4) Proactive investments now to control the desert locust       outbreak could reduce the need for a much larger United       States humanitarian response effort later, as well as support       economic and political stability and build resilience in       affected countries.        (5) In order to optimize the United States response to the       desert locust outbreak, an interagency working group should       be established to develop and implement a comprehensive,       strategic plan to control the desert locust outbreak in East       Africa and other affected regions, mitigate impacts on food       security, economic productivity, and political stability and       prevent future outbreaks.       SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP.         (a) Establishment.--The President shall establish an       interagency working group to coordinate the United States       response to the ongoing desert locust outbreak in East Africa       and other affected regions, including the development of a       comprehensive, strategic plan to control the outbreak,       mitigate the impacts on food security, economic productivity,       and political stability, and prevent future outbreaks.        (b) Membership.--        (1) In general.--The interagency working group shall be       composed of the following:        (A) Two representatives from the United States Agency for       International Development.        (B) One representative from each of the following:        (i) The United States Mission to the United Nations       Agencies for Food and Agriculture.        (ii) The National Security Council.        (iii) The Department of State.        (iv) The Department of Defense.        (v) The Department of Agriculture.        (vi) Any other relevant Federal department or agency.        (2) Chair.--The President shall designate one of the       representatives from the United States Agency for       International Development described in paragraph (1)(A) to       serve as chair of the interagency working group.        (c) Duties.--The interagency working group shall--        (1) assess the scope of the desert locust outbreak in East       Africa and other affected regions, including its impact on       food security, economic productivity, and political stability       in affected countries;        (2) assess the impacts of restrictions relating to the       coronavirus disease 2019 (commonly referred to as ``COVID-      19'') pandemic on efforts to control the desert locust       outbreak and mitigate its impacts and in exacerbating food       insecurity;        (3) monitor the effectiveness of ongoing assistance efforts       to control the desert locust outbreak and mitigate its       impacts and identify gaps and opportunities for additional       support to such programs;        (4) review the effectiveness of regional and multilateral       efforts to control the desert locust outbreak and the       coordination among relevant United States Government       agencies, regional governments, and international       organizations, including the World  [[Page H3656]]       Food Programme and the United Nations Food and Agriculture       Organization; and        (5) not later than 90 days after the establishment of the       interagency working group under subsection (a), develop and       submit to the President and the appropriate congressional       committees a comprehensive, strategic plan to control the       desert locust outbreak, including a description of efforts       to--        (A) improve coordination among relevant United States       Government agencies, regional governments, and international       organizations, including the World Food Programme and the       United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization;        (B) ensure delivery of necessary assets control the desert       locust outbreak and humanitarian and development assistance       to address and mitigate impacts to food security, economic       productivity, and political stability; and        (C) to the extent practicable, prevent and mitigate future       desert locust and other, similar destructive insect outbreaks       (such as Fall Armyworm) in Africa and other parts of the       world, which require a humanitarian response.        (d) Interagency Working Group Support.--The interagency       working group shall continue to meet not less than semi-      annually to facilitate implementation of the comprehensive,       strategic plan required by subsection (c)(5).        (e) Sunset.--This Act shall terminate on the date that is 2       years after the date of the enactment of this Act, or at such       time as there is no longer an upsurge in the desert locust       outbreak in East Africa, whichever occurs earlier.        (g) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1079, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1079, the Desert Locust  Control Act introduced by my colleague, Representative Chris Smith,  ranking member of the Africa and Global Health and Global Human Rights  Subcommittee.   Starting in late 2019, swarms of locusts entered the Horn of Africa  from the Gulf of Aden, multiplying and spreading throughout the region.  Ever since it began, the locust outbreak has plagued the most  vulnerable and threatened their ability to lead full lives, generate  income, and to feed themselves and their families.   Locusts are a highly mobile insect and have the capacity to consume  vast amounts of crops in a very short period of time. Even a small  swarm can consume food for up to 35,000 people each day. This has  devastated large swaths of crops throughout East Africa, including  Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia, and stretching as far as Uganda and the  Democratic Republic of Congo.   Food security is already hanging by a thread in this region, and  efforts to control the scale of destruction have been hindered by COVID  restrictions, lack of reliable data, and the geographic reach of the  outbreak across multiple countries. While some efforts have been  successful in containing the outbreak from spreading further into West  Africa, good rains this spring allowed for additional breeding,  threatening future harvests in Somalia and Ethiopia. This measure would  harmonize efforts across the United States Government to evaluate and  respond to the locust outbreak, bringing in the support of the U.S.  mission to the Food and Agricultural Organization, USAID, and others to  establish a working group responding to the outbreak.   We have already seen the ripple effects of COVID on poverty, food  insecurity, health, education, and so much more. We must ensure that we  don't let this outbreak continue to exacerbate and accelerate those  already existing challenges.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass), the lead Democrat on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, given the incredible damage locusts can inflict in such  a short time, it is critical that our ability to evaluate and respond  to these outbreaks is efficient across our government, including the  U.S. mission to the Food and Agriculture Organization and to the USAID.   That is exactly what this bill will do to help support regions that  were already struggling with food security from being further impacted  by locust swarms consuming their crops.   I thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa, Global  Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations, my  colleague, Representative Smith, for introducing this important bill,  and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1036) to amend the State Department Basic Authorities Act of  1956 to authorize rewards under the Department of State's rewards  program relating to information regarding individuals or entities  engaged in activities in contravention of United States or United  Nations sanctions, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1036         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bassam Barabandi Rewards for       Justice Act''.       SECTION 2. AMENDMENT TO DEPARTMENT OF STATE REWARDS PROGRAM.         Subsection (b) of section 36 of the State Department Basic       Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2708) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (11), by striking ``or'' after the       semicolon at the end;        (2) in paragraph (12), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; or''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph.        ``(13) the identification or location of an individual or       entity that--        ``(A) knowingly, directly or indirectly, imports, exports,       or reexports to, into, or from any country any goods,       services, or technology controlled for export by the United       States because of the use of such goods, services, or       technology in contravention of a United States or United       Nations sanction; or        ``(B) knowingly, directly or indirectly, provides training,       advice, or other services or assistance, or engages in       significant financial transactions, relating to any such       goods, services, or technology in contravention of such       sanction.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1036.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1036, the Bassam  Barabandi Rewards for Justice Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by  my friend, the gentleman from South Carolina, Congressman   Joe Wilson,  and the gentleman from Florida, Ted Deutch.   Mr. Speaker, whistleblower programs have proven themselves effective  over and over again. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice collected  $3.7 billion in settlements and judgments from False Claim Act cases  against companies and individuals who had defrauded the government. Of  the $3.7 billion, 92 percent came from cases brought by whistleblowers.  Whistleblowers have easier access to evidence of misdeeds than outside  law enforcement investigators, deeper knowledge of the bad  [[Page H3658]]  actors engaged in unlawful behavior, and greater insights into the  methods through which fraud or theft is being carried out.   This bipartisan bill would authorize the Department of State to offer  rewards for information about the identity or location of individuals  who defy sanctions imposed by the United States or by the United  Nations.   This legislation builds on several existing programs that provide  rewards of information leading to the arrest or conviction of criminals  engaging in human trafficking, smuggling, or other transnational  crimes.   This bill will also increase compliance with American and  international sanctions programs and, therefore, serves a valuable role  promoting human rights, good governance, and the rule of law around the  world.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Wilson and Mr. Deutch for their diligent  work on this legislation, and I encourage all Members to join me in  supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is vital to helping the United States  protect human rights and the rule of law around the world.   By allowing the State Department to compensate individuals for  bringing forward evidence of sanctions evasion and criminal misconduct  by bad actors, America will be better equipped to punish those who  flout the rule of law.   I thank my colleagues, Representatives Wilson and Deutch for putting  forward this key legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
