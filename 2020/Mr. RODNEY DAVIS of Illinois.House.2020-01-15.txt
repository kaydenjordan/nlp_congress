 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Ms. Zena Cardman, a recent graduate of NASA's Astronaut Candidate Class  XXII, and a native of Urbana, Illinois.   Zena was selected in 2017 from a pool of more than 18,000 applicants  as some of the brightest and most skilled minds in the country. The  past 2 years of training and her graduation from candidate school  earned her the title of astronaut, and she is now eligible for  spaceflight.   As a new grad, Zena will support NASA's current missions, such as the  work aboard the International Space Station, the Commercial Crew  Program, and the Artemis Program, which has set a goal of sending  humans back to the Moon by 2024.   I am proud to recognize Zena today as one of the best minds in space  exploration. I know she will be an invaluable asset to NASA. I extend a  well-deserved congratulations to Zena and congratulate her on her  graduation. I thank her for all she has done.                          Remembering Frank Mitchell     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  Frank Mitchell, a native of Springfield, Illinois, and the first  African American House of Representatives page since Reconstruction. As  a student at Feitshans High School, Frank was asked to interview for a  position as a page for then-Congressman Paul Findley. When the school  principal, my good friend, Irv Smith, called to say they had selected  Frank, according to articles just recently, Frank said he went out and  he bought some suits, got a haircut, and headed for Washington.   After his year-long stint as a House page, Frank graduated from  Feitshans in 1967 and went on to work as a newspaper and TV reporter  before accepting positions with the Illinois Attorney General's Office  and eventually Cook County's Stroger Hospital. He is well-known across  the State for his work with the Illinois Fatherhood Initiative.   Congressman Paul Findley's son, Craig, who now chairs the Illinois  Prison Review Board, said Frank's appointment to the House as a page  was one of his father's proudest accomplishments. Frank brought credit  to the page system, Craig said, and I admired him for his service and  his friendship for decades.   Almost everyone that knew Frank felt that way. They admired him for  his service and his friendship. Frank was a well-loved part of the  Springfield community for years. I had the opportunity to meet many of  his family members and also those who helped Frank, and who Frank  helped through his career in public service when I went to his services  in Springfield just a few weeks ago.   For so many, Frank was a role model, he was a mentor, and he is part  of the history in this institution that so many of us have had the  opportunity to serve in this great Nation in the House of  Representatives.  [[Page H249]]    The House of Representatives is a better place because of Frank  Mitchell and Washington, D.C., is a better place because of Frank  Mitchell. Everybody that knew Frank Mitchell knows that their life has  been blessed.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Frank for his service, and he will be missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend  Mr. DeSaulnier from California for yielding. I also thank my good  friend Ms. Foxx, the ranking member of the Education and Labor  Committee and also Chairman Scott for your work on this.   I rise in support of Mr. DeSaulnier's amendment of which I am a  cosponsor. This amendment will require the GAO to report on the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission's ability to meet the demands of its  workload in terms of the number of cases they receive.   If this important bill is enacted, the EEOC will inevitably be  required to review an increasing number of mixed-motive age  discrimination claims, which are worthy of review. This amendment is  important because to adequately address workplace discrimination that  relates to age or any other factor, we must have the resources to  address and correct the problem.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I rise in support of my bipartisan amendment to H.R. 1230, the  Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.   I would like to thank my friends on both sides of the aisle for their  cosponsorship of my amendment, including Representatives Chellie  Pingree, Elise Stefanik, Haley Stevens, Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon, Marcy  Kaptur, Abigail Spanberger, Betty McCollum, Mark DeSaulnier,   David  Trone, Chris Smith, Pete Stauber, Will Hurd, and my colleague from the  great State of Illinois,   Mike Bost. I also thank Chairman Scott for  his support for this amendment.   I was proud to cosponsor this bill, which provides an important fix  caused by the 2009 Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. Supreme Court  decision. This bill will ensure that older workers can seek the justice  they deserve when they face age discrimination in the workplace on a  level playing field.   My amendment highlights the discrimination that women face in the  workplace based not only on gender but on age, as well.   According to a 2018 report from the EEOC, women, especially older  women, but also those at middle age, were subjected to more age  discrimination than most older men. In fact, some research suggests  that ageism at work begins at age 40 for women, 5 years earlier than  men. This is unacceptable, and we must find ways to correct the  problem.   This amendment would require the Department of Labor and the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission to conduct a comprehensive study on  these age discrimination cases. DOL and the EEOC would then be required  to make recommendations for best practices to combat age discrimination  of women in the workplace.   The challenges that women face are not partisan issues, and together  we can and should, Mr. Chairman, make every effort to address them.  Employers should make, and have the right tools to make, conscious  efforts to ensure that women have equal rights and opportunities in the  workplace regardless of their age.   I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment to protect older  adults from age discrimination.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much  time I have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez- Colon), my good friend.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Davis for  yielding to allow me to speak on this bipartisan amendment. And thank  you for allowing me to be a cosponsor of this amendment.   The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 was signed into law  more than 52 years ago. Yet, according to the American Association of  Retired Persons, AARP, three in five older workers have seen or  experienced age discrimination. Between 1997 and 2018, 423,000 workers  filed an age discrimination complaint averaging 20,142 claims per year.  This figure is 22 percent of all workplace discrimination claims   Furthermore, AARP reports that 76 percent see age discrimination as a  barrier to finding a new job. The Puerto Rico Department of Labor and  Human Resources states that there are more than 300,000 women age 35 or  older in the labor force on the island. This population represents 28.8  percent of all workers in an economy that has experienced a structured  downturn for more than a decade.    This amendment simply requires the labor secretary and the chair of  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to submit a report  determining the number of women who may have been discriminated against  because of their age.   As vice chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, I am  proud to support this measure to assist aging women in the workforce.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on  this bipartisan amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
