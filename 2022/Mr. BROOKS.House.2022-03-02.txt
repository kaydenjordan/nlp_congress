 Mr. Speaker, as background, I have served on the House  Committee on Armed Services for 11 years and on the Committee on  Foreign Affairs.   There is an old saying: Those who do not learn from history are  doomed to repeat it.   The lesson from Vietnam is that war is hell. If America is unwilling  to do horrible things required to win a war, then America should not  fight it. Be all in or all out.   A World War II lesson is that Europe's pre-war appeasement strategy  does not work against aggressor nations. In the 1930s, Adolf Hitler and  his National Socialist German Workers' Party time and again seized more  and more of Europe. Beginning in 1935, Adolf Hitler and dictatorial  socialist Germany annexed the Saarland; invaded and seized Austria in  the Anschluss; seized the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia; seized the  Slovak state Bohemia and Moravia; and forced Lithuania into ceding the  Memel Territory.   In response each time, Europe and the free world tried appeasement  and did little to nothing, thereby emboldening Adolf Hitler and  dictatorial socialist Germany.   The result? Hitler and Germany invaded Poland, triggering the  Holocaust and the deaths of tens of millions of people in World War II.   The question is: Has the world learned from history?   In 2014, Vladimir Putin and Russia invaded Crimea. The free world did  little to nothing.   Also in 2014, Vladimir Putin and Russia inspired a rebellion in  Donetsk and Lugansk in Ukraine, costing thousands of lives and creating  hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees. The free world did little  to nothing.   Last month, Russia invaded Ukraine again, apparently seeking the  total destruction and conquest of Ukraine. I admire the bravery and  kindred spirit of citizens who fight and die for liberty and freedom  against overwhelming odds.   They remind me of American Revolutionary War heroes like George  Washington and Patrick Henry and places like Valley Forge, Cowpens,  Kings Mountain, and Saratoga.   Fortunately, something is different about this Russian attack on  Ukraine. This time, the world does not do nothing. This time, the free  world is helping Ukraine during their time of peril. This time, time  will tell whether the world's help is enough and effective.   First, Europe and America impose economic sanctions on Russia. In  that vein, we must learn from Vietnam. Economic sanctions must be all  in or all out. There can be no half measures. America must be in this  to win or not be in it at all.   Second, Europe and America must be, and are, supplying Ukraine with  much-needed tank-killing Javelins, aircraft-destroying Stingers,  advanced fighter jets to replace those lost in combat, and other  military equipment Ukraine desperately needs.   Third, Europe must decide whether to deploy combat troops. For  emphasis, it is my view that America should not even consider providing  combat troops in Ukraine unless Europe first does so in significant  numbers. Even then, whatever America decides about troop assistance  should never go beyond assistance to our European allies.   I, like many Americans, am tired of America spending our Treasury and  our lives in so many parts of the globe. It is time for the rest of the  free world to step up.   Ukrainians bravely shed themselves of the dictatorial boot in 1991.  Russians can, and should, do the same.   My message to the Russian people is this: Your Russian comrades  fought side by side with you in World War II against Adolf Hitler and  dictatorial socialist Germany. Now, Vladimir Putin forces you to kill  each other and die by the thousands in Ukraine. It does not have to be  this way. The true way to peace is to do what America regularly does:  replace our political leaders.   I urge freedom-loving Russians to bravely stand up and do the same.  Do what is necessary to get the leadership Russians want and deserve,  and do it before it is too late. That is the lesson of World War II.                            ____________________
