 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dear friend,  Jennifer O'Brien, of Binghamton, New York. She was recently designated  as the 2018 New York Mother of the Year. Jennifer has dedicated her  life to helping others and especially those who have been less  fortunate.   Jennifer is the mother of two beautiful children, both of whom have  cerebral palsy. Along with her full-time job at Health Processes,  Jennifer serves as the executive director of Life Is Washable and as  the executive director of the American Special Hockey Association.   Through Life is Washable, Jennifer has implemented innovative  programs which have allowed children with special needs to play sports  and participate in community events with their families. In addition to  serving over 50,000 people with these programs, Jennifer serves over  3,000 members of the American Special Hockey Association.   She is also responsible for the construction of the largest  accessible playground in New York State, known as OurSpace at Rec Park  in Binghamton, New York.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Jennifer O'Brien's  outstanding accomplishments as a wife, a mother, and an advocate.  Jennifer is one of those rare individuals who possesses endless energy,  integrity, courage, tenacity, and compassion.                            ____________________
