 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I wish you and I wish everyone a happy  St. Patrick's Day. It is a big day for celebration up in Boston and all  of Massachusetts and all across the country and the world. On St.  Patrick's Day, everyone is Irish. So I wish everyone a happy St.  Patrick's Day today.
