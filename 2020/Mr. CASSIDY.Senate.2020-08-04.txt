 Madam President, I rise to address the issues regarding  the COVID crisis. Now, as we know, the COVID crisis is a public health  crisis which has led to an economic crisis and, in turn, an educational  crisis.   Today, I am going to speak about an aspect of the economic crisis-- specifically State and local governments, which have had to shut down  their economy and, in turn, have lost all the tax revenue they  otherwise would receive and, because they have lost that tax revenue,  have put the jobs of firefighters, police officers, teachers,  sanitation workers, and other essential frontline workers at risk. So  let me proceed.   Senate Republicans have unveiled a proposal for a second line of  support for American families and small businesses as our Nation  continues to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus is an  unprecedented challenge, but we shall overcome, and the HEALS Act  attempts to do that.   The introduction of this proposal signals Republicans' commitment to  seeing America through this challenging time, as was with the CARES  Act. The ultimate safety of the people of Louisiana and the United  States are my top priority, and the HEALS Act, as with all major bills,  is a starting point of negotiations to build consensus among Members of  both parties for the best path forward.   The HEALS Act includes stimulus checks for Americans, support for  small businesses, and billions to help schools reopen. While these are  critically important to economic recovery, so, too, are the essential  services provided by States and local communities. I am talking about  police officers, firefighters, teachers, sanitation workers, and other  municipal workers. Because of this economic lockdown, State and local  governments have seen their tax base erode, which threatens their  ability to keep these very people we need employed--these people who  keep our communities running.   I don't want to see, for example, a situation where cities slash  police budgets and force layoffs of those who put their lives on the  line to keep us safe. That is why Congress should include additional  relief for State and local communities in this relief package.   Senator Bob Menendez--and his staff has been a wonderful team to work  with--and I have offered a bipartisan proposal called the SMART Act to  help communities through this pandemic. I am privileged to be joined  today by Senator Menendez and Senator Collins to speak on its behalf.   The SMART Act calls for $500 billion in funding for State and local  governments, and it would be dispersed in thirds. One-third is based on  a State's population. Clearly, California needs more than Alaska. One- third is based upon the COVID-19 impact. My State has had one of the  highest per capita incidences of coronavirus infection. We have been  terribly impacted. One-third is based upon revenue lost, which, again,  my State, as well as the States of my colleagues, has been very  impacted. It is a fair formula that prioritizes funding to the hardest  hit.   The need is great. S&P Global released a report detailing the State  susceptibility to fiscal distress in a COVID-19 recession. There were  38 States that had a high or very high risk of economic exposure. S&P's  findings echo a Moody's report that also predicted dire effects to  States and cities if nothing is done. Moody's found that 34 States will  see tax revenue fall by double-digit percentage points, the worst of  which are Alaska falling 80 percent, Louisiana at 46 percent, and North  Dakota at 44 percent.   According to the National Association of Counties, local  communities--not States; local communities--anticipate a $202 billion  impact to budgets through 2021. Their report shows that 71 percent of  counties have delayed capital investments, including infrastructure and  economic development projects; 68 percent have cut or delayed county  services--or parish services in the case of Louisiana--human services,  public safety, and community development support; and 25 percent have  cut the county workforce. Moody's estimates that 1.3 million have  already been laid off, and an estimated 1.4 million more State and  parish county workers and municipal workers will be laid off in the  coming fiscal year. Sixty-six percent of counties receiving CARES Act  coronavirus relief indicate that the funding will not cover the COVID- 19 budget or they are uncertain if the budgetary impacts will be  covered. This is the impact of what has happened.   By the way, we spoke earlier of $202 billion, and this is how the  breakdown is in terms of lost revenue and lost State funding, et  cetera. The impact upon State and county and municipal governments is  huge. All told, the National Association of Counties predicts a loss of  4.9 million jobs and $344 billion lost in GDP. It does not have to be  that way. We can save jobs for police officers, firefighters, teachers,  and others by including State and local support in the act we are  considering.   As I mentioned before, Louisiana, my State, is facing serious  shortfalls. We are still struggling with a second wave of COVID cases.  Yesterday, we had the No. 1 per capita incidence of coronavirus. The  State is having to continue in a phase 2 lockdown, which strains not  only my folks in Louisiana but also the revenue of the local  communities where they would otherwise spend their money.   Folks back home know the consequences if they don't receive support.  There were 22 parish presidents who signed a letter supporting the  SMART Act. They wrote:         As elected leaders with parish populations ranging from       over 400,000 to 18,000, the COVID-19 pandemic has created       unprecedented challenges for all local governments not only       within Louisiana, but nationally. The extreme loss of tax       revenues, which provide for essential services, coupled with       unforeseen costs brought onto us by the response to COVID-19       pandemic, has the potential to have an extremely detrimental       effect on our role to provide for the citizens of our       parishes.    I received a letter from more than 80 mayors across my State giving  ``their strong support and thanks'' for efforts to pass the SMART Act  because they know I am working to deliver the support they need for  their communities or mutual constituents. And mayors ranging from  cities as large as Shreveport to as small as Glenmora and Athens wrote:         The SMART Act would provide funding for municipal economic       recovery that will support the reopening of businesses and       allow Louisiana to move forward. We are grateful for Senator       Cassidy's bipartisan efforts and for his longstanding       partnership with Louisiana's governments.    The same sentiments have been echoed by Louisiana's Chamber of  Commerce.   I understand concerns about spending money on State and local  government. Some are worried the money will be used to bail out poor  management decisions and overly generous and unfunded pension plans. I  share those concerns, which is why the SMART Act includes specific  provisions prohibiting spending in those areas. The SMART Act money  replaces lost revenue caused by COVID-19 and nothing more. A city or  parish or county would have to show their books and show that they have  lost revenue relative to a year ago before they would be eligible to  receive funding from this.   I understand concerns about spending, but the cost of doing nothing  is worse. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spoke on the State and  local funding needs, saying that while costly, it would be ``worth it  if it helps avoid long-term damage and leaves us with a stronger  economy.''   Congress should not allow police officers, firefighters, first  responders, teachers, sanitation workers, and others to lose their jobs  by the millions at a time when our country needs them most. The United  States cannot fully recover economically if local communities cannot  provide basic services, allowing commerce to flow.  [[Page S4707]]    As I end, I commend my colleagues on the work thus far on the HEALS  Act. More work is left to be done, and I look forward to working with  others in this Chamber in the coming days to strengthen this bill even  further and finding a common path forward with our Democratic  colleagues. We cannot let Americans down in this time of tremendous  need. By working together, we can deliver the support they need, and we  will be stronger as a nation for having done so   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to speak of a largely unknown  aspect of the Vietnam war and a too neglected aspect. I rise to  highlight Air America and its role in military conflicts from the 1940s  through the Cold War.   Air America, which was previously known as the Civil Air Transport,  operated under a shroud of mystery, intrigue, and, at times, purposeful  deceit to allow the organization to continue covert operations. Its  members lived the motto ``Anything, Anywhere, Anytime,  Professionally.''   Now, if you would look at this picture, you would think that this  must be an Army helicopter pilot performing a rescue on an active  battlefield. No, that pilot was a civilian. He was a contractor of  sorts with the U.S. Government and was flying that helicopter to rescue  that soldier or that marine, not an enlisted person. Its members,  again, lived the motto ``Anything, Anywhere, Anytime, Professionally,''  including rescuing those from battlefields.   They garnered respect as cargo and charter airline pilots during the  Secret War in Laos in the 1960s and 1970s. As the war progressed, the  U.S. Government increasingly relied on Air America pilots to conduct  search-and-rescue missions of downed U.S. military pilots--often in  heavy combat areas with no weapons of their own. The daily risks that  they took to save others earned them the reputation as being the most  shot at airline. I shouldn't laugh, but there is, I am sure, kind of a  gallows humor they felt when they said that, ``the most shot at  airline.''   Here is a depiction of a plaque in Richardson, TX, that President  Reagan dedicated. On it are the names of those who died as Air America  pilots.   At the plaque dedication in Dallas, President Ronald Reagan said:  ``Although free people everywhere owe you more than we can hope to  repay, our greatest debt is to your companions who gave their last full  measure of devotion.''   While President Reagan recognized the contributions that these pilots  made to the United States, Air America has received mixed support  throughout its history. The Department of Defense and the CIA, among  others, have argued that Air America pilots are not veterans, saying  their heroic rescues of American soldiers were not part of their  contracts or within the scope of their mission.   These sentiments have kept Air America pilots from receiving veteran  status and the benefits that come with the status. This needs to  change. This need to change is based on declassified materials that  show these pilots are deserving of such recognition for their exploits.   Who were these dedicated Americans serving in Air America?   Most crews had military training. Many bore the scars of fighting on  the ground in Korea and Vietnam. They are former POWs and Special  Forces--all tough as nails. They were also crop dusters and water  bombers who fought forest fires. They were smoke jumpers and flight  mechanics. Thousands of personnel were indigenous people, both male and  female. Air America members came from all walks of life to answer the  call to serve.   Military aircraft was provided to employees to conduct combat-related  activity in areas where the U.S. Armed Forces could not go due to  treaties. They served at considerable risk. Numerous employees died or  were seriously injured. However, their sacrifices were not given the  same recognition as military members.   Lowell Pirkle was killed when an RPG hit his helicopter, and it  burned to the ground. Sadly, it took years for his remains to be  repatriated and sent to Honolulu. When Deborah, Lowell's wife, insisted  that he be buried in Arlington Cemetery, she was informed that Lowell  was ineligible because he died not in the military but as part of Air  America. He would eventually be buried in Arlington due to his previous  military service, though the work in both engagements was essentially  the same   Let me just pause for a second. Let's look at this poster.   From 1962 to 1975, Air America inserted and extracted U.S. military  personnel and provided combat support across the entire Vietnam field.  Air America rescued hundreds of Americans and stranded Vietnamese,  including the last out of Saigon in April 1975. Who can forget these  dramatic photographs?   Air America pioneered remote landings during the Vietnam war to  resupply U.S. troops and key allies, like the Hmong in Laos, and Air  America pilots were the only known civilian employees to operate non- FAA-certified military aircraft in combat zones.   Lastly, as I previously mentioned, here is the memorial plaque in  Richardson, TX, that honors the 146 Air America veterans who were  killed. These men served ``Anything, Anywhere, Anytime,  Professionally.'' Again, it has been denied that they actually  performed these military duties, but, once more, declassified documents  show that the U.S. Government owes Air America and, therefore, its  members status as veterans.   In August 1965, Secretary of State Dean Rusk wrote: ``Political  factors require that Air America helicopters continue to assume  responsibility for all search-and-rescue operations in Laos.''  [[Page S4722]]    A year prior, Ambassador to Laos Leonard Unger said: ``Search and  rescue is a crucial factor in maintaining the morale of pilots, and  there is no prospect at this juncture of establishing effective search- and-rescue procedures without the use of both civilian (Air America)  and U.S. military personnel.''   The stories go on, but I will add one more.   CIA Assistant General Counsel James Harris wrote to the Civil Service  Commission: ``In the case of Air America, it would have been virtually  impossible to preserve the cover story had all the corporate employees  been advised that they were really employees of the United States  Government.''   It is time for the U.S. Government to set the record straight about  Air America. Their service is commended by all who served with them,  especially by those servicemembers whose lives were saved by Air  America. We owe them more than a debt of gratitude. I urge my  colleagues to consider the story of these brave pilots and work toward  providing the recognition they deserve as Federal employees, including  granting veteran status and the associated benefits.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Matthew  Fegley, a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the Congress.
