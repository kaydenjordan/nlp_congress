 Madam Chair, I thank the chairman for his steadfast  leadership.   I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings  Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019.   I support this bill because of one of my constituents, Steven  Pastrone, who lives with multiple sclerosis. He shared: ``My whole  right side of my body was weaker than my left and I had a hard time  cognitively doing anything.''   Steven was not able to access his medication, which cost $35,000 per  treatment, more than many Nevadans earn annually, so he had to rely on  a cost-assistance program from the drug manufacturer.   So many people in our country are in Steven's position and cannot  access their lifesaving medications outright. Chairman Elijah Cummings  would say: ``We are better than that.''   My constituents who stop me at church and at recreation centers don't  tell me that they are Democrat, Republican, or Independent. They tell  me that they have diabetes; they have cancer; they have heart disease;  they have asthma; and they want this Congress to do something, to act.   So this week, we finally tell Americans across this country that we  value your health more than Big Pharma profits, and we will pass H.R.  3, to lower drug costs now.   I want to thank the chairman and the Members of this body, my  colleagues, for working so hard. This is one of the most important  issues that this Congress can act on, and I am proud to be a sponsor of  this important legislation.
