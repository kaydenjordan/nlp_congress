 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Chloe Jean Milsten of Park County for her spirit of  entrepreneurship in Livingston.   While still in high school, Ms. Milsten opened and operated her own  business, Chloe's Barkery. Located in downtown Livingston, Chloe's  Barkery sells dog treats to the Park County community. Now, after her  high school graduation, she continues to manage the shop, providing  Montanans with a unique, healthy bakery tailored for dogs.   Ms. Milsten's family has been a tremendous support system during her  business endeavors. Her parents were some of her biggest influences in  encouraging her to launch her business. Additionally, her younger  sister Taeyha assists in the day-to-day operations of the store.  Chloe's Barkery is the perfect example of a successful family-operated  business that we can all be proud of in Montana.   Ms. Milsten's interest in animals is not merely related to her  entrepreneurial spirt, but also that she hopes to become a veterinarian  one day. I applaud Ms. Milsten for her impressive motivation and  perseverance in owning and operating a successful small business, and I  look forward to seeing all she accomplishes in the future.                            ____________________
