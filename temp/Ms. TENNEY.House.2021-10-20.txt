 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Thomas  [[Page H5687]]  Strayer Nelson of Ilion, New York, who turns 100 years old today.   Mr. Nelson is one of the last living survivors of the attack on Pearl  Harbor. He joined the Navy right out of high school and was assigned to  the USS Wasmuth, a Clemson-class destroyer that was docked in Pearl  Harbor on December 7, 1941. He left the Navy as a first class  electrician's mate.   On that fateful day 80 years ago, 19-year-old Thomas Strayer Nelson  was lying in his bunk aboard the ship docked in Pearl Harbor when the  alarms sounded. Sensing trouble, Tom made it topside where he saw  several Japanese planes bombing American ships. He quickly assessed  that this was not a drill.   Tom quickly jumped on his .50 caliber machine gun and successfully  helped defend the Wasmuth and its crew on that fateful day.   The wreckage was devastating. Nearly 20 U.S. ships were damaged or  sank at sea, and more than 2,400 Americans, including civilians, were  killed.   Tom remembers crying that day during the aftermath, but Tom's heroism  did not stop there. Nearly 1 year later, in December 1942, the Wasmuth  was escorting a convoy when it was knocked off its tracks and two mines  exploded below the ship. The Wasmuth sank, but 134 crew, including Tom,  were rescued due in large part to Tom's efforts.   Tom came back home and was an electrical inspector for over 27 years  in his hometown of Ilion, New York, where he has resided for nearly his  entire life. I had the great honor of meeting Tom this past weekend. At  the age of 99, now 100 today, he was full of life and very engaging,  and he also had a wonderful sense of humor. I also had the pleasure of  meeting his daughter, Janice, with whom he has been living the past 2  years and who provides great care for him, and his son, John, who is  also providing loving care to Tom. John is a former State trooper who  has now taken on the mantle of also being an electrician in his  father's legacy.                                time  1115    I just want to say also about the wonderful family from this small  community, Tom's late wife, Gladys Cooley, passed away in 2015. He also  had a daughter who passed away and a son, Tom, who died very young from  rheumatoid arthritis.   I just wanted to take this special time to recognize and thank  someone who is part of our Greatest Generation from my community, one  of the last survivors of Pearl Harbor who actually was there when this  occurred. I want to thank his family and everyone for hosting me,  greeting me, and giving me the real unique opportunity to meet with  this great hero of our country.   I want to say thank you again to Tom for his heroism, his service,  and his bravery. I wish him another 100 years of good health and good  cheer. I look forward to seeing him again when I return to my hometown.   Here's to many years ahead.                            ____________________
