 Mr. Chairman, I have long been a supporter of campaign  finance reform. I voted for motor voter. I voted for McCain-Feingold  the year in the House it was Shays-Meehan. I supported the Help America  Vote Act in 2002.   There are plenty of flaws in the current system. That is for sure.  And we need to fix it. But you know what? We have a Democratic House,  and we have a Republican Senate, and the only way that we are  reasonably going to fix this issue is with a bipartisan bill.   I am the only Republican here today who was here in 1993 when we  passed the motor voter bill. This was a bill that was patterned after  what Michigan has had in place for decades. When you get your driver's  license, you are asked to register to vote. It works.   This bill, H.R. 1, is not bipartisan. One of our big objections is  truly the taxpayer-financed campaign element of this bill.   If you do a poll today across the country, you are going to find that  most voters are going to say that campaigns are too expensive; they are  too negative; and, yes, they are too long.   We are going to have thousands--thousands--of candidates running for  Congress. They are all going to be eligible for this match from the  Treasury for any contribution under $200, with a 6-to-1 ratio, so we  are going to have more money in politics, and we are not going to have  the transparency that I think all of us want.   If we are going to fix the problem, let's sit down; let's have  regular order; let's have all the committees with some jurisdiction sit  down and have Republicans and Democrats work together on a committee  process that we can pass in a bipartisan vote that will get the  attention of the Senate, and maybe we can do something about the  problems today.
