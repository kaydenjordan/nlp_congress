 Mr. Speaker, our country is in an inflation crisis caused  by the Biden administration's failed leftwing, progressive policies.   We have families who can't find baby formula for their newborns,  grocery stores with empty shelves, workers filling up their gas tanks  for twice what they paid 2 years ago, and farmers paying triple for  fertilizer compared to two harvests ago.   H.R. 7606, the bill that passed the House last week, will do nothing  to combat these crises in the immediate future. Instead, Congress  should consider a bill introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson), my friend and ranking member of the House Agriculture  Committee.   H.R. 8069, the Reducing Farm Input Costs and Barriers to Production  Act, will work to immediately combat rising food and fuel costs and has  the support from our farmers, ranchers, and producers.   However, once again, Democrats passed a bill that doesn't fix our  problems, nor does it increase our domestic food or fuel production,  and they blame everything on Republicans. Let the record show we  offered real solutions, and Democrats simply did not listen.                            ____________________
