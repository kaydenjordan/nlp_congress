 Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak about the need to  protect Social Security.   Last year, the Republicans passed an expensive tax scam that gave 83  percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. This and the new tax scam  2.0 will add trillions to our deficit.   Now they are trying to use this massive deficit that they created to  justify cutting and dismantling Social Security, all while a retirement  security crisis is looming to wreak havoc on those who are going to  retire over the next decade.   One in three Americans have less than $5,000--one in three have less  than $5,000--saved. Fewer have pensions. For so many families who have  worked hard, played by the rules, Social Security is all they will  have. And Republicans, they want to take it away.   Mr. Speaker, let's build up Social Security, not dismantle it.                            ____________________
