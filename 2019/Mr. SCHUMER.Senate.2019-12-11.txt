 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I begin, I want to express deep  sympathy for the families and the victims of the shooting yesterday in  Jersey City, which left one fallen police officer, Detective Seals, and  several bystanders as victims. My heart goes out to their friends and  family today. Local and Federal law enforcement must investigate  quickly and professionally so we can implement the best responses. We  are not sure yet if this was motivated by hate or if it was criminal in  nature, but whatever the answers, rest assured the response must be  swift, sure, and strong.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, my good friend, the Senator from Texas,  is just engaged in a gimmick to cover up all that he hasn't done on  making drug costs lower. Now, 99 percent of what the public wants is  not being allowed on the floor by his leadership when he was the whip,  by this leadership, and now he wants to get well with a bill that is  very small.   Open up the floor to debate. We will debate all the big things that  will really reduce prices, which people want, and we will debate his  bill. I object.
