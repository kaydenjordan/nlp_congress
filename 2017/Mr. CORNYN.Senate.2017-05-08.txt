 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S2792]]     Madam President, last week our colleagues in the House  made a first necessary step to delivering on our promise to repeal and  replace ObamaCare and to restore individual choice for a health  insurance product that people choose that fits their actual needs,  rather than one mandated by Washington, DC. They passed the American  Health Care Act, a bill that provides relief to Americans all across  the country. With the passage of the AHCA in the House, we have a way  forward to do away with government mandating one-size-fits-all  healthcare.   Now that the House has passed this legislation, it is up to the  Senate to do our job and to keep our promises. To be specific, the  promise President Obama made when the Affordable Care Act was passed-- actually, he made many promises multiple times--proved not to be true.  So in many ways, when President Obama promised that if you like what  you have, you can keep it; that if you like your doctor, you can keep  your doctor; that if you like your plan, you can keep your plan--none  of that was true, we have now learned.   I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that ObamaCare--the  Affordable Care Act--was sold under false pretenses. So it is up to us  to restore individual choice for healthcare products that people want  that fit their needs, not one they buy because the government is  holding a gun to their heads or threatens to penalize them unless they  observe the government mandate to buy that healthcare.   You know, one of the biggest reasons for passing ObamaCare given at  the time, back in 2010, was the number of uninsured in the country.  Well, the fact is, there are still 30 million people uninsured under  ObamaCare even though it has been the law of the land for the last 7  years.   I believe we can and we must do better to deliver affordable care  that people choose, that meets their individual needs, and not  healthcare they buy simply because the government is coercing them into  doing so. We will work together with all of our colleagues who are  willing to work with us. If that means Republicans are going to be  working with 52 Republicans to get this bill passed, we will get it  done and we will get it passed. Ideally, though, it would be better if  our Democratic colleagues work with us. But so far, they have  steadfastly refused to work with us even though they know that  ObamaCare is in shambles and that people are finding they can't find an  insurance company where they live because insurance companies are  pulling out of those individual markets because they are simply losing  too much money or people who can buy ObamaCare policies in the  individual markets are finding that their premiums are going through  the roof and that the deductibles are unaffordable, thus effectively  leaving them without effective coverage.   Even though our Democratic colleagues know that ObamaCare is melting  down and is not serving the public the way they promised it would or,  in fact, is a positive harm to them because of unaffordable premiums  and deductibles, still, so far they are standing on the sidelines and  unwilling to participate in this process. I hope that changes at some  point in the near future in the interests of the people we represent  all across the country.
