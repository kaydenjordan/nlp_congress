 Mr. Chairman, I rise to express concerns regarding  H.R. 2500, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020,  specifically the overall top-line budget for the Department of Defense  that is outlined in the bill.   Senior military commanders, including General Dunford and Secretary  Mattis, have testified that a 3 to 5 percent real growth in the defense  budget top line is the minimum necessary to maintain readiness recovery  and our competitive edge over peer adversaries like Russia and China.   Regrettably, this bill in its current form reduces the President's  budget request by $17 billion to achieve an arbitrary lower top line.   To reach this lower top line, many critical modernization and  readiness programs had funding reduced that will slow our recovery  efforts. These programs include hypersonic munition development,  precision-guided munitions, the Air Force Next Generation Air Dominance  program, and F-15C spares and repair parts.   I am concerned that we are creating conditions that could prohibit  the realization of the National Defense Strategy and impact our ability  to project credible deterrence at a time when we need it most, given  the evolving threats that we now face.   Mr. Chair, as the ranking member of the Tactical Air and Land Forces  Subcommittee, I would like to thank our subcommittee chairman,   Donald  Norcross, for his leadership and his bipartisanship.   From a policy perspective, I am pleased with the legislative outcomes  the subcommittee was able to accomplish with this bill. For example,  the bill rightfully recognizes the importance of fifth generation  strike fighter capability and also supports growing fighter force  structure capacity through strong support for both the F-15EX and the  F-35 programs.   The bill appropriately provides oversight on vehicle Active  Protection Systems for combat and tactical vehicles and authorizes  additional funding for these critically needed systems.   The NDAA has always been a product of bipartisan consensus, and I  hope that as we go forward with the floor process, we can reach that  level of consensus again.    Mr. Chair, first of all, I would say, being from  Missouri, I would think that Harry Truman would be shocked that this  would try to be named after him.   But anyway, this amendment eliminates all enlistment requirements  except for the gender-neutral occupational standards.   It says, ``Any qualifications established or applied for eligibility  for service in an armed force shall take into account only the ability  of an individual to meet gender-neutral occupational standards for  military service,'' and it goes on.   Intended or not, I am concerned that this means that an individual  with a  [[Page H5547]]  chronic illness, with zero ability to deploy, could apply for and join  the military as long as the candidate meets the gender-neutral  occupational standards.   This is not how the military recruits and retains the best military  fighting force. The military prides itself on high medical and physical  standards. Currently, if you meet both standards, then you may be  granted the honor of serving. The military is under no obligation to  accept individuals who do not meet the medical criteria for service.   The military's recruitment process doesn't screen for race, religion,  color, national origin, or sex. Neither does it screen for gender  preference.   It seems that the intent of this amendment is to gut the President's  recently implemented policy on transgender servicemembers, which, I  will remind everyone, allows transgenders to serve. It allows  transgenders to serve in their biological sex, except for those--except  for those--who have undergone treatments for gender dysphoria, which  would make them nondeployable.   I would remind my colleagues that the DOD policy is based on medical  conditions, not an individual's fluid and preferred gender identity. It  is based on deployability and readiness, not discrimination.   The Trump policy states that anyone who meets military standards  without special accommodations can and should be able to serve. This  includes transgender persons.   This amendment appears to gut the military's ability to ensure our  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines can medically serve by stating  the DOD can only take into account whether or not an individual meets  gender-neutral occupational standards.   Military service is a privilege. It is not a right. It would be  unwise for us to make exceptions to service for one specific entity who  could not meet medical standards. That is why I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment.                                time  1900     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in opposition to this amendment, which establishes and  mandates the establishment of a curriculum to be used in education  programs on family planning for every military serviceman and -woman,  and I will be the first to say I think this amendment is excessive.   We already have DOD policy that requires the defense health agency in  each military service medical department to administer its own training  on counseling and methods of contraception to all DOD healthcare  providers so that they may provide assistance to our military members  when it is needed.   In addition, I am a former teacher, and I believe knowledge is  important, but a simple brochure would suffice; however, this amendment  is over the top. It would require an entire curriculum to be developed,  which would be used in education programs.   It requires every military member, men and women, to come in off the  field, and, instead of honing their skills on a target range or in the  cockpit, they would be subjected to perhaps hours of PowerPoint  presentations, worksheets, and lectures not on what China is doing in  the South China Sea or the latest tactics of Russian aggression, but on  family planning.   Not only would this amendment force every servicemember to be  subjected to this curriculum and programming, suggesting that this  training is more important than their military training, but it  ambiguously defines what comprehensive family planning is. As written  in this amendment, this training would include information about the  prevention of unintended pregnancy and the importance of providing  comprehensive family planning.   I am extremely concerned this ambiguous terminology will be  interpreted to include abortion counseling or services. We already see  this dangerous terminology in places like New York, where their  comprehensive family planning program funds over 57 Planned  Parenthoods.   I would like to know from the author of this amendment whether this  amendment encompasses information about abortion services as part of  comprehensive family planning services.    Madam Chair, I yield 10 seconds to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Speier) to answer this question.    Madam Chair, it sounds like a little ambiguous answer  there. We don't know if this includes abortion counseling or not.   Madam Chair, I just think that this is an unnecessary mandate to push  family planning curriculum on a captive audience, and perhaps it is not  the best use of the time of our military.   Other government employees are not forced to leave their job duties  to attend family planning training. You  [[Page H5549]]  don't hear of the Department of Education having their employees go or  the Department of Transportation or any of the other departments, yet  we want to take our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines off the  training field and bring them in for this curriculum.   I would suggest that we should not target our military population and  use their precious time in this way. I believe too much is at stake.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate what my colleague is trying  to do, but I do think that it is unnecessary, it is excessive, and it  is redundant. The author of the amendment already said it is already  being done. And servicemembers already have access to counseling on  methods of contraception, so we should not require mandatory training  for every servicemember and have this expanded curriculum and bring  them off the training field and sit them down for a PowerPoint  presentation.   Madam Chair, I urge all my colleagues to join me in opposing this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
