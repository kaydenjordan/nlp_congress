 Mr. President, today on Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day,  veterans and their families will participate in remembrance events at  the Pearl Harbor National Memorial.   The attack on December 7, 1941, killed 2,403 and injured 1,178. This  date of infamy as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt described it, was  one of America's most consequential. It launched the United States into  World War II and unleashed the courage, bravery, and resolve of  thousands of servicemembers who changed the course of history.   In Europe and Asia, they crushed the forces of fascism, Nazism, and  oppression and brought freedom to much of the world. The price they  paid was immense. Many made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.  Those who returned built the world we know today.   We call them the Greatest Generation. Now in the twilight of their  lives, we have a chance to say, thank you, once more.   I have introduced S. 3812, the WWII Veterans Hospital and Medical  Eligibility Act, and I am pleased to have the bipartisan support of  Senators Cramer, Daines, Booker, Tester, Coons, Collins, Young, Rubio,  Sinema, Rounds, Wicker, Hassan, and Klobuchar, and Tillis.   In 1996, the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Act opened the VA  healthcare system to all veterans of the Spanish-American War and World  War I. My bill will provide the same benefits for World War II  veterans. It will exempt World War II veterans who are not enrolled in  VA healthcare from means testing requirements. This is one final  opportunity to honor their heroism and afford them with dignity in  their final years.   I have been honored to work with the American Legion on this  legislation. I thank the Legion for its tireless advocacy on behalf of  our Nation's veterans. On October 31, 2019, the American Legion  National Commander, Bill Oxford called on the Veterans Administration  to expand the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Act of 1996 for World  War II veterans. This bill does just that.   As we reflect on National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, it is time  for us to answer the call and provide VA healthcare to all those who  answered the call of our Nation during its hour of need in World War  II.                            ____________________
