 Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate to take  action to crack down on child pornography offenders and to protect our  children. This is a growing crisis, and it is one that is near to the  heart of every parent in America. I can attest to that as a father of  three small children myself. I have got a 9-year-old, a 7-year-old, and  a 16-month-old baby at home.   But I can also attest to it as a former prosecutor. As the attorney  general for the State of Missouri, one of the first things I did was  establish a statewide anti-human trafficking initiative and task force  because what I saw as attorney general of my State was that human  trafficking, including, unfortunately, child sex trafficking, is an  exploding epidemic.   In my State and around our country, children are exploited, children  are trafficked. And those who work in this area and those who prosecute  in this area--law enforcement who work day in and day out--will tell  you that the explosion of child pornography is helping to drive this  exploding epidemic of child sexual exploitation and child sex  trafficking.   The problem is that child porn itself is exploding. A New York Times  investigative reporter found that in 2018, there were 45 million images  of children being sexually exploited available on the internet--45  million. Just a few years before, it had been 3 million and in 2018,  45. Then, last year, the National Center for Missing and Exploited  Children found that that number had grown to 85 million--85 million  images on the internet of children being brutally sexually exploited.   And as every prosecutor and every law enforcement advocate and every  law enforcement agent who works in this area will tell you, that  explosion of this material--which, by the way, is harmful in and of  itself, is exploitative in and of itself--is driving a crisis of child  exploitation and child sex trafficking in this country.   Now the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme  Court has helped bring this issue front and center. Her record of  leniency to child sex offenders has been much at the center of her  hearings, and it has startled the public. A recent Rasmussen survey  found that following her hearings, 56 percent of all respondents said  that they were troubled by her record on child sex offenders. That  included 64 percent of Independents.   And they are right to be troubled. Her record is indeed startling. In  every case involving child pornography where she had discretion, she  sentenced below the Federal sentencing guidelines, below the  prosecutor's recommendations, and below the national averages.   We now know that the national average for possession of child  pornography--the national sentence imposed, on average, is 68 months.  Judge Jackson's average is 29.3 months. The national average sentence  for distribution of child pornography: 135 months; Judge Jackson's  average, 71.9 months.    In fact, it is true for criminal sentencing across the board. The  national average of all criminal sentences imposed in the United  States, 45 months; Judge Jackson's average, 29.9 months.   This is a record of leniency. In the words of the Republican leader,  leniency to the ``extreme'' to child sex offenders and on criminal  matters in general.   But--but, but, but--we are told, and have been told for weeks on end  now, it is not really her fault. We were told by the White House and  Senate Democrats that it is not her fault because those Federal  sentencing guidelines that she, in every case where she could went  below--those guidelines aren't binding. Thanks to the decision by the  Supreme  [[Page S1955]]  Court, by Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens, those guidelines are only  advisory. And so we were told, repeatedly, that if we really want to  get tougher sentences for child porn offenders, then we are going to  have to change the law.   In fact, I see my friend Senator Durbin here today, the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee. He said this to me multiple times during the  committee.   On March 22, he said to me:         I hope we all agree that we want to do everything in our       power . . . to lessen the incidence of pornography and       exploitation of children. . . . I . . . want to tell you,       Congress doesn't have clean hands. . . . We haven't touched       this for 15, 16 or 17 years.    Senator Durbin went on:         We have created a situation because of our inattention and       unwillingness to tackle an extremely controversial area in       Congress and left it to the judges. And I think we have to       accept some responsibility.    And he went on:         I don't know if you--    Meaning me--       have sponsored a bill to change this. I will be looking for       it. . . . If we're going to tackle it, we should.   Well, I agree with that 100 percent. I agree we should tackle it.  This is the time to tackle it, and I am here to do that today. I am  proud to sponsor and introduce legislation along with my fellow  Senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis and Rick Scott and Ted Cruz to get  tough on child porn offenders.   Now, let's be clear. When Congress wrote the child pornography  Federal sentencing guidelines, and it is Congress that wrote them  substantially, way back in 2003--when Congress wrote them, they wanted  them to be binding. Congress meant for these guidelines to bind Federal  judges. The Supreme Court struck those guidelines down.   Now it is time to put it back into place. My bill would put a new  mandatory--mandatory--sentence of 5 years for every child porn offender  who possesses pornography, 5 years. If you do this crime, you ought to  go to jail. It would make the guidelines binding for any and all facts  found by a jury or found by a judge in a trial, restore the law to what  Congress intended back in 2003, take away discretion from judges to be  soft on crime, and get tough on child sex offenders. That is what this  bill would do.   Now, I called this bill the Protect Act of 2022 because it is modeled  on the PROTECT Act of 2003, when Congress wrote these guidelines. And I  would just note for the record that I believe every Senator voted for  it back in 2003, including the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  Senator Durbin, and every member of the Judiciary Committee, Republican  and Democratic, who was serving at the time.   That act back in 2003 toughened penalties for child porn offenders,  made the guidelines mandatory, and explicitly took away discretion from  judges to sentence below the guidelines.   I think it was a pretty good law, and I think now is the time to act.  Our children are at risk. The epidemic of sexual assault, sexual  exploitation, and victimization is real.   And let's be clear what child pornography is. It is an industry--an  industry that feeds on the exploitation of the most vulnerable members  of our society, that feeds on the spectator sport of child abuse and  child victimization.   If you have a lot of images of child pornography, you ought to go to  jail for a long time. If you possess child pornography, you ought to go  to jail for at least 5 years. And, yes, it is time for every judge in  America to get tough on child porn. That is what this bill would do,  and I urge the Senate now to take this opportunity to act.   So as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  S. 3951, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, the Senator asks: ``Why now?'' Why act  now?   It is because it is a crisis now, because there are 85 million images  of children being exploited on the internet now, because child  exploitation is exploding in this country now.   Today, the Senator lays bare on this floor the bait and switch that  he and his colleagues have employed.   They say: Oh, Judge Jackson--it is not her fault. You should act on  the law to change the law.   But when we come to change the law and do what this Congress did in  2003, to do it now in 2022--a measure that Senator Durbin supported in  2003--he says: Oh, no, no, we don't need to act now. Why do it now? It  is rushed. It is too hurried. Let's do it later. Let's think about it  longer.   Then we hear recited again the bizarre claims that somehow child  pornography is a conspiracy theory. This is something that Senate  Democrats, including the chairman, have repeated over and over and  over, led by the White House--the idea that child exploitation is a  conspiracy theory.   I would just invite you to look any parent in America in the eye and  tell them that the exploitation of children is a conspiracy theory--or  any law enforcement agent or any prosecutor or anyone who is working on  the exploitation, to combat the exploitation of children in this  country. No. It is a crisis, and it is real. The fact that the Senate  hasn't acted until now is, I think, shameful for the Senate. But why  wait another day?   Now, I look forward, if the Senator is serious. He does hold the  gavel in the Judiciary Committee. We could mark this bill up. We could  hold hearings. We could take action. I would invite him to cosponsor  this bill. He voted for it in 2003. Let's have hearings, then, if we  can't vote on it today, if we can't debate it today. Let's have  hearings. Let's mark it up. Let's take it seriously. I will wait. I  suspect I will be waiting for an awfully long time.  [[Page S1957]]    Here is the bottom line: I am not willing to tell the parents of my  State that I sat by and did nothing. I am not willing to dismiss child  exploitation as just some conspiracy theory. I am not willing to  abandon the victims of this crime to their own devices and say: Good  luck to you.   No, I am not willing to do that--nor am I willing to excuse Judge  Jackson's record of leniency that does need to be corrected. She should  not have had the discretion to sentence leniently in the extreme, as  she did, nor should any judge in America, in my view. What is sauce for  the goose is sauce for the gander. We should fix it for everybody  across the board, and we can begin by acting as we did in 2003.   So I am disappointed, but I can't say that I am surprised that this  measure has been objected to today. All I can say is that I pledge to  my constituents--I pledge to the parents of my State and, yes, to the  victims of my State--that I will continue to come to this floor and  that I will continue to seek passage of this act until we get action  from this Senate to protect children and to punish child pornographers.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois says that  Congress hasn't acted in two decades; that is true. I haven't been here  for two decades; he has.   There is no excuse to not take action now. There is no excuse to not  act on this problem when we know what the solution is.   So, listen, if the Senator is saying today, if he is committing  today, to holding hearings and marking up a bill to toughen the child  pornography laws, to make mandatory the sentencing guidelines, that is  fantastic. I will take him at his word. I look forward to seeing those  hearings noticed and to seeing that markup noticed, and I hope it will  be forthcoming.   I am here to make a prediction. I think we will be waiting a very  long time, because let's not forget what his party and the Sentencing  Commission, stacked with members of his party, have been recommending.  It has not been to make child sentences tougher--child pornography  sentences tougher. They have wanted to make them weaker.   What the Sentencing Commission has recommended, with its liberal  members for years now, is to make them weaker. That is what Judge  Jackson has advocated. She also wants to change the guidelines--to make  them weaker.   I think that is exactly the wrong move, and that is why the Senator  was here to block this effort today. He doesn't want there to be  tougher sentences. He doesn't want to talk about this issue. He wants  to sweep it under the rug. I am here to say I won't let that happen. I  will be here as long as it takes. I will be advocating for this in the  Senate Judiciary Committee as long as it takes, until we get justice  for the victims of child pornography and child exploitation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
