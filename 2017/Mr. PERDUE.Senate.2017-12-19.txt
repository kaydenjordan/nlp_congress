 Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with  my friend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Senate  Finance Committee, Senator Hatch.   I would like to confirm my understanding of the modification of the  section 958(b) stock attribution rules contained in the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act. The Senate Finance Committee explanation of this bill, as  released by the Senate Budget Committee, definitively states, ``This  provision is not intended to cause a foreign corporation to be treated  as a controlled foreign corporation with respect to a U.S. shareholder  as a result of attribution of ownership under section 318(a)(3) to a  U.S. person that is not a related person (within the meaning of Section  954(d)(3)) to such U.S. shareholder as a result of the repeal of  section 958(b)(4).''   I would like to confirm that the conference report language did not  change or modify the intended scope this statement. As you know, I  filed an amendment to the Senate bill, Senate amendment No. 1666 would  have codified this explanatory text of the Finance Committee report.   I also want to confirm that the Treasury Department and the Internal  Revenue Service should interpret the stock attribution rules consistent  with this explanation of the bill.    I thank the chairman for the clarification and appreciate  his outstanding leadership and work on this important and historic  legislation.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.                                     DACA     Mr. President, I come from a different world. I come from  the real world. I have been here just a couple of years, but this sort  of rhetoric that we have heard on the floor of the Senate over the last  few weeks is amazing to me. The disinformation, the known misleading  statements that are made--that doesn't exist for very long in the real  world because there are rules and regulations out there where that is  taken care of. But it seems that if you are good at it in this body and  can get away with it long enough, that what Vladimir Lenin once said is  true, and that is this: It doesn't matter what you say is true; it only  matters that you say it and say it and say it, and pretty soon, to the  common folks in your country, it becomes true.   Well, I think we have lived through a century where we have done  nothing but disproved that as a free society here and as a leader of  the free world.   I think what is at stake tonight in this vote is bigger than just a  few changes in our Tax Code. Good grief. We can work for the next 10  years and not clean up every detail in this Tax Code, but this is a  first step to bringing sanity back to our country.   Let me put a little perspective on this. Let's talk about what  President Trump inherited when he took office in January of this year.   We had 8 years of the lowest economic growth in the history of the  United States--1.9 percent. We had the lowest workforce participation  rate in over 40 years.   In the last 8 years, we borrowed 35 percent of every dollar that was  spent by the Federal Government--this body borrowed before you and I  got in the Senate.   Under the last administration, for 6 years of those 8 years, the  opposing party in this body had a supermajority for 2 years and they  had a majority for 4. So for 6 years, that party had the White House  and they had a majority in the Senate at least. In those 8 years, they  doubled our national debt from $10 trillion to $20 trillion this year,  even though last year--or the last year of the last administration,  2016--our Federal Government collected more Federal tax than any other  year in our history, and the last few years have been the same.   With all that borrowing, even when the last administration said: OK,  we need to fix infrastructure, we need to get the economy going--they  put $1 trillion into fake infrastructure investments, and none of these  parameters moved. We still had no economic growth.   This is the same party that liberalized Social Security and Medicare  to the point where they are not sustainable. And in just 14 years--14  years--both those trust funds go to zero. This is not about going to  Medicare and Social Security and finding money to give to the rich;  this is trying to figure out how to get the economy going so we can  save Social Security and Medicare. It is no more complicated than that.   But what we are hearing here are words like ``shameful'' and  ``ridiculous.'' I think what President Trump walked into was shameful  and ridiculous. For the United States--the wealthiest country in the  history of the world--to have those sorts of performance parameters is  ridiculous. It is shameful. There will be a day of reckoning, and it is  today. Our President took that seriously, and he said that job No. 1 is  growing the economy.    Let's put that in perspective. He said, in the first year of his  administration, he wanted to focus on three things that would grow the  economy. One is he wanted to pull back on regulations. I am here to  tell my colleagues that over 860 of the most onerous regulations and  rules have been reversed so far this year.   The second thing President Trump said was he wanted to work on  energy. Well, we got the Keystone Pipeline working. He actually moved  on stopping the Clean Power Plan that was thwarting the energy  production in this country, and, in this bill tonight, we will open up  ANWR production to give us capability on the energy side of our  economy.   The third thing the President said he wanted to do was to change our  archaic tax plan; not to give money to the rich but to open our  companies and our workers to be more competitive with the rest of the  world.   For the last decade--maybe even the last 30 years--I have lived this  in my career. For 40 years, I have watched U.S. competitiveness decline  and decline and decline. Why? Because of two reasons. Our Federal  Government grew out of any proportion. In 2000, the size of our  government was $2.4 trillion. Last year, it was $4 trillion. That is  under one Republican administration and one Democratic administration.  We have put regulation on top of regulation. We liberalized all of our  social programs to the point we cannot afford it.   The other thing we did is we loaded onto this tax situation where we  lost our competitiveness with the rest of the world. The rest of the  world lowered their tax rates while we actually increased ours, they  reduced their regulations while we increased ours, and we just simply  lost our competitive edge, such that today, two out of every three  acquisitions regarding a U.S. company are U.S. companies being bought  by a foreign company. Now, that is a C corporation. In many cases, it  is an S corporation. Why is that? It is because of the difference  between our 35 percent corporate tax rate and the average of 18 percent  in Asian countries and 21 percent in Europe. All we are doing is trying  to reach some point of being reasonably competitive with the rest of  the world.   This President walked into a disaster, and what we have seen in the  first year are dramatic results: Two million new jobs have been created  this year, 860 regulations reversed, and illegal crossings on the  southern border are down 60 percent.   We passed a bill in this body 97 to 2 that allows a department head  in the Veterans' Administration to remove people for cause, for lack of  performance. Guess what. So far this year, over 500 people have been  asked to leave because of performance reasons in our  [[Page S8127]]  Veterans' Administration. That is something both Democrats and  Republicans should be proud of.   We also see a Department of Education that has removed 300 people for  the same reason. CEO competence is at a 20-year high. Consumer  confidence, despite what the other side wants to tell us, is at a 16- year high, and many studies are proving that today.   Tonight I want to clear up some of the absolute, unbelievable  mistruths and myths about this bill that are being perpetrated. We  heard several just in the last hour on this floor. The first, the great  one--I love this: This tax plan is only going to help the wealthy. We  are going to tax the low-income people in America, and we are going to  give it to the billionaires.   Let me just give some examples here. A median-income family today--a  family of four who works, with two kids, who makes a median income of  $73,000 a year is going to get a $2,200 tax reduction. That is a 60- percent reduction in their Federal tax rate.   A single working mother, as an example, with one child at home--now,  this is a parent who has to find childcare, has to find a way to work,  gets very little help from family or friends, doesn't own a home--I  know many people like this--that person is going to get a 75-percent  tax cut in this bill.   Beyond that, today, 52 percent of households in America--this is  before this bill--pay zero Federal income tax, but this bill goes  further. Up to 6 million people will potentially be removed from the  tax rolls because of this bill. I am just a simple business guy, but I  just look at the facts. These are mathematical facts here. There is no  projection, no opinion. This is part of this bill that belies half of  the mistruths we just heard in the last hour on this floor.   The second one is a process question. Of course, this is what we  always hear the minority party say. I dare say, as an outsider, I heard  Republicans say this in the last 6 years. There is no transparency, no  regular process, no regular order. Well, in the last few years, there  have been over 70 public hearings--Senate hearings in committee--about  tax reform. This particular bill has been in full regular order. Yes,  it was done in reconciliation, but that is regular order. I personally  would have preferred not to have done that, but it is within regular  order.   It went through committee. Amendments were put up and debated and  passed in committee. Then the bill was brought to the floor. We voted  on amendments on this floor, and then it went to a full vote and was  passed--or will be passed tonight.   The third myth: This tax plan will not generate economic growth. This  is a really rich one because most of the people saying that have never  written their signature on the front of a check. They just simply  haven't been in business. Yet these are now the newfound experts in  this body who say: Well, this is not going to grow the economy. Of  course, it is not; we need bigger government to grow the economy.  Haven't we proven that?   No, we have disproved that. If anything, over the last 8 years, we  have proven that bigger government does not correlate with a better,  growing, competitive economy. What this bill simply does is it gets  government back out of the way, to some degree, helps us become  competitive with the rest of the world, and ignites this economy.    Let's just look at what is being said about this. First of all, it  has been estimated that nearly 1 million new jobs will be derived  because of this bill. It is estimated that annual incomes of working  Americans will go up somewhere between $4,000 and $9,000. That is in  addition to the tax cuts. That is because the demand for labor in a  growing economy will create rising wages.   The other side says: Well, to get rising wages, you need to increase  minimum wage. That is the wrong way to look at this. This bill, I can  tell from personal experience, will create demand for labor, and that  labor will increase in price.   GDP will grow somewhere between 3 and 5 percent over the next decade.  I actually believe it will be much more than that. The big one, in my  mind, is by eliminating the repatriation tax, and, by the way, we are  the last country in the world to still have this archaic tax, which we  collect no tax on today, but eliminating that brings over $2.6 trillion  back into this economy.   The other side says: Well, that is not going to go to the economy, it  is going to dividends or to pay down debt. Guess what. In a  capitalistic society, it is all contributory. It all adds to the  benefit of growing the economy.   Capital formation is part of what created this miracle in the first  place. The last 70 years in America has been, I would argue--as a 40- year experienced veteran of the business community here, as the only  Fortune 500 CEO in the Senate and in all of Congress, I would argue  that this economic windfall we have experienced over the last 7 years  in America is based on three things: On the top of the best workforce  in the history of the world, it is innovation, capital formation, and  the rule of law. Quite frankly, because of regulations in this body  over the last 15 years and because of our Tax Code, we have taken those  for granted. Tonight we begin to reverse that.   The next claim I want to debunk is that this tax plan adds $1  trillion--I love this one--will add $1 trillion to the debt. This is  from the other side that administered more than doubling our debt in  the last decade. No other President in the history of our country,  prior to the last administration, added $10 trillion to the debt of  this Nation.   There is no bigger debt hawk in this body than I, and I can tell you  this is what brought me into the political arena. This $20 trillion in  debt is the beginning, it is not the end of the story. Unless we do  something today about our Federal debt, it is going to grow $11  trillion, is the latest estimate, over the next decade. Most of that is  on the mandatory side.   To solve this debt crisis, clearly we have to grow the economy, but  we will not solve the debt crisis only by growing the economy. We will  not solve it unless we start by growing the economy.   We are told by the Joint Committee on Taxation and by the  Congressional Budget Office--and both of these modeling groups I have  personal problems with--but even if you take their worst-case  scenarios, you only have to grow the economy two-tenths of 1 percent  per year. That is going from 1.9 percent, which is the average baseline  of the last 8 years, growing it by two-tenths of 1 percent to 2.1  percent over the next decade. There has only been one time in one  decade in the last 70 years where this economy didn't grow more than  2.5 percent, and in that decade it grew 2.3 percent. So in no decade  since World War II have we grown less than 2.3 percent.   In addition, CBO says we have to grow 2.2 or 2.3 percent. The last  two quarters are already over 3 percent. The fourth quarter looks like  it will be as well if we pass this tax bill tonight.   It just seems to me that people who have experience in the real-world  economy know that investing in our workers is the best investment we  can make, and that is what this tax bill does. Don't be confused by the  rhetoric.   Members of the other body in the last hour say there is going to be a  day of reckoning. There is, because I believe that the other side has  failed the working poor in this country. The best example is ObamaCare,  perpetrated by the supermajority, 60 votes on the other side, and we  know it is now collapsing under its own weight, but this is what they  have done to the working poor in America.   In 2014--and it has been that way over the last 3 years as well--but  2014 is the last year we can get from the IRS. Under ObamaCare, the IRS  fined 8 million people in America $2 billion, and the irony is, half of  those people make less than $25,000. Now, that is outrageous, and for  those same people to beat their chests now about this being for the  rich, it is even more outrageous.   I will close with this. The biggest argument they make is that this  is for the rich, and the rich are not paying their fair share. The top  1 percent today pay about 40 percent of all tax revenues that we have,  and the top 10 percent pay over 70 percent. That was true before this  bill, and that is going to be true after this bill.   What is going to also be true is the fact that the working men and  women of America will find that their place of employment, whether it  is a one-man self-proprietorship, a one-woman self-  [[Page S8128]]  proprietorship, or a major corporation, those companies, in a global  economy, are going to find themselves more competitive because of what  President Donald J. Trump is doing in this tax bill and what we are  backing up tonight. I argue that this is a historic day, not just  because of tax relief for the working men and women of America, or  building competitiveness for those same people around the world, but  for our kids and grandkids so we can begin to deal with this huge  growing debt.   People say: Well, you are adding debt. No, this is an investment,  and, by the way, it is not $1.5 trillion. They know that $500 billion  of that--one-third of it--is this policy versus law. They know that,  but it still makes a better story. They also know that $200 billion of  that are fake costs because it says if you eliminate the way it is  scored right now, if you eliminate the repatriation tax, the Joint  Committee on Tax and the Congressional Budget Office, in their infinite  wisdom, say that is going to cost you $200 billion. We don't collect  $200 billion in repatriation tax. As an outsider, I cannot believe we  sit here and talk about these fake numbers that way.   The President of the United States has a vision for our country. We  need to rise up and be competitive again in order to deal with this  long-term tax situation but, more importantly--or as importantly--to be  able to afford to do the right things for our people. When we have  hurricanes, when we have fires, we don't have the resources to do that.  Every dime we are spending behind these hurricanes and behind the fires  and behind all of the things we are doing is borrowed. Every time we  spend on our military, it is borrowed money. The only way to eventually  change that is to begin to grow our economy. This is only one of many  steps that are required, but this tonight becomes historic because you  can't do the others unless you make this economy competitive.   I want to praise our President tonight for having the guts to stick  through this process. We are going to pass this bill tonight and make  America great again because we are going to make America competitive  again.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
