 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman LaHood for putting this  together as we celebrate the 200th birthday of our great State of  Illinois.   The congressional district I serve stretches from Rockford to the  north; the western border is the Mississippi River; and then we go into  central Illinois, as Congressman LaHood said, to the city of Peoria. I  am very proud to be able to share that city with Congressman LaHood.   My congressional district also represents the Quad Cities, which is  where I call home. So in between all of these towns is 7,000 square  miles of scenic farmland and vibrant towns like Monmouth and Canton and  Thomson. We are a proud region with a proud history of manufacturing,  agriculture, and service to our Nation.  [[Page H10172]]    Let me tell you a little bit about the congressional district I  serve. We are the home to John Deere in Moline, the birthplace of  Caterpillar in Peoria, and home of the iconic Sock Monkey, which was  created in Rockford, Illinois. I kid you not.   In Rockford, we hosted the Nation's very first National Football  League game at Douglas Park, where the Rock Island Independents  defeated the St. Paul Ideals 48-0, a real romping.   More than 40 years before the world also fell in love with them  through a movie called ``A League of Their Own,'' the Rockford Peaches  were the four-time champions of the All-American Girls Professional  Baseball League--also, I kid you not. This is amazing history.   I want to mention a few athletes as well. Jim Thome, Congressman  LaHood knows him. He was the five-time all-star who played for eight  different major league teams. He also came from the city of Peoria, and  my brother was very close with him. My brother, my late brother, was a  baseball coach at Eastern Illinois University and Southern Illinois  University, and he was good friends with Jim Thome.   We have also had several other brilliant performers come out of our  region. Comedian Richard Pryor was born and grew up in Peoria. The town  of Aledo in Mercer County is the hometown of two country megastars:  Suzy Bogguss and Margo Price. And we even have a member of Destiny's  Child, Michelle Williams, who came from Rockford. So we are a proud  people.   We also are very proud of our agricultural heritage. Our region is  one of the top corn producers in the country. We have corn and soybean  farms all across Illinois that have been worked by generations of farm  families. And they even go through the rolling hills of the Driftless  Area in the Galena Territory. What the Driftless Area means is that  this is a gorgeous stretch of land where the last ice age actually  didn't flatten, and so we have wonderful farmland in that region as  well.   A little bit to the east of the Galena Territory, we have a town  called Freeport, which is also known as Pretzel City, USA, and it is  home to the Union Dairy, which recently celebrated its centennial  birthday.   Our region has played a pivotal role not just in our State's history,  but also in our Nation's history. Senator Everett Dirksen, a Senate  office building right down the road here is named after Senator  Dirksen. He came from Pekin, Illinois, which is in my congressional  district. If you don't know the history of Everett Dirksen, he was  actually one of the authors of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1968.   Let's go to where I live, Rock Island County. It was the location of  the very first railroad bridge over the Mississippi River, built in  1856. And since we are all getting into this Abraham Lincoln part of  our State's history, Abraham Lincoln was the attorney for the bridge  company that I just mentioned. Then, 2 years after that bridge was  built, our region was the host--I know Congressman Bost said that his  district was the only district that had two Lincoln-Douglas debates.  Well, there is actually another congressional district that had two  debates. One was in Freeport in 1858, in August of that year, and then  another was in Galesburg in October of 1858.   So, in fact, President Lincoln's congressional district--I know  Congressman Davis is going to lay real claim to Congressman Lincoln,  but he also--let's see. Congressman Davis had part of his district;  Congressman LaHood had part of his district; and he also represented  Tazewell County, which is part of my congressional district.   Another legend of the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant, made his home in  Galena, Illinois, and his Presidential campaign headquarters was in a  place called the DeSoto House, which is a hotel today in downtown  Galena. It is a place where my husband and I like to stay when we visit  Galena.   During the Civil War, Rock Island was used as a Union prison camp  before it was converted into the Rock Island Arsenal, where, today, it  is the Army's only active foundry. The hardworking men and women of the  Rock Island Arsenal have produced munitions for every single one of our  conflicts and our wars dating back to the Civil War.   Mr. Speaker, the people of the northwestern and central and western  part of Illinois have always had a special connection to the veterans  who have served in our country. There is one particular street, the  last point I want to make talking about my congressional district that  I am lucky enough to serve, and its place in history over the last 200  years, but we are very, very proud of the street that we call Hero  Street in Silvis, Illinois. It is a 1\1/2\-block street, and there is  no street of that similar size that has had more men and women serve in  the military than Hero Street USA in Silvis, Illinois.   More than 100 people have come from that street of a block and a half  long to serve in the military, and 8 of them, all Mexican Americans,  made the ultimate sacrifice during World War II and the Korean war.  Hero Street has long been a source of pride for the congressional  district that I am lucky enough to serve, and I am proud to mention  them as part of this Special Order tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I know all of us from this great State of Illinois who  are speaking tonight are only scratching the surface about how  important our region of the State is to our State's history. I am very  proud to be part of this.    I thank Congressman LaHood for putting this together so we can talk  about the bicentennial of the State of Illinois.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Bustos for her  valuable comments and advocacy for the State of Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to a colleague from Taylorville, Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis), somebody who serves a district just to the south of me.  We share Springfield together. He represents some of the best  institutions of higher learning in our State, and I am proud to share  many of the Lincoln sites with my friend.   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend,  Congressman LaHood, and all my good friends from the Illinois  delegation who are here today.   This is really a privilege for me to be able to be here to talk about  Illinois' 200th anniversary. It is my home State. It wasn't always my  home State. As a matter of fact, my family moved us from our hometown  of Des Moines, Iowa, to Taylorville, Illinois, when I was 7 years old,  in 1977.   Taylorville was a new experience for me, but it was a home that we  established. My parents were able to achieve their dream of owning  their own business, which gave my family the chance to achieve the  American Dream, and it was right here in Illinois. It was in our home  State that celebrates our 200th anniversary.   Taylorville is the place where my wife grew up, and it is where we  choose to raise our three children. But it is also my proud hometown,  and I love to talk about it because it is where I grew up, but it is  also where so many things have happened. Because I have taken this job  as a Member of Congress, this opportunity, I have learned a lot more  about my hometown.   A couple of highlights that I want to bring out: one, of course, was  Taylorville's basketball team from the 1940s still holds the IHSA  record. I believe they were 45-0, with big-name players like Johnny Orr  and Ron Bontemps.   Edward Mills Purcell was born in Taylorville and raised in  Taylorville. He actually was the Nobel Peace Prize winner in physics.  He actually created nuclear magnetic resonance, which is the backbone  of what we know today as an MRI. It came out of my hometown in  Taylorville, Illinois.   I am so honored that, since 2013, I have been blessed to be able to  walk this floor and serve the 13th Congressional District with these  great colleagues from our home State. The 13th Congressional District  goes way beyond my hometown of Taylorville. It stretches in 14  counties, and one area that I know that has been talked about tonight  is Springfield, the State capital, Lincoln's hometown.   I have got to give it to my colleague, Mr. LaHood. Yes, he represents  more geography that Lincoln represented in his one term here in  Congress, and Mrs. Bustos represents part of Lincoln's old district. I  understand that. But as somebody who represents Lincoln himself in  Lincoln's tomb, I think I represent Lincoln the most.  [[Page H10173]]    What this tells you, this friendly rivalry that we three have, it  goes to show you that, in one term in Congress and then his time as the  President of our great Nation, Abraham Lincoln took three Members of  Congress to follow in his footsteps in his one district. There is no  way any of us in this institution can follow in the footsteps of  Abraham Lincoln, but it is such a privilege to know that we three share  such history. And that is exactly why we are here today, to talk about  the 200th anniversary of our home State, and we would not be talking  about Illinois without Abraham Lincoln.   There is a story and a statue in my hometown that has Lincoln and a  pig. The old stories are that Lincoln came to practice when he was a  lawyer and complained about the pig squealing under the steps of our  local courthouse. So we in Taylorville honor Abe and his comments on  the pig. Come visit, see the statue, and come celebrate Abraham  Lincoln.   Abraham Lincoln was a leader that, obviously, our Nation needed at  that time. We stand here in the House of Representatives and we debate  issues that may seem important today, but, compared to what our great  President Abraham Lincoln and the Members of Congress at the time  leading up to our Civil War, the issues that they had to discuss and  they had to debate, I believe history has shown us that we will never-- and, hopefully, never ever--experience what those elected officials did  in Lincoln's time.   But it took the courage of Abraham Lincoln to actually keep our  Nation together and keep the stability and the growth of the great  State of Illinois as part of this United States of America for 200  years. His leadership and ability to unite people is something I strive  to do in Congress every day.   We certainly have a diverse State, and I want to highlight some of  the things that Abraham Lincoln is probably not known for.   Abe Lincoln actually was the inspiration for landmark legislation  that he signed that created the Morrill Land-Grant Acts that gave us  land-grant universities, including the greatest land-grant university  that I joke with my colleagues about from throughout this great Nation.  The greatest land-grant is the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, which I am proud to have in my district.   As we move on to talk about important issues, I cannot leave this  floor tonight without talking about the importance of agriculture in  our home State of Illinois. This past August, U.S. Secretary of  Agriculture Sonny Perdue; chairman of the House Agriculture Committee,  Mike Conaway; and so many Members, including Congressman LaHood,  Congresswoman Bustos, and others, joined me and other members of the  House Agriculture Committee for a farm bill listening session at the  largest outdoor farm event in the country, the Farm Progress Show in  Decatur, Illinois. Just the fact that this show is in Illinois every  other year truly highlights the importance of Illinois agriculture to  the rest of the world.   I am proud to be able to serve on the House Agriculture Committee and  serve as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Biotechnology,  Horticulture, and Research. And when we talk about agriculture and our  ability to feed the world, it stems right from our home State of  Illinois.   With 72,000 farms and over 2,600 food manufacturers, Illinois is a  national leader. We are the leading producer of soybeans, corn, swine,  and one of the largest producers of ethanol. As we move ahead into the  next farm bill debate, I am proud to be able to take Illinois' voice to  the House Agriculture Committee with my colleague Congressman Bost and  my other colleague Congresswoman Bustos.   I am proud to represent central Illinois and the 13th District here  in Washington, and I hope that those who follow us for the next 200  years enjoy legislating in a bipartisan way as much as we do together  in the Illinois delegation.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Davis for those  wonderful words regarding Illinois. I think we can agree there is  enough Lincoln history and heritage to go around to all of us. So I  thank the gentleman for his advocacy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Deerfield, Illinois (Mr.  Schneider), who represents many of the northwest suburbs and part of  Cook County.                                time  2015
