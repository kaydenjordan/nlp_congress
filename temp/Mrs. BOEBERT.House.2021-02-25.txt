 Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 39.

I  rise today to oppose the latest Democrat land grab, in the form of H.R.  803.   This bill, which is actually eight bills piled into one, adds nearly  1.5 million acres of new wilderness and permanently withdraws 1.2  million acres from mineral production. Seriously? This is the approach  we are taking?   Democrats want to stop mineral production, lock up our lands, and  depend on our enemies in Russia, Saudi Arabia, and China for our  energy, all while pretending to be green.   It is unacceptable to outsource our energy development to countries  that often use child and slave labor. We literally have children mining  in Congo with their bare hands to appease these not-in-my-backyard  extremists.   Speaking of backyards, Mr. Speaker, the sponsor of title I in this  bill doesn't have a single acre designated as new wilderness in her  district, yet title I alone locks up 510,000 acres in my district. The  Grand Junction Chamber sent me a letter opposing this, stating: These  are lands that are literally in our backyard in Mesa County, yet  Congresswoman DeGette continues to ignore us, does not meet with us,  and does not even consider the consequences of her bill on the  hardworking families of our district.   Could anyone here imagine me legislating away any part of Denver or  Boulder? The Member who authored title I's attack on my district simply  responds to doubts and concerns by inviting D.C. swampers to my  district on horseback to look at the pretty views, and then they call  it a day.   Dolores County is mentioned several times in this massive land grab.  The locals, elected officials, and experts have expressed their disdain  for this bill repeatedly over the years, with no regard from the bill's  sponsors.   After the past year of statewide lockdowns, the last thing  communities in my district need is further restrictions imposed by the  Federal Government on what they can do on public lands. Mr. Speaker,  the majority is silencing the people of my district in order to ram  through a 3 million-acre land grab.   Have supporters of this legislation considered the disastrous  wildfires that will result from the new wilderness designation and  other land grabs in this bill? Wilderness is the most restrictive land  use designation possible. It prevents active management of our forests,  which is critical for mitigation against catastrophic wildfires. If we  don't manage our forests, Mother Nature will continue to manage them  for us.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from  Texas, Congressman Chip Roy, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I have said it before and I will say it again: cancel  culture has become a pillar of the left.   Today, cancel culture took on toy potatoes, but not a sitting  Governor accused of sexual assault. That is where we have come to.   From Kevin Hart to Gina Carano, the woke mob will go after decades- old comments, and in Gina's case, for simply being a Conservative. The  woke mob now includes big tech, major corporations, and the Hollywood  elites at Disney who fired Ms. Carano for the crime of--wait for it-- posting conservative content on social media.   They tried to come after me, too. Twitter tried to cancel me. It  didn't work. The fake news at CNN and other outlets also tried to  cancel me for simply walking around the Capitol with my family. That  didn't work either. Mr. Speaker, it will never work because I refuse to  bow to the cancel mob.   We are a nation that has always had the audacity to dream, the  strength to lead, and the boldness to speak our minds. We must stand  tall and kneel before God. Scripture says that every knee will bow and  every tongue will confess Jesus is Lord.   Now, that is an audacious statement in America right now: Jesus is  Lord.   Why is that such a controversy?   Because there is power in the name of Jesus.                                time  1900    This isn't the first time Christians have been attacked for  professing the Lordship of Jesus.   If you go to the Book of Acts, Peter and John were arrested. It says:  Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple  and the Sadducees came upon them, greatly disturbed that they taught  the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. And  they laid hands on them and they put them in custody until the next day  for it was already evening. However, many of those who heard the word  believed and the number of men came to be about 5,000.   There were 5,000 salvations because someone had the boldness to speak  in the name of Jesus. It goes on.   Now, when they saw the boldness--their boldness was tangible. It was  evident to the people around them. It wasn't in a prayer closet. It  wasn't hidden. It was out in front. They saw the boldness of Peter and  John and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men.   That means that they didn't know the languages that they were  speaking in. They were speaking in unknown languages.   They marveled and they analyzed that they had been with Jesus. Their  [[Page H706]]  boldness was so tangible, so intense the people around them knew that  they had been in the presence of Jesus. Wow.   It goes on to say: What shall we do to these men? For, indeed that a  notable miracle has been done through them. It is evident to all who  dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot deny it, but so that it spreads  further among the people, let us severely threaten them-- Whew, sounds  like America. That sounds really familiar right now--that we would  severely threaten them, that from now on, they speak to no man in this  name. They wouldn't even say the name, in this name.   So they called them, and they commanded them not to speak at all, nor  teach. They were not allowed to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.   But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in  the sight of God to listen to you more than God, you judge.   It goes on to say exactly what God will do if you remain bold and  strong in your convictions and if you refuse to bow down to the cancel  mob, to the woke culture.   Peter and John spoke out. Now, Lord, look on their threats and grant  to Your servants boldness as we may speak Your word by stretching out  Your hands, hands to heal, that signs and wonders may be done through  the name of Your holy servant, Jesus.   This is the boldness that God is looking for right now. He said, if  we cry out to Him, He will hear us, and He will heal our land.   This cancel culture isn't just to keep us quiet; it is to stop the  very plan and movement of God Almighty. But I have read the end of the  book and we win. Glory to God. God bless America.   Do not give up the faith and hope in God. He will turn all shame into  glory.    Absolutely. Absolutely. It is an ongoing testimony of  even the lives that we are living today. Our stories, I believe, will  be recorded as there are a cloud of witnesses that are watching eagerly  what we are going to do. They have been waiting for this time and this  season and they are watching the sons of men. They are watching us like  never before.   Jesus came here and He showed us how to live, not as God, but as men,  anointed by the spirit of God, to walk in grace, not just a wishy- washy, cover up your mistakes kind of grace, it is this boldness. It is  empowerment. It is God's ability working in and through you. And I am  very much inspired by the Book of Acts and many others.
