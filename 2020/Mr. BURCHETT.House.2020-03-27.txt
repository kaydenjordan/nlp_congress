 Mr. Speaker, when I was 5 or 6 years old, I had a  Sunday school teacher tell me a story that relates to a little bit of  what we are doing right now. A small child went missing in the Plains  States. The community went in 100 different directions. They didn't  find the child. There was no result.   They final came together. They prayed to God, asking for wisdom. They  ended up holding hands and walking across the prairie. They found that  child.   Mr. Speaker, this country needs to remember that, and this body needs  to remember that. I think we need to put our partisanship aside. We  need to quit bickering, and we need to ask Almighty God for wisdom and  to do what is right.
