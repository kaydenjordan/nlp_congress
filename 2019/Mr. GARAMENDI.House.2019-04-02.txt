 Mr. Speaker, as I often do these Special Order hours  here on the floor, I want to start by stating the fundamental reason I  am here and my Democratic colleagues are here. I harken back to a very  famous American, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This is actually etched in  stone down at his memorial on the other end of the plaza here. He said:  ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance  of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who  have too little.''   That ``we provide enough for those who have too little,'' a  fundamental value, a fundamental statement of purpose, a fundamental  statement of why we seek elective office, not to provide more for those  who have much, but, rather, for those who have too little.   In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I do not understand why a man who says  he has much would purposely set out to harm those who have too little.   Why, Mr. Speaker, would the President of the United States put in  place a policy to take healthcare away from Americans? Obviously, he  has much, or at least he says he does. But millions of Americans rely  upon the Affordable Care Act for their insurance, for their health  insurance, literally for their ability to stay alive.   Why would the President of the United States ask the court to repeal,  to find unconstitutional, the Affordable Care Act that has provided  insurance coverage to more than 20 million Americans and healthcare  benefits to millions upon millions more?   Why would our colleagues on the Republican side of this aisle fall in  lockstep to support the President's effort to take away healthcare from  Americans?   I do not understand this. Where is the compassion? Where is the  empathy? Where is the concern for Americans, not one or two, but  millions upon millions of Americans who have come to rely upon the  Affordable Care Act to give them their basic insurance?   More than 20 million Americans found insurance coverage through the  expansion of the Medicaid program, not in every State, because there  were State Governors who were willing to go along with the President  and the Republicans and not institute the Medicaid expansion. But there  are still 20 million more Americans who have comprehensive healthcare  coverage today.   Why? We must ask the question of the President and any of his  sympathizers: Why would you do that?   It is not just those people who have been able to get coverage in the  Affordable Care Act, but it is every senior who is on Medicare who will  lose coverage. Every senior on Medicare has an annual visit to a doctor  to determine if they have any medical problems, a free annual check-up.  That, too, would disappear.   For seniors who had hundreds of dollars, if not thousands of dollars,  in annual expenses for drugs because of the Medicare drug doughnut  hole--yes, the infamous doughnut hole that was created in the expansion  of the Medicare program in 2003--that doughnut hole is literally closed  as a result of the Affordable Care Act.   Eliminate the Affordable Care Act, Mr. President, and seniors who  rely upon expensive drugs are going to, once again, pay billions of  dollars of additional costs right out of their pocket.   Here it is: ``Whether we provide enough for those who have too  little.''   Think of seniors who are in nursing homes. Most of the Medicaid  dollars are for nursing home care. The expansion will affect them, if  it is repealed.   Remember the bad old days when your insurance policy had a cap, a  $50,000 lifetime cap, maybe a $100,000 lifetime cap? If you had a bad  car accident, you would blow right through that. If you had cancer,  guaranteed within the first month of treatment, you would blow through  that cap, and it would come right out of your pocket.   Remember the bad old days when the great majority of personal  bankruptcies were a direct result of medical expenses?   Mr. Speaker, does the President remember those days, that now he  wants to eliminate the Affordable Care Act? Is that where we are in  this country? How mean-spirited.   Maybe his test of progress is whether we add more to those who have  much.   Look at this. The Affordable Care Act actually raised taxes on the  superwealthy. Maybe that is what the President wants, to, once again,  give a massive tax cut to the superwealthy. If the Affordable Care Act  is repealed, the average tax cut for the superwealthy, the top one- tenth of 1 percent of Americans, will be nearly $200,000 a year. Is  that what our President wants?   Apparently, he took the first half of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's  statement about values and said: Oh, yes, we want more for the wealthy.   That is precisely what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is  repealed, to the tune of more than $197,000 for the top one-tenth of 1  percent of America's wealthy.   What in the world? What is going on here in America that the  President of the United States, in league with many of our Republican  colleagues, would rip out of the hands of Americans a healthcare  program that is working?   That is not where we are on the Democratic side of this aisle. We  have fought this fight for 8, 9, 10 years. The Affordable Care Act  passed in 2009 and 2010, and here we are. Our Republican colleagues  gained control of this House and the Senate, and we fought the fight  over those years to stop the repeal.   Now, the President, once again, is going around Congress, this time  to the courts, asking the Supreme Court of the United States to rip out  of the hands of Americans the healthcare that they have come to rely  upon.   We will continue this fight. Not only will we continue this fight,  but we are stepping up to improve the Affordable Care Act, and we  intend to do it with a piece of legislation. We call it the  Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and Making Health Care More  Affordable Act of 2019, H.R. 1884, protecting preexisting conditions.    You heard my colleague, just before I stood up here, talking about  preexisting conditions. 130 million Americans have preexisting  conditions: high blood pressure, being a woman who might get pregnant,  you name it. We all, at least 130 million of us, have preexisting  conditions.   Here is what we intend to do: improve the Affordable Care Act and  reduce premium costs for consumers by expanding the eligibility for the  premium tax credit, expanding affordability for working families,  protecting comprehensive coverage for small businesses and workers, and  eliminating junk insurance policies.   I was the insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and I can  talk for hours and hours about insurance companies that sold junk to  people. They worked until they had an illness, and then it failed to  work. We would  [[Page H2977]]  make those junk insurance policies unavailable in America.   We would ensure that there would be comprehensive benefits, like  maternity care. If you talk about family values, you better talk about  maternity care.   We would make sure that the programs to make people aware that they  can get insurance would be in place.   We would help the States as they carry out their coverages. We would  make sure that the exchanges were not eliminated, that they would be  strong. Unlike the President who would eliminate the exchanges, we  would strengthen them.   We have work to do. We are here to make things better for America,  for the people, and we intend to do so.   Joining me tonight are a couple of my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn), a fellow who has worked on this for years.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman (Mr. Clyburn) so  very much. He has been working for those qualities and values all of  his life, and I really appreciate his coming to us and bringing us the  awareness of what Dr. Martin Luther King said about America and about  where the role of healthcare fits into justice in America.   I see Mr. Cicilline from Rhode Island here, the chairman of the  Democratic Policy and Communication Group.   Would you like to communicate with us?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman (Mr. Cicilline).   It is extremely important that we continue this fight we fought  successfully for 8 years, 9 years. And here we are once again.   The general public, keep in mind, Protecting Preexisting Conditions  and Making Healthcare More Affordable Act of 2019, H.R. 1884.   I turn to the gentleman from the State of New York (Mr. Morelle). If  you would like to join us and tell us how all of this affects your  constituency in New York.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman could stand by for a few  seconds.   I knew that he had been in the New York legislature as a leader in  the assembly there. And I had some recollection of the work he did on  insurance matters.   If he could just talk about the experiences he had when he tried to  protect people with preexisting conditions, and those issues that he  dealt with in the early nineties, some of the work that was done and  the experiences that he had there.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Morelle so much. Actually, I  didn't know that the gentleman had lost his daughter. That tragic  illness is an example of why the Affordable Care Act is so important,  because people will have coverage. There are no lifetime limits.   Although your daughter was unsuccessful in the treatment, many  thousands upon thousands of Americans are able to get treatment and  survive cancer or some other debilitating illness.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for his experience, and I  thank him for being here and bringing all those years of knowledge and  experience to this House and helping us fight this fight.   Let me now turn to my colleague from New Jersey who often is here  with  [[Page H2979]]  me on the floor, Mr. Payne. He and I talk about a lot of different  subjects. Here, we are talking about one that affects every American. I  thank the gentleman for joining us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Payne for his consistent work  here on the floor on multiple issues.   Healthcare issues have always been at the front of his agenda for him  and his constituents, and he has fought fiercely since 2012 to see to  it that the Affordable Care Act remains in place.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to put up one more chart that I think  graphically displays what we have been talking about here. This is  2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. The Affordable Care Act really took hold in  2013. It took a couple years to set up the administrative systems and  the like.   You can see in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, the number of uninsured in  America went from 44 million down to 27 million, which is just, in  large numbers, a clear description of what the Affordable Care Act was  able to do in bringing insurance to Americans.   Here we have a President who was unable to get his wall and decided  to go around Congress and the Constitution to try to fund the wall by  moving money from one military account to another so that he could  build his wall.   Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution clearly states that it is  the Congress that appropriates money. It says no money shall be  appropriated from the Treasury without law. Congress passed a law that  said $1.2 billion was for border security. That is it. Now the  President wants $8 billion, literally going around Congress and the  Constitution.   He is doing it once again with the Affordable Care Act. He was unable  to get Congress to repeal the law, so now he is going to the court  system to try to get the court to repeal the law.   Hopefully, the court won't do that. But if it does, those 20 million  Americans who will lose their insurance and those 130 million Americans  who have preexisting conditions and will once again be open to  insurance discrimination--not able to get insurance, paying vastly more  because they have a preexisting condition, like being a woman, or blood  pressure, or diabetes, or any number of things--those people will  remember that it was the President who went around Congress to the  courts to ask the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act.   There is so much at risk. Every senior on Medicare will see the  doughnut hole come back, and their drug expenses will skyrocket  billions of dollars. The free annual checkup that seniors are able to  get now will no longer be available. It goes on and on, all gone.   I am going to end with this before I turn this over to my colleagues.   I don't know that I could ever put this up enough, when FDR said:  ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance  of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who  have too little.''   In this case, probably close to 27 million Americans have too little.  They didn't have healthcare, and today, they do. Those are the  Americans who had too little.   Where do we stand? What are our values? How do we approach this  fundamental question of America as we go into the 2020s? Are we for  those who have much, like the President? Or are we for those who have  too little, like the Americans who were uninsured prior to the  Affordable Care Act?   I will tell you where we Democrats stand. We, without any Republican  support, created the Affordable Care Act. We fought over the last  decade, not only to implement it, but to fight the defensive battle to  see that it would continue.   Now we are going to continue that fight. We are not going to give up  because our values, our purpose, are with those Americans who now rely  upon the Affordable Care Act, and, indeed, with those seniors and with  this country so that we can provide for those in need.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2980]]                                ____________________
