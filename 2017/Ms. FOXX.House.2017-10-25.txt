 Mr. Speaker, Forbes magazine recently discovered something  many of us have known for a long time, which is that Sparta, North  Carolina, is a wonderful place to live and work.   Sparta, located in Alleghany County, is a wonderful community made up  of people with vision, strong work ethic, big hearts, and dreams.   Forbes encouraged young entrepreneurs to move to seven locations  around the country--and, in particular, to Sparta--for the high-speed  fiber internet and relatively low cost of living. This would allow  innovators and job creators to live affordably and work globally.   Mr. Speaker, this is a great reason to move to Sparta, but it is not  the only reason. I urge entrepreneurs and families to live in Sparta  for the wonderful quality of life, sense of community, and incredible  heart that makes this town a wonderful place to call home.                            ____________________
