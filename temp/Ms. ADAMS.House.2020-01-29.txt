 Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my colleagues in support  of H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive CREDIT Act.   I commend Chairwoman Waters, Congresswoman Pressley, and my  colleagues for their leadership and dedication to ensuring that the  credit reporting system works for everyone.   Our Nation's credit reporting system has an impact on hundreds of  millions of Americans. Credit scores and credit reports are  increasingly relied on for key decisionmaking by creditors, employers,  insurers, and even law enforcement. However, it has been more than 15  years since Congress has enacted comprehensive reform of the credit  reporting system.   In particular, I would like to focus on the consumers who have  experienced financial distress due to inaccurate information on their  credit reports.   When there is an error on a consumer report, the burden falls on the  consumer. It can take months and even, in some cases, years to remove  an error on a consumer's report, all the while the consumer's credit  continues to suffer, potentially preventing them from receiving a much- needed loan or financing.                                time  1345    My bill, the Improving Credit Reporting for All Consumers Act, which  is part of this larger package, would help consumers by making it  easier for incorrect information to be removed swiftly and painlessly.   It would make much-needed improvements to the dispute process for  consumers by providing a new right to appeal the results of initial  disputes.  [[Page H657]]    It would also require furnishers to retain better records of negative  information and that consumers be provided copies of any documents used  during the dispute process. All furnishers who regularly report  negative information would also be required to notify customers about  this practice and alert customers when they first send derogatory  information.   The second portion of my bill prohibits credit reporting agencies  from providing consumers with misleading and unfair information about  the various credit monitoring services they offer.   Credit reporting agencies would also be prohibited from misleading  consumers by describing certain products and services as free that are,  in truth, provided at no charge only for a limited trial period before  automatically converting into a paid subscription service.   The naysayers will say that my bill is well-meaning but significantly  flawed because the dispute process would make things more complicated  and difficult, but they would be wrong. The status quo is difficult and  cumbersome, and too many consumers' lives, credit, and opportunities  for healthy financial records hang in the balance.   Credit scores have a significant bearing on your ability to secure  access to loans and other opportunities for upward economic mobility.  This is an issue far too important, life-altering, and impactful. We  must do all that we can to ensure that consumers are fully  knowledgeable about their options and that they have the necessary  protections available to them.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bold package.
