 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Brady  for yielding. I thank Ranking Member Brady and Chairman Neal for their  hard work on this agreement.   We know that the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is vital to our  Nation's economy and my home State of Tennessee. Over 200,000 jobs in  Tennessee depend on the passage of USMCA, and that includes about  35,000 manufacturing jobs and 10,000 west Tennessee farm operations.   Madam Speaker, the Volunteer State produces almost $14 billion in  exports to Canada and Mexico. More importantly, the USMCA updates the  25-year-old trade agreement that we know as NAFTA and modernizes the  economic partnership of North America. Frankly, the USMCA will allow  Tennessee and our Nation as a whole to achieve greater prosperity.   I thank President Trump for delivering on his promises and creating a  better trade agreement for the American people.                                time  1230    Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting ``yes'' on the USMCA, and I  urge all my colleagues to do so as well.
