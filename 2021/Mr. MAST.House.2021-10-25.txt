 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I was asked by somebody about this piece of legislation,  the Congressional Gold Medal for the 13 killed on August 26, and why  not a gold medal for the thousands that have been killed in the war on  terror, the ones that I wear on my wrist and the ones with names on the  wall in the Rayburn Office Building and those that we see the markers  for in Arlington National Cemetery. The fact is, we could give every  one of them a thousand gold medals and it wouldn't represent a  thousandth of what we owe those who have given their lives in defense  of this country.   This gold medal isn't about that. It is about what we owe to the  living.   This gold medal is a result of America's leaders being weak. That is  why we are awarding this gold medal. We owe our fighters strength. We  owe them that we never be intimidated, that we never back up, that we  never retreat, that we never surrender. And as leaders, if we can't  promise that to our fighters, then we owe it to them to never ask to  lead.
