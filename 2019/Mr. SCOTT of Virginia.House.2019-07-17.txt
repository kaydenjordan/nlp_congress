 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  3305, Designating the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 2509 George Mason Drive in Virginia Beach, Virginia as the  ``Ryan Keith Cox Post Office Building.'' I appreciate my colleague, the  gentlelady from Virginia, Mrs. Luria, for introducing this bill.   Ryan Keith Cox is a Virginia Beach hero, a distinguished public  servant and one whose legacy will live on forever. We will remember  Ryan for his heroic actions during the Virginia Beach massacre on May  31, 2019. He saved dozens of lives by helping his colleagues find a  safe space to hide during the mass shooting at the Virginia Beach  Municipal Center. He was killed protecting two of his coworkers  guarding a cubicle door while his coworkers huddled on the floor  beneath two desks.   The Virginia Beach community will remember Ryan as a cherished friend  and one who always put others before himself. He was soft spoken,  encouraging, positive and considered by all to be ``a good man''.   He was active in his Church and participated in Anointed Voices, Men  of Hope, the Male Chorus and the Men's Ministry at New Hope Baptist  Church.   Madam Speaker, the designation of this post office in Ryan Keith  Cox's honor will forever remind us of his valor and his 12-year long  career with the City of Virginia Beach. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.
