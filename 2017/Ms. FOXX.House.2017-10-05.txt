 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from Tennessee,  the chair of the Budget Committee, for the wonderful work she has done  on bringing us to this position.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this substitute amendment.   As chair of the Education and the Workforce Committee, my priority  this Congress is to ensure that our policies promote a climate of job  creation through economic growth, a sound fiscal policy, and a global  economic competitiveness.   Our budget helps achieve all of these priorities by laying the  foundation for a robust and comprehensive simplification of our  burdensome Tax Code. The Democrat substitute not only fails to do so  but would decimate America's workforce.   Our budget reforms our broken Tax Code so that it works for every  American at every income level, regardless of where they live or how  much money they earn.   The top U.S. tax rate for individuals has been as high as 90 percent  and as low as 28 percent. At the same time, income tax revenue has  remained fairly steady, despite these sharp rate swings. It turns out  that the biggest driver of Federal revenue is not higher tax rates but  economic growth.   In fact, a sizeable majority of economists point out that a broad  base and low rates are key in a tax system that fosters economic growth  and competitiveness. Legislators on both sides of the aisle agree on  this basic principle, and history has shown it to be true.   Instead of raising taxes, we should, instead, embrace the policies  contained in this budget resolution that encourages economic growth,  like reducing regulatory burdens, welfare reform, and comprehensive tax  reform for all individuals, not just a select few.
