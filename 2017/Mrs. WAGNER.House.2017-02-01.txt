 I thank Chairman Hensarling for the time.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Huizenga, the chair of the Capital Markets  and Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee, for his leadership  on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor the SEC disclosure rule for  resource extraction, which is an important tool for Congress to use in  disapproving excessive red tape brought by Washington bureaucrats.   The previous administration placed crushing regulatory burdens on the  American people. In 2015 alone, Federal regulations cost almost $1.9  trillion--nearly $15,000 per American family. This particular SEC  regulation, which was issued by the Obama administration, regarding  resource extraction disclosures will make it more expensive for our  public companies that are involved with energy production to be  competitive overseas with foreign state-owned companies.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this resolution of disapproval.  The SEC has estimated that ongoing compliance costs for this rule could  reach as high as $591 million annually and fully admit that it has the  potential to divert capital away from other productive opportunities,  like growing a business and creating jobs.   Securities law should not be used to advance foreign policy  objectives, particularly when the compliance cost of implementing those  objectives is so expensive--with no added benefit of investor  protection.   While this rule had already been vacated before the U.S. District  Court of D.C. in 2013, I am happy that, through this resolution of  disapproval, Congress--we the people--can now weigh in as well on this  harmful rule. I urge the passage of this resolution.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a member of the Financial  Services Committee and of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.
