 Madam Speaker, I am going to try something for the  next hour, and it is going to be one of those presentations that is  always a little on the difficult side because we are going to talk  about things a lot of this place and a lot of the country doesn't want  to hear, but we call it math.   The first premise, I need to ask all of us, if I were to walk into a  room of Democrats, people on the left, or people on the right, and say,  ``What is the biggest threat over the next couple of decades that is  facing your country?'' you would hear all sorts of things.   You know, a couple of years ago, with the Democrats, it was Russia,  Russia. Today, it may be this and that. I am going to argue it is  demographics. And you go, huh?   We are going to do almost 38 boards here, walking through the  national debt, deficit spending, spending priorities, and the reality  on where there are revenues, taxes, what we call receipts. Then you  have to ask yourself, does the next generation, and the generation  after that, and the generation after that, do they have the right to  live in a country where there is some prosperity, or has Washington,  D.C., decided to just destroy those who are heading toward retirement,  those who are heading toward elementary school and their future?   Let's actually sort of walk through some of the realities of the  math. And I am not going to even bother with 1965 and what the mix was.   You have to understand, in 2021, 77 percent of all the spending in  this place, 77 percent of all the spending, was what we called  mandatory, formula, Social Security, Medicare, formulas. Only 10  percent was defense, and 13 percent was everything else in government.   If you like to think that, well, you have lots of prodefense  Democrats and, obviously, prodefense Republicans, then mandatory is a  formula that you don't even vote on here. You are electing Members of  Congress to come and vote on 13 percent of the spending in this budget  cycle. This is how out of whack it is. And we are going to walk through  how much of this mandatory is demographics.   Look, getting older is not Republican or Democrat, but it is math. It  is going to happen. So let's actually walk through a couple of the  realities here.   I just threw this chart together. I know it is impossible to read on  camera and those things. But the point is simple. Today, Social  Security is 23 percent of all the spending; national defense is 15;  Medicare is 14. In a couple of years, all those change. I could even  [[Page H5861]]  show you some charts that, if interest rates tick up even a little bit,  defense actually starts to fall to fourth very, very soon.   To give you an idea, when you actually get up in front of audiences-- and for conservative audiences, the folklore a decade ago was, well,  waste and fraud, foreign aid, and then you would pull out this chart  and show that it is a fraction of a percent.   Fine, maybe we should do something different in foreign aid. Yes, the  spending from this year has massive fraud in it. But the long-term  impact of those is nothing compared to the fact--and I am going to have  to be honest and have a conversation about how we save, how we protect  Medicare and Social Security, because what is going on around this  place--you get politician after politician behind these microphones and  saying, I am going to protect Medicare, and I am going to protect your  Social Security, while they are driving it into the ground.   So let's actually start to walk through how fast it is eroding. From  2019 to 2031--and 2031 is what? How many years from now? It is  functionally nine budget cycles from now. We will have doubled debt.  You have to understand how fast this is eroding from us.   The more current numbers, because this slide was done about a year or  two ago, it is actually much worse with the spending during the  pandemic. So let's actually start to also walk through what we need to  understand. Social Security, healthcare, entitlements, and interest  costs drive 90 percent of the 2008 to 2031 spending hikes.   Let's back that up. If you take a look at Social Security, Medicare,  and then the interest attached to those, that is what drives the  deficit.   Remember our earlier comment: It is our demographics. And this place  is unwilling to actually have honest conversations of how we are going  to protect access to those earned benefits because the numbers are so  big and so scary.   What do you have? What do you have here even today? Member after  Member running to the microphones talking about how we are going to  functionally give away more.   But if you are under 50, we are about to make your future--as a  matter of fact, it is already baked into the cake. Your future is  really dangerous right now.                                time  2030    So let's actually walk a little bit more through what the slides look  like. Rising Social Security and Medicare shortfalls drive nearly  entire 2019 to 2031 nonpandemic--so this is before the pandemic--and  you start to understand that this is before the pandemic calculations.  We were heading towards about $2.2 trillion a year in borrowing before  the pandemic. That is the baseline number.   When you actually start to really understand that--this is the  general revenues. And when you start to add up all the shortfalls, you  are heading towards a time where functionally a 30-year government is  living on borrowed money.   So let's actually do a little bit more. You have all seen this slide.  Lots of people like to use it. You know, the national debt is set to  match the World War II peak within a decade. Well, guess what? We are  pretty much there. We have pretty much now have hit what they call the  percentage of GDP.   Why do we use that? Because there is this theory that says the size  of the economy is what allows you to borrow money, and as long as you  don't borrow too much money where the interest costs start to burden  the availability of what they call capital stock, for an economy to  grow, the economy to have new investments.   The fear is--remember, it wasn't that long ago we used to talk about,  well, when we hit 100 percent of GDP, that means the borrowing, the  publicly borrowed money will be the size of the economy. Guess what? We  have already surpassed that. We have done it.   You are going to see some boards here that should terrify you.   Long-term baseline. Now, I have got to give credit where credit is  due. Manhattan Institute, Brian Riedl, basically what he does is take  the CBO numbers, and I think some from Joint Tax, and tries to make  them digestible. He also lays out what the short-term, which is 10- year, 20-year, and 30-year layouts are. You can go right now to that  website and download these same charts for yourself.   But the long-term baseline shows absolutely unsustainable debt; and  this side has gotten worse since last year when we printed it, because  it actually had in 2050. So functionally in less than 30 years, we were  approaching up to 195 percent of debt, borrowed money, the size of the  total economy, so functionally twice the size of the economy. That  number has actually now gotten much worse because of what we have done  in the pandemic financing and a whole bunch of the other promises that  have come in and the other spending that has happened during unified  government from the left.   So once again, trying to actually demonstrate, it is not falling  revenues. We have dozens of charts--and I only brought a couple of  them--on the slide deck that make it very clear, when you look at--and  this redline is what in Ways and Means we would call receipts. Most  people think of it as tax revenues. It is basically where it has always  been.   If you actually go back to the 1960s and 1970s, it was about 17.3  percent of GDP came in as revenues, as taxes. Now, we are actually  heading towards a time where it is about 18.5 percent. So it is  actually higher. But what is this line here? You see this? Okay, that  is the pandemic.   But then you get back to the trend line. Why is the trend line  exploding in that direction with 31.8 percent more spending than  revenues? It is demographics, healthcare costs.   So let's actually do another one. Medicare part A and Social Security  trust funds face bankruptcy. The Medicare trust fund is gone in about 6  years. Remember, post tax cuts and reform, you know, when we reformed  the tax code, because the economy was growing so fast and so many  people were working, we actually at that time went from 4 years left in  the part A trust fund of Medicare--remember, only the hospital portion  of Medicare has a trust fund. Everything else comes out of the general  fund. We actually added a couple of years, because there were so many  people working and, therefore, paying their FICA taxes.   But does this concern anyone that the Social Security trust fund is  gone? The Medicare, the hospital portion of the trust fund, is gone in  functionally 5 years. Is anyone paying attention? Or, once again, will  we try to manage this by crisis? But the scale of these numbers is just  stunning, and then we live in this financial fantasy world in this  place.   Here is the slide. I have done a version of this slide for a decade  now, and I have been booed in front of audiences for telling them the  truth. There is something wrong in our psyche when we are so used to  politicians lying to us that we almost want them to not tell us the  truth; it hurts too much.   Now, I have been on this floor dozens and dozens and dozens of time  saying there is a path. The future doesn't have to be this dystopian,  debt-laden financial collapse. There is a path. But you have to have a  revolution in the cost of healthcare and economic growth. There is a  series of things, and you have to do all of them together.   The thing that terrifies me the most is how many times do you have  anyone come behind these microphones and talk about the scale of the  debt that is coming or solutions to it.   The fact of the matter is, I don't know if our public votes on this.  God knows, you don't raise money telling people the truth about what is  going on. But I have a 6-year-old daughter. Doesn't she deserve to live  in a prosperous country? Because this is going to crush prosperity for  everyone, and it is going to wipe out lots of people in retirement.   Once again, you have got to understand, this chart, this is  Congressional Budget Office numbers, which say in about 29 years, we  have $112 trillion of borrowing, debt. This is an inflation adjusted  number, so this is in constant dollars.   You are going to notice, the entire 30-year debt comes from Medicare  and then Social Security. The rest of the budget is actually in  balance.   If this place isn't willing to have a revolution in the cost of  delivering healthcare to our brothers and sisters and our seniors, our  future is really ugly.  [[Page H5862]]    You have got to understand. There is a fraud around here. You will  get people from the left saying, well, we should do Medicare for all.  Medicare for all is a financing bill. It does nothing to the cost of  healthcare. ObamaCare, the ACA, was a financing bill. It was about who  got subsidized and who had to pay. The Republican alternative was a  financing bill. It was about who had to pay and who got subsidized.  None of them are doing things that change the cost of healthcare.   I didn't bring the slide here, because I did it just 2 weeks ago,  that shows 31 percent of Medicare spending is just diabetes. The single  most powerful thing you could do to help the United States in its  sovereign debt and to end misery in our minority communities and my  Tribal communities out in Arizona is do an operation warp speed, go  after type 2 diabetes. Isn't that something Republicans and Democrats  could agree upon? And guess what? It has amazing economic impact.   We are working on a math problem right now. We actually believe  solving diabetes could be one of the single biggest things you could do  to income inequality, because you take a look at some of our urban  minority populations that suffer from diabetes and some of my Tribal  communities out west, and if you normalize, saying, what would happen-- what would this population's income and prosperity look like if you  cured diabetes, that income inequality number shrinks dramatically. It  is not a bunch of transfer payments; it is solving people's misery. But  it is a little hard campaigning on something that is complicated, isn't  it?   So this is the slide, out of everything I am going to show, that I  actually see in my dreams. It really, really bothers me, because I  don't have really elegant ways to explain how dystopian this number is.   Projected 2051 budget deficits are entirely driven by Social Security  and Medicare. But do you see this number here? It is basically saying  almost 21 percent of the entire GDP will be outlays for Social Security  and Medicare, but revenues will only be 6 percent. This gap here is  solely living on borrowed money. This over here is the rest of the  budget. Turns out that for the rest of the budget, revenues are  outpacing the spending. That is all other government. That is defense,  that is environment, that is everything, including education. But this  gap right here is what brings us to that $112 trillion of borrowing in  the next 29 years.   You have got to get your head around this. That is assuming the CBO  numbers, that there are no recessions, there are no economic slowdowns,  there are no major terrorists attacks that slow down the economy, and  there is not another pandemic. That is a baseline number. Do you  understand how fragile we have made this economy because we are  unwilling to tell the truth about these numbers?   I had a political consultant once tell me: Schweikert, you can't tell  the truth about the debt and financing, because it will get you  unelected. I am incredibly blessed. I represent North Maricopa County,  so Scottsdale, Carefree, Cave Creek, Paradise Valley, Fountain Hills. I  represent a bunch of really smart people, and they are not happy when I  show them this, but they understand it is math.   I don't get my head around how this becomes partisan, because you are  going to see, if you take a look at the pieces of legislation the left  drops, they are trying to expand the programs at the same time they are  collapsing. I mean, the lunacy.   So let's take a look, do the same thing, trying to get our heads  around this. Remember, this slide was done before the pandemic scale of  borrowing, which we are going to be paying interest on that for decades  and decades and decades, because we never pay it off.   Social Security faces functionally a $35 trillion shortfall over the  next 30 years. Now, it is 29 years. $32 trillion, if you include the  trust fund balance. So functionally just Social Security has a $32  trillion shortfall over the next 29 years, okay?   Oddly enough, we could sit down around the table, and that $32  trillion shortfall on Social Security, we can figure that out, because  being a defined benefit system as it is, the math, you have about a  dozen or two dozen levers where you can say we are going to stop  subsidizing really, really, really rich people, we are going to do  this, we are going to do that. There are to deal with that.   The one that is just brutal, math-wise, is this one. So Social  Security is $32 trillion short. Medicare is $78 trillion short. And  this one is much more difficult. Yet, the solution around here is,  well, we will just subsidize more people and borrow the money.   There is a path, but you have got to be willing to functionally  legalize technology and disrupt the cost of healthcare.   And there are some amazingly good things happening. Actually, with  the messenger RNA, there are so many diseases that, if we invest in, we  could actually cure misery today and reap the benefits in the future.  And I have only come to the floor dozens of times trying to share that  math.   So once again, let's take a look. This is also something that is  disharmonious to what a lot of people believe. The typical retiring  couple--and this is before the pandemic--will receive $3 in Medicare  for every dollar they paid in.   Now, Social Security, you functionally get really close to what you  put into it. Social Security is a fairly square deal. Medicare, we have  a problem.   That typical retiring couple, 2 years ago, when Brian Riedl was doing  this math, would put in about $161,000 in a lifetime, and they were  taking out, or receiving benefits, of about $522,000. That gap right  there is almost the sole primary driver of most of the U.S. sovereign  debt over the next 30 years.   If we are willing to actually have an honest conversation of what do  we do to keep our brothers and sisters healthy, to provide access and  resources, but do it in a modern way and could we bend this cost  differential here? Because if we do that--remember, we were just  talking a moment ago. Thirty-one percent of this is just diabetes in  our seniors. If you took that on, that is the single greatest thing you  could do to bending this curve and saving the economic future of this  society.                                time  2045    We also need to deal with a bit of the folklore. Now, this is  folklore that comes from the left. You do realize the Tax Code has  already been getting more progressive. You do realize the 2017 tax  reform was more progressive than the Tax Code before 2017.   And look, when you actually go back to the 1980s, 1990s, the top 20  percent at that time were all paying about 60 percent of all income  taxes. Today, they are paying 70 percent. This is the top 20 percent.   So it is folklore. Now, it is good political folklore. It is good  campaign folklore. We are going to make the rich pay their fair share.  Fine, stop subsidizing them.   We have already done a demonstration here repeatedly that we come up  with a trillion, a trillion-four over 10 years of direct subsidies to  the really, really, really rich. So the absurdity that is in the  current tax plan being offered by the Democrats is: Let's do this.  Let's raise their taxes. Oh, by the way, wink, wink, nod, nod, you make  $800,000 a year, we are going to give you tax credits of $118,000 if  you buy what Democrats tell you to buy.   Okay. Why not go further? Why not remove the trillion, trillion-four  in direct subsidies that we give to the rich and then put that toward  balancing some of these--well, actually slowing the erosion? Because  you are not going to balance this.   Any politician that gets up and says we are going to balance the  budget; we are going to pay off the debt and deficits isn't being  forthright. Our job is just to stabilize it at this point because the  numbers are so large. If you get someone that comes behind these  microphones and throws out the rhetoric of, well, it is foreign aid, it  is waste and fraud. Well, we are going to balance the budget by doing  this. Buy them batteries for their calculator because they obviously  don't have them.   This comes back to dealing with the reality. No defense cuts, taxing  millionaires cannot finance current deficits. The progressive wish  list. The proposals that the left has proposed this year functionally-- the free college, the job guarantees, the Medicare for all--you start  to add that up, and if you start to wipe out everything else, you  functionally have just blown up the deficit by another 34 percent. The  math just doesn't work.  [[Page H5863]]    So let's actually sort of walk through this. It is important.  President Biden promised in his campaign $11 trillion of new spending  over 10 years. $11 trillion in new spending. And look, they are all  cited. They are either CBO or Committee for a Responsible Budget. But  you start to look at it, this is just the campaign promises of $11  trillion of new spending on top of what is the $4-plus trillion  baseline budget, plus the couple trillion additional we did over the  last two years.   Now you have, what was it, the original scoring of the Build Back  Better plan was, what? They claimed $3\1/2\--but it really scored out  to $5, $5\1/2\ trillion. This is the lunacy we are at.   And, yet, if you come and add up every potential tax hike the left  talks about--you know, get rid of any changes we did in tax reform that  created the great growth--you actually start to take all income over  $200,000 and just take 50 percent of it. Hey, you make $200,000, we  take 50 percent of it. You do all the tax hikes that are on the entire  list of the Democrats. Over a decade, you functionally raise $12  trillion. Okay. The deficit already projected before the pandemic was  going to be over $13 trillion at that time. And that is not assuming  you just blew up the economy, you slowed down growth.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I know this is a lot of boards, but in  some ways you need it to try to drill in. We hate talking about this  around here. I can't tell you--I will start to do these presentations  even with some of my conservative brothers and sisters, and they run  away from me. But it is the math.   The progressive programs overwhelmingly benefit the rich. This is one  of my fixations here because I think this is something the left and  those of us on the right could actually come to an agreement on. Let's  stop subsidizing the rich. The things we provide to families with high  incomes, and you actually walk through the amount--we actually brought  a presentation to the floor a couple weeks ago and showed a trillion, a  trillion-four-hundred-thousand dollars that goes to the very top  quartile. That is the lunacy that is going on around here, we want to  tax the rich, but we are going to turn around and hand it back to them.  You know, if it is my fourth house and I happen to buy it on a beach,  should I be getting subsidized flood insurance?   The Biden budget proposals would add $8.8 trillion in debt over the  next decade, and that is with the Biden tax hikes. How often are we  talking about that around here? That is how CBO scores it.   Even eliminating all defense spending doesn't get you close to  actually making a difference in the long-term debt.   Think of this. This is the defense line. And the baseline is  basically projected to sit about now for the future decades at about  3\1/2\ to 4 percent of GDP. But you start taking a look and go out to  that 2050 number, we are at almost 16 percent of GDP. The size of the  economy will just be the spending on Social Security and Medicare. Does  anyone sort of see a difference, hey, 4 to 16?   This is the reality, but yet, we will get people who will come behind  these microphones, Members, and say, if we would cut defense, if we  would do this, we will balance it. No, you won't. That is not the math,  and you know it is not the math. We need to stop misinforming--my wife  would refer to it as lying--the public and start telling the truth and  treat them like adults about what is going on.   Remember, the problem ultimately isn't Republican or Democrat. It is  demographics. We as a society have made lots of promises, and if we are  going to keep them, we need to tell the truth about the math.    It turns out the growth in the economy is crucial, even with my most  optimistic math. When we have come here and said we can have a  revolution in the cost of delivering healthcare, we can do all these  things, the linchpin of it is you must have the economic growth.   You actually take a look during when President Obama oversaw about  half a trillion of new taxes, and we functionally lost $3.2 trillion of  economic expansion. If we are going to raise taxes, you have got to  think it through in a way that what is the economic growth effect at  the end of the decade, the next decade, and the decade after that.  Because if we don't keep growing the size of this economy, that ratio  of borrowing--because the borrowing is exploding. If you aren't growing  the economy as fast, there is a technical economic term for it. It is  called ``We are screwed.''   Even a 100 percent tax rate on small businesses and upper-income  families could not come close to balancing the long-term budget. Take  everything. Take all the money from upper income. Take all the money  from small businesses, and you still don't get close to balancing.   We all know this. Why is this place so incapable of telling the  truth? I mean, are we that addicted to the spending? Our constituents,  our voters, our contributors, are they that addicted to us handing them  checks?   But this is the basic chart. It makes it very, very clear. You can't  solve the long-term budget even if you go out and confiscate 100  percent of small businesses' wealth and the upper income's wealth.   Here's where the reality should be terrifying you. National debt is  projected to leap from 200 percent to 328 percent of GDP, depending on  if those Biden proposals pass and if there are any interest rate  changes. So you start taking a look at this. When you start to see $328  trillion of spending in 28 years, 29 years, you get this sort of  number, if the Biden proposals pass and interest rates go up by 1  percent. You have got to understand how fragile we are.   Is there anyone around here that is a fan of Taleb, the guy that  wrote ``Black Swan?'' In ``Antifragile'', he talks about how you can  see these things coming, do things not to make yourself--because there  are going to be other economic black swans. We have made this country  incredibly, economically fragile because these numbers are coming.   Now, this one happens to come if the Biden administration and the  Democrats here get their proposals. But even if they don't, you are  still well over 200 percent of debt-to-GDP as the baseline.   The share of Federal tax revenues spent on interest on the national  debt is projected to surge. Okay.   Here's a simple thought experiment. Today interest, with our  incredibly low interest rates, is about 9 percent of GDP. If we get two  points of an interest rate hike, in 2051, 100 percent of GDP is just  interest.   Doesn't this terrify anyone else? I can't be alone in looking at  these numbers and just panicked for my society, for my country, my  daughter.   Since 1990, nondefense discretionary spending has grown four times  faster than defense. This is important because we keep seeing people  come behind these microphones talking about the skyrocketing cost of  defense. Nondiscretionary is growing four times faster. Over the last  20 years, four times faster. And you saw it in the opening slide that  basically said 70 percent of all of our spending is mandatory today, 10  percent is defense, and everything else is what we really get to vote  on.   Coronavirus legislation--and we are all guilty on this; Democrats  substantially more guilty, but we are all guilty--pushed the 2020 and  2021 Federal spending past $50,000 per household. So if you are a  household out there during this pandemic cycle, do you feel you got  $50,000 worth of value? Because you are going to pay for it for the  rest of your lives, the rest of your kids' lives, the rest of your  grandkids' lives with lots of interest. Functionally, this spike you  see here was $50,000 per household. That is what we did during the  pandemic.   And you have got to understand, we have had an incredible free ride  the last couple years. The Federal Reserve has functionally financed  our debt. And now we are financing our own inflation.   I am sure some of you have been to a grocery store, filled up your  gas tank. Welcome to what happens when you do Keynesian economics.   Here's the reality: Do you see the little line down here? This is  China. This is Japan. This is the rest of the world. This is the  Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is functionally about five  [[Page H5864]]  times more financing our debt than China and Japan together. We are  playing a shell game ourselves. We are financing our own debt. And then  you wonder why you have inflation.                                time  2100    And we have all been in this body, and I know there is always angst  when we get near the debt ceiling, but the fact of the matter is if you  take a look at the last 40 years, almost the only times we have  actually had any attempt to bend the spending curve, bend the borrowing  curve, bend the debt curve have been out of negotiations to raise the  debt ceiling.   Budget deals, we have had a number of them. Remember the Budget  Control Act and some of the others?   Now, the problem is, we have had some of these where we set base  lines and they were actually sort of working, and then this place all  runs away from them. But there is a fraud in those, and that was they  were always tied to discretionary spending, not the mandatory that is  functionally driving the debt.   Some of my brothers and sisters on the left have said, well, it was  tax reform. That is just not true. If you actually look at the  contributor debt, if everything from tax reform was extended  permanently, it is a tiny fraction, and that is assuming without CBO-- remember CBO wasn't giving us the value for all the economic growth we  particularly had in 2018 and 2019. But that is not the math.   And the six major deficit reduction deals that we have had since  1983, if you take a look at them, almost all of it was under  discretionary. It saved us some money in interest. We did raise some  more taxes. We did a little bit in the early eighties under Ronald  Reagan on mandatory Social Security, but you take a look at them, and  they had a pretty darn impressive effect. Remember the surpluses in the  late nineties? But today we have let it get away from us.   And you take a look at what became of the $1.7 billion in promised-- remember 2013 until this year there was supposed to be about $1.7  trillion in functional reductions in spending? Do you remember the  Budget Control Act? Except what happened?   Well, time after time both Republicans and Democrats came here and  whittled it away because we wanted to spend more money, and we lost  much of the value. So we did gain about a trillion dollars of savings  over those 10 years. It could have been double that if we hadn't  whittled it away.   The last thing, and I hope our brothers and sisters on the left will  actually step up and help us on this one. The current number is  actually substantially higher than this because this slide now is a  couple months old, but we think we have identified over $200 billion in  functionally missed and fraudulent claims and payments during the  pandemic. You have seen some of the crazy stories of how much fraud  there has been in unemployment in California.   We need to tell the truth about the healthcare costs, Medicare  driving our debt. But I believe in a holistic theory. You need to go  after everything. You need to go after what we know is the fraud from  the last 2 years. We also need to tell the truth about bending the  curve on delivering healthcare. And there are ways to do it. This place  just needs to stop being so fearful of telling the truth about the debt  and deficits because if we don't grow up and take this head on it is  going to take our head off.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
