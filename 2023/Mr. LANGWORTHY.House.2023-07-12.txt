 Madam Speaker, it feels like every week, the House  Oversight Committee uncovers more evidence of wrongdoing by the  President and his family.   I have seen thousands of pages of suspicious activity reports at the  Treasury, the FD-1023 form from the FBI, and piles of evidence that  suggest bribery and influence peddling.   All of this is hidden from the American people by a brazenly corrupt  two-tiered justice system and a complete media blackout on the subject.   Bribery and foreign influence peddling strike at the heart of our  democratic principles. It corrodes the very foundations of our Nation  and fosters an environment where personal gain takes precedence over  our duty to the American people. It is a responsibility of each and  every one of us to demand answers and to hold the President  accountable.   It is outrageous that just last month, the DOJ announced a sweetheart  plea deal for Hunter Biden that would absolve him of any future charges  with the foreign bribery and influence peddling schemes that we have  just started to unravel in the House Committee on Oversight and  Accountability.   On the very same day this plea deal was announced, Biden's DOJ went  after President Trump. It is a joke. This is something you would expect  to see in a tinpot, third-world dictatorship. What is even worse is the  complete media blackout on any of the evidence that we have uncovered  here.   We used to hail the free press in America as the fourth estate.  Journalists used to pride themselves on uncovering corruption.   The American people have a right to know about potential wrongdoing  by their elected leaders and their associates and their families. They  deserve a media that fearlessly investigates and reports on matters  that impact the foundations of our democracy.   These allegations that are not taken seriously by the DOJ or the  media have a very real impact on the work we do here in this Chamber  every single day.   This week, we are considering the NDAA. House Republicans have  included strong language to combat the threat of the Chinese Communist  Party. Meanwhile, our President and his family have alleged business  ties to that same Chinese Communist Party. How can we expect a  President to appropriately represent the interests of the United States  if there is a vested interest in seeing our adversaries succeed for  their own personal gain?   If not for the work of the House Oversight Committee, the American  people would be left in the dark, and this is unacceptable. We need  every American citizen to speak up and say that it is ``We, the  people'' that run this government; not Joe Biden, not the bureaucrats,  and certainly not the Department of Justice, or those in the corrupt  legacy media who have put a complete media blackout on this corruption  story. We are not going to let this stand.                            ____________________
