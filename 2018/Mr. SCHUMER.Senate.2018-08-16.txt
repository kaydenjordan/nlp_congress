 Madam President, as the Senate continues to work on  appropriations, I want to thank the chairman, Senator Shelby, and the  ranking member, Senator Leahy, for their work. The process has so far  been productive and bipartisan in the Senate. Both sides have worked to  avoid poison pill riders. That has meant steady progress. Next up are  the annual appropriations bills for the Departments of Labor, Health  and Human Services, and Defense, which I hope will follow the same  bipartisan course of the previous few bills.   We have already achieved substantial increases in funding for  important priorities through the appropriations process, including  significant new resources for the NIH, significant new resources to  combat the opioid epidemic, and significant new investments in  infrastructure, childcare, college affordability, Social Security, and  the VA. That is a big victory for the American people, who have waited  too long for our country to invest in them.   Middle-class people are worried about staying in the middle class.  People trying to get to the middle class are worried--the ladder is  steeper and longer. These kinds of things help them: college  affordability, help with childcare, building infrastructure, making  sure Social Security is around. All of that helps the middle class. For  years, a hard-right group on the Republican side cut the smithereens  out of these things, but this year, we managed to restore them. The  American people will do a lot better because of it.                            ____________________     Madam President, I am happy to report that the annual  authorization of the national defense was signed into law. I want to  take a moment to thank a colleague who is not here today to celebrate  that fact--Senator John S. McCain, for whom the bill has been named.  Our dear friend Senator McCain has been such a stalwart champion for  the men and women in uniform. He would be proud that once again  Congress has met its obligation to give the military the support and  certainty it needs to conduct missions around the globe.   Even from afar, Senator McCain's influence on this Chamber is  considerable and strong. His presence hovered over us as we all made  sure--knowing he would importune us, if he were here, to make sure the  Defense bill was strong and voted on quickly. So many of the bases in  my State--including our Niagara Air Force base, including our Fort  Drum--are so much the better because of John McCain's great work. I  wish him all the best and commend his staff and Senator Inhofe's and  Senator Reed's staff for their work on the John S. McCain National  Defense Authorization Act.                            ____________________     Madam President, on the Supreme Court, as we return from  the State work period, the Republican majority continues to steam  forward on President Trump's nomination to the Supreme Court,  announcing that hearings will begin on September 4. That is just 12  business days from today. Yet the Senate remains unable to do its due  diligence on the nominee because we have access to only a tiny  percentage of his record.   Why is this? Senate Republicans are in the midst of a blatant and  historic obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee's record, denying the  Senate and the American people critical information about this  potential Supreme Court Justice.   The entire record of Judge Kavanaugh's 3 years as Staff Secretary in  the White House--the most senior position he held before joining the  bench--is being deliberately withheld from the Senate and from the  public. The Republican majority has unilaterally declared those papers  irrelevant even though Judge Kavanaugh himself has testified to the  importance of the position and the work he did there.   Meanwhile, the small percentage of documents the Judiciary Committee  will get to see are being prescreened by a political operative named  Bill Burck--a longtime Republican lawyer and former deputy to Brett  Kavanaugh when he worked in the White House. A deputy to Brett  Kavanaugh is now determining what Brett Kavanaugh's record should be  there--somebody who was a lawyer for Steve Bannon--notorious Steve  Bannon--a lawyer for Reince Priebus, a lawyer for McGahn, White House  Counsel.   Mr. Burck and his team have already started delivering documents to  the Judiciary Committee, but they are refusing to provide a privilege  log. Why are they giving us this document and not that one? Aren't we  entitled to know what their reasoning, at least, is? So the Judiciary  Committee cannot understand how many documents are being held back and  on what basis. A privilege log has always been provided in previous  Supreme Court vetting processes, and without it, we have no idea  whether the basis for Mr. Burck's withholding all of these documents is  legitimate.   Where is our chairman of the Judiciary Committee? He says: Oh, this  is the best ever. Then why aren't we getting such a log? What is his  answer to that? I know he will come to the floor and rail and rail, but  the process--the actual facts--is much worse than we have seen.   Here is something new--also being done by the chairman of the  Judiciary  [[Page S5674]]  Committee. One-third of the documents we are getting, which is a small  percentage of the total documents, are being deemed as ``committee  confidential'' by the majority and have not been released, stacking an  additional layer of secrecy on top of multiple layers of existing  secrecy.   Why are I and my staff and the other 79 Senators not on the Judiciary  Committee being denied the ability to review so many of these documents  that have been given to the Judiciary Committee? What are the  Republicans on the Judiciary Committee hiding? The moniker ``committee  confidential'' sounds like another way to shield Judge Kavanaugh's  record from the eyes of the American people and the Senate, and we have  no knowledge of why these documents are being withheld.   Even the National Archives--nonpartisan and neutral--felt compelled  to release a statement about this process. They are usually very quiet.  They are archivists. They go ahead and do their job. They felt that  what was going on was wrong. You can tell by the statement they  released. The Archives clarified that Burck's review of Kavanaugh's  records is ``a separate review--completely apart from the National  Archives and the George W. Bush Presidential Library's efforts. This  effort by former President Bush does not represent the National  Archives or the George W. Bush Presidential Library.'' That is what the  archivists said. They are separating themselves from such a secretive,  nondemocratic process. For a down-the-middle organization like the  National Archives--very reluctant to comment on political matters--to  put out a statement like this goes to show how far the Republicans and  Chairman Grassley have departed from precedent.   The obstruction here is shocking. Everywhere you look, Republicans  are deciding what constitutes the proper review of a nominee chosen by  a Republican President. Republicans have unilaterally decided what  documents are relevant to the Senate. Republican lawyers are the ones  combing through those documents and deciding unilaterally which can be  released to the Senate. The Republican majority and the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee are then deciding unilaterally which of those  documents remain under the committee's lock and key. It is like letting  only the defendant in a lawsuit decide what evidence is admissible. Let  me say that again. This is exactly like letting only the defendant in a  lawsuit decide what evidence to admit. It would be a rigged trial. That  is what is happening here.   It seems as though the Republicans are trying to rush Judge Kavanaugh  through with as little scrutiny as possible because they know there are  some troubling beliefs in his history. Think about what we already  know. Judge Kavanaugh has written opinions skeptical of our healthcare,  reproductive rights, and even the contraceptive coverage requirement.  On this issue, he is far to the right of the American people. That is  maybe why our Republican friends don't want people to know his views.  He has argued that Presidents should effectively be above the law; that  they should be immune from civil and criminal investigations while in  office; that Presidents can decline to enforce a law they deem  unconstitutional, even if a court has held it constitutional; that  Presidents should be able to reach into independent Federal agencies to  hire and fire the heads of those agencies at will. He rules almost  reflexively against actions by Federal agencies, whether it is net  neutrality, environmental protections, or dark money.   That is another one. He seems to agree with the Citizens United  decision and would seem to allow dark money--poisoning our politics,  leaving American people with little faith in government, that they will  have an influence--to have greater influence than ever.   This isn't just about allowing the Senate to review documents for the  sake of it; we need to scrutinize Judge Kavanaugh's record because his  beliefs will matter a great deal in the decades ahead, if he gets  approved, on issues ranging from healthcare, to women's reproductive  rights, to Executive power and accountability.   Rudy Giuliani, the President's lawyer, just declared that the  President may not decide to comply with a subpoena issued by the  special counsel or whomever. A court case on this matter could reach  the Supreme Court. So this isn't a hypothetical case; it is well within  the realm of possibility that the Supreme Court will have to decide  whether President Trump, who has shown so little respect for rule of  law, will have to comply with a duly issued subpoena. So it really  matters what Brett Kavanaugh thinks about this.   Before we elevate someone to the Supreme Court who may have to rule  on the issue of Presidential subpoenas, don't the Senate and American  people deserve to know what the nominee thinks? This is just one of  many reasons the Senate and the public must be able to review the  nominee's full record.   There must be a reason Republicans are so intent on hiding this  nominee's record and rushing through his confirmation. What are they  hiding? What are they hiding? What are they afraid of? I think they  realize that if the American people knew exactly how Judge Kavanaugh  felt before he became a judge, they might not want him to be there.   Republicans demanded all of Elena Kagan's documents, and Democrats  agreed to request them. Again, we have this hairsplitting argument by  the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He says: We are giving more  documents before--it is the percentage of documents that matter. Are  you seeing the whole record or only part of the record? Some people  have bigger records than others. Kagan--we Democrats in the majority,  when our Republican friends, including the Senator from Iowa, asked,  gave them the whole record. That is what we should be getting as well.   In fact, Republicans, including the distinguished majority leader,  demanded all of Judge Sotomayor's records, including documents from her  time as district attorney and even her records as a board member of the  Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund. We agreed. But now they have totally  changed the rules. And I understand. The chairman of the Judiciary  Committee is a decent man, and when he has to do things like this, he  doesn't like it. But he ought to rise to the occasion.   What they are doing is flat-out wrong. The American people deserve a  methodical and thorough examination of a nominee who will yield immense  influence over their lives for generations. The Republican majority  seems intent on denying the American people that basic right.   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  and the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  and the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  and the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I wish to recognize city court Judge  Michael F. McKeon of Auburn, NY, on his retirement from the New York  bench after 20 years of dedicated and faithful service to his community  and to his State.   Judge McKeon was born and raised in Auburn and, save for a few years  during college and law school, has lived his entire life in this  vibrant community in the heart of New York State's Finger Lakes region.   Judge McKeon has dedicated much of his professional life to public  service. After law school, he clerked for New York State Supreme Court  Justice Robert White for 7 years, and while in private practice, he  also served as corporation counsel for the city of Auburn. For 27  years, McKeon also taught criminal justice courses at Cayuga County  Community College in Auburn.   First elected as Auburn's city court judge in November 1998, Judge  McKeon quickly got to work implementing new and innovative ways of  administering justice and ensuring that those with behavioral and  addiction illnesses got access to critical treatment and support to  help turn their lives around. Under his leadership, Auburn introduced  one of the first drug treatment courts in New York State. Soon  thereafter, he founded a behavioral health court for misdemeanor and  felony offenders.   McKeon was a very active member of the Nation's drug court community  and became a sought-after resource for other judges in New York and  throughout the country looking to introduce drug courts into their  communities. With evangelists like Judge McKeon demonstrating great  successes in helping end addiction through diversion and treatment  programs, Federal funding for drug court programs reached its highest  levels in fiscal year 2017.   Judge McKeon was chosen by his peers as president of the New York  State City Court Judges Association from 2006 to 2008 and vice  president from 2002 to 2006. He continued his drug court advocacy in  these leadership roles, helping New York State become one of the  Nation's leaders in drug court adoption. In 2015, he worked with the  State legislature to pass the first cost-of-living-adjustment for State  judges in 13 years. McKeon also served as chair of the Local Codes  Advisory Committee to the chief judge of the New York State Court of  Appeals.   I congratulate Judge McKeon and his family on his well-earned  retirement, and I thank him for his outstanding service to his beloved  Auburn.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
