 Mr. President, as our Nation battles another wave of  COVID-19, I want to detail my efforts to lower barriers for Americans  to access lifesaving vaccinations against this terrible disease.   The Special Committee on Aging's investigation forced the largest  commercial health insurer in the United States to reverse course and  make whole providers who were paid far below the market rate for  administering COVID-19 vaccines. These efforts will help ensure that  every provider who can administer COVID-19 vaccines is doing so,  helping get more shots in arms.   Last year, news reports detailed how UnitedHealth had been  shortchanging pediatricians who were vaccinating children against  COVID-19. In short, Medicare set reimbursement rates for participating  providers at $40 per dose in mid-March 2021. The Federal Government  strongly recommended that private carriers do the same and most appear  to have done so within weeks, but UnitedHealth did not.   The committee's investigation found that UnitedHealth paid in-network  providers roughly 40 percent below the Medicare rate until July 1,  2021. Further, the company delayed action to make providers whole.  During the investigation, pediatricians in Pennsylvania and beyond  raised concerns that UnitedHealth's original reimbursement rate could  dissuade providers from administering the vaccine.   UnitedHealth covers 26 million people in employer and individual  market health insurance plans, with 1.4 million  [[Page S376]]  in-network providers and an estimated 14 percent market share.  UnitedHealth's decision to reimburse providers below the Medicare rate  had the potential to harm families across our Nation at a critical  juncture, just as the Food and Drug Administration prepared to expand  the availability of vaccines to children ages 5-11.   For parents with questions about vaccines, pediatricians are trusted  advisers who can play a key role in overcoming lingering concerns or  hesitancy, which remains a major issue in our Nation.   In the long term, ensuring that all hands are on deck to deliver  vaccines will help end this pandemic. Data has shown time and again  that being vaccinated against COVID-19 reduces infections, severe  disease, hospitalization, and death. Vaccinating children also will  help protect adults by increasing the number of Americans shielded from  the virus, reducing its spread. It also reduces the chance for the  virus to mutate and spawn variants, like Omicron, that has led to  another wave of illness and death. These concerns are particularly  important for older adults who are more likely than the general  population to experience both severe COVID-19 and breakthrough  infections. Vaccinating children helps protect older generations,  particularly older adults living in multigenerational households,  including more than 7 million grandparents who live with grandchildren  under the age of 18.   Providing more parents with the information they need to ensure they  are comfortable vaccinating their kids will help protect all of our  children. While pediatric hospitalizations remain relatively rare,  there has nonetheless been a significant increase of such  hospitalizations as the Omicron variant has spread in recent weeks. The  Wall Street Journal recently reported that pediatric hospitalizations  due to COVID-19 reached pandemic highs in the United States.   Vaccinating more children is essential to keep schools open for in- person learning, a live issue for schools throughout our Nation that  have been forced to return to online classes in the face of the Omicron  variant. We must do all that we can to safely keep students in the  classroom so that they can receive the high-quality education they  deserve. School closures also cause a disruption in the lives of  families, with parents often struggling to find childcare or forcing  them to take time from work. Vaccinating children will help schools  remain open, protect students and educators, and help parents stay in  the workforce.   After Aging Committee investigators reached out to UnitedHealth, the  company quickly and voluntarily committed to change course, commitments  I detailed in an October 20, 2021, letter. In response to my letter,  UnitedHealth confirmed its plans to retroactively increase  reimbursements for approximately 2 million COVID-19 vaccine  administration claims to the Medicare rate across its entire commercial  network, including individual plans on the Affordable Care Act  marketplace. On January 14, 2022, the company reported that it had  processed 1.64 million claims in connection with its commitment to the  committee--more than 99.8 percent of the affected total--at an average  cost of $14.55 per claim for a total of $23.9 million. The company  expects the remaining claims, which number less than 2,900, to be  processed by February 1, 2022.   UnitedHealth also committed to more quickly update reimbursement  rates for future emergent vaccines and therapeutics, whether for COVID- 19 or the next pandemic. The company added that it is ``redirecting  additional internal resources and automating updates whenever  possible,'' while noting that their new processes still might involve  withholding claims ``for a short time,'' which it characterized as no  longer than 30 days. On January 14, the company went further, stating  that it will implement new billing codes in a national public health  emergency ``faster than industry standard,'' while noting that it has  ``learned over the past few months the required technology and human  resources that need to be brought forward to accelerate'' adoption of  new billing codes in a public health emergency.   While lacking some details, the steps UnitedHealth has described  appear to be an appropriate response. However, UnitedHealth has not  adequately addressed an issue that a senior company official raised  when speaking with Aging Committee investigators in September, that the  company's size and numerous claims systems presented a barrier to  quickly updating COVID-19 vaccine reimbursement rates in the first  place. In its responses to subsequent questions about the issue from  committee staff, UnitedHealth has cited reasons such as contracting  language for the delay, but has failed to provide additional  information or explanation in their written responses. The fact that a  senior UnitedHealth official told the committee that the company's size  negatively affected the quality and efficiency of its interactions with  the market is concerning and a matter that deserves continued oversight  from Congress and regulators.   In recent weeks, the world has been upended by the Omicron variant.  Case rates have skyrocketed, and hospitals are once again filling up,  primarily with people who have not gotten a COVID-19 vaccine or  booster. In order to leave the tragedy, the disruptions and the  closures of the pandemic behind, every person who can be vaccinated has  a duty to the country to roll up their sleeves and get the shot.   We will continue to learn more about the Omicron variant and variants  to come. However, there is one thing about this variant, past variants,  and future variants that will not change: The key to ending this  pandemic is getting more people vaccinated.   I remain committed to removing future roadblocks that may emerge to  widespread vaccination against COVID-19.   This body should do the same.   In closing, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the  following documents: a September 3, 2021 Modern Healthcare article  detailing UnitedHealth's under reimbursement for COVID-19 vaccines  compared to most other major carriers; my October 20, 2021 letter to  UnitedHealth; UnitedHealth's November 5, 2021 response to my letter; a  November 12, 2021 supplement to the company's original response; and a  January 14, 2022 email from UnitedHealth providing further updates.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From Modern Healthcare, Sept. 3, 2021]     UnitedHealthcare Pays Providers Below Standard Rates for COVID-19                                  Vaccines                              (By Nona Tepper)         Pediatricians across the country are claiming the nation's       largest insurer is shortchanging them for administering       COVID-19 vaccines, jeopardizing access to the main tool for       stopping the virus' spread.        The American Academy of Pediatrics has fielded complaints       from providers nationwide who are frustrated that       UnitedHealth Group is paying about 50% of the federal rate       for vaccine administration, said Dr. Sue Kressly, who chairs       the AAP's payment advocacy advisory committee and runs       Pennsylvania-based Kressly Pediatrics. While UnitedHealthcare       is not legally required to pay the federal rate, Kressly said       the Minnetonka, Minnesota-based insurer is the only national       carrier that has not agreed to pay at least $40 for vaccine       administration.        The insurer also continues to pay pediatricians and family       medicine providers below-market rates for COVID-19 tests,       Kressly said, an issue the New York Times revealed in       February.        With new variants of COVID-19 continuing to emerge, Kressly       worried that low fees for testing and vaccine administration       would lead some doctors to stop offering these services,       worsening the public health crisis, increasing medical costs       and inspiring more independent practices to shutter,       particularly as providers struggle with overwork during the       pandemic.        ``They had record-breaking profits in 2020, and we       struggled with getting them to pay adequately for COVID       testing. That still not been resolved,'' Kressly said. ``Now       pediatricians who are giving the vaccine to people covered by       UnitedHealthcare, they're effectively opening their wallet,       and subsidizing that patient to get the vaccine.''        At the end of the company's most recent second quarter on       June 30, UnitedHealthcare generated $55.5 billion in revenue,       up 13% from the $49.1 billion reported during the same period       last year. The company counted more than 49.6 million       enrollees, an increase of 1.2 million year-over-year.       Meanwhile, the insurer's low vaccine reimbursement rates       threaten the future of family practices, Kressly said. Unlike       most medical services, federal legislation bars providers       from balance billing patients for the COV[0-19 vaccine.        ``If we don't at least make enough money to cover our       costs, then we won't be here as practices to serve the       community beyond the  [[Page S377]]       public health emergency,'' Kressly said. ``That's a bigger       problem.''        UnitedHealthcare is not the only payer offering clinicians       low fees for vaccine administration--some regional plans and       employers are also paying below the federal rate, Kressly       said. But she said these payers are likely just slow to react       to payment standards. In March, the Centers for Medicare and       Medicaid Services nearly doubled what it was paying providers       for giving the vaccine, after the American Medical       Association found the previous rate did not cover the costs       associated with administering the shot. Most of these payers       are just confused about the update and, when Kressly reaches       out to them, she said they generally immediately increase       their rate. But UnitedHealthcare has refused to increase what       it is paying pediatricians.        ``They say, `Our fee schedule is our fee schedule, it's up       to the contract that the practice has with UnitedHealthcare,       let them try to have the conversation,' '' Kressly said.        UnitedHealthcare, for its part, said it recently offered to       increase reimbursement for COVID-19 testing for some       pediatric and family medicine practices that met specific       criteria. When it comes to vaccines, UnitedHealthcare said it       is continually reviewing its reimbursement rates.        Dr. George Rogu, president of the Independent Pediatric       Collaborative of Long Island and head of RBK Pediatrics,       hopes to be one of the providers paid more for giving       UnitedHealthcare enrollees COVID-19 vaccines.        When Rogu reached out to the insurer last month. a       UnitedHealthcare customer service representative blamed his       low rates on his different customers' plans and the different       fee schedules associated with each. The customer service       representative said Rogu was the first provider to complain       about the matter and offered to refer his case to the       company's management team.        ``We cannot in good conscience say, `Oh, we can't give you       the vaccine because you have UnitedHealthcare.' That's not       right,'' Rogu said. ``It's just not humanely right. But       people that have a large panel of UnitedHealthcare customers?       It's killing them.''        Rogu said he is still waiting to hear back from the       insurer.        He said he noticed that he was being paid below the federal       rates in May and asked New York-based Canid Vaccines, his       vaccine administration software system, about the problem.       The startup verified that UnitedHealthcare reimbursed him at       about half the rate that other insurers did. Canid Vaccines       said it has identified at least 25 independent practices       representing more than 350 providers nationwide that       UnitedHealthcare is paying at less than the federal rate.        Among pediatric circles, UnitedHealthcare is often referred       to as the ``evil empire'' since they are the least       transparent and least cooperative among the major insurers,       said Dr. Peter Pogacar, vice president of the Rhode Island       chapter of the AAP and a pediatrician at East Greenwich       Pediatrics. He said UnitedHealthcare is underpaying       physicians for COVID-19 vaccine administration there too.        ``Healthcare should be about healing with business as a       sideshow, not the main event,'' Pogacar wrote in an email.        The insurer isn't just offering low rates for administering       the COVID-19 vaccine. UnitedHealthcare has also reimbursed       providers for less than what it cost them to purchase COVID-      19 testing kits. After significant media attention, the       manufacturer and distributor of the tests dropped their       prices so that providers were no longer losing money when       they were paid UnitedHealthcare rates, said Dr. Reshma       Chugani, a pediatrician at the Atlanta Children's Clinical       Center. The insurer also announced it would increase the rate       paid for the tests, as well as allow pediatricians to       resubmit patient claims, she said. But they are still not       offering to reimburse providers for tests previously paid at       below-market rates.        ``We lost money on every United patient,'' Chugani said.        Additionally, the insurer has made it difficult for       providers to recoup the money it said it owes them, forcing       them to go through multiple administrative layers and still       failing to reimburse one type of test at the full rate, said       AAP's Kressly. She said she talked to UnitedHealthcare about       this issue two weeks ago and that it has still not been       resolved.        ``They've put barriers for us to have to act when we have       no time, energy or resources to do so,'' she said.                                   ____                                                   October 20, 2021.      Sir Andrew Witty,      Chief Executive Officer,      UnitedHealth Group.        Dear Sir Andrew: I write in regard to commitments       UnitedHealth Group (UnitedHealth) made to the U.S. Senate       Special Committee on Aging related to reimbursement policies       for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines. UnitedHealth's       past policies appeared to have created access barriers for       children seeking COVID-19 vaccination from their primary care       pediatrician--barriers that affected younger and older       Americans alike. I appreciate the company's decision to       reprocess certain COVID-19 vaccine claims, which I expect       will facilitate the broadest possible access to COVID-19       vaccines among UnitedHealth's members. I expect that the       steps UnitedHealth has committed to take will help children       seeking COVID-19 vaccines as well as older Americans under       the purview of the Aging Committee, including the millions       who live with and care for their grandchildren or other       younger relatives. I appreciate your company's assurance that       UnitedHealth will keep the Aging Committee updated on its       progress toward expeditiously resolving the concerns raised       with the company.        The Aging Committee's attention was drawn to this issue by       press reports highlighting that during a four-month period       earlier this year, UnitedHealth reimbursed pediatricians at       rates that failed to meet the costs of administering COVID-19       vaccines. During that time, other large insurers reportedly       reimbursed pediatricians and other health care providers at a       higher rate, in line with what the Centers for Medicare &       Medicaid Services (CMS) set in March 2021. Pediatricians       raised concerns that UnitedHealth's low reimbursement rates       would deter in-network providers from administering COVID-19       vaccines, creating barriers for patients. The additional       costs of administering COVID-19 vaccines have been       significant for providers, a point that CMS noted at the time       it increased reimbursement rates, citing ``updated       information about the costs involved in administering the       COVID-19 vaccine for different types of providers and       suppliers and the additional resources you need to safely and       appropriately administer the vaccine.'' The agency       furthermore encouraged private payers to follow suit, noting       that ``in light of CMS's increased Medicare payment rates,       CMS will expect commercial carriers to continue to ensure       that their rates are reasonable in comparison to prevailing       market rates.'' Given UnitedHealth's status as the Nation's       largest commercial payer--with 26 million people enrolled in       employer and individual plans, 1.4 million in-network       providers and an estimated 14 percent market share--it is       critical that the company do all it can to ensure that       vaccines are available to every person that is eligible to       receive one. To that end, the Aging Committee requested that       UnitedHealth provide information about the company's       reimbursement rates, the timeliness of future fee schedule       updates and the company's progress toward making providers       whole for vaccines they administered while UnitedHealth was       reimbursing below reimbursement rates set by CMS.        The ongoing effort to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates       across our Nation demands an all-hands-on-deck approach.       Ensuring that all eligible children are vaccinated against       COVID-19 is key to improving the overall vaccination rate,       which will better protect older Americans by helping stem the       spread of the virus. Such efforts are of particular       importance ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)       expected consideration of COVID-19 vaccines for young       children later this month. Older Americans have been among       those hit hardest by COVID-19 and face the greatest health       risks if they contract the disease, even after being       vaccinated. Recognizing the elevated risk of breakthrough       infections in older adults, the Biden administration recently       authorized third doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for       people ages 65 and over. The serious health risks COVID-19       poses for older adults are especially acute for those living       in multi-generation households, including more than 7 million       grandparents who live with grandchildren under the age of 18.       Those older Americans are at even greater risk of exposure       when they live with unvaccinated individuals, an important       consideration given the greater impact of the delta variant       on children. The current wave of COVID-19 has led to higher       pediatric case rates, record pediatric hospitalizations and       school closures that have affected more than 900,000 students       at 1,800 schools across 44 states in August and September       alone.        During calls in September with Aging Committee staff,       UnitedHealth officials confirmed press accounts that reported       a months-long period when the company was reimbursing       providers up to 40 percent less for COVID-19 vaccine       administration than the rate set by the CMS. While other       major payers reportedly adopted the reimbursement rate set by       CMS swiftly, UnitedHealth continued reimbursing at a lower       rate until the end of June. During conversations with staff,       UnitedHealth reported that it had problems uploading the CMS       rate to the company's various fee schedules. Aging Committee       staff have heard concerns from providers that the       reimbursement issues pediatricians experienced with       UnitedHealth earlier this year could resurface when the FDA       authorizes a COVID-19 vaccine for 5-11 year-olds, which will       carry a different billing code.        Following the concerns raised by the Aging Committee last       month, UnitedHealth informed Aging Committee staff during a       call on October 6 that the company planned to address the       concerns outlined above. Specifically, UnitedHealth committed       to reprocessing all of its commercial claims--not just       pediatric claims--from the time CMS issued new rates for       COVID-19 vaccines in mid-March to the time United updated its       fee schedule on July 1. Company officials further stated that       United Health would reprocess the claims automatically and       that providers would not be required to resubmit claims for       reprocessing. Noting that the company expected to reprocess       ``millions'' of claims that  [[Page S378]]       were submitted by providers during the three-and-a-half month       period prior to July 1, UnitedHealth officials told Aging       Committee staff that they hoped to make ``significant       progress'' within 30-45 days. Company officials further       committed to:        1. Review UnitedHealth's claims process to minimize delays       in making payments to providers for COVID-19 vaccines;        2. Verify that there are no similar underpayment issues in       its Affordable Care Act Exchange and Medicaid Managed Care       books of business: and        3. Provide updates to Aging Committee staff on the       company's progress toward meeting these goals.        As part of these updates, please also provide me with the       following information no later than November 5, 2021:        1. How many claims does UnitedHealth expect to reprocess       for COVID-19 vaccinations that were administered prior to       July 1, 2021? What was the average difference between the       initial reimbursement and the reprocessed claim? What was the       total amount that UnitedHealth paid to providers to settle       these claims at the CMS rates?        2. UnitedHealth told Aging Committee staff that it is       difficult to quickly update its reimbursement rates when new       vaccine billing codes and rates are issued by CMS.       UnitedHealth further stated that its expected solution for       this issue may involve delaying payments to providers to give       the company's payment systems time to reflect new codes and       rates. In order to minimize access delays in the future, what       steps is UnitedHealth taking to ensure that pediatricians and       other providers will be reimbursed in a timely manner when       CMS issues new rates for COVID-19 vaccines or other emergent       vaccines and therapeutics in the future?        Thank you for your attention to this important issue. If       you or your staff has questions, please contact Peter       Gartrell, Chief Investigator for Chairman Casey.            Sincerely,                                           Robert P. Casey, Jr.,                                                           Chairman,      U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging.                                   ____                                                   November 5, 2021.      Chairman Bob Casey,      U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Casey: On behalf of UnitedHealth Group,       including our over 120,000 frontline doctors, nurses, and       other health care practitioners, thank you for your recent       letter regarding retroactive payment for COVID-19 vaccine       administration. Like many individuals and families,       clinicians and essential health workers have sacrificed       deeply these past two years as our country worked together to       fight COVID-19.        We share your commitment to ensuring and expanding access       to critically important health care services and understand       these are extraordinarily challenging times for the millions       of people we are privileged to serve, as well as employers,       health care providers, governments, and the health care       system. We welcome this opportunity to provide you with an       overview of the significant actions we have voluntarily taken       regarding vaccine reimbursement and the steps we are taking       to quickly address the concerns expressed.        UnitedHealth Group is committed to helping people live       healthier lives and making the health care system work better       for everyone. We do this by working with stakeholders and       partners to address the biggest challenges facing our system.       As we shared during our conversation, we have been in close       contact with the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding       concerns they raised about vaccine reimbursement.        Consistent with the discussion with your staff on October       6th and your October 21st letter, we are writing to confirm       the following details related to our reimbursement for COVID-      19 vaccine administration:        UnitedHealthcare (UHC) has been reimbursing providers using       the new CMS rates since July 1, 2021, consistent with timing       specified in UHC's contracts with providers.        UHC will adjust claims paid less than $40 between March 15       and June 30, 2021 to reimburse at $40 per administration, so       providers can benefit from the increase CMS announced on       March 15, 2021.        The voluntary retroactive reimbursement changes are in       process and claims will be adjusted accordingly. Providers       will not need to take action to receive the change in       reimbursement.        UnitedHealth Group recognizes the important role that       reimbursement plays in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic,       which is why we are taking action to adjust previous claims       and accelerating our processes to update reimbursement rates       when changes are announced by CMS. In your letter dated       October 21, 2021, you asked for the following information:        The number of COVID-19 vaccine administration claims UHC       expects to reprocess.        The average difference between the initial reimbursement       and the reprocessed claim.        The total amount that will be reimbursed.        Information on how we will ensure providers will be       reimbursed in a timely manner when CMS issues new rates for       COVID-19 vaccine claims going forward.        Approximately two million COVID-19 vaccine administration       claims paid between March 15 and June 30, 2021 will be       impacted by this retroactive adjustment. We anticipate the       average adjustment will be approximately $12.50 per claim,       for total additional reimbursement of approximately $25       million. UHC has already begun processing these       reimbursements.        With regard to new rates for COVID-19 vaccinations or other       emergent therapeutics for COVID-19, we will be accelerating       our process for updating our reimbursement to support the       COVID-19 vaccine codes and rates implemented by CMS as they       become available. Specifically, UHC will implement new COVID-      19 codes and rates upon the publication of this information       by CMS rather than including these changes in our scheduled       quarterly reimbursement update processes. This will ensure       provider payments are updated as quickly as possible.        We appreciate the services provided by health care       professionals during the pandemic. The actions we are taking       to adjust COVID-19 vaccine claims build on the many steps we       have taken to support providers over the last eighteen       months, including accelerating claims payments, assisting in       processing and administering CARES Act Federal funding to       providers, working with HHS to ensure clinicians who provided       COVID-19 testing or treatment for individuals without       insurance were reimbursed for their services, and removing       administrative requirements in highly impacted areas.        We appreciate the opportunity to address the Committee's       questions.            Sincerely,                                                    Brian Thompson,      CEO, UnitedHealthcare.                                   ____                                                  November 12. 2021.      Addendum to UHG--Senate Aging Committee Response on 11/5/21         Thank you for the email of November 8, 2021 with follow-up       questions to UHG's letter dated 11/5/2021, and for your       continued engagement regarding how we reimburse providers for       COVID-19 vaccine administration. Please see our additional       responses below:        Staff asked that we clarify whether ``similar underpayment       issues occurred in United's Affordable Care Act and Medicaid       Managed Care plans.''        Answer: As discussed with staff, we have been paying       providers according to their contracts since the vaccines       first became available. These provider contracts explicitly       provide how new procedure codes are implemented and on what       timeline; those provisions are agreed to by all parties.       Because United paid its network providers according to these       contracts, there have been no ``underpayments.''       Nevertheless, after reviewing concerns about the contracted       reimbursement amounts paid earlier this year, we elected to       voluntarily increase reimbursement--above and beyond       contractual rates--for all commercial plans (including       individual plans purchased via ACA exchanges), for dates of       service between March 15, 2021 and June 30, 2021.        Within ACA Exchanges, we similarly have paid according to       contracts agreed to with providers. ACA Exchange plans will       be included in the voluntary increase in reimbursement       described above. The completion of that increase will be on       the same time frame as commercial plans. With respect to       managed Medicaid, as we noted in our first discussion with       staff on September 22, 2021, those plans pay according to       rates set by state law and state payment policies. United has       paid for vaccine administration consistent with those       parameters and will continue to do so.        Staff asked that we provide detail about how we will timely       reimburse providers for emergent vaccines and therapeutics       unrelated to COVID-19 and the current Public Health Emergency       (PHE).        Answer: In the event of a future pandemic or new PHE we       will take immediate actions (noted below) to accelerate       reimbursement updates. Outside of a pandemic or PHE how we       update codes and payment rates will continue to be guided by       our existing contracts with providers. Consistent with       industry practice, those contracts provide for timely and       substantial payment to providers while we complete the update       to our systems. At all times we will follow all applicable       state and federal requirements.        Staff noted the complexity of adjusting reimbursement rates       for new procedure codes and asked for details on how United       might make those adjustments more quickly in the future.        Answer: We hope that under less exigent circumstances CMS       will provide additional lead time for its pronouncements, but       United is not relying on that to speed its processes during       this PHE. Instead, we are devoting significant time and       effort to ensuring that the process of updating new COVID-19-      related codes within our systems begins at the time of       publication of those codes and without regard to contractual       timelines. This includes, for example, redirecting additional       internal resources and automating updates whenever possible.       While some claims filed immediately after new payment codes       are announced might be held for a short time while those       updates are being made (generally no longer than 30 days       after receipt), we believe this will result in overall faster       reimbursement at updated rates. Indeed, it is common in the       industry to hold claims during a period of change or       uncertainty to help ensure that those claims are paid       accurately. We are confident we will be able to update new       codes for all claims platforms on a timely basis.        Finally, staff asked for updates as to our progress on       increasing the reimbursement amount for the approximately two       million claims impacted by our decision to voluntarily       increase reimbursement for COVID-19 vaccine administration.        Answer: To date, we have resolved approximately 60% of       these claims. We expect the  [[Page S379]]       remaining claims to be completed in the coming 6-8 weeks. We       will update you when all claims are complete.                                   ____       From: Prible, John M.      To: Gartrell, Peter (Aging)      Cc: Hartman, Doug (Aging); Shakow, Peter      Subject: RE: Follow Up on UnitedHealthcare's Response      Date: Friday, January 14, 2022 5:12:29 PM         Peter, thank you for your recent email, in which you asked       for an update on our voluntary efforts to retroactively       increase reimbursement to $40 for COVID-19 vaccine       administration. Answers to your questions are provided below;       however, we expect that this confidential information will       not be shared with third parties.        To date, we have retroactively reimbursed providers for       1,640,996 claims, or more than 99.8% of all affected claims.       The average additional payment for those claims was $14.55,       for a total of approximately $23.9 million in additional       payments. At this time, fewer than 2,900 claims (less than       0.2% percent of all affected claims) remain to be       reprocessed. Because the original paid amount on those       remaining claims averaged about $36, the average additional       reimbursement to be paid will be about $4. Those remaining       reimbursements continue to be prioritized and sent out the       door. We anticipate those few remaining claims will be       completed by February 1, 2022.        We note that you asked for claims and payment data by       state. There are a few reasons we are not able to cut this       data cleanly by state, including that providers submit claims       via tax identification numbers (TIN), many of which cover       physicians (and therefore claims) from multiple states.        You also asked for additional information about how we will       shorten the adoption time of new rates in this or a future       national public health emergency (NPHE). As we stated       previously, contracts between United and its network provider       groups specifically provide for time to implement new rates       in an orderly way. We understand this to be routine across       the industry, understood and long accepted by the provider       community, and entirely proper. If there is another NPHE or       there are exceptional circumstances which dictate more timely       adoption of new rates, we have learned over the past few       months the required technology and human resources that need       to be brought forward to accelerate. As a point of reference,       should circumstances justify it, we commit to implement new       codes in an NPHE faster than industry standard.
