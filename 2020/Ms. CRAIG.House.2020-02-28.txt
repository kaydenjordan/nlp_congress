 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his time and  especially for his leadership on this issue.   The tobacco industry has targeted our kids for too long, and we have  a moral responsibility to act. E-cigarette usage among middle and high  school students is a public health crisis. The industry's targeting of  our children has resulted in the highest rate of tobacco usage in 20  years as a new generation is addicted to nicotine.   It is all disguised by the 15,000 flavors, like mint, mango, and  cotton candy, developed to cover up the unpleasant harshness affiliated  with tobacco use.   This is absolutely unacceptable. As a mother, I have survived middle  school four times with four sons, and three have now finished high  school. I have  [[Page H1265]]  seen how rampant and widespread vaping has become in our Nation's  schools. Parents and schools need our help.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I must stand up to the industries  responsible for this epidemic. Public health--more importantly, our  children's health--depends on it.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support and urge my colleagues to support  this bill.
