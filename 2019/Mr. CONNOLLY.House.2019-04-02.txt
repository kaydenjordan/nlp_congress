 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 540) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 770 Ayrault Road in Fairport, New York, as the  ``Louise and Bob Slaughter Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 540         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LOUISE AND BOB SLAUGHTER POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 770 Ayrault Road in Fairport, New York,       shall be known and designated as the ``Louise and Bob       Slaughter Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Louise and Bob Slaughter Post Office''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 540, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 770 Ayrault Road in Fairport, New York, as the ``Louise and  Bob Slaughter Post Office''.   Representative Louise Slaughter was a groundbreaking Member of this  House. She served here for 32 years. She was the first female  chairwoman of the Rules Committee, and she coauthored the landmark  Violence Against Women Act. She was also a dear friend.   Born in Harlan County, Kentucky, in 1929, Louise Slaughter was the  daughter of a blacksmith. After graduating from high school, she went  on to earn a bachelor's degree in microbiology and a master's degree in  public health, both from the University of Kentucky.   After moving to upstate New York and marrying her beloved husband,  Bob, Louise became active in local community groups and, eventually, in  politics. She served a number of years in local elected offices and in  the New York State Assembly.   Louise was first elected to Congress in 1986, where she eventually  rose to become the top Democrat on the powerful Rules Committee.  Tragically and very sadly, Louise died in March of last year, and she  is sorely missed by all of us.   Naming a post office in her honor in her hometown of Fairport, New  York, is maybe the least we could and should do to honor the  distinguished career in public service of this remarkable woman.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, on a personal note, Louise Slaughter was an  extraordinary Member of this body. She had a marvelous sense of humor.  She was an encyclopedia about the procedures of the Rules Committee,  which often mystified many of us. Her heart was in the cause every day.   The last few years she was here were tough. She lost her beloved Bob  very suddenly, and she struggled with a lot of health issues in the  last year of her life. None of it left her daunted.                                time  1545    She faced every day with an indomitable spirit and will, a commitment  to her values and to fighting for her constituents and for those  values.   This is the least we can do to honor Louise Slaughter and her  husband, Bob. I hope we can do more as we progress, but it is an honor  to have served with Louise, and it is a privilege to manage this bill  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 829) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 1450 Montauk Highway in Mastic, New York, as the  ``Army Specialist Thomas J. Wilwerth Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 829         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ARMY SPECIALIST THOMAS J. WILWERTH POST OFFICE                     BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 1450 Montauk Highway in Mastic, New York,       shall be known and designated as the ``Army Specialist Thomas       J. Wilwerth Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Army Specialist Thomas J. Wilwerth Post       Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 829 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 1450 Montauk Highway in Mastic, New York, as the Army  Specialist Thomas J. Wilwerth Post Office Building.   Army Specialist Wilwerth's life was defined by a call to service.  While still a junior in high school, Thomas felt the call to serve his  country in the years after 9/11, and he made the decision to join the  Army to defend his country.   After finishing his senior year, during which he also served in the  Army Reserves, Thomas was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division based  out of Fort Carson, Colorado.   In December 2005, Thomas was deployed to Iraq, and he served  selflessly with his division as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. While  on deployment, he was tragically taken from us on February 22, 2006,  when an improvised explosive device detonated near his Bradley Fighting  Vehicle.   At just 21 years of age, Thomas' tragic death serves to remind us all  of the human cost of war. He demonstrated in his short life, Mr.  Speaker, the kind of commitment and service to this great country that  is an example to all of us.   Naming a post office in his honor in his hometown of Mastic, New  York, is the least we can do as a country to honor and remember a young  man who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Zeldin indicated, there is nothing  we can do, not this action, that can really make up for the loss of a  loved one, even in the time of war. But we can, as a grateful Nation,  explain our appreciation and gratitude for the ultimate sacrifice that  was made, and that is what we are doing today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 725) to change the address of the postal facility designated  in honor of Captain Humayun Khan.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 725         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CAPTAIN HUMAYUN KHAN POST OFFICE.         Section 1(a) of Public Law 115-347 (132 Stat. 5054) is       amended by striking ``180 McCormick Road'' and inserting       ``2150 Wise Street''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues today in  consideration of S. 725, a bill to change the address of the postal  facility designated in honor of Captain Humayun Khan. Captain Khan was  an extraordinary military officer and an American hero who lived in  this country since he was 2 years old.   Mr. Khan represented the best of what it means to be an American.  Growing up, he was captivated with the writings of Thomas Jefferson and  his writings on freedom. It was at the school Jefferson founded, the  University of Virginia, that Mr. Khan learned to put those ideas into  practice. There, he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.   After graduation, Mr. Khan put his dreams of becoming a lawyer on  hold to serve the American people on Active Duty in Iraq.   On June 8, 2004, while serving with the 201st Battalion of the 1st  Infantry Division, tragically, Captain Khan was killed. While visiting  the Guard personnel on his day off, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Khan was killed by  an improvised bomb outside Forward Operating Base Warhorse.   It is to honor the life and memory of Captain Khan that we today  dedicate this post office in Charlottesville, the home of his alma  mater and the beginning of his distinguished military service, in his  name.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from West Virginia. I  [[Page H2972]]  think this is an important honor, and it is an important technical  correction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
