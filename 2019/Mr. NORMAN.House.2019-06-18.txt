 Madam Chair, I rise today because I have an amendment at  the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   This amendment would establish a pilot program that would allow an  expeditionary sea base, ESB, to be equipped with weaponry to defend  itself.   This pilot program is needed because, currently, an ESB must be  accompanied by a destroyer when on a mission. To deploy a destroyer,  operational costs add up to $33 million.   If the $7.5 million pilot program--which is the cost--is passed, then  this expeditionary sea base will be able to protect itself and a  destroyer will no longer be required to accompany it, allowing the  destroyer to complete other missions.   This pilot program does not mean the ESB will go out actively using  its weaponry. Rather, the intent of this program would be to free up  the destroyer for other missions without leaving an ESB defenseless.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I would just say, this is a return on  investment. This is a good investment that will save this country a lot  of money with its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.
