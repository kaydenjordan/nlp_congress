 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the fact here of striking the last word. I  rise in opposition to amendment 36, which was en bloc.   Despite the description of this amendment, it would actually reduce  broadband competition, if adopted, with tremendous negatives for my  district and many others.   It also frustrates broadband deployment, an important thing right  now.   By requiring network sharing in multi-tenant buildings, there is less  of an incentive for network operators to build out or make upgrades to  their networks.   More importantly, nothing in the FCC's order that is the subject of  this amendment would prevent State and local efforts from increasing  access to multi-tenant environments. Rather, the Commission would  clarify that those efforts should be consistent with Federal policy.   This amendment also raises safety concerns. Technicians from varying  broadband providers would be required to service the same facilities in  a shared setting, and this could lead to unknown or unsafe environments  for these workers.   This amendment could also disincentivize build-out.   This amendment would prevent the preemption of an outlier San  Francisco ordinance which requires the sharing of in-use wiring in  apartment complexes, office buildings, and other similar buildings  between providers.                                time  1315    For years, the FCC has been promoting facility-based competition to  bring broadband to unserved Americans. Meanwhile, the Commission has  forborne from the vast majority of the legacy competitive carrier  provisions of the Communications Act because they did not work. We  shouldn't be trying to re-create them on a local level.
