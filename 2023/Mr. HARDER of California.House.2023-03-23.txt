 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, frankly,  I am angry.   This week, D.C. Republicans' hypocrisy is on full display. At the  same time they push a bill they claim supports parents, they are  slashing funding for critical programs that countless parents depend  on.   My daughter Lillian just turned one, and as one of the few people in  this Chamber who has changed a diaper recently, I am tired.   Republicans can't claim to be the party of parents when, in the same  breath, they are gutting childcare and education funding. They can't  claim to be the party of parents when they focus more on banning books  than teaching kids to read.   Our kids really are struggling right now. It is time Congressional  Republicans put aside their political tantrums and actually do  something to help. Better yet, get out of the way and let us parents  get it done.                            ____________________
