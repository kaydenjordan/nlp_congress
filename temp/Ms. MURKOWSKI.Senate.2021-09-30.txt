 Mr. President, there has been a lot of impassioned  words about a nominee that we will have before us in just a matter of  less than an hour, Tracy Stone-Manning. Know that I join my colleagues  in the concerns that they have expressed, as we look to those  individuals that we asked to take the helm of some of these very  important Agencies--Agencies, as my colleague from Alaska has pointed  out--that have extraordinary impact on the activities and the actions  that go on in our State. We need to have only the highest caliber of  men and women. And in what we have seen, the background that we have  seen with this particular nominee, I would hope, would shock us all.   And so as we move forward with this nomination process and consider  the impact to, again, not just an Agency, not just to a department, but  the impact that then comes to our communities, our States, the people  who we work for, it is only appropriate and fitting that we speak to  the issues that we have learned of; we speak to the truth of the  matter; and the truth of the matter is that this nominee is not an  individual who should be in this position.
