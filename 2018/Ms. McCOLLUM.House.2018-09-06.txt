 Madam Speaker, I have a motion to instruct conferees at  the desk.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, this motion would instruct conferees to use a  provision from the Senate Interior Appropriations bill that guarantees  full funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program. The Payment in  Lieu of Taxes program--or PILT, as I will refer to it from now on-- provides Federal payments to local governments to help offset the loss  of property taxes due to nontransferable Federal lands within their  boundaries.   Since local governments cannot tax Federal lands, PILT payments help  defray the cost for maintaining vital community services, such as  police and fire protection and construction of schools and roads in  many cases. It also provides much-needed search and rescue operations.   To date, including fiscal year 2018 payments, approximately $8.5  billion in payments have been made to local units of government. These  payments are a vital lifeline for communities across this country.   Originally, PILT was part of the discretionary appropriations  process; but often, Congress failed to provide enough funding for our  counties and they ended up being shortchanged. To stop this from  happening and to correct the problem, the program was made mandatory.  However, Congress has failed to authorize the PILT program, so we are  back to funding PILT through the Interior Appropriations bill.   Funding PILT through the discretionary appropriations process creates  uncertainty and unpredictability for local governments across this  country. Why? Because the amount available to be appropriated for PILT  is constrained by the 302(b) allocation provided in the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. And with less than a 1  percent funding increase for 2018 and 2019, it just goes to show that  the Interior allocation cannot continue to keep pace with the rising  cost of PILT.   At the same time, we need to meet other important obligations in the  Interior bill, such as providing healthcare for Native Americans and  Alaskan Natives, addressing the backlog of deferred maintenance on  Federal lands, and maintaining our national parks, only to name a few.   In the past 25 years, PILT has grown from $103 million to $553  million in fiscal year '18. The estimate for this year is again going  to exceed $500 million.   I agree with our local units of government; PILT should be funded as  a permanent mandatory program. But with the reauthorizers not having  completed their work, the next best thing we can do is to pass this  motion to guarantee full funding for our counties.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this commonsense motion,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's reluctance in opposing  this because the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program is a nonpartisan  issue and it is something that the Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee has been struggling with over our allocations,  and it is something, as I bring up, that the Senate has in their bill,  something which I think is a good idea and should be discussed. I look  forward to further discussions on this, as well as with the other  conference committee the chairman and I serve on, Madam Speaker.   But we have a precedent for using this provision. In fact, it a  fiscal year 2018 enacted bill. This provision would simply ensure that  100 percent of the PILT payments will be made even if the cost exceeds  the cost of the Interior Department's original estimate.   So this is a backstop. This is a guarantee. We still need the  authorizers to do their work, but this is to make sure that we don't  shortchange any of the other important programs that we fund in the  Interior bill. So in my opinion, this is a commonsense issue, and I  would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on that.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his comments and look forward  to going to conference and completing our goal together.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 187,  nays 218, not voting 24, as follows:  [[Page H7896]]                                    [Roll No. 388]                                 YEAS--187       Adams      Aguilar      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Boyle, Brendan F.
