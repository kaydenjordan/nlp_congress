 Mr. President, for months--for months--over 300 general  and flag officer nominations have been indefinitely delayed because of  the holds of the senior Senator from Alabama, and the consequences are  mounting.   As war continues in the Middle East, the Senator's holds have  prevented the swift confirmation of the commander of the Navy's 5th  Fleet and the deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command, both vital  for our operations in that region of the world. The Senator continues  his holds even as U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have been attacked two  dozen times in the last 2 weeks.   At one point this summer, the Senator's holds meant that for the  first time ever--ever--all three branches of the military operated  simultaneously without confirmed leadership. And now the U.S. Marine  Corps is suddenly without a leader due to illness, but because of the  Senator's holds, there is no No. 2 in place to step in.   And it will get much worse for our military if the Senator continues  his recklessness. The Pentagon says that by the end of this year, up to  three-quarters--of the generals and admirals in the Defense Department  will be affected by Senator Tuberville's holds.   Let me say that again. The Pentagon recently estimated that by the  end of this year, up to three-quarters of the generals and admirals in  the Defense Department will be affected by Senator Tuberville's  reckless, reckless holds.   Patience is wearing thin on both sides of the aisle over the  Senator's antics. Last night, a group of our Republican colleagues  tried to confirm many of our military nominees by consent. For 4 hours,  late into the evening, our colleagues moved from one nominee to the  other, and the Senator from Alabama brazenly stood there and objected  to each one.   Democrats and Republicans alike have tried to reason with the Senator  from Alabama, offering him one solution for compromise after the other,  but every step he has refused to cooperate.   So 2 days ago, Chairman Reed of the Senate Armed Services Committee  introduced a resolution that will allow the Senate to quickly confirm  the  [[Page S5322]]  nominees currently being blocked by the Senator from Alabama. This  resolution was referred to the Rules Committee, and, when the time  comes, I will bring it to the floor of the Senate for consideration. If  we can't solve this problem another way, we will all have to vote to  move these nominees forward.   We will work with our Republican colleagues in good faith to move  this resolution forward because most of us want these holds on our  military leaders to come to an end quickly. Our military deserves  better. Our servicemembers deserve better. Their spouses and their kids  and their entire families deserve better. These holds must not  continue. We will work to move this resolution, and I hope to see  bipartisan support so we can finally get these hundreds of nominees  appointed to their posts.   In the meantime, the Senate will move forward on three critical  senior military nominees here on the floor. We will vote to confirm the  nomination of Lieutenant General Mahoney to be the second in command at  the U.S. Marine Corps. As I mentioned, Lieutenant General Mahoney's  confirmation has become a top priority for the Senate after the  Commandant of the Marines, Gen. Eric Smith, was unexpectedly  hospitalized after a serious medical emergency. We pray for the  General's recovery and for his family.   We will also vote to confirm ADM Lisa Franchetti to be the next Chief  of Naval Operations. Admiral Franchetti's confirmation will mark a  significant milestone in our military's history. Once confirmed,  Admiral Franchetti will be the first woman ever to lead the U.S. Navy.   I am proud to say she is a Rochester, NY, native, and a graduate of  Pittsford Mendon High School.   Admiral Franchetti is an exceptional leader with a distinguished  career serving our Nation. I am confident she has the experience, the  skills, and the vision to succeed as the U.S. Navy's top officer.   Finally, we will vote to confirm the nomination of Gen. David Allvin  to be Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force.   Both parties must work together--work together--to ensure that our  military is fully staffed and fully equipped to defend the American  people at any time, but particularly at this time of crisis, and that  begins by confirming these vital nominations today.
