 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the  Bloomington Jefferson High School cheerleaders for their national  championship victory. This season the team looked to replicate their  historic success, having won five State titles and two national  championships in just the past five seasons.   The team qualified for the national championship at the Universal  Cheerleaders Association Ten Thousand Lakes Regional competition back  in October, and in February, they made the trip down to the 2018 UCA  National High School Cheerleading Championship in Orlando, Florida.   At the national championship, they competed against 28 other teams  from across the country. They placed first in the preliminary rounds  and then advanced to the final round. In the final round, they were  able to best seven other teams and emerged with their third national  title in 5 years.   Mr. Speaker, the consistent hard work and skills of these student  athletes is impressive, and it is a credit to their dedication, their  perseverance, their coaches, and all of the families that offered them  support.   Congratulations again to Bloomington Jefferson on their national  championship.   Go Jaguars.                            ____________________
