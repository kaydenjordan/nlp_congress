 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and  thank the Disabled Veterans of the World War, now the Disabled Veterans  of America, on its 100th anniversary.   It was founded in 1920 and headed by World War I veteran and  Cincinnati Judge Robert S. Marx. The DAV has stood as an organization  of disabled veterans serving veterans as they make that critical  transition from military life to civilian life.   As Marx said of the need of the DAV, ``We had a common experience  which bound us together, and we ought to continue through an  organization of our own . . . an organization of us, by us, and for  us.''   With 1.2 million members, the DAV has grown into one of the foremost  veterans' service organizations in our country.   Arkansas DAV Commander Charlie Brown, who served for more than 26  years in the U.S. Air Force, in both Desert Storm and in Vietnam, has  helped lead our State's fight in support of America's injured veterans  and their families.   I would like to extend my congratulations to the entire Disabled  American Veterans family and wish them continued success for  generations to come.                            ____________________
