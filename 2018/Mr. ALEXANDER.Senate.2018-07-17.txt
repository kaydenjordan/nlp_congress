 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today the Senate is finally voting to  confirm James Blew, who has been nominated to be Assistant Secretary  for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development at the U.S. Department  of Education. He is well-qualified to lead that office. For 20 years,  in various roles, he has advocated for improving educational  opportunities by overseeing grants to low-income, high-risk schools. He  has a M.B.A. from Yale University. He will be in charge of helping to  manage the Department's budget and ensure that programs are working as  intended.   Mr. Blew's sin with some of my friends on the other side is that he  is in favor of giving low-income children a choice of a better school  and in favor of  [[Page S4981]]  public charter schools, which gives teachers more freedom to teach and  parents more freedom to choose the school for their child.   No one should be surprised that a Republican president would nominate  such an Assistant Secretary of Education. Every Republican president  has nominated assistant secretaries of education and secretaries of  education--I was one of them--who support giving low-income children  more choices of good schools--the same choices that wealthier children  have--such as public charter schools.   As far as public charter schools go, every Democratic president since  1990, when the first charter schools were formed, has supported public  charter schools.   Mr. Blew did not deserve to be subjected to the unreasonable delay  and obstruction that the Democrats have given to his nomination. He was  nominated on September 28, 2017, 292 days ago. We held a hearing on  November 15, 2017, 244 days ago.   Going back to the Clinton administration, there had been no hearings  for this position, but I held one anyway, as chairman of the committee,  as a courtesy to Democrats. Then, Democrats forced Mr. Blew's  nomination to be returned to the President at the end of the  congressional session last year.   Let's see how that compares to how President Obama's first Assistant  Secretary for the same job was treated. Carmel Martin was nominated on  March 18, 2009, and was confirmed by voice vote without a hearing on  May 1, 2009, 44 days later.   It is one thing to vote against a presidential nominee. That is  appropriate. Any of us can do that. I think it is wrong to always vote  against a presidential nominee just because you disagree with that  nominee's point of view. Why would you not expect a Republican  president to nominate an assistant secretary who favors giving poor  children choices of good schools and supports public charter schools  that were invented by the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota  and were supported by every Democratic president since 1990? So this  unreasonable delay of a well-qualified Assistant Secretary is not good  for the Senate, not good for the country, and not good for children who  need that sort of leadership.    I support and urge my colleagues to vote for Mr. Blew.   I yield floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted to confirm  Scott Stump, who was nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary for  Career, Technical, and Adult Education at the Department of Education.  Mr. Stump will be in charge of matters related to career, technical,  and adult education at the high school and postsecondary levels.   Stump is well-qualified for this role. He spent nearly 14 years at  the Colorado Community College System as assistant provost for career  and technical education, where he was in charge of directing the  system's career and technical education programs and guiding  implementation of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education  Act. He is also a past president of the National Association of State  Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, now called Advance  CTE. He is supported by the Association for Career and Technical  Education and Advance CTE. He was approved by the HELP Committee on  June 26, 2018, by voice vote.   Mr. Stump will be key in carrying out the Perkins Act  reauthorization, which I expect Congress to complete its work on this  year. The reauthorization, which aligns Federal dollars more closely  with the needs of employers and employees and gives States more  flexibility in spending Federal dollars, was passed out of the HELP  Committee unanimously on June 26, 2018. The House of Representatives  passed its reauthorization on June 22, 2017.   I look forward to working with Mr. Stump as he takes on this role at  the Department of Education, and I urge my colleagues to support him as  well.                            ____________________
