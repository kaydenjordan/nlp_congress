 Mr. President, a long and arduous process is finally  drawing to a close. In the next couple of days, we will vote on Judge  Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. I will be voting  yes.   Last week, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate  Judiciary Committee about an allegation she made about Judge Kavanaugh.  Dr. Ford deserved to be heard, and she was. Her claims deserved to be  investigated, and they were, thoroughly, by the Senate Judiciary  Committee. Then they were investigated again by the FBI.   Here is what we have learned after seven FBI background  investigations, more than 2 weeks of committee investigations, and a  day-long hearing in which both sides were heard: There is not one scrap  of corroborating evidence  [[Page S6534]]  to back up her claims against Judge Kavanaugh.   Person after person after person has given testimony of Judge  Kavanaugh's good character, both in high school and in his adult life.  Sixty-five women who knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school sent a letter  to the Senate Judiciary Committee noting that he always treated women  with ``decency and respect.''   It has become clear that for many of my Democratic colleagues, zero  evidence was never going to be enough. Innocent until proven guilty  doesn't seem to be a concept that my Democratic colleagues understand.  Instead, my Democratic colleagues seem to be putting forth a new  standard: Guilty no matter what, even with evidence to the contrary,  which is scary because innocent until proven guilty is a pretty  foundational principle of our system of government, and it is a  powerful safeguard against destroying the lives of innocent people with  false accusations.   The truth is, to many of our Democratic colleagues, Judge Kavanaugh  has been guilty since the moment he was nominated. He is guilty of  being a Republican. He is guilty of being nominated by a Republican  President. He is guilty of pledging his allegiance to the law instead  of to Democrats' preferred judicial outcomes. So any means of defeating  him became fair game, no matter how unjust, no matter how outlandish.   Dr. Ford certainly deserved to have her claims heard and  investigated, but Democrats didn't stop there. They gave credence to  almost every accusation that was thrown out, no matter how ridiculous  or uncorroborated. It didn't matter if no less a paper than the New  York Times had declined to publish an accusation for lack of any  corroboration. If it would slow down Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation,  they grabbed onto it.   At least one Democratic Senator suggested that we needed an FBI  investigation because Judge Kavanaugh had thrown ice at someone in  college. Apparently, throwing ice in college is now grounds for an FBI  investigation. What is next--an FBI investigation because Judge  Kavanaugh stole another kid's toy in preschool or because he didn't  share his swing on the playground during recess?   The confirmation process for Judge Kavanaugh has gotten particularly  ugly in the last couple of weeks, but the truth is, it was ugly from  the beginning. Long before Dr. Ford had made any accusations, one  Democratic Senator on the Judiciary Committee said that those who  supported Judge Kavanaugh would be complicit in evil.   For starters, let's point out that Judge Kavanaugh is a mainstream  judge. During his time on the DC Circuit, Judge Kavanaugh's Democrat- appointed colleagues have been just as likely to join his majority  opinions as his Republican-appointed colleagues.   Judge Kavanaugh has won admiration from across the political spectrum  for his intellect, his fairness, and his dedication to the law.   Former Obama Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal noted this about  Judge Kavanaugh:         I think it's very hard for anyone who's worked with him,       appeared before him, to, frankly, say a bad word about him.        In my practice we basically have a rule: If there's a       Kavanaugh clerk who applies, we hire that person.    Thirty-four of Judge Kavanaugh's law clerks wrote a letter on his  nomination which said, in part:         Our views on politics, on many of the important legal       issues faced by the Supreme Court, and on judicial       philosophy, are diverse. Our ranks include Republicans,       Democrats, and Independents. But we are united in this: Our       admiration and fondness for Judge Kavanaugh run deep. For       each of us . . . it was a tremendous stroke of luck to work       for and be mentored by a person of his strength of character,       generosity of spirit, intellectual capacity, and unwavering       care for his family, friends, colleagues, and us, his law       clerks.    Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan--certainly not someone Democrats  think of as either evil or an extremist--hired Judge Kavanaugh to teach  at Harvard Law School, where he has served as the Williston Lecturer on  Law.   Both inside and outside his profession, those who know him praise his  character.   Eighty-four women who worked with him in the Bush administration sent  a letter praising him as ``a man of the highest integrity.''   A self-described liberal Democrat and feminist lawyer who knows Judge  Kavanaugh and knows him well wrote the following in an op-ed for  Politico:         My standard is whether the nominee is unquestionably well-      qualified, brilliant, has integrity, and is within the       mainstream of legal thought. Kavanaugh easily meets those       criteria.        Just as a Democratic nominee with similar credentials and       mainstream legal views deserves to be confirmed, so, too,       does Kavanaugh--not because he will come out the way I want       in each case and even most cases, but because he will do the       job with dignity, intelligence, empathy, and integrity.    That is from a liberal lawyer. This is the man that the junior  Democrat from New Jersey said it would be ``evil'' to support.    I frequently disagree with my Democratic colleagues on policy issues,  oftentimes quite strongly, but I don't go around calling my colleagues  ``evil'' because we disagree. I know that word should be reserved for  people who have truly malicious motivations or who have done truly  terrible things--not people who, like me, want to do what is best for  our country but have different opinions about how to get there.   What kind of an example does the Senator from New Jersey's rhetoric  set for our children--that civil disagreement is impossible; that  anyone whose opinion differs from our own should not be tolerated; that  our fellow Americans are not just our political opponents but our  enemies?   Democrats like to accuse the President of using irresponsible  rhetoric. I might suggest they take a long hard look in the mirror.   But it is not just the Democrats' rhetoric that has been extreme and  irresponsible throughout this process, so has their handling of Dr.  Ford's allegation. The ranking member on the Senate Judiciary  Committee, the senior Senator from California, sat on Dr. Ford's  allegation for 6 weeks without sharing the allegation with Republicans.   During that time, she never once questioned Judge Kavanaugh about the  accusation, despite having multiple chances to do so, both in public  and in private. If the ranking member thought this accusation was  credible, she had an absolute responsibility to disclose it to the  committee or to the FBI immediately. She also had an obligation to ask  Judge Kavanaugh about it. She did neither.   If, on the other hand, she thought it was false--which is the only  excuse for her silence--then the Democrats' decision to exploit this  accusation for political gain is appalling. In either case, Democrats  have behaved with a total lack of responsibility throughout this  process.   Not only have they shown not the slightest concern about the  possibility of tarnishing a good man's name, they also displayed no  real concern for Dr. Ford. Clearly, they had no particular interest in  giving her or her allegation a hearing until it became politically  expedient to do so. If they had really cared about her accusation, they  would have brought it up immediately and questioned Judge Kavanaugh  about it immediately. Instead, they held it in reserve, apparently to  be deployed in the event that they needed it to delay the confirmation  process.   It is shameful but not surprising. As I said earlier, Democrats made  clear from the beginning that they would do anything they could to  defeat Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Throughout this process, they have  grasped any straw that appeared: too few documents, too many documents,  an unrelated investigation, outlandish accusations.   Then, after last week's hearing, when it became clear there was no  evidence against Judge Kavanaugh, they jumped on his demeanor at the  hearing. Now he was unqualified because he passionately defended his  good name in front of the committee. Apparently, it is not OK to be  angry when your good name has been dragged through the mud and your  family has been threatened.   Today, of course, now that we have gotten the results of the FBI  investigation, which Democrats requested, by the way, Democrats are now  saying that Judge Kavanaugh shouldn't be confirmed because the FBI  investigation wasn't long enough or thorough enough.   I would like to ask: Does anyone here think there is any FBI  investigation  [[Page S6535]]  that would have satisfied my Democratic colleagues? After all, we know  Democrats have been opposed to Judge Kavanaugh from the very beginning.  A number of them announced their opposition before the ink was even dry  on his nomination. Are we really supposed to believe they were going to  change their minds after yet another FBI investigation?   Despite the well-coordinated intimidation tactics of the far left, we  are moving forward. We are about to vote on Judge Kavanaugh's  nomination, as we should be. But I can't help but reflect on the  process of getting here.   I would like to ask my Democratic colleagues if this is what they  think the process should look like going forward. Do they really think  that Supreme Court confirmations should be characterized by intense  partisanship and unsubstantiated character attacks? Do they really want  to do away with the presumption of innocence and allow innuendo--the  substitute for evidence? Do they really think it is OK to stop at  nothing to tank a nomination?   Tomorrow and Saturday, I will be casting my vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  I will be voting for him because he is supremely qualified. We all know  that. The Democrats know that. I will be voting for him because he is a  man of character and integrity, and I will be voting for him because I  know that he can be relied on to uphold the rule of law and the  Constitution. I invite not just my Republican but my independent- thinking Democratic colleagues to join me. It is not too late to say no  to the politics of personal destruction. It is not too late to say no  to unchecked partisanship. It is not too late to put this eminently  qualified nominee on the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
