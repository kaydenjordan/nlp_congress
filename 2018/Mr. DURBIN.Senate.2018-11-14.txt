 I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, Steve Magruder has devoted his life to  helping working families. For more than 40 years, Steve faithfully  served as a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical  Workers International Local 176. Last week, Steve retired as the  business manager of Local 176, a position he held for 8 years.  [[Page S6959]]    The IBEW is as old as commercial electricity. In 1891, 2 years before  electricity made Chicago the White City, the IBEW formed to protect the  rights and safety of those brave workers willing to work on electrical  and telecommunications. They would be the ones who brought power across  the country, and today, they have a membership of 750,000 worldwide.   Steve started out in the storied electrical industry while he was  still in high school. He worked as a shop assistant for Bradley  Electric. He eventually became the owner of the residential division of  Bradley Electric.   In 1975, he was initiated into the IBEW Local 963 in Kankakee, IL, as  a residential wireman. The next year, the local IBEW chapters merged to  form IBEW 176. In 1982, he became a journeyman wireman and moved into  companies such as Comstock and Company and Meade Electric.   By 1990, Steve became an agent in the Local 176 business office. He  founded the IBEW 176 sick, injured, and needy committee, which helps  members in difficult times. Over the years, hundreds of thousands of  dollars have been used by the committee to help so many people through  the tough times.   Through all of this, Steve stayed involved in politics and helped  candidates who would help working families of Illinois. In 2010, he  became business manager of Local 176 and apprenticeship program numbers  increased. He also expanded political work by chairing the 176 PAC  committee and a committee on political education. If a business hired  in Kankakee or Iroquois County hired from outside, Steve was at the  frontlines fighting for families to keep them from being left behind by  the local economy.   Steve is retiring now to spend more time with his wife of 45 years,  Candy. I wish him the best in his future endeavors.                            ____________________
