 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of communities across  Michigan's First District that depend on Essential Air Service funding  for industry, mobility, and economic success. I believe that, when it  comes to protecting taxpayer dollars, we as Congress have a fiduciary  responsibility to the American people. We owe it to them to evaluate  what is working and what isn't and make the appropriate adjustments.   The Essential Air Service program is a great example of a program  that is working, and I am proud to support it. EAS grants make it  possible for 8 of the 10 airports in Michigan's First District to  provide reliable air services, promote economic stability and job  growth, and support a healthy tourism industry in the Upper Peninsula  and throughout northern Michigan.   The benefits that this program provides to small towns and cities in  Michigan and across the United States are well worth the investment,  and I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to ensure  full Essential Air Service funding.                            ____________________
