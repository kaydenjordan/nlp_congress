 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lowey and rise in  opposition to this bill.   Our Nation really needs to be on an even keel to produce steady  economic growth in this country. This bill doesn't help that.   I agree, America must have a strong defense, but a nation has to be  strong at home to be strong abroad. You can't shortchange the home  front. A nation at home must be secure, without wild stock market  swings, to be strong abroad.   A nation at home must be strong, without a massive drug epidemic here  at home, to be strong abroad.   This bill can't produce a steady economy with consistent job growth  because it fails to dedicate sufficient resources here at home: to  education, to healthcare, to employment and retraining, for Head Start,  for energy independence, for law enforcement, and for localities  savaged by the drug epidemic and shortchanged on treatment.   Our ship of state needs to be on an even keel, not the wild  fluctuations in this resolution. This bill tilts in the wind far, far  starboard, and that is not a setting that can assure a steady ship of  state to maintain a steady growth economy.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep concern in the wake of  President Trump's failure to levy economic sanctions on more of  Russia's oligarchs, allowing Putin's repressive regime its continued  illegal aggression on Ukraine.   In his State of the Union, the President used the single word,  ``Russia.'' That was it. And then he decided to call it ``a rival.''   A rival? How about enemy of liberty? How about that?   In stark contrast to every other President going back to Ronald  Reagan, read what wasn't said in this State of the Union. This raises  serious questions as to why President Trump is letting Russia off the  hook.   Why would President Trump reject the advice of all U.S. intelligence  offices, including that of his own CIA Director, especially when the  United States intelligence agencies know Russia interfered massively in  our elections and European elections, our most important alliance, and  uses its military assets to undermine liberty?   Thankfully, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team seeks answers, but  Trump's most troublesome financial connections with Russia-linked  investors and intermediary banks remain questions that need to be  answered.   Speaking as co-chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, I urge my  colleagues to act in the national interest and in the absence of  Presidential leadership on Russian aggression.                            ____________________
