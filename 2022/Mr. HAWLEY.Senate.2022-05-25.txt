 Mr. President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on S. Res. 134, a resolution expressing the sense of the  Senate that the President should work with the Government of the United  Kingdom to conclude negotiations for a comprehensive free trade  agreement between the United States and United Kingdom.                            ____________________
