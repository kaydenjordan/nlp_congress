 Madam Speaker, tomorrow, our residents who are fortunate  to live in our Nation's Capital will come to the Capitol as part of  their Lobby Day to ask the Congress to pass the D.C. statehood bill.   Most Americans are unaware that the Americans who live in their  Nation's Capital have the fewest rights of any Americans. That is at  the same time that those 700,000 residents who live in the Nation's  Capital pay the highest taxes per capita, higher than the taxes of the  residents of any State.   As you might imagine, the residents of the District of Columbia are  seeking to become the 51st State of the Union. I am pleased that  already almost 90 percent of Democrats are on our D.C. statehood bill.  I am grateful to Senator Carper, who will soon introduce this same bill  on the Senate side.   There are many reasons that no Americans should fail to have equal  rights if they pay equal taxes. But surely, service in every war the  Nation has fought, even beyond being first per capita in Federal income  taxes, should qualify the 700,000 residents of the District of Columbia  for equal treatment as the 51st State.   On this poster, we see why any State would stand for its rights:  World War I, more casualties of people who live in the District of  Columbia than three States; the Korean war, more casualties than those  of eight States; World War II, casualties are more than four States;  and the Vietnam war, casualties that outnumber those in 10 States.   The residents of the District of Columbia will be here to say to my  colleagues that 200-plus years--it is about 218 years now--without  equal rights is 218 years too many.   Nobody who lives in our country and pays taxes should be  unrepresented on this floor when votes are taken. I appreciate that I  can now vote for the District of Columbia in the Committee of the  Whole, where some votes are taken. But District resident have no  representation on this floor and none in the Senate at all.   It is past time to right this wrong. We cannot do it for those who  have died in war for our country. We can certainly do it in their  memory.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I don't even want to speak to the underlying issue. I  want to speak to what it is we are doing here with congressional power.  The President signed a bill. He didn't have to. He could have retained  his power.   Now he proposes to ignore the bill he signed and act as if the  Congress did not exist. This is the road to dictatorship. Congress  cannot ever agree with an executive that takes our power. That is what  Trump is trying to do.   We have gradually given up our power, sometimes for expediency sake,  sometimes to avoid controversy. Today, we put all on notice that we  will not give the power that belongs only to Congress to the President  of the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank my good friends for working together to produce this magnificent  lands package.   Mr. Speaker, this lands package takes all our precious land  seriously, including our urban parks. I particularly appreciate that  this bill allows the District of Columbia to receive full State grant  funding for our city parks.   First off is Franklin Park in downtown D.C. to be rehabilitated with  public-private partnership money using Federal, local, and private- sector funding.   This bill incentivizes the private sector to step up and do its part  to see that our public parks are as good for business as they are for  people. The Founders of the Capital city made sure that the Capital  would be a city of parks. Watch us set an example for urban parks  throughout the country by supporting this important legislation.
