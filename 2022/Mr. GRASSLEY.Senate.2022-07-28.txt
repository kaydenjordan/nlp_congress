 Madam President, today is a very important date for the  relations between the United States and the Baltic states of Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania.   Today marks 100 years of continuous, uninterrupted diplomatic  relations between our country and each of the Baltic countries.   Let me explain why I emphasize continuous, uninterrupted diplomatic  relations. Last Saturday marked 82 years since Acting Secretary of  State Sumner Welles issued a declaration that is remembered to this day  in each of the Baltic countries. Soviet troops had entered the Baltic  states, arrested leaders, and organized rigged elections to create pro- Soviet government.   The Welles Declaration decried the ``devious processes whereunder the  political independence and territorial integrity of the three small  Baltic Republics--Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--were to be  deliberately annihilated by one of their more powerful neighbors.'' It  was a clear, principled statement that the United States would not  recognize Soviet control over these countries as legitimate.   During the 50 years the Soviet Union forcibly occupied Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania, diplomats from each of the Baltic states  continued their work in the United States, and we continued to  recognize them as independent, sovereign countries under foreign  occupation.   The Soviet Union justified sending troops to the Baltics on the basis  of the threat from Nazi Germany. However, just a year before, the  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Nazis and Soviets contained a  secret protocol whereby Hitler and Stalin agreed to carve up their  neighbors into ``spheres of influence.'' Under this agreement, the  Baltics, Finland, eastern Poland, and what is now Moldova would be  controlled by the Soviet Union, and the rest of Poland would go to  Germany. Finland was able to fight back in the Winter War, retaining  its sovereignty, but losing significant territory to Russia. The rest  of the pact played out just as Stalin and Hitler agreed.   This isn't just history. This is directly relevant to Vladimir  Putin's rhetoric, attitude, and actions in Ukraine. He believes he has  a right to a sphere of influence over his neighbors just like Stalin  and Hitler thought. To this day, Putin maintains that the three Baltics  joined the Soviet Union in 1940 and ceased to exist as countries until  the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Russian Duma has even  threatened to repeal a Soviet law recognizing Lithuania's independence  from the USSR--what a joke.   Let's be clear: The Baltic states are not former Soviet republics.  They have been independent countries for over a century. Following in  Stalin's footsteps, Putin justifies attacking Ukraine, at least to  audiences outside of Russia, as a reaction to NATO encroaching on  Russia. Putin casts NATO as a threat, even making up a claim that NATO  was planning to put missiles in Ukraine targeting Russia.   The fact is, even our eastern flank allies in NATO do not currently  have the kinds of defensive missiles they would need to repel a Russian  invasion, which is unfortunate. Currently, we have meager ``tripwire''  forces that are insufficient to stop the kind of invasion we saw in  Ukraine in February. Russia's military leaders know that NATO cannot  begin to threaten Russian territory.   There were no allied reinforcements in any NATO country bordering  Russia until the invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine was militarily  neutral then, but seeking economic ties with the European Union, thus  slipping away from economic dependency on Russia.   The fact that NATO has become attractive to Ukraine since Russia  seized Crimea and part of the Donbas is a threat not to the territory  of the Russian Federation, but to Russia's imperial desire for a sphere  of influence. Putin blames Ukraine's westward turn on provocations by  western intelligence agencies, failing to recognize that Ukrainians are  making their own choices. Just like in 1940, the United States has  refused to recognize another Russian occupation of a sovereign country  as legitimate.   We were once a small collection of colonies seeking to chart our own,  independent course free from European empires. That is why the Welles  Declaration expressed admiration for the Baltic countries as they  pursued self-government and democracy.   That is why the Welles Declaration made clear that the people of the  United States oppose intervention or the use of force by large or  powerful countries on smaller, weaker ones. That principle applies  today to Ukraine. No one should decide Ukraine's fate except the  Ukrainian people. True to our principles, the United States can never,  directly or tacitly, consign Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.   As we celebrate 100 years of excellent diplomatic relations with our  Baltic allies, there is no doubt in retrospect that we were right to  stand up for their sovereignty, even when that seemed hopeless, even  foolish. Fifty years of Russian occupation could not turn them into  Russians, just as centuries of Russification policies have not  convinced Ukrainians to accept the Russian view that they are just  ``little Russians.'' The Baltic countries are thriving democracies with  strong Western values and some of our closest allies. Thank God they  regained their independence and are now in NATO.
