 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and thank  Sharon Hughes for her 20 years of service to the Eighth District of  Ohio.   Sharon was born in Marion, Ohio, and attended Bowling Green State  University. She worked for Congressman John Boehner from 2002 to 2016,  and she has been a dedicated staff member in my office since 2016. She  served as a caseworker and office manager, and also directed the  military academy nomination process with excellence, and the  Congressional Art Competition with excellence as well.   Outside of her congressional work, she also served in several  leadership roles for the Butler Philharmonic Orchestra.   During her 20 years of service to the Eighth District of Ohio, Sharon  has made a difference in the lives of countless constituents, including  assisting in  [[Page H1090]]  securing Federal benefits; solving tax return problems; and acquiring  service records, passports, and military service-connected disability  compensation.   I thank Sharon so much for everything that she has done for Ohio's  Eighth District. May she enjoy her well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
