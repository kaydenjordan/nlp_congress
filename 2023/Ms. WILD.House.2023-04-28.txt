 Mr. Speaker, I am a mother myself. My children are now 27  and 30 years old, but I distinctly remember how challenging it was to  have children in a two-parent working family.   I was a lawyer before I came to Congress, and I distinctly remember  the panic when I had to bring my very active toddler son to court with  me because his preschool was suddenly closed.   I really feel for people who have ongoing issues finding affordable,  reliable childcare.   More than 38,000 children in Pennsylvania are waitlisted; 1,600  classrooms have closed; and hundreds of childcare positions remain  unfilled. In my district in the Lehigh Valley, more than 1,500 children  are waitlisted, and Carbon County is classified as a childcare desert.   The childcare crisis isn't just hard on parents. It is hard on  childcare providers, too. Early childcare workers in my district make  just $28,000 to $32,000 compared with their elementary school peers  making $52,000.   The Childcare for Working Families Act introduced yesterday on a  bicameral basis would help open more care providers and lower costs for  parties, capping costs at 7 percent of a family's income.   Putting money back in parents' pockets, raising wages for hardworking  care providers, and giving kids more quality early childhood  education--that is working for people.                            ____________________
