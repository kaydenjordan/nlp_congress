 Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank my colleague from Guam for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5931, the Improving FHA  Support for Small Dollar Mortgages Act of 2020.   I want to start off by thanking my Financial Services Committee  colleague, Congressman Stivers from Ohio, for working with my staff and  me to craft a bill that will ultimately try to help close the  affordable housing gap, and I look forward to working with him on other  legislation and policy going forward.   H.R. 5931, the Clay-Stivers Improving FHA Support for Small Dollar  Mortgages Act of 2020, would require the FHA to conduct a review of its  policy to identify any barriers to supporting mortgages under $70,000,  or small dollar mortgages, and submit a report to Congress within a  year with a plan for removing such barriers.   In a recent report, the Urban Institute found that, despite having  similar performance indicators, credit profiles, loan-to-value ratios,  and lower debt-to-income ratios, the financing options to purchase,  renovate, or refinance homes valued at or under $70,000 remain limited  compared to mortgages between $70,000 and $150,000--and many of those  homes are in our State of Missouri.   Mr. Speaker, the Urban Institute report further revealed that FHA is  disproportionately failing to serve this market, despite its mission to  serve underserved borrowers. Specifically, the report found that FHA  serves 24 percent of the overall market but only 19 percent of the  small dollar mortgage market.    Again, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan study to  identify any barriers to supporting these small dollar mortgages and  report to Congress within a year a plan for removing such barriers to  financing for creditworthy borrowers.
