 Madam Speaker, I want to speak tonight about the  very deep humanitarian situation at the U.S.-Mexico border.   Immigration has been the lifeblood of our Nation for generations. The  United States has been blessed that people from all over the world have  come to our country fleeing oppression, dictators, violence, poverty,  desperation, and seeking opportunity in our Nation that has been built  up by those very same people to become the most prosperous and powerful  Nation on the face of this Earth.   But our immigration system is broken. Our enforcement system is  broken.   And tonight, we want to talk about what we have learned, after  repeated visits to Department of Homeland Security facilities, operated  by Customs and Border Protection, ICE, and also HHS facilities operated  by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.   I am going to be joined tonight by a few of my colleagues,   Jimmy  Gomez, who represents part of Los Angeles, Darren Soto, a Congressman  from Florida, and perhaps other Members of Congress this evening.   Before I turn it over to Darren, I want to speak for a second about  what is known as the largest for-profit center that is operated to  detain children. It is in a town called Homestead, Florida, and it is a  massive operation. The operators of this facility, it is reported, make  over $700 per child per day, and its size continues to grow.   There are many troubling things going on at Homestead, and about a  system that keeps growing and growing for the sake of profit, holding  and detaining children, some of them infants and toddlers, longer and  longer.   My colleague, Darren Soto, is here to describe Homestead and his  visits there.   I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).    That is an important point. When you went into  that facility, this HHS facility, you were told, as a Member of  Congress that has oversight authority over these Federal agencies and  facilities, you were told not to speak to anybody that was inside that  facility.    And there has been concern because of the  weather in Florida, because you have a hurricane season in Florida,  about the ability of these tents to withstand strong weather and the  danger that that could present to the kids there.    The gentleman mentioned the point about the  Trump administration has done something fundamentally different than  the prior administration in a few ways. First, its zero tolerance  policy. So it started aggressively separating fathers and mothers from  their young kids. Thousands of those kids were lost in the system.  Literally, the administration had absolutely no way ahead of time to  track them and to reunite them with their parents.   And also, what is known as the Remain in Mexico, or MPP policy; that  once people come seeking asylum, the administration has done a few  things: Number 1, for the people that do make it here, they then send  many of them right back to Mexico. And these are, unfortunately, the  cities that--some of these cities that the United States Government and  the Department of State recommends that Americans do not travel to. And  we are sending people back there, when we are recommending to our own  folks that they don't go to these same cities.   Then the other thing they have been doing is metering, as you alluded  to, and trying to block people from legally--remember, these people are  legally presenting themselves for asylum. And they are blocking these  folks from presenting themselves for asylum.   So what happens is, the situation that you have with the young man  and his young daughter, 2-year-old daughter, the photo from about three  weeks ago that the whole world saw. And I didn't speak to a single  person who saw that photograph of the father and his 2-year-old  daughter, dead in the water, with the young girl, her arm over her  dad--I didn't speak to anybody who said that they saw that photo that  didn't cry.    Thank you, Darren. Thank you for keeping an eye  on the Homestead facility in Florida, for the CODELS, which are  official congressional visits to these facilities. Thanks for all the  work that you have been doing.    Absolutely.   Jimmy, I know you are from Los Angeles. You have also been on many of  these CODELS. You have seen the horrific conditions that folks are  being kept in, the separation of families, all of these things.    That is an important point, Jimmy. People  wonder, well how is it that these families got separated? Why would the  government do that?   There is, in the law, which is known as Section 1325, a law that  allows the government to basically charge the parents with a crime;  therefore, separate them from their kids, and send the kids off  somewhere else.    That was bizarre. You remember, several months  ago now, when Secretary Nielsen was still the Secretary of Homeland  Security in, I think it was the first hearing, where she was asked  about the government's, the Trump administration's family separation  policy. She said, flat out, that there was no child separation or  family separation policy; very bizarrely said that there was no family  separation policy.    That is right, you and Nanette Barragan, who  also represents part of southern California, and you saw the metering  policy, what is known as the metering policy. Again, that is where they  block people from legally presenting for asylum. You all saw it  firsthand. In fact, you ended up spending almost the whole night, I  think, sleeping there on the concrete.    These were CBP agents who were refusing to show  you.    So it is a purposeful way to disrupt your rest,  your sleep, to try to get as many people out of there as possible?    With her kids.    You mentioned the Trump administration's  policies, and there was a really excellent article written not too long  ago by a gentleman by the name of Adam Serwer, and I think he wrote it  for The Atlantic, although I could be wrong. But his point is that the  cruelty is the point, it seems like, and the further along we go, the  more it seems that that is the case, that some of these policies are  done for sheer harshness towards the people who these policies are  directed toward.   And you know that last week there were a group of us from the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus who went over to two Border Patrol  stations in El Paso, Texas, first the El Paso Border Patrol Station  number one, and then the Clint facility, which is now infamous.   This was the same day or the day after that a story had broken about  a Facebook page. I think it is the I'm 10-15 Facebook page that was set  up as a secret group, or a private group, set up for Border Patrol  agents, former Border Patrol agents and current Border Patrol agents,  9,500 members of this group who had made some very vile and very vulgar  comments about the people in their care, about Members of Congress,  about the work that they do. A lot of it is stuff that I just can't  read on the House floor because they would probably shut me down for  being vulgar.    Yes.    And if our colleagues have not read that  article, Republican and Democrat, you should read that ProPublica  article that was published last week, because it tells you exactly the  problems with CBP right now and the culture at CBP.   I want to read one thing. We were talking about the father, and when  he and his daughter died they were face down on the river. She had her  arm around him. So everybody saw that photo around the world and  throughout the country. I want to tell you a post that was on this  Facebook page, posted by a Border Patrol agent or a former Border  Patrol agent, and so I am going to quote here. It says: ``Okay. I'm  gonna go ahead and ask, have y'all ever seen floaters this clean? I'm  not trying to be an `a,' but I have never seen floaters like this.  Could this be another edited photo? We've all seen the Dems and liberal  party do some pretty sick things.''   Now, that was his post. There were a few responses to that post. Some  of them were memes. One of the memes had a Sesame Street character, and  the language below the Sesame Street character says ``oh, well'' about  these deaths.   Another meme from another agent or former agent has a picture. There  is a famous scene in a movie ``Rocky IV'' of the Russian fighter, and  he uses a famous line for anybody who has ever seen it. The meme says,  ``If he dies, he dies.'' They are talking about the little girl and the  man who are hugging face down in the river.   I reached out to Secretary McAleenan, I think still the Acting  Secretary of DHS. I think he is still acting. I think I am right about  that. And I said, over the weekend: I would like to have a discussion  with you this coming week. And we are trying to set it up about the  accountability and disciplinary system for CBP agents who have made the  most vile and vulgar comments.    Look, don't get me wrong. There were some people who were part of  this group who I am sure never made a comment. There were people who  were part of this group who never said anything close to some of the  worst stuff on here, who would not be subject to discipline.   A big part of the problem right now is the culture at CBP, and as far  as I can tell, there is close to zero accountability for anything like  this or what happened in Maine on the northern border a few weeks ago.   It was reported, because if you take a Greyhound bus from McAllen,  Texas, for example, and you are going to go to San Antonio or Dallas or  Austin or whatever, you get stopped along the way by CBP agents. Same  thing in California if you are coming up from San Diego or near the  border. And the CBP agents will get onto the bus, go up to each person,  or at least the people they suspect could possibly be immigrants, and  they will ask you to basically prove your citizenship.   So we have been in a battle with Greyhound over that because of the  rights that Americans have, having to prove citizenship. But here is my  point. I think it was ACLU that got emails made public of a few agents  on a few occasions, or it may have been one agent on a few occasions,  saying to his agents who were going out to do these checks on the  buses, his message to them was ``happy hunting.'' Happy hunting.   I asked Secretary McAleenan: Well, what are you going to do about  that person? Somebody is describing going after human beings here as  hunting. What is the disciplinary process?   Congress has not gotten any answers about what the disciplinary and  accountability process is at the Department of Homeland Security, at  CBP for actions like this.   Then one more thing--and then, of course, I want to hear more of your  perspective--is also, besides the fact that there is hardly any  accountability as far as we can tell, it is also very secretive. I  mean, really, Border Patrol right now is probably the most--except for  the Secret Service, probably the most secretive law enforcement agency  in the country, the least transparent law enforcement agency in the  country.   You and I both know when we have gone and visited the border, when we  have gone to these facilities, there are good agents who are doing  their work, who are doing it honestly and earnestly, who are not  mistreating anybody, who are helping to defend and protect the United  States. But those people are overwhelmed by a system that is undercut  by a bad culture at this point and by these rogue agents who have  essentially ruined the culture at CBP, and I don't know that the  higher-ups, right now, are lifting a finger to do anything about it.    In fact, I want to talk to you, because  Americans ask the question, rightfully, of Members of Congress, ``Okay.  So you have identified a problem or you are complaining about a  problem. What is your solution to it?'' So I want to talk about that  for a second.   But a few more examples on the Facebook group, because I really want  our colleagues to have a sense of how deep this problem is and that it  is not just imaginary.                                time  2115    This is right here in writing, in pictures, and in language.   There was a post, and this is one of the milder posts, but it is a  meme. The language on the meme says: ``You know what? I'm just going to  say it. . . . Hondurans have the stupidest names ever.'' Again, this is  either a current or former Border Patrol agent.   One more, and before I read this, I want to explain something. In  Border Patrol, they have their own language. One of the slurs that they  use talking about the desperate people who are presenting themselves is  the word ``tonk.'' People probably wonder what that means. That word is  supposed to be what it sounds like when they hit one of these folks  over the head with a flashlight. It makes that sound, ``tonk.'' They  are using that as a slur to describe the folks who are at the border.   The meme is a picture of red, dead meat laid out flat. The caption  says, ``Little tonk blanket ideas!''   I mean, this is sick stuff.   I told McAleenan that some of these people need to be taken off the  beat. These people, some of them are clearly a danger to human life, in  the way they are talking and acting.   Combine that with a system where there is hardly any accountability,  if any accountability at all, and it is very dangerous, very dangerous  not only for the people who come into their care but dangerous for  their coworkers as well.   These good agents are overrun. When they try to do the right thing,  try to report abuse, try to report neglect, try to report malfeasance,  they are thwarted by people higher up in Border Patrol who take that  information and do absolutely zero about it.   What happens? A lot of people then figure, ``Well, nothing is going  to happen if I actually report it, and there is a chance that if these  people find out I am reporting it, they are going to take retribution  against me.''   There is a whole group of people who are working in the system who  actually want to do the right thing, do their jobs honestly, who are  undercut, thwarted, and slowly brought into this rotten system because  the people at the top will not do anything to change it.   Madam Speaker, Mr. Gomez mentioned some of the solutions. He  mentioned the supplemental bill.   The supplemental bill was the Trump administration coming forward and  asking for billions of dollars more in funding because, it argued:  There is a surge at the border; there are more people coming; so we  need more money for ICE, CBP, and HHS, which are the kids.   There was a House version of that bill. There was a Senate version of  that bill. The Senate bill is what finally passed.   As Mr. Gomez mentioned, a big concern that we had was that this  President likes to play games with funding in this administration. They  like to take money that Congress appropriates for one purpose and then  go use it for something else.   Madam Speaker, as Mr. Gomez knows, the biggest example of that was  when they wanted to take this military money and use it to build a  wall.   When I was in law school, and maybe every law student studied this,  there is, of course, a famous jurist, Oliver Wendell Holmes. In legal  theory, he had this ``bad man'' theory. The idea was that laws needed  to be written in such a way that somebody who has no shame at all, a  bad man who is looking to take advantage of any little crack in the law  that he can, we need to write a law that prevents that from happening.  Right now, we are not in that situation because the Trump  administration is able to do all these things and move money around.   One of the big problems we had was a lack of guardrails. They could  take this humanitarian aid and, instead of using it for humanitarian  purposes, direct it toward a wall or toward something else, toward more  ICE beds, toward more HHS beds so that the private contractors who run  Homestead and who also run private prisons can make another $775 a day  per child because they are growing their number by 3,000, 4,000, 5,000,  10,000 people.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, in order to make sure that we  start to solve this problem, there is legislation that the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus and others are pushing immediately.   There are a few specific things that we need to do. One of them is  that we need to raise standards of care. Many of us went out to  Antelope Wells, New Mexico, parts of rural New Mexico, and we witnessed  that CBP is understaffed, underprepared, and under-resourced to handle  medical emergencies by these asylum seekers, the folks who come in with  medical emergencies. Maybe they go into diabetic shock. They encounter  some respiratory illness, and they are very sick.    It is not that they were unprepared to handle medical emergencies by  asylum seekers. They are also very unprepared to handle emergency  situations by their own workers, Federal employees, CBP agents.   Dr. Raul Ruiz, also from southern California, is an emergency room  medical doctor. He was in Haiti after the earthquake. He has been in  disaster situations. He and his staff have done an excellent job and  spent a lot of time coming up with legislation that raises those  standards of medical treatment and of care.   We believe, based on everything that we have seen, that some of these  deaths of these young children could have been prevented if the  standards of  [[Page H5580]]  care had been appropriate and if these kids had just been treated  better. We have to raise the standard of care.   When we went over to Antelope Wells, they get 200 people who come to  present themselves for asylum. They put them all in this sally port.  They have 200 people there, including some infants, toddlers, et  cetera.   What do they give them to eat? They give them frozen burritos that  they heat up, frozen burritos for a 3-year-old.   Pumping more cash into the system is not the full answer to this. We  don't just pump more cash into the system so they can buy people  burritos and still not have nurses and doctors when there is an  emergency. We have to raise the standard of care.   The second part is that we have to move people through the process  faster. Remember, I said that with President Trump and the zero- tolerance policy, the remain-in-Mexico policy, all this stuff, it has  created a situation where people are being held longer.   When we saw these dozen or so Cuban women who were in this cell at El  Paso Border Station 1, some of them had been at that Border Patrol  station for 50 days. Some of them said they had not showered or taken a  bath for over 15 days. Some were grandmothers. Some had been separated  from their kids and didn't know where their kids were. There were a few  who said they had not been given their prescription medication. One of  them had epilepsy, and she said she had not gotten her medication for  epilepsy.   We walked over to what is this steel toilet, because it is basically  like a prison cell. They are sleeping on concrete floors. There are  painted cinder-block walls. We go over to this steel toilet. Directly  above it, it has a sink. The sink is not working. There is no sink.   All these people going to the restroom, they can't wash their hands  because the sink doesn't work. They are staying there many, many, many  days, well beyond what the law prescribes and the court settlements  have prescribed for how long somebody should be staying there.   The final piece, as we know, is a longer term thing, which is that we  believe the United States and other countries in the Western  Hemisphere--and I believe that we should wrangle our allies from around  the world because whenever there is some major crisis in some other  part of the world, those nations ask the United States to help out. We  should ask the same of those countries when something happens in the  Western Hemisphere, in this case, in Central America.   My point is that we need to make serious investments in the Northern  Triangle countries of Central America because I don't believe that  these people want to get up and leave their homes to make a 1,200-mile  journey to the United States if they don't have to, if they weren't so  desperate, if they weren't fleeing violence, if they weren't fleeing  oppression. But that is where they find themselves.   By the way, one more point on this: The President wants to spend  billions and billions of dollars on the wall but over the last several  years has committed only hundreds of millions of dollars in Central  American aid.   I was speaking with Matt Cartwright the other day, our colleague from  Pennsylvania. He made a great point, which is if we took those billions  of dollars that we are spending on a wall and used that as seed money  to start investing in Central America, what we would do is help create  safety and opportunity in those countries so that people don't feel the  need to come to the United States, and we wouldn't have a surge of  migration.   Like I said, I think those people want to stay in their countries.   Also, Madam Speaker, even a few days ago, I saw an article where  there was a very famous columnist, a writer who made the case that this  is a different situation. This migration from Central America is a  different situation from refugees who have fled to the United States in  previous generations. His point was that they are not fleeing state- sponsored oppression.   I believe that kind of thinking is an anachronism. It is old  thinking.   The fact is, somebody who is living in Central America or anywhere  around the world can be just as oppressed and put in danger and have  their life threatened and the lives of their family threatened  systematically by a drug gang or a drug lord and these groups as some  dictator did in the 1960s or 1970s in some other country.   I believe that threats to people have evolved, that the refugee  situation, the asylee situation, has evolved and that the United States  should recognize that evolution, just like other things have evolved.   We should recognize that evolution and recognize that the threats  these people are facing, even though it may not be coming directly from  the Central American governments, are just as dangerous as people who  were fleeing Vietnam in the 1970s or are just as dangerous as the  Cubans who were fleeing the dictatorial Castro regime in the early  1960s. We should recognize that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    In fact, more people have come since the  announcement of that policy. It is an abject failure.    Absolutely. We talked about that piece,  basically a Marshall Plan for Central America, the investment. And Zoe  Lofgren, another colleague of yours from California--northern  California, San Jose--has got legislation that addresses, essentially,  the start of a Marshall Plan for Central America, which I believe she  has filed already.   And I mentioned Raul Ruiz's bill on lifting standards.   Another bill that we are pushing very strongly is the accountability  piece. We were talking about the CBP officers and the fact that I can't  tell whether there is any legitimate accountability over there. My  colleague from Texas, Veronica Escobar, who represents El Paso, has got  a bill on accountability that she has also filed.  [[Page H5581]]    So we are pushing these pieces of legislation really hard, working  with the Speaker and others, to try to get some of them passed before  the end of this July, before we go on the long August recess.   Lori Trahan, another member of the CHC, from Massachusetts, has got a  bill.   One of the problems, and you spoke to it, is that DHS and HHS will  often try to deny Members of Congress access to the facilities. People  might say: Okay, well, you are Members of Congress and they are a  different agency. Why should you be able to go in whenever you want;  right?   Well, remember, the legislative branch has oversight over these  executive agencies, and you can't do your job of oversight if they  don't let you in. Or, if you have got to give 7 days' notice, they have  a chance to just clean everything up. In fact, if you read that  Facebook page by the Border Patrol agents, they are talking about the  fact the facilities are cleaned up before Members of Congress actually  have a chance to visit. So that is a problem.   Lori has got a bill that says that, with 24 hours' notice, we could,  as Members of Congress, go in there and inspect these facilities.   So these are some of the pieces of legislation, practical solutions,  that we are working on to overhaul the system and improve this  situation.   And, real quick, I mentioned that trip last week to Clint and to El  Paso Border Patrol station number one. It was a very intense visit and  very tense, also, a lot of people on that trip. It was about half and  half, half CHC members, half not CHC members, but there were many  people who stepped up, and particularly the women who were on that  trip.   I got some video that I released. But there are other portions of  that, in that room, other times in that room, where Madeleine Dean,  Ayanna Pressley, and, of course, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were pressing  the CBP officers and a doctor there to explain why these folks were  being neglected.   In fact, to give a lot of credit to Alexandria, we would not have  been able to go into that room and I would not have been able to  document what had happened except for the fact that she basically  insisted and barged into that room to go see and talk to those women.   Nanette Barragan was great.    Joe Kennedy, he and I went over to another cell, and we spoke to a  woman who was in the early stages of pregnancy. She was there with  another family that included a young boy. They had a seat that was  working, actually. But what I noticed was, in their cell, they were  reusing the same, like, seven or eight or nine paper cups over and  over.   Paper cups are cups you throw away or you recycle and you get another  one. They were making these people use the same paper cups day after  day. For what?    That is absolutely right.   These folks may not be citizens, they are not legal residents when  they present themselves, but they are human beings. This is the most  powerful, prosperous, and, we believe, humane country on the face of  this Earth. We should be treating them a lot better than we are  treating them. I firmly believe that the overwhelming majority of  Americans believe that, regardless of their politics.   Madam Speaker, Mr. Gomez read the names of the six children who have  died over the last several months. Over the last few years, there have  been about 24 adults who have died. I have only been able to find 16 of  their names, but I want to read their names also to remember them:   Yimi Alexis Balderramos-Torres;   Johana Medina Leon;   Simratpal Singh;   Abel Reyes-Clemente;   Guerman Volkov;   Mergensana Amar;   Wilfredo Padron;   Augustina Ramirez-Arreola;   Efrain De La Rosa;   Huy Chi Tran;   Zeresenay Ermias Testfatsion;   Roxana Hernandez;   Ronald Cruz;   Gourgen Mirimanian;   Luis Ramirez-Marcano, and   Yulio Castro-Garrido.   May all of them rest in peace. May the children who also died rest in  peace. They were doing what people throughout the generations have  tried to do from all over the world who were fleeing oppression,  violence, and desperation. They were trying to make it to the United  States of America. They were trying to live in the United States of  America, and they died.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 39 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, July 11, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
