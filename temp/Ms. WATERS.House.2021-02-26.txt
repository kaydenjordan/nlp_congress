 Madam Speaker, I am so grateful that we have President  Biden's leadership in the White House to tackle the ongoing pandemic.  H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, carries out this plan  and delivers the relief that communities across this country need so  very much.   Critically, the bill provides more than $75 billion for programs in  my committee's jurisdiction, including $20 billion for emergency rental  assistance, $5 billion for 70,000 new housing vouchers, $10 billion in  homeowner assistance, $10 billion to boost emergency medical equipment  production, $10 billion for small businesses, and $15 billion for  airline workers.   I am so pleased that we are increasing the stimulus payments from  $600 to $2,000 for each of our constituents. I am a happy camper  tonight. This is what America needs.    Republicans ought to be a part of this; but if they are not, then we  are going without them.   With hunger growing and millions out of work and at risk of eviction  or foreclosure, America needs this bill passed into law. Vote ``yes''  on this bill.
