 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my Republican friends for  pointing out the advantages of natural gas.   I might add that we had, in the last Congress, a hearing about what  was the world's largest solar plant. This wasn't a plant that had solar  panels. It had thousands of mirrors pointing to three different towers  that would superheat the water, which would turn to steam and would  drive turbines to produce electricity.   I have one article here. This was from February 2014. It talked about  the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, sprawling across roughly  5 square miles of Federal land; that is Mojave Desert area near the  California-Nevada border. It had opened, and it was glorified. There  was $1.6 billion in Federal loans, $600-some-odd million in grants to  help them make their payments. Years later they paid 7 million--well, 2  years ago, they had paid back, I think they said, $7 million of the  $2.2 billion.   Anyway, this article was about the world's largest solar plant  scorching birds in the Nevada desert. From testimony we heard,  apparently this solar plant, as birds would fly through the superheated  sunlight, it would cause them to explode in flames, which is why the  locals called them flamers.    Originally, they were not expecting to have to spend a lot of money  cleaning mirrors with water. They thought it would just be dust. They  didn't anticipate all the flaming bird debris--some of them endangered  species, I am quite sure.   In a period of February through June, there were 290 of those flamers  that exploded in flames and scattered their bird debris. Anyway, that  was the solar side of it.   Since they had a contract to provide all this electricity and they  had used up their $2.2 billion, what do you do when you don't have $2.2  billion and the ability to burn up endangered species and you don't  have that kind of government grant? Well, you take just a little bit of  money and you do what they did: you use natural gas--very  environmentally friendly.   You can create a natural gas electrical plant very, very cheaply and  make up for what the fire, the flaming birds, and all the other things  did to slow down this great solar-powered plant. So there is a lot to  be said for natural gas.   We did have a hearing yesterday, and one of the things I did not get  to point out that I had highlighted but just didn't have enough time to  ask the inspector general about, since his conclusion was, even though  there were hundreds of pages that clearly reflected not just bias, but  angry, hateful animus against Donald Trump, Republicans--but certainly  Donald Trump--the IG, it seemed very clear to me, with hundreds of  pages documenting the overwhelming bias among those who were supposed  to be fair and impartial, figuratively depicting justice being blind,  well, it was as if IG Horowitz decided: Well, we have got all this  overwhelming bias, so that will make the Republicans happy. But I have  got so many Democratic friends, I don't want to get them permanently  upset with me, so I will just conclude that there is no evidence that  bias affected the investigation at all.   Yet, in his own report, IG Horowitz said, and this is in the  executive summary, page 9: ``Most of the text messages raising such  questions pertained to the Russia investigation, and the implication in  some of these text messages, particularly Strzok's August 8 text  message ('we'll stop' Candidate Trump from being elected) was that  Strzok might be willing to take official action to impact a  Presidential candidate's electoral prospects. Under these  circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to  prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the  Midyear''--the Hillary Clinton--``related investigative lead discovered  on the Weiner laptop was free from bias.''   Boy, is that an understatement. Here it is established beyond any  reasonable doubt Strzok not only hated Trump, was trying to impress his  mistress, but clearly, things he did showed their bias; and it is IG  Horowitz's own words that it was Strzok's decision, heading up this  investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Here they had tens or  hundreds of thousands of emails that were found on the Anthony Weiner  laptop, and it was Strzok's decision.   He had the authority to decide, and he did decide: We are not going  to really investigate that. We are not going to make that a priority.  We are going to push that aside and, instead, go after this so-called  Russia investigation involving Trump.   That, even standing alone, is overwhelming evidence of bias that  affected the investigation. I know Mr. Horowitz apparently was just  trying to keep from making all of his Democratic friends mad, so he  threw them this little gift: Clearly, there was all kinds of bias, but  I will say in my conclusions that I couldn't find that bias affected  [[Page H5356]]  the investigation where clearly it did. He said it in his own words it  was Strzok's decision, and he decided not to follow up on that.   In fact, with all of my friends across the aisle who continue to  repeat the mantra that Comey's October press conference cost Hillary  Clinton the election, despite the evidence that she was not a good  candidate, she didn't do what was needed to honestly and openly win an  election, when it came to these emails that needed to be investigated,  it sounds a whole lot more like what happened was that even Comey  calling that October press conference was a cover for Hillary Clinton,  because the alternative--kept hearing from sources, I believe, that  there were FBI agents who had found all these emails of Hillary  Clinton's that were supposed to be gone. They didn't have them. They  were destroyed. They were unavailable because she had obstructed  justice. She had obstructed justice by destroying evidence.   They thought all these emails were gone, and all of a sudden FBI  agents are in possession of these massive number of Clinton emails. And  so Comey sat on them.   If Comey had not called that press conference, then it appears what  was likely going to happen, you were either going to have FBI agents  who learned from Comey how you go about leaking--and we saw the  information from IG Horowitz that apparently there were agents at the  top who were quite good at leaking information, even getting tickets  and different things in return for their leaking, that those agents  would have leaked that information.   And when it came out that they knew they had found all these missing  Clinton emails and Comey was sitting on it, he was obstructing justice,  then that would have doomed the Clinton campaign. She would have lost  by a whole lot bigger once it came out that Comey was blocking,  obstructing, not allowing them to investigate these newfound--well,  they had been found for a month. They were sitting on them.   We found out at the hearing yesterday that, actually, Rosenstein made  the decision not to allow Congress to have those for the last month.  Who knows how long he may have known about them.   He really does need to be fired. He needs to go. Clearly, he has  obstructed Congress' investigation. The question is how much  obstruction of justice did Rosenstein do back in 2016. We don't know.  But we do know there was obstruction.   Apparently, according to Horowitz, it was Strzok who had the  authority to decide are we going to dig into these newly found or  month-long found emails from Hillary Clinton or are we just going to  set those aside because they might hurt Hillary Clinton's election and,  instead, go after this Russia investigation--totally bogus--based on  purchases by the Clinton campaign.                                time  1815    And Strzok--his decision--he decided, I am not going to pursue this  evidence that actually blows Hillary Clinton's claims out of the water.  Instead, we are going to pursue Trump.   That is one overwhelming piece of evidence where the bias affected  the investigation. It could have blown the campaign out of the water  where it wouldn't have even been close.   But rather than Comey allowing it to leak out, there were also  rumors--and, like I say, I had good sources and others had good sources  and indications that we might even have one or more FBI agents resign  over Comey and Strzok obstructing the Clinton email being investigated.  If FBI agents had either resigned and had a press conference and  disclosed how Strzok and Comey were obstructing justice and preventing  the investigation into Hillary's emails that had been in their  possession for a month, that would have devastated the Clinton campaign  far worse.   So Comey, not wanting to hurt the Clinton campaign, preferring to  hurt Trump, called a press conference. As I said in some interview back  in October when I was asked about whether or not this was a serious  investigation, I said: Well, if he comes back in 2 or 3 days and says  there is nothing there, then we will know for certain that this was  simply an effort to protect Hillary Clinton, because, clearly, they  could not properly investigate all of those emails in such a short  period of 2 or 3 days.   Sure enough, just a couple of days later, Comey comes out of a press  conference: Gee, we have investigated this massive number of emails,  and Hillary Clinton is clean.   So, rather than destroying her campaign, Comey's action, it appears-- more likely, actually--saved her campaign and allowed it to be closer.   So that is just a little bit of information that I didn't get to  yesterday.   Now, it is absolutely incredible what has gone on, not on our  southern border--that is amazing enough--but all of the mayhem that has  been raised by the media. All of the outrage that has been expressed by  Democrats is really extraordinary when we look at the facts about what  has been going on since 1997--not new laws, not terribly new laws that  this administration is working with. Unlike the Obama administration,  this administration has not seen fit to just speak new laws into  existence.   Like with DACA, President Obama, like any good totalitarian monarch,  spoke that he wanted this law. He didn't even sign the new royal edict;  he just spoke it into law. Then Jeh Johnson, head of Homeland Security,  drafted some memos to create it. Now, it overruled existing law,  overruled law that had been passed by bipartisan efforts here in the  House and Senate, signed by people like Bill Clinton and others. But,  anyway, he spoke it into law.   Here we have an administration that really does want to follow the  law. I had been down on the border all hours of the night and day as  well. But during the Obama Presidency, I had been down on our border. I  had seen children separated from the adults they were with talking to  Border Patrol agents.   We have heard from ICE. Of course, what is being thrown figuratively  and literally at ICE agents is really outrageous. What is being hurled  in the way of both words and actions toward people simply following the  law that even Democrats helped create is really outrageous.   There is an article here by Michelle Mark dated June 19 from Business  Insider: ``Several former Obama administration officials took to social  media and news outlets last month to explain a gallery of years-old  photos that showed immigrant children sleeping in shoddy conditions at  a government-run holding facility in Arizona.   ``The images, which the Associated Press first published in 2014,  resurfaced recently for reasons that remain unclear, and quickly  prompted viral outrage on Twitter. One particularly disturbing image  showed two children sleeping on mattresses on the floor inside what  appeared to be a cage.''   That was the Obama administration, the very thing that people are  going nuts about, screaming and hollering.   ``A number of prominent liberals--and even a former Obama  administration official--shared the photos, mistakenly believing they  depicted the Trump administration's treatment of immigrant children who  were forcibly separated from their parents.''   Obviously, these former Obama officials did not realize that this was  what they did to children. And then to be holier-than-thou with an  administration that simply is enforcing the law the Obama  administration often violated when they were guilty of actually  following the law themselves? They could have made better conditions.   I am happy to report that the conditions I see under the Trump  administration down on our southern border are much better than they  were under the Obama administration. The facilities for children are  much, much better. I mean, there were some really terrible situations  that the Obama administration created down on our border during  President Obama's terms, especially the second term. It was a bit  shocking what was happening to children then.   It has been amazing. There was one child holding on to a fence, and  that was used to show how terrible it was for this sweet little child.  It turns out that was part of an immigration protest. This kid wasn't  in any kind of cage. In fact, the other pictures that have now been  discovered show that it was apparently some adult figure who was part  of the protest and dragged the kid there, but it certainly was not  someone caged by the Trump administration.  [[Page H5357]]    But this goes on to say: ``Jon Favreau, who worked as a speechwriter  for former President Barack Obama, tweeted, `This is happening right  now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to  get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.'    ``Favreau said he later deleted the tweet after social media users  pointed out that the photos were taken during the Obama administration.  But by that point, critics had already rushed to accuse him of  concealing Obama's own harsh immigration tactics while condemning  Trump's.   ``Favreau said in a series of tweets that he made a `mistake' by not  checking the date of the photos before sharing them on Twitter. He  explained that the photos were taken in 2014, when the Obama  administration faced `an influx of unaccompanied minors who showed up  at the border, fleeing violence from Central America.' ''   Well, I can tell you, there were many of these people I saw all hours  of the night that weren't fleeing violence, but they had heard they had  opportunities. I have been there when small children were being passed  among--well, the Border Patrol is at one end of the group of people  that had come in illegally asking questions, and they are shuffling  around trying to decide who is going to claim this child. And then, on  some occasions, they say: Oh, no, no, no, not with me, not with them.  No, they are by themselves.   Well, I watched you just walk up here taking care of this child.   No, they were unaccompanied.   It is also interesting, with all of the outrage about the 12,000  children that were being so well taken care of, 10,000 of the 12,000  came unaccompanied, was the claim, and 40 percent of those coming are  teenage males of gang age. We know, it turns out, many of them are gang  members.   We know, just recently, there was an MS-13 member claiming a child.  It may have been his child. But that child did not need to be with a  MS-13 gang member.   We know, during the Obama administration, during the George W. Bush  administration, and during the Clinton administration, it was not  uncommon to separate children from a parent if they believed the parent  might not be in the best interest of the child, may be a threat to the  child.   Again, for heaven's sake, these children, whether accompanied or  unaccompanied, were placed by their parents in a position to cross  deadly territory, be subjected to sex trafficking themselves, be  subjected to becoming drug traffickers. If those things happen in this  country, I have seen it as a judge when there were hearings--I didn't  do juvenile law, but I saw it. I had seen hearings.   You have parents, if they let their child here in Texas, in America,  do the things that parents from other countries allowed their children  to go through, there is a good chance, at least in Texas, Child  Protective Services would have grabbed that child and said: This is an  unfit parent to let them go across a desert, to let them be in the  hands of gang members, or to let them be subjected to sex trafficking  and drug trafficking.   I have also been there when the Border Patrol has asked--it wasn't on  their list--but frequently they would ask: How much do you pay to the  gang or the drug cartel to bring you in?   $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000.   Where did you get that kind of money? You didn't have that kind of  money.   Often, the final answer, after, $1,000 or $1,500 here, or $2,000  there, or somebody from America sent this: Well, where did you get the  rest? Often the final answer was: They are going to let me work that  off when I get to where we are going.   Well, how do you work it off?   It is either drug trafficking or sex trafficking is the way that  normally got worked off. Any parent that would subject their children  to that--like I say, 10,000 out of 12,000 were unaccompanied who are  down there right now when they are trying to figure out what is to be  done.   The outrage ought to be with parents that would allow that to happen,  and the outrage ought to be with a political party or with any  political people that would hang out a shiny object of a great life  here--free benefits, welfare--if you will just come across a desert,  risk sex trafficking, risk drug trafficking, come on.   Now, the border has to be secure. That is the humane thing to do. If  we stop the $80 billion or so in drugs that came across our border,  estimated last year by some, then the corruption in Mexico and Central  America dries up to next to nothing. Those people would end up with a  better economy, a better life, and better jobs. That is what we would  do if we were a true caring, loving neighbor. We would make sure that  our wall made a good neighbor stop the drug trafficking.   And these poor people who made to be drug mules, made to be drug  traffickers, they are poisoning Americans. I mean, it is a matter of  national security.   Donald Trump is exactly right to be so concerned and to want a zero- tolerance policy, and so is Jeff Sessions.                                time  1830    We can deal with this issue, but it is a very small percentage that  are actual parents that are being separated from children. And there  were parents being separated from children in the prior administration,  even though the Dallas Morning News obviously either doesn't want to  admit it or wants to remain in total blissful ignorance. So these  things have happened, and the Trump administration is trying to fix  them and do things correctly.   Now, it turns out that when our Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen  was at a Mexican restaurant Tuesday night, she had people screaming at  her trying to ruin her dinner and accusing her of doing what others in  the Obama administration had done. It turns out one of those was an  employee at the Department of Justice.   Some would say, but, again, political beliefs shouldn't adversely  affect a job with the government.   Well, it should when that job is enforcing the law. When you work for  the Department of Justice and you are going to scream at people because  they are following the law, then you should not be at the Department of  Justice.   This person that was screaming and becoming a nuisance and creating  problems and screaming out in ignorance should not be working at the  Department of Justice, just as anybody who is biased for Hillary  Clinton or against Hillary Clinton should not have been investigating  Hillary Clinton. Anybody biased for or against Donald Trump should not  have been investigating Donald Trump. It does matter.   I guarantee you Democratic criminal defense attorneys, even though  there was some expressed feigned outrage, if they had a client who had  run for office that was on trial for a criminal charge, that criminal  defense attorney would want to know which jurors supported their client  and which were totally opposed to their client in the last election.  They would want to know that. Maybe you do that in chambers, maybe you  do that at the bench, but I have a feeling--I have heard those claims  from defense attorneys about the right to know about things. Sometimes  it is very personal information, but if it tells a defense attorney  about someone's bias or prejudice within a potential juror, that  defense attorney really does have a right to know in order to protect  their client and to ensure that justice is done by fair and impartial  arbiters.   But we have got people at the Justice Department still that are not  fair, they are not impartial.   There is a new record here, according to Paul Bedard's article  yesterday from the Washington Examiner, ``New Record, 99 Percent of  Seized Border Kids From Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.''   Obama prosecuted nearly half a million illegal aliens. He did. I  think in those situations, they were trying to follow the law.   The only reason I bring that up is the feigned outrage. For some  people, it is not feigned; they are really outraged, because they  really don't realize what has gone on before. Some of us have seen it.   Now, a 100 percent no-tolerance policy, that is much stricter than  the Obama administration. But President Obama and Hillary Clinton are  both on video talking about how they were going to do those type of  things to discourage people from coming in illegally. And now they  really are feigning outrage, and it needs to stop.  [[Page H5358]]    Let's work together for a solution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
