 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1520, the Purple Book Continuity Act.  This bill has moved through regular order in the Energy and Commerce  Committee and does, in fact, have broad bipartisan support. This may be  only a small part of solving the problems of drug pricing, however, it  is an important part of that question.   Through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, Congress  established a pathway for biosimilars to enter the therapeutic market  so that patients would have more treatment options, more access to  lifesaving medications, and lower healthcare costs.   As the Food and Drug Administrator, at the time, Scott Gottlieb  announced, there is a four-point plan to increase biosimilar  availability. The plan would focus on increasing market competition by  reducing delays to entry; improving the efficiency of biosimilar  development; maximize the clarity of the regulatory process; and  develop a communications strategy to promote biosimilars.   The Purple Book plays an important role in biosimilar development. It  lists the licensed biologic products, including any biosimilar or  interchangeable biologic product, and any relevant exclusivity  information. The Purple Book is not currently required by law and takes  the form of two separate and sometimes cumbersome PDF files.   H.R. 1520 codifies the Purple Book and requires the Food and Drug  Administration to publish the information in a searchable format,  similar to the Orange Book. This bill will make the Purple Book a more  useful tool for developers of biosimilars, in addition to providers,  payors, and patients.   The Food and Drug Administration provided us with some important  feedback that would ensure that the agency will be able to effectively  implement this legislation should it become law. Enhancing the Purple  Book is critical to the transparency of the relevant intellectual  property protections, as well as other factors considered by the  developers of biosimilars.   So I certainly want to thank the chairwoman for her willingness to  work with us and the agency on this important issue. I am pleased to  cosponsor this bill, and I urge other Members to support it this  afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I urge support of this bill  upon passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1503, the Orange Book  Transparency Act of 2019. This is a bipartisan product that moved  through the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I would like to thank  Representative Robin Kelly for introducing this legislation.   The publication of the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic  Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book, lists drug products  that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on the  basis of safety and effectiveness. Importantly, the Orange Book lists  therapeutic equivalence evaluations for approved multisource  prescription drug products in addition to relevant patent and  exclusivity information.   This publication provides information to State health agencies,  prescribers, and to others to inform decisionmaking, and allow for the  containment of healthcare costs, as well as educate the public.  [[Page H3488]]                                     time  1230    A preliminary version of the Orange Book was produced in 1979. It was  not until 1984, with the enactment of the Drug Price Competition and  Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the Hatch- Waxman Act, that Congress codified the Orange Book.   This bill amends existing statute to make the Orange Book more  useful, particularly for manufacturers of generic drugs. Enactment of  this bill will allow these manufacturers to know which branded products  face competition and when those products will no longer be protected by  patents. Insurance companies, doctors, and patients will be able to  determine when a generic alternative is available for a more expensive  branded product.   The Food and Drug Administration is already performing the practices  contained in this bill, but the legislation would codify current  practices and ensure that certain patents are listed in the Orange  Book. Additionally, patents that are found invalid would have to be  removed following the conclusion of any appeals process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the Republican ranking member of the Oversight  and Investigations Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 1503 would support the work that the Food and Drug  Administration is already conducting and facilitate competition in the  marketplace. Therefore, I urge my fellow Members to support this  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
