 Mr. Speaker, what it really boils down to is choice for  Americans, affordable choices. Just because we want to be part of this  green agenda here, constantly crying about climate change doesn't mean  it is going to be good for Americans.   These mandates, for example, on trucks will add 16,000 pounds of  weight that is no longer part of the cargo capacity for trucks. On  automobiles, it is adding about $13,000 to the price of a car.   Little credit has been given for how efficient and clean internal  combustion engines run these days. This is all a big CO2  scam. I remind you; CO2 is only 0.04 percent of our  atmosphere.   Let's go back in the direction of allowing people to have choices of  the best manufactured cars that come from right here in America instead  of giving it over to China, which is what will happen on the mined  products, the labor, so many other things.   Americans can figure out what they like. They certainly don't need  California mandates that have already failed in the past and the  Federal Government dictating to them what their choices are in driving.   H.R. 4468 is a good, righteous bill. Let's support that and help  people continue to have the choices they want in this country and not  be mandated by Congress or certainly California.
