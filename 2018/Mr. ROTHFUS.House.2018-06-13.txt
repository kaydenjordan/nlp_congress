 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, H.R.  6029, the Reauthorizing and Extending Grants for Recovery from Opioid  Use Programs Act of 2018, or the REGROUP Act.   In simple terms, this bill will help our Nation continue the fight  against the opioid crisis. The REGROUP Act does two things. First, it  reauthorizes and extends the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program  administered through the Department of Justice for an additional 2  years through 2023. Second, it also raises authorized funding levels  for these programs from $103 million to $330 million for each fiscal  year.                                time  1445    Mr. Speaker, back in my district in western Pennsylvania, the opioid  crisis is still a huge problem that continues to destroy lives, hurt  families, and plague entire communities.   While we have made some progress, there is much more work to be done.  Therefore, we must not only continue to support the Comprehensive  Opioid Abuse Program, but enhance it with additional funding.   Originally authorized in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act  of 2016, or CARA, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program authorized  valuable grant resources to States and localities suffering from the  epidemic. These competitive grant programs offer a wide variety of  support at all phases of this fight, from first responders to those  suffering from substance abuse.   More specifically, the DOJ has developed various grant programs for  first responders fighting on the front lines, programs that support  drug courts and veteran treatment courts. It also provides grants for  increasing collaboration between criminal justice agencies and  substance abuse agencies. Furthermore, it even has programs that help  develop the prescription drug monitoring programs.   For example, back in Beaver County and Allegheny County, we have  veteran treatment courts that provide alternative justice systems where  those who suffer from addiction and who run afoul of the law can  actually receive the care, treatment, and intervention they need.   The alternate systems that these courts offer are precisely the type  of programs that the REGROUP Act will support. Courts like these help  break the cycle of addiction for individuals and, hopefully, save lives  in the process. Our whole society benefits when someone breaks the  chain of addiction.   Mr. Speaker, if we are to end the opioid crisis, we must attack this  problem at all levels. We must be committed to this fight for the long  term, and we must increase support for these programs. The REGROUP Act  will help us continue this fight against the opioid crisis.
