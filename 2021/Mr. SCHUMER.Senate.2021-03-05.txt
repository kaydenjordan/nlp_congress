 Madam President, first and foremost, I want to thank  everyone--everyone on the floor staff who worked late into the night  and into the wee hours of the morning to finish reading the Senate  amendment to the American Rescue Plan.   The folks who sit up here on the dais come to work every day with a  very serious job to do, helping the Senate come to life and fulfill its  purpose under the Constitution. I am sure you all didn't expect that  part of your job this week would entail standing on your feet and  reading dense legislation for more than 10 hours straight.   I can't imagine that is anyone's idea of a good time, but, as usual,  our staff took their additional duties in stride and carried them out  with professionalism and grace, finishing around 3 in the morning, and  you are all right back on your posts this morning.   Thank you, thank you, thank you for your service, your dedication.  You are the unsung heroes of this place.   To all of the critical workers, not just those here on the dais--the  clerks, the stenographers, the Capitol Police officers, the floor  staff--to all of you: Thank you, thank you, thank you for your efforts  yesterday and every day.   And as for our friend from Wisconsin, I hope he enjoyed his Thursday  evening.                            ____________________     Madam President, a year ago this week, Congress began  work on what would become the CARES Act, the opening salvo in a  yearlong battle against what, at the time, was a strange and new  disease. I don't think anyone could have anticipated that a year hence  we would have lost more than 10 million jobs and over half a million  citizens.   Even as the vaccine makes its way across the country, and hope  shimmers on the horizon, millions of Americans  [[Page S1218]]  are still struggling with basic necessities. Folks are thousands of  dollars behind on the rent and utilities. Their heat, water and power  are getting shut off. More than a million Americans on unemployment  insurance report that their kids aren't getting enough to eat.   Sometimes the macrostatistics get in the way because the top end is  doing very well, the top 10 percent or 25 percent, but so many other  people are struggling. And if you just look at a big number, you say:  Oh, everything is getting a little better. It is not for the lower half  of America. It is not.   I read about one of my constituents recently, Allilsa Fernandez, from  Queens, who had a job as a home healthcare aide lined up at the start  of the pandemic but couldn't take it because of her family's  preexisting medical conditions. Her mother was in the hospital with  COVID. Her income went from $3,400 a month to just $1,000.         It was a huge, huge loss--    She said.         I have medications, my electric bill, the phone bill, and       [the] other costs. Every day you . . . have to make . . .       decisions: Am I going to eat?    In America, that should not be the case. It shouldn't be at any time  but particularly when an evil disease has robbed our hard-working  people of their income, their livelihood.   ``Am I going to eat?'' And we are supposed to sit here and do  nothing? We are supposed to say to Ms. Fernandez, and so many like her,  we are not giving you the help you need?   Ms. Fernandez hasn't been able to pay the rent since April of last  year, over $16,000 worth. And this bill will help people like her, but  it will also prevent people from getting into Ms. Fernandez's place:  people who work for State and local governments who might be laid off,  people who work for small businesses who might be laid off.   It is the job of this government, during this evil pandemic, to  assist American families, businesses, and workers like Ms. Fernandez  until this pandemic is over. It is also our job to prevent others from  falling into the same awful situation that Ms. Fernandez finds herself.  It is our job to hasten the day when Americans can go back to work, our  country can go back to normal, our economy can come roaring back. We  can reduce that awfully high actual 10 percent unemployment. That is  what the American Rescue Plan will do.   It will send direct checks to American workers and families  struggling with the cost of groceries, medicine, and the rent. The vast  majority of Americans will get the full $1,400 we have asked for. It  will help reopen schools as quickly and safely as possible. It will  help the hardest hit small businesses hang on. It will keep  firefighters and teachers and busdrivers and sanitation workers on the  job. It will help American families stay in their homes, care for their  children, put food on the table, and it will give our country the  resources, the vaccination and testing, that it needs to crush the  virus once and for all.   All told, the American Rescue Plan will be one of the largest anti- poverty bills in recent history, cutting child poverty just about in  half. The entire country has gotten behind the bill: business leaders,  mayors, Governors, from big cities, small towns, Red States, Blue  States, Democrat, Republican.   The clear majority of the American people--Democrats, Independents,  and Republicans--all support the American Rescue Plan. It seems the  only group in America who doesn't support the American Rescue Plan are  Washington Republicans.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say $1.9 trillion is too  expensive. Well, my Republican colleagues didn't think it was too  expensive when they gave nearly the same amount in tax breaks to  corporations and the ultrarich in a healthy economy, not one that is  struggling.   My colleagues claim this bill isn't related to COVID. What hogwash.  It is a strange thing to say because most of the measures in the bill  are exactly the same ideas Republicans supported a year ago in the  CARES Act, which passed without a single dissenting Republican vote.   Direct checks, in the CARES Act; enhanced unemployment insurance, in  the CARES Act; assistance for State and local governments, in the CARES  Act; funding for testing and the vaccine, in the CARES Act; aid to  schools and small businesses, in the CARES Act. All of them were in the  CARES Act, which every Republican voted for, and now they are saying  the American Rescue Plan, which has the basic, same structure, is not  related to COVID.   When we passed the CARES Act, we all thought that maybe COVID would  be gone by the summer. It isn't. We need to keep at it in the same way.  Every single Republican who voted for the CARES Act and those ideas a  year ago, when a Republican was in the White House and Republicans  controlled the Senate, is now saying no, it seems. But now that a  Democrat is in the White House, now that Democrats control the Senate,  those same ideas, which they supported when Trump was President and  McConnell was majority leader, are a liberal wish list--same ideas. Who  the heck are they kidding? They have no good answer.   But let's face it, we need to get this done. It would be so much  better if we could in a bipartisan way, but we need to get it done.   We are not going to make the same mistake we made after the last  economic downturn when Congress did too little to help the Nation  rebound, locking us into a long, slow, painful recovery, where it was  years before employment was back to where it was before that crisis.   We are not, we are not going to be timid in the face of big  challenges. We are not, we are not going to delay when urgent action is  called for. The Senate will move forward today with the American Rescue  Plan. There will be a lengthy amendment process, as the rules of the  Senate require. The Senate is going to take a lot of votes, but we are  going to power through and finish this bill however long it takes. The  American people are counting on us, and our Nation depends on it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the agreement that has been reached will  allow us to move forward with the American Rescue Plan, and voting will  resume shortly.   Senate Democrats are completely united in our belief about how  important this entire bill is for our fellow Americans; for getting the  vaccine to our people; for reopening our schools; for keeping American  workers, families, and businesses afloat; and for putting our country  on the road to a strong recovery.   Now that this agreement has been reached, we are going to power  through the rest of the process and get this bill done. Make no  mistake, we are going to continue working until we get the job done.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, good morning.   Now, it looks like we have about 14 amendments left, and 1 or 2 of  those may be voice-voted. So I would ask that we all stay in our seats  so we can expedite the process. I would ask that we try to accomplish  these votes in no more than 10 minutes so that we can move forward.   I yield the floor.    No.    Mr. President, I am pleased that we have finally come to  this point. This amendment makes a series of conforming and technical  changes. It strikes provisions that the  [[Page S1262]]  Parliamentarian advised were extraneous. It makes a series of  perfecting changes on behalf of reconciled committees while preserving  the will that the Senate has worked over this long day.   I call up my amendment No. 1398 and ask that it be reported by  number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], proposes an       amendment numbered 1398 to amendment No. 891.    (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of  Amendments.'')    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate, equally divided.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, it has been a long day, a long night, a  long year, but a new day has come, and we tell the American people:  Help is on the way.   When Democrats assumed the majority in this Chamber, we promised to  pass legislation to rescue our people from the depths of the pandemic  and bring our economy and our country roaring back. In a few moments,  we are going to deliver on that promise.   This bill will deliver more help to more people than anything the  Federal Government has done in decades. It is broader, deeper, and more  comprehensive in helping working families and lifting people out of  poverty than anything Congress has seen or accomplished in a very long  time.   The pandemic has affected nearly every aspect of American life. So  this bill spans the gamut and provides support to every part of our  country. For Americans who doubted that the government can help them in  this time of crisis, you will be getting direct checks. Your schools  will receive assistance to reopen quickly and safely; your local  businesses will get another lifeline; and the day when you receive the  vaccine will be a lot sooner.   The American Rescue Plan will go down as one of the most sweeping  Federal recovery efforts in history. It is never easy to pass  legislation as momentous as this, but it will all and soon be worth it.   Now, I know that on Saturday morning the American people aren't  watching our proceedings here. They are probably out walking the dog or  sitting down at breakfast with the kids. But I want them to know help  is on the way; that their government is going to give one final push to  get us over the finish line.   I want the American people to know that we are going to get through  this, and someday soon our businesses will reopen; our economy will  reopen; and life will reopen. We will end this terrible plague, and we  will travel again and send our kids to school again and be together  again.   Our job right now is to help our country get from this stormy present  to that hopeful future, and it starts with voting aye on the  legislation before us. Vote yes on the American Rescue Plan. Vote yes.   And before I yield the floor, one final note. Let us all express our  deepest gratitude to all of my colleagues who went through a long, long  period in the last day; to the staffs of the committees and the  personnel in Senate offices who have worked so hard to put this  legislation together, and especially let us thank the great floor  staff: the clerks, the cafeteria workers, the custodial staff, and the  Capitol Police.   (Applause, Senators rising.   This bill includes important support for state and local governments,  allowing them to not only provide services that are needed to fight the  pandemic and support the economy, but also ensuring that teachers and  first responders don't need to be laid off and services don't need to  be cut.   We also know that this crisis is going to have lasting consequences  for State and local budgets, that many of the impacts won't just be  felt this year, but going forward given how disruptive the last year  was.   So in designing this funding, we split the money for localities into  two tranches, half to be delivered this year and half next year. For  States, the money is delivered up front, with the Secretary given the  discretion to calibrate timing of payments for some States based on  their unemployment rate. For States with lower unemployment rates, the  bill creates a structure for Treasury to work with States to spread the  funding out over the course of this recovery.   That will allow States and localities to get the money that they  need, but over a timeline that will best support the economy as it  recovers.   Additionally, below are names of the staff who worked tirelessly  towards the passage of this bill. I want to thank them for their  service, and I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the  Record.

My notes here say: ``Let's give them a round of applause.''   And, of course, one more thank-you to my great and wonderful staff. I  will thank all of them by name at a later date because I want them to  be awake and alert when I do.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    I just want to thank everybody. We are a great team. We  are a great team.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 12.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 27.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.  [[Page S1270]]     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls with respect to these motions be waived.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 15.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 1, S.  11.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday,  March 9, at 5:30 p.m., cloture ripen on, one, Executive Calendar No.  12, Marcia Fudge, to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and  Executive Calendar No. 27, Merrick Garland, to be Attorney General;  that the Senate proceed to vote on cloture on the Fudge nomination;  that if cloture is invoked, postcloture time expire on Wednesday, March  10, at 12 noon; further, that notwithstanding rule XXII, following the  cloture vote on the Fudge nomination, the Senate vote on cloture on the  Garland nomination; that if cloture is invoked on the Garland  nomination, postcloture time expire on Wednesday, March 10, at 2:15;  further, that cloture on the Regan nomination ripen following  disposition of the Garland nomination.    Mr. President, today's legislation takes a very  important step in providing financial assistance to multiemployer  pension plans, particularly those plans that have already had to  suspend benefits in order to save the plans from going insolvent. That  has been a very painful step for some plans in New York because it  resulted in retiree benefit cuts of as much as 60 percent.   This legislation will allow those plans to restore painful cuts and  ensure others on the brink do not have to take similar steps.   I will be watching how the administration implements this new program  very closely to ensure plans receiving financial assistance under the  new program are not placed in a worse long-term funding position than  they are today or are projected to be into the future. This new program  is intended to be a long-term solution for these ailing plans, a  solution that protects retiree benefits as well as the health of the  plans themselves.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m. on  Tuesday, March 9; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of  proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, morning business be closed,  and the Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of  the Fudge nomination, as provided under the previous order; finally, I  ask that the mandatory quorum call with respect to the Regan nomination  be waived.    Mr. President, for the information of Senators, the  Senate will not be in session on Monday, March 8. On Tuesday, there  will be two rollcall votes at 5:30 p.m. The first vote will be on the  motion to invoke cloture on the Fudge nomination to be Secretary of  HUD, followed by a cloture vote on the Garland nomination to be  Attorney General.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:05 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, March 9, 2021, at 3 p.m                            ____________________
