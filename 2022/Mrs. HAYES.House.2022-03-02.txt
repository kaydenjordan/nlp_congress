 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to  support the Honoring our PACT Act, which upholds the promise we made to  servicemembers that we would care for them if they became sick or  wounded while fighting to protect this country.   This legislation recognizes the full range of military toxic exposure  that servicemembers have faced.   This monumental package also includes my bill, the Palomares Veterans  Act, which would remove barriers to benefits and compensation for those  veterans who responded to one of the largest nuclear disasters in  history.   Over 55 years ago, a B-52 bomber collided with aircraft over the  Spanish village of Palomares, causing radiation exposure to more than  1,600 U.S. airmen who had no protection when they responded to the  crash.   Decades later, many of these airmen are suffering and dying from  health conditions that likely came from radioactive material. But the  VA still does not count Palomares as a radiation risk event or provide  these veterans with benefits or disability.   My bill, the Honoring our PACT Act, would address this, ensuring  these veterans get the healthcare and benefits they deserve and  ensuring their surviving spouses and children are eligible for  benefits.   The job of Congress is to appropriate funds, yet whenever we want to  help people, my Republican colleagues say no. If we are not willing to  support our veterans, what are we willing to support?
