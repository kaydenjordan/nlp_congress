 Mr. President, I rise today to salute Justice  Gary E. Hicks for his many years of dedicated service in the New  Hampshire judicial branch. Justice Hicks recently retired from his role  as senior associate justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, a  culmination of a long legal career that also included 23 years as a  commercial litigator and 5 years as a Superior Court judge. He leaves a  legacy worthy of our praise and our gratitude.   Justice Hicks has firm roots in New Hampshire. He was born in West  Stewartstown and raised in nearby Colebrook, two close-knit communities  in northern New Hampshire near the U.S.-Canada border. His father ran  the local hardware store on Main Street in Colebrook, Hicks Hardware.  Justice Hicks started working in the store at age 12, and he often  observes that the service-oriented and problem-solving aspects of that  job proved useful in his later career as a judge. Even when his duties  as a justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court kept him close to the  State capital, Justice Hicks still found time to visit family and  friends in his hometown and mentor students at his alma mater,  Colebrook Academy.   He left Colebrook after high school to attend Bucknell University. At  the encouragement of his wife Patricia, Justice Hicks then enrolled in  law school and received his J.D. from Boston University School of Law  in 1978. He worked as a commercial litigator for 23 years at a  prestigious New Hampshire law firm. In a short time, Justice Hicks  developed a reputation for his compassion, his kindness, his intellect,  and his thorough understanding of the law.   As Governor of New Hampshire, I had the honor of nominating Gary  Hicks to fill a vacancy on the New Hampshire Superior Court in 2001. He  brought the same integrity and work ethic to the bench, and he later  wrote that his experience as a Superior Court judge was both  fascinating because of the breadth of issues he encountered and  rewarding because of the many people who obtained justice through the  legal system. When there was a vacancy on the New Hampshire Supreme  Court in 2006, Governor John Lynch nominated Gary Hicks for a position  on New Hampshire's highest court. An elated Justice Hicks referred to  the appointment as his ``life's ambition.''   Friends, colleagues and fellow jurists are quick to point to one  character trait in particular when describing Justice Hicks. He is an  incredibly thoughtful person who is generous with his time and takes  great care to use his legal talents to get it right. His thoughtfulness  emerges not only in the many cases to which he applied an even  temperament and careful deliberation, but also in his treatment and  mentorship of law clerks and new attorneys. Many of his former law  clerks, including my daughter Stacey, remember his patience and  guidance as they navigated complicated legal questions, and they  continue to draw on their formative experience with Justice Hicks when  resolving difficult issues later in their careers. They benefited  tremendously from his goodwill. In many respects, Justice Hicks is a  living testament to one of his literary heroes, the dignified,  reasoned, genuine, and inspiring character of Atticus Finch from ``To  Kill A Mockingbird.''   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all  Americans to join me in thanking Justice Gary Hicks for his many years  of service to New Hampshire and his fellow Granite Staters. In  retirement, he plans to spend more time with his grandchildren and  expand his involvement with the advanced studies program at St. Paul's  School in Concord, NH. We wish him all the best in this new chapter of  his life.                            ____________________
