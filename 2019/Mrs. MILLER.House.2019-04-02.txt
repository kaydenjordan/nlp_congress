 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 540, which names a post  office located in Fairport, New York, in honor of Louise and Bob  Slaughter.   Louise Slaughter was a Member of the House body for over 30 years.  From 1987 until she passed away last year, Representative Slaughter was  a tireless advocate for the people of her upstate New York district.   In addition to her numerous legislative accomplishments,  Representative Slaughter made a mark on this body as the first woman to  chair the House Committee on Rules.   Representative Slaughter was an intellectual and a beloved Member of  the House. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall).    Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the gentleman's  comments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 829 introduced by  Representative Lee Zeldin. The bill names a post office located in  Mastic, New York, in honor of Army Specialist Thomas J. Wilwerth.   Specialist Wilwerth joined the United States Army while he was still  in high school. He felt called to defend our Nation after the terrorist  attacks on September 11. After graduating high school, he was assigned  to the 1st Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team  based out of Fort Carson, Colorado.   In December 2005, Specialist Wilwerth was deployed to fight in  Operation Iraqi Freedom. On February 22, 2006, Specialist Wilwerth and  two others in his unit were killed by an improvised explosive device.   Specialist Thomas Wilwerth was 21 years old when he gave his life in  service to his Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill that makes a  technical change to correct the address of a post office named last  Congress.   The post office is named after Captain Humayun Khan, who sacrificed  his life in service of our country.   Captain Khan served in the Army Reserves while he studied at the  University of Virginia and was commissioned as an officer after he  graduated in 2000. In 2004, he was deployed to Iraq, and he was killed  on June 8, 2004.   This bill corrects the address, to ensure that the correct facility  is named in Captain Khan's honor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1600
