 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Amsterdam radio  legend, Sam Zurlo, on his retirement this week.   For over 60 years, Sam's voice has greeted the residents and visitors  of Montgomery County, New York. Sam has been working in broadcasting  since 1953. Now at 82, he hosts the longest-running talk show in the  history of the county.   Sam's broadcasting career was born from his service with Armed Forces  Radio in Germany, where he delivered a nightly broadcast for 3 years.  Sam also worked as a print journalist for the Schenectady Gazette for  some 35 years.   Decade after decade, his distinctive voice has been the catalyst for  free and open debate. He has brought an air of familiarity and of  community to our humble corner of upstate New York. Listening to  conversations about current events with Sam has always made the  abstractions of politics a little more real. Sam's personality has  inspired many and brought light, comfort, and connection to countless  neighbors and friends.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sam Zurlo for his years of exceptional work and  a legendary career in local journalism. I wish him the best for an  equally special retirement.
