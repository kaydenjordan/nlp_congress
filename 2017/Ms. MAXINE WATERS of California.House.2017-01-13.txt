 Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this  budget, which is designed to repeal--not replace--ObamaCare.   I am adamant about this because of what I have witnessed all of my  life. I am going to share with you--and some of you may have never  heard of these things--that I have watched people die from preventable  diseases.   I have watched, over the years, from the time I was a child, where  people had home remedies. They didn't have any prescription drugs.   I watched as my great-grandmother was in pain, in tears, because of  arthritis and rheumatism. We had to rub her down with something called  liniment.   I have watched men get up and try to go to work with pneumonia. They  tried to heal pneumonia with what was known as hot toddies.   I have watched as children have died. Little children used to walk  around with little bags around their neck with something in it called  asfidity that was supposed to protect them from harm. They had  pneumonia. They had colds. That is all they had. They didn't have a  doctor. They died from preventable diseases.   Now we have 20 million more people who are insured under this  healthcare plan. This is a healthcare plan for all Americans.   The Republicans will tell you that, yes, they are going to give you  something better, but they have been saying this for 8 years. They have  been after what is known as ObamaCare for 8 years. Why don't they have  a remedy? Why don't they have a plan? Why don't they have anything?   They didn't have anything when they started to attack ObamaCare, they  don't have anything today, and they are not going to have anything  better than the ACA.  [[Page H503]]
