 Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking also my  friend, Representative Pearce from New Mexico, for offering this  amendment with me.   Mr. Chair, during our committee work on portions of this bill, I  raised this issue and offered a similar amendment. So I appreciate  Representative Pearce for working with me to improve the bill for  Indian Country.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because it will  provide some limited, though not complete, legal protection for Indian  Tribes and their water rights. That said, I continue to have grave  concerns with the underlying bill and the impact it will have on Indian  Country.   Even if this amendment is adopted, the underlying bill will cause  significant harm to Indian Country. For example, in title 4 of this  bill, it blocks  [[Page H5530]]  emergency water releases that prevent disease outbreaks for Tribal  fisheries in California's Klamath River. The provision will  significantly increase the risk of widespread fish kills and lead to  tragic losses for Tribal communities.   While this amendment doesn't mitigate all of the negative impacts of  this bill, it will improve the bill somewhat by including an additional  legal protection for Tribal rights that will preserve past, pending, or  future Tribal water rights settlements.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for this amendment.
