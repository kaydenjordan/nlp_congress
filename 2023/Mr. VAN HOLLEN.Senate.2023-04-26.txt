 Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from  Connecticut for his words in support of the Equal Rights Amendment and  for his fight for justice.   Let me also thank my colleague, my Maryland partner and friend  Senator Cardin, for teaming up with Senator Murkowski to push for  passage of this legislation year after year. It is long overdue that we  take this up and that we pass it in the U.S. Senate.   If you look at our history during the darkest of times and against  the longest of odds, Americans from all backgrounds have stood together  to insist that America live up to its promise--the promise of equality,  the promise of equal rights for all.   In fact, if you think about the story of America, it really is the  story of the struggle to make good on that fundamental promise to  ensure that every individual receives equal dignity.  [[Page S1374]]    We talk about how we are endowed by our Creator with certain  unalienable rights, and that is true. There are not more rights for men  and not supposed to be more rights for any particular group. It is  supposed to be about equal dignity, and equal dignity should include  equal treatment under the law.   In their fight for voting rights, our Nation's suffragettes faced  unjust arrest. They faced persecution. They faced resistance from a  nation that was not yet willing to fulfill that full promise when it  came to voting rights. Despite it all, through protests, through  demands, through arrests, the suffragettes prevailed and made sure that  we passed the 19th Amendment, at least fulfilling the right to vote for  women.   But we have a lot of unfinished business. It is not just all men who  are created equal; it is all people who are created equal. We have  accomplished that when it comes to the ballot box. Although, as we in  this body know, we also have a long way to go to make sure that that is  made real in practice on the ground. That is why we have been fighting  to pass voting rights legislation. But we also need to make sure that,  when it comes to women's rights, we enshrine it in the highest law of  the land in order to give the rhetoric legal teeth and legal backing.   Alice Paul, who really is the founder of the movement for the Equal  Rights Amendment, knew that a century ago when she said:         I never doubted that equal rights was the right direction.       Most reforms, most problems are complicated. But to me, there       is nothing complicated about ordinary equality.    There is great truth in the simplicity of that statement, and that is  what equal rights is all about. It is not a lot of words, but they are  the rightly chosen words:         Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or       abridged by the United States or by any state on account of       sex.    That is it; a simple statement but a powerful statement because it is  a true statement if we really want to live up to our full promise.   That is why the overwhelming majority of the American people support  it. Seventy-five percent of our fellow Americans support the ERA.  Thirty-eight States have ratified it, enough to make the ERA our 28th  Amendment. Yet 100 years after the proposed amendment was first  introduced to Congress, despite this broad support and the ratification  of a necessary number of States, we have not yet made that part of our  Constitution.   The results are painfully clear every day. My colleagues have talked  about some of them: the persistent pay gap, which disadvantages not  only women but also the families that they support. Recent rulings by  the Supreme Court on reproductive rights have shown that the lack of an  explicit protection against gender discrimination puts women's  fundamental rights at risk and on the chopping block. So this is the  moment to finally get this done.   I, again, want to thank Senator Cardin and Senator Murkowski for  their efforts to move forward on this. I want to thank the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee.   As I close, I do want to say a few words about my friend and  colleague from Maryland's long-term fight for this and applaud him for  over a decade of working to make sure that we get the ERA across the  finish line.   It has been one very important aspect--in fact, the cornerstone of  many of his efforts here in the United States--but it is a reflection  of his fights for civil rights, for women's rights, for racial rights,  and for human rights around the world. I want to thank him for his  persistence on this and so many issues that call upon us to be what we  say we are as Americans--people who believe in the equal dignity of  every individual and the rights of every individual. I want to thank my  colleague. I want to thank him for teaming up with Senator Murkowski  from Alaska and thank her for her efforts.   I said at the beginning that we have been defined as an American  story by our struggle to make good on that original promise, the idea  of equal rights. Many people have tried to interpret it in different  ways, but I think we all understand, at the end of the day, the North  Star is equal rights. It means equal rights for everybody, not just  equal rights for some people over here, because that is not equal  rights.   That is as simple as what brings us here to the floor. I want to  thank my colleague, again, from Maryland for keeping this fight going.   I really hope my Republican colleagues will take this moment, despite  what we expect, to enshrine that simple proposition into the  Constitution of the United States.   I yield the floor.
