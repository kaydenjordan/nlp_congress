 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule. It  sets into motion the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.   This repeal-only bill takes money intended to fund health care for  middle class families and it hands it to the wealthy families and to  big health corporations in the form of tax cuts. The public does not  know this.  [[Page H484]]    According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, this bill  would give the 400 highest income families in the United States an  average tax cut of $7 million a year. It would rob millions of families  of the money they need for their insurance. It hands it over to the  wealthy, including nearly $250 billion over 10 years in tax cuts for  health insurance companies and drug manufacturers.                                time  1015    Where are the majority's values? We should be providing more  Americans with health insurance, not fewer; and we should be creating  jobs, not eliminating them. This bill is a disgrace. It is a betrayal  of the working families of this Nation.    A report by Families U.S.A. said that repeal of the  Affordable Care Act equals a huge tax cut for the wealthy.   What people don't know, and the public doesn't know at the moment, is  that this will hand over to wealthy and major corporations new tax  breaks worth nearly $600 million--more than a half-trillion dollars  over 10 years, $345.8 billion over 10 years in tax cuts for people  whose incomes are over a specified threshold; $200,000 for single  individuals; and $250,000 for families. There are $274.4 billion over  10 years going to health insurance companies, drug manufacturers, and  other large healthcare corporations.   That is what repeal of the Affordable Care Act does. My colleagues  need to face up to that, and the public needs to know it.
