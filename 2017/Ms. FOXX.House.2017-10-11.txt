 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the work of a very  wonderful constituent of the Fifth District of North Carolina, Teresa  Lewis.   Every September, we celebrate American Business Women's Day in order  to recognize the many different backgrounds and diverse occupations of  American businesswomen. However, it is my belief that we should  celebrate American businesswomen like Teresa Lewis every day.   Teresa's success was born out of determination and the desire to  provide a better life for her family. In 1986, Teresa founded WorkForce  Carolina, a professional staffing service that includes recruitment,  interview completion, and skills assessment.   As CEO of WorkForce Carolina, Teresa has employed thousands of  people, and her company has served as a boon to the North Carolina  economy.   Most importantly, Teresa serves as a role model to all women and men  in our country. I commend Teresa Lewis on all of her many  accomplishments and thank her for all she does for the community.                            ____________________
