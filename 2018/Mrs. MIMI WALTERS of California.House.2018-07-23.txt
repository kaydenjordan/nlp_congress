 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask  unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which  to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on  the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, House  Republicans made a promise to the American people that there was a  better way forward under our leadership. Our Better Way Agenda outlined  a pathway toward safer communities, a stronger military, and a robust  economy. Since then, House Republicans have compiled a record of  results, not rhetoric. Thanks to this progress, the American people are  better off now.   Republicans started by moving bills that address some of the biggest  issues plaguing cities and towns across the country:    We have passed over 50 bills to put an end to the opioid epidemic in  our communities.   FOSTA, which will dismantle the online sex trafficking industry, was  signed into law.   We are also keeping our children safe by providing additional funding  and resources for school safety programs.   We are rebuilding our military, ensuring our troops have the tools,  training, and equipment they need to carry out their missions and keep  us safe both at home and abroad. Our brave men and women in uniform  received their largest pay raise in nearly 10 years.   We are keeping our promise to provide our veterans with the care they  have earned by overhauling the VA and ensuring that they have access to  reliable, quality care.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has undoubtedly had the most significant  positive effect on the daily lives of Americans. Tax reform has led to  unprecedented economic growth across our Nation. Americans are keeping  more of their hard-earned paychecks, while companies in all 50 States  are creating jobs and opportunity for all.   At home in Orange County, the unemployment rate has dropped to a near  20-year low, while pay and benefits continue to rise. Nationally,  jobless claims have fallen to their lowest levels since 1969, and  economic confidence is soaring.   Mr. Speaker, I could go on about the numerous accomplishments House  Republicans have achieved in the last 18 months, but the American  people don't  [[Page H6638]]  need convincing. They are seeing the results firsthand. Our Nation is,  without question, better off now, and we will continue our work to  improve the lives of all Americans.   I am proud to introduce my friend and fellow committee member on the  Energy and Commerce Committee, Congressman Buddy Carter from the First  District of Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who sits on the House  Committees on Education and the Workforce and Oversight and Government  Reform. Virginia Foxx is the Congresswoman who represents North  Carolina's Fifth District.    Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege to  introduce the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs.  McMorris Rodgers).   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague  for yielding and for hosting us this evening in a Special Order to talk  more about Americans who are better off now because of our hard work  over this Congress. I want to just join in sharing why Americans and  their families are better off, and it is because Republicans have  provided a better way and results that work.   After years of struggling to get ahead, hardworking men and women are  now seeing jobs, opportunity, and confidence come roaring back. This is  the comeback story that was made possible at the beginning through our  Better Way Agenda. Over the past 2 years, we have worked hard to  deliver on that agenda.   Mr. Speaker, at better.gop, you can check out the promises that we  have kept and why, as a result, America is stronger at home and abroad  with a booming economy, safer communities, and a revived military.   After historic tax reform and our work to rein in Obama-era  regulations, unemployment is at a historic low, job openings at a  record high, paychecks are growing, and wages are rising right along  with consumer confidence.   In my home State of Washington, the average wage increase just hit a  10-year high, and those increases are benefiting rural communities as  well, like Garfield County.   Garfield County is in my district. It is the smallest county in the  State of Washington, and the average wage increase has been 8.7 percent  in the last year.   Asotin County is another small, rural county, and they have seen a  6.6 percent increase in the last year. For other rural counties,  unemployment rates are dropping sharply.   Pend Oreille County is in my district. They have seen a 3.2 percent  drop in their unemployment rate.   For families and small businesses that are no longer overtaxed and  overregulated, they have confidence again that they can achieve a  better life and reach their full potential. That is what I am most  excited about. I am excited about the hope and the optimism that it is  bringing to people in eastern Washington and across this country.                                time  1945    It wasn't that long ago, in 2010, unemployment was at 9.9 percent.  Our policies have unleashed economic growth. It is now at 4 percent.  More Americans are coming off the sidelines and into the workforce.  Just last month, there were 600,000 Americans. I am proud to say that  it includes people with disabilities.   As The Washington Post recently reported, the jobless rate for  workers with disabilities has fallen at a faster rate than the general  population. This is great news because Washington State is getting  ready to launch our ABLE accounts. I was proud to lead efforts in tax  reform to provide a way for  [[Page H6639]]  those with disabilities to explore work, get a part-time job or an  internship, and take that money and put it back into their ABLE  account.   Today, 50,000 people in my State will be eligible for ABLE accounts.  It will help them find a job that gives them independence, dignity, and  purpose. We all recognize that a job is a foundation for a better life.   A booming economy isn't the only reason why Americans are better off.  We have also made significant investments to combat the opioid crisis  and human trafficking, target dangerous criminals, and make schools  safer.   After the Obama administration left our Armed Forces depleted, we  have made good on promises to revive and rebuild our military. In  addition to giving our troops the biggest pay increase in almost a  decade, we have provided for the largest increase in defense in 15  years. Our troops, including those I have the privilege of representing  at Fairchild Air Force Base, will now have additional resources to  train, address the readiness crisis, and keep America secure.   Madam Speaker, the American people don't want rhetoric. They want  results. After years of slow growth, lack of confidence, stagnant  wages, and a stagnant economy, they asked for a better way. I am proud  to have been a part of a group that has proven that we can get those  results done. By putting people first and focusing on improving lives,  we have delivered real results and a better way forward. That is why  Americans are better off today. I invite everyone to learn more at  better.gop.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), serving on the Committee on the  Budget, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the  Committee on Education and the Workforce, representing the Third  District of Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
