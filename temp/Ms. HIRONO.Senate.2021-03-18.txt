 Madam President, I rise today in support of the  nomination of my friend and former colleague Xavier Becerra to lead the  Department of Health and Human Services.   Xavier and I served together in the House of Representatives from  January 2007 to January 2013. While we sat on different House  committees, we were both very involved in one of Congress's most  significant achievements during that time--passage of the Affordable  Care Act, ACA. The ACA promised to greatly shrink the number of  uninsured Americans and rein in health care costs that were increasing  rapidly. It also led to false, harsh, partisan accusations by  Republicans that the law was going to ration health care and death  panels were inevitable.   Despite years of sabotage and dozens of attempts to repeal it, the  Affordable Care Act has lived up to its promise: more than 20 million  Americans gained  [[Page S1642]]  health insurance thanks to the ACA, and the ACA reduced health care  spending a total of $2.3 trillion between 2010 and 2017.   As a senior member of the Health Subcommittee of the House Ways and  Means Committee, Xavier Becerra played a significant role to help write  and pass the ACA and defended the law from near continuous Republican  assault as California's attorney general. Most recently, he has been  leading litigation at the Supreme Court to reinstate the ACA after an  ideologically-driven district court judge struck down the law in its  entirety.   These efforts demonstrate the leadership, experience, and health  policy expertise Xavier will bring to the Department of Health and  Human Services.   Despite these bona fides, Republican Senators are actively smearing  Xavier's reputation and misrepresenting his qualifications to prevent  him from becoming the first Latino to serve as HHS Secretary.   First, they claim Xavier isn't qualified because he isn't a doctor.  Republicans clearly didn't believe this was a deal breaker when all but  one of them voted to confirm Alex Azar--a former executive at Eli  Lilly--as Donald Trump's HHS Secretary. I think most Americans would  rather have an HHS Secretary like Xavier Becerra, who successfully sued  hospitals to lower healthcare costs, than a person in charge of running  a pharmaceutical company. Republicans have also claimed that Xavier  lacks ``extensive health care experience.'' This is particularly rich  coming from the same people who voted to confirm Betsy De-Vos to become  Education Secretary. She not only had never worked in a public school,  she had never even attended one. These same Republicans voted to  confirm Rick Perry to become Energy Secretary, when he didn't even know  the Department of Energy was responsible for the Nation's nuclear  arsenal.   Throughout his 12 terms in the House of Representatives, Xavier  Becerra was a leader on health policy issues. He helped write the most  sweeping change to our healthcare system in more than a generation, and  now, as the California attorney general, he is defending that law in  court. He has the experience needed to lead the Department of Health  and Human Services.   Republicans are also attacking Xavier's nomination on the grounds  that he is somehow ``extreme'' and ``a radical'' because he supports a  woman's right to have an abortion. The Supreme Court first recognized a  woman's constitutional right to an abortion in 1973. That is nearly 50  years ago. Supporting this fundamental right is anything but radical,  it is a position shared by almost 70 percent of the American people.  But that hasn't stopped attacks on a woman's right to seek and have  one.   What is ``extreme'' and ``radical'' are Republican efforts to  undermine this right--if not completely eliminate it. Just last week,  the Republican Governor of Arkansas signed a law that bans all  abortions unless they are necessary to save the life of the mother.  This law is directly contrary to the Supreme Court's command that  States cannot prohibit abortion prior to viability. It does not even  include an exception for pregnancies that are the result of rape or  incest.   The junior senator from Arkansas has called Xavier Becerra  ``extreme'' and ``a radical'' for defending a woman's constitutional  right to an abortion, while his State wants to force women who have  been raped to carry their pregnancies to term. What planet are we  living on?   On Thursday night, Xavier Becerra will be confirmed to become the  next Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. In any  normal world, the vote would be bipartisan and it would be  overwhelming. I strongly support his nomination and call on my  colleagues to do so as well.
