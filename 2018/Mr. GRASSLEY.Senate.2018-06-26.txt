 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the past few days, the issue of  family separation has reached a fever pitch. All you have to do is look  at the daily newspapers or cable television, and you know that is true.  This is a crisis that has been brewing since the surge of young  migrants across our border way back in 2014 and is just now reaching a  new peak.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: I find it ridiculous  to suggest that members of my political party--the Republican Party-- somehow support the idea of separating families. No one wants families  separated. No one wants to see families exploited. To suggest otherwise  is to feed the frenzy that has been whipped up over the last few days.   Lost in this frenzy is the reality that the only groups standing to  truly benefit while America is divided are smugglers, drug cartels, and  human traffickers. They know about the weaknesses and loopholes in our  current immigration law, and they aren't afraid to use those weaknesses  and loopholes. For these people, it is all about profit. Smugglers,  drug cartels, and human traffickers don't care about human lives.   In 2015 and 2016, I questioned the Obama administration's Department  of Homeland Security after receiving reports that human trafficking was  increasing, and some smugglers weren't being arrested even after  smuggling people across the border dozens of times. The lack of  consequences emboldened these smugglers.   At that time, I also asked the Obama Department of Homeland Security  about a dangerous tactic used by smugglers to pair kids with unrelated  adults to create the appearance of a family unit. The word  ``appearance'' is key here.   Knowing the legal loopholes better than most, these smugglers knew  that our laws, like the Flores settlement agreement, prevented family  detention.   Flores vs. Reno effectively prohibits the government from maintaining  custody of immigrant children even when they are with their families.  Through this agreement, the government had sent the message that if you  come alone, you will be detained, but if you come with a family, and as  a family, you will likely be released. Understanding this, these smart  smugglers knew they could sell this false freedom and build a cruel new  business model.   In 2015, I was horrified to learn that human smuggling rings were  exploiting children and selling them to the highest bidder to get to  the United States and avoid detention. That is right. Smugglers would  use kids like pawns in an effort to help adults avoid detention when  coming across the border. To truly help families, any solution we come  up with must protect against this evil stunt by the smugglers.   Department officials reported that kids were being kidnapped, or  adopted, and then smuggled with their unrelated adult so-called  ``family member'' to the United States.   U.S. Government officials work closely with foreign officials, trying  to locate and safely return these kidnapped children to their mothers  and fathers. Unfortunately, this doesn't always happen. For example, a  woman paid a smuggling organization in Brazil $13,000 in fees to  smuggle her to the United States. She flew from her home country of  Brazil to Mexico, where she was paired with a minor child. She was then  instructed to claim the child as her own upon arrival to the United  States.   After learning about this scam, ICE intervened, and the woman was  removed. The child, however, was never found. She will never be  reunited with her real family. She is likely separated from that real  family forever. That is all because the flaws in our current  immigration system permitted--and even encouraged--her to be  trafficked.   I heard just yesterday that U.S. Customs and Border Protection has  temporarily stopped referring cases for criminal prosecution, but that  is exactly what the Obama administration did during their tenure. It is  exactly why we are dealing with this terrible situation that separates  children and families in the first place. Failure to refer cases for  prosecution will only give a green light to these smugglers, once more  putting at risk the very kids we are worried about protecting, and we  ought to be worried about protecting them.   This tactic of creating fake family units isn't new and isn't limited  to just a one-time deal. Last week, Secretary Nielsen reported that  this tactic is still being utilized. She stated:         In the last five months, we've had a 314 percent increase       in adults and children arriving at the border, fraudulently       claiming to be a family unit. This is, obviously, of concern.    These fake family units are often provided with fraudulent documents  to support that the group is actually a family unit when we all know it  is not a family unit. There is a whole industry that exists to create  fake birth certificates and many other documents that show a familial  relationship. As the tactic to create these fake family units has  become more popular, the underground market has exploded. Smugglers are  very smart, and many of them are masters of gaming our immigration  system.   Let me reiterate that the way the Flores vs. Reno agreement is  currently applied, the government can't keep immigrant children even if  they are with their parents. Flores discourages the Federal Government  from keeping families together in Department of Homeland Security  custody. If we remedy this situation, not only would we be able to keep  families together, but we would also be telling the smugglers who  profit from this that their days of making millions of dollars off the  most vulnerable are over. The most vulnerable--the kids we are talking  about--aren't getting the protection they ought to get when they are  separated from their parents.   To me, the answer to this problem appears to be very simple. We  should repeal the Flores decision only as it applies to accompanied  children so that the Department of Homeland Security  [[Page S4396]]  can keep families together in family residential centers. That is very  simple, and that is very quick. That is why, last week, I worked hand  in hand with Senator Tillis to produce a bill that would do just that.   Senator Tillis's thoughtful bill, in addition to repealing parts of  the Flores decision, would also allow more immigrant court judges to be  hired and would provide for detained families to have their cases heard  first.   Senator Tillis's bill would immediately end this crisis and wouldn't  return us to the failed catch-and-release policies that even the former  Obama Department of Homeland Secretary, Jeh Johnson, has acknowledged  are poor public policies.   I hope my colleagues will join with Senator Tillis and this Senator  to fix this problem. The American people are counting on it. Thousands  of families are depending upon it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
