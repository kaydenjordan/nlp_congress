 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the rising costs and  supply chain backlogs that are impacting hardworking families.   Store shelves across the country are empty. Families are facing what  is expected to be the most expensive Thanksgiving in history.   Yet, we have heard silence from Congressional Democrats on these  issues.   We need to solve these bigger supply chain issues, not double down on  failing economic policies that have made life for American businesses  and workers harder and more expensive.   Thanks to record inflation levels, households earning the median  income have been forced to spend an additional $175 per month on food,  fuel, and housing. These higher costs are making your paychecks worth  less.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to fight against these policies that are  making life for Americans more expensive.                            ____________________
