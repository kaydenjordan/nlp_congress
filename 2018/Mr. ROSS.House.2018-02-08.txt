 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mrs. Love, from Utah for  presenting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here in support of H.R. 4771.   It is said that all politics are local, but might I also suggest that  all economic growth is local as well. Local in the sense of small  businesses. Small businesses, the moms and pops who put their ideas at  risk in order to create their American Dream of growing a business and  creating jobs.   Yet, what does it take?   It takes access to capital. Yet, since Dodd-Frank, we have not seen  that access to capital available to our small businesses, who so  desperately need it, in order to grow our economies, especially at the  community level.   In fact, might I even suggest that Dodd-Frank has only one attribute  in terms of job growth, and that is the creation of the one fastest  growing job out there: compliance officer--compliance officers that  banks and financial institutions now have to hire in order to meet  regulatory burdens that take away from the bottom line of consumers who  want to achieve the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4771, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act,  will allow that access to capital that is so desperately needed at the  local level, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.                                time  1200
