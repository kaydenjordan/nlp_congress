 Mr. Speaker, this week kicks off the North American  International Auto Show in Detroit. As a car guy all my life, I never  missed the world's premier automotive event, the greatest show on  Earth. This year there is plenty to celebrate.   Just yesterday, Fiat Chrysler announced it would create 2,000 jobs  and invest $1 billion to modernize manufacturing plants in Michigan and  Ohio. Last week, Ford scrapped plans for its facility in Mexico and  instead promised to invest $700 million at the Flat Rock plant. This  move will bring 700 new jobs to Michigan. These are exciting  developments for our State's economy and good paying jobs for our  dedicated and talented workforce.   Mr. Speaker, as everyone will see at this year's auto show, Michigan  continues to lead the way in car manufacturing. Working together, we  can keep Michigan on the forefront of innovation and mobility and keep  making the best cars and trucks in the world right in our backyard, the  motor capital of the world.                            ____________________
