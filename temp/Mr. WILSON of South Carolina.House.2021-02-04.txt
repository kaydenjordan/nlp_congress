 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the  service of the Correspondence Director of the Second Congressional  District, Joshua Grant. This week he is joining the office of my fellow  Charlestonian, Senator Tim Scott, as a Legislative Correspondent for  Finance.   Josh hails from the beautiful community of Walterboro, South  Carolina, and joined the office of the Second District shortly after  graduating from Benedict College, an historically Black college in  Columbia, in 2016. During his time in the office, Josh continually went  above and beyond and made every constituent and guest feel welcome. He  instituted a small-town sense of community to Capitol Hill.   Congratulations to his parents, Joseph and Diannia Grant, as well as  his siblings, Tahnee Johnson, Tiffany Gist, Lisa Grant, and Jason  Grant, for raising a kind, smart, and inspired young man, a favorite of  my wife, Roxanne.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   After last night, Republicans are united to stop socialism which  destroys jobs.                            ____________________
