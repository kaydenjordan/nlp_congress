 Mr. Speaker, I come to you, not just as a Representative  from my district today but someone who served for 18 years as a Los  Angeles police officer on the streets, someone who has been in uniform,  at attention, at several police officer and deputy funerals as tears  were rolling down my face, and looking side to side and seeing the same  of my brothers and sisters in law enforcement.   I am sure that everyone who speaks today will have a story, a  horrible story that affected their community. On October 5 of last  year, one such story happened in our community. Sergeant Steve Owen was  basically executed. He was shot from a far distance, and then the  killer came up and put four more shots into him at close range to make  sure that he was dead.   These are the types of things that we are seeing in our communities  across this country at an alarmingly high rate over the last few years.   I think that the Thin Blue Line Act is one more of those types of  issues that we can do to protect our first responders, our police  officers, our firefighters, to give these people justice, to give their  families justice, so I urge you to support the Thin Blue Line Act.
