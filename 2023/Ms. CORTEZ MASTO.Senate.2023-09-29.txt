 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  able to display this poster on the floor.    Mr. President, like so many this morning, I rise to  mourn the loss of a true champion in the U.S. Senate.   Dianne was one of the kindest, most thoughtful people that I had the  pleasure to know. When I first got to the Senate--and I have heard some  of my colleagues this morning talk about as new Senators--she was so  gracious. As a new Senator, she would invite me to dinner with  colleagues, and she was such a lady and so professional and so elegant.  Every time you went to dinner with Dianne, you can be guaranteed that  she would have a little set of flowers for you at your place at the  restaurant. And then she would have a little parting gift for you,  whether it was a little coin purse or something to show just truly who  she was. And I heard this morning from my colleagues, similarly, the  stories of Dianne's kindness and her respect for others.   She was a fighter her whole life, leading on so many important  issues. In the coming days and weeks and months and years, as people  around the world really honor Dianne's memory, many will speak to her  leadership--and rightfully so--on women's rights and foreign affairs.   But I want to take the time to highlight a place where Dianne did so  much. And most people don't know, unless you are a part of Team Tahoe,  Dianne loved Lake Tahoe. Lake Tahoe is a beautiful, pristine Alpine  lake that both Nevada and California share. In 1997, Dianne and then- Senator Harry Reid got together and passed legislation to protect this  pristine lake.   And since that time, once a year, Dianne has been instrumental in  bringing people around the lake together to address the needs for Lake  Tahoe. That was all Dianne.   So when I first got to the Senate in 1997, one of the first things we  talked about, she pulled me aside and said: We are going to have the  Tahoe Summit this year. I hope you are there, and I hope you will be  there always to support Tahoe.   And I said: Dianne, I grew up around this lake. The first time I was  there was when I was 18 years old. My mother grew up around this lake.  We love Lake Tahoe in Nevada, and you can guarantee that I will always  be there for it.   And if you sat and talked to Dianne, the first thing you will hear  her talk about in Lake Tahoe are her memories--her memories of riding  her bike as a young girl around the lake. Her memories of times when  she was there with her family, having the opportunity to enjoy  incredible Lake Tahoe.   So I couldn't pass this day without recognizing, of course, all the  incredible things Dianne has done; but what most people don't know,  unless you are a part of Nevada and California, is the hard work that  she has done around this lake for the people who live there, for the  people who cherish this lake, for the tourists that come here every  single day. And it is not just the work that she has done here in the  Senate. This was 2017. This was the first opportunity that I had as a  young Senator to join Dianne. And as you can see, Dianne was hosting it  that summer, the Lake Tahoe Summit.   But Dianne had this ability not only to have this summit once a year  to talk about how we protect this lake, but she brought together  incredible stakeholders and experts around the lake--people who live  there, people who worked in our State--to address not just the quality  of the lake and the pristineness to protect it, but everything else  around it from the transportation side to the wildfires that were  happening to the environment. And she had a luncheon, a regular  luncheon after the Tahoe Summit to talk about how we continue that work  together.   And because of Dianne's prestige, she had the ability to bring  incredible speakers to the Tahoe Summit once a year. First, President  Clinton; then one time, President Obama; and just recently, we had our  former Speaker, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi speaking. We had one of  our incredible Senators, chairwoman of Energy and Natural Resources at  the time, Lisa Murkowski. It was about how we work across party lines  to really focus on protecting, for everyone who wants to enjoy this,  Lake Tahoe.    She was a true champion, and she will be missed. On behalf of Team  Tahoe, which is what she coined it--Dianne never took credit for  anything she did around this lake. Even though people wanted to  recognize her and show that support, she never took the credit. She  said: This is about a team. This is Team Tahoe. This is what we do  together. This is how we work together.   This is the legacy of her work in the U.S. Senate, carried forward  right here in Lake Tahoe.   So, to Dianne, to her family--her incredible family--and to everyone  on Team Tahoe, we will miss Dianne Feinstein. She will always be a part  of the work we do. Her legacy will live on not just around Tahoe but in  so many other areas as we have talked about today.   I am going to miss her. I am going to miss the opportunity to sit  with her at lunch and talk about what we still need to do to fight to  protect this incredible, pristine lake.   Thank you, Dianne, for your service.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
