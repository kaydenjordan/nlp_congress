 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support reinstating the assault weapons ban.   The AR-15 has become the weapon of choice for shooters looking to  kill as many people as possible in as little time as possible.  Researchers estimate that if we still had a Federal assault weapons ban  we would see 70 percent fewer mass shooting deaths.   The number of mass shootings has skyrocketed since the original  assault weapons ban expired in 2004. These weapons have been used in  the deadliest shootings in our history from Sandy Hook to Parkland to  Uvalde. They are weapons of war that have no place in our community.   This is the amount of damage which is done by one bullet fired by an  AR-15 as it enters the body. That is the bullet. That is the size of  the damage. The bodies of kids in Uvalde were riddled so badly with  wounds that their parents had to use DNA tests to identify their own  children. One family identified their child by their shoes--their  shoes.   These weapons don't just kill. They slaughter, and they decimate.  They are designed for death and maximum destruction. They have no place  in our schools or in our streets or anywhere in our communities.   We know that the original assault weapons ban worked. We have to  reinstate it before more innocent lives are lost.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act. Before the Emanuel church  shooting, before the Uvalde, El Paso, and Parkland shootings and so  many others, shooters showed warning signs or even flat out said what  they were going to do.   Before many die by suicide by gun, they show warning signs that they  may be a danger to themselves.   In these situations, there is often evidence that something terrible  is going to happen. We know it, we can even articulate it, but we are  often powerless to stop it.   This bill remedies this situation. This bill would help prevent  individuals who pose an imminent threat to themselves or others from  accessing firearms, by allowing law enforcement and family members to  file a court petition in Federal court to temporarily--temporarily-- block dangerous individuals' access to guns.   Despite the claim that this bill invades due process, this is  absolutely false. It is a thinly veiled attempt to prevent any and all  regulations of firearms in this country. As the chairman has said, it  has been found constitutional. There is a hearing before the seizure  with a judge, with witnesses, testimony under oath, affidavits. The  judge makes a finding. It happens all the time in domestic violence  cases.   These guns can only be taken away for a temporary period after a  hearing with a judge, who determines on balance that it is necessary to  do so for the safety of the gun owner or the community.   This bill is so common sense. It has historically been bipartisan.  The last Republican President supported it, introduced by Senator  Lindsey Graham in the Senate.   I thank Congresswoman McBath. Our Republican colleagues this morning  have been talking about their passion for the Second Amendment, their  devotion to the right to bear arms. If only for a moment they showed  the same devotion, the same commitment to preserving the life of young  people, the right to live a life free from gun violence, to go to a  movie theater or church or synagogue and not worry  [[Page H5424]]  about their life and their liberty because they are gunned down by  someone who shouldn't have a firearm.   This is absolutely the most commonsense proposal that will come  before Congress on guns. Keep them out of the hands of people who are  dangerous to themselves and others. For God's sake, vote for this bill.
