 Mr. President, I wish to recognize Fred Smith,  founder and executive chairman of FedEx for receiving the distinguished  L. Welch Pogue Award for his outstanding lifelong contributions to the  field of commercial aviation.   On September 14, Mr. Smith, a proud Memphian and generous benefactor  to his city, will receive due commemoration for his renowned  achievements and contributions involving his organization, career, and  passion.   Since 1971, the iconic Tennessee company he founded has facilitated  deliveries not just in the United States but across the world.   This includes FedEx's work on the Project Airbridge Operation, a  partnership executed by FedEx under the direction of the Federal  Government that expedited the importation of critical supplies at the  height of the pandemic.   This award, first presented in 1994, recognizes individuals with a  lifetime of achievement in aviation and recognizes individuals who not  only have a vision for where the industry is headed, but have acted to  make it a reality.   I can think of no one more deserving to receive such an award. Let us  celebrate this achievement and commitment to excellence that Mr. Smith  has shown throughout his career.                            ____________________
