 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today in strong  support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.   This year's NDAA includes a top-line budget that restores funding for  shipbuilding, procurement, missile defense, and a number of other  priorities that will help ensure the national defense of our great  Nation.    The NDAA continues to support and improve the lives of those who  sacrifice for our country on a daily basis by authorizing a military  basic pay raise of 2.7 percent. The bill reinforces the committee's  longstanding commitment to the military family by requiring DOD to  increase parental leave, expand the in-home childcare pilot program, it  improves support available to military families with special needs  children, and provides comprehensive reform of DOD's family violence  prevention and response program.   It also requires the Department to standardize the definition of  professional military education across the joint force. It requires DOD  to report to Congress on the number of military personnel infected with  COVID-19 at the 2019 World Military Games in Wuhan, China. It increases  funding for COVID-19 vaccine research, while providing $35 million for  research and treatment of Havana syndrome.   Madam Speaker, this is an outstanding NDAA. I want to thank the  chairman and ranking member for their tireless efforts in working  together to preserve the bipartisan spirit of this committee. I also  want to thank the chairwoman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee  that I work with, Ms. Speier.   Madam Speaker, this is a bill we can all be proud of.
