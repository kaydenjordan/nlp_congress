 Mr. Speaker, I want to say thanks to Mrs. Walorski, my  colleague on the Ways and Means Committee, for yielding to me and for  her leadership in putting together this Special Order and her tireless  fight for life.   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today in defense of life and the  unborn. Over the last few weeks, we have witnessed extreme abortion  views pushed in States across the country.   In New York, the State legislature passed and the Governor signed  into law an abortion bill so broad it effectively allows abortion on  demand until birth while removing protections for infants born alive  during an abortion. Barbaric legislation such as this is nothing to  cheer about.   In Virginia, the Governor tried to soften the blow of his infanticide  endorsement by saying ``the infant would be kept comfortable'' while a  decision was made on whether to abort the infant.   These disturbing and extreme trends seeping into the mainstream of  the Democratic platform underscore the need for its leaders in Congress  to stand up, to fight for life in the face of these abhorrent actions.   Now more than ever, leaders in Washington need to stand up for life.   I stand committed with the millions of pro-life advocates around the  country to make sure infanticide is condemned and the voiceless are  given a voice.
