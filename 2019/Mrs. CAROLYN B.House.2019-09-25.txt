 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I strongly  support this bill and congratulate the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Perlmutter) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck) for their hard  work.   We have to pass this bill because it is a public safety issue. Banks  can't serve marijuana businesses, an $11 billion business, because it  is still illegal at the Federal level, which means that legal marijuana  businesses around the country operate in all cash.   This is a huge public safety issue because storing huge piles of cash  in warehouses is a magnet for criminal activity. But it also means that  companies that just provide services to marijuana businesses, like  electric or water utilities, are also getting cut off from the banking  system. Undermining people's access to basic utilities creates yet  another public safety problem.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bill.
