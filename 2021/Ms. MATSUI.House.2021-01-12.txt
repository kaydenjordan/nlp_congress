 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule  providing for consideration of the resolution before us today, calling  on the Vice President to invoke the Fifth Amendment and remove  President Trump from office immediately.   Last week, members of both parties came to the floor of this Chamber  to take the oath of office. In that oath, each of us pledged to defend  the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I believe  that oath compels me and my colleagues to act today.   Last Wednesday's armed insurrection at the United States Capitol was  a coordinated attempt to overthrow our democratic process with  violence. Make no mistake, these rioters viewed the President's  repeated claims of fraud as a mandate to act. Lies, misinformation, and  demagoguery have consequences.   Unfortunately, America witnessed those consequences last week, some  on television, some under tables in barricaded offices, some in these  Chambers, and some in the last moments of life.   It is not with joy that I immediately called on Vice President Pence  to invoke the 25th Amendment. I am cosponsor of both this resolution  and the Articles of Impeachment because I believe I have an obligation  to honor my oath and defend the Constitution against a grave domestic  threat.  [[Page H130]]    On a personal note, I am taking this stand for the future of my  grandchildren. Our obligation to them and to future generations is that  this democracy stands.   So, it is with sadness but firm resolve that I rise to support this  rule and implore my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join  me.
