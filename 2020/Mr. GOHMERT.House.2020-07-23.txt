 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the  privileges of the House with the form of the resolution to be as  follows.    My understanding is that the rules allow any time a  Member is properly recognized to speak that that privileged resolution  then takes priority over all other business at that point.    Mr. Speaker, I will wait for 1 minutes.    Yes.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, recognition has properly gone to a great  man, John Lewis, a colleague who will be sorely missed.   He, along with the great Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., some people  say: ``Oh, they did much for African Americans.'' But actually, they  did a great deal for everyone in this country.   As a young Christian, their efforts enabled me to treat brothers and  sisters as brothers and sisters. For that, I will be ever thankful.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Raising a question of the privileges of the House:   Whereas, on July 22, 2020, House Resolution 7573 was brought to the  House floor for a vote with the purpose of eliminating four specific  statues or busts from the United States Capitol, along with all others  that include individuals ``who served as an officer or voluntarily with  the Confederate States of America or the military forces or government  of a State while the State was in rebellion against the United  States,'' yet failed to address the most ever-present historical stigma  of the United States Capitol; that is, the source that so fervently  supported, condoned, and fought for slavery was left untouched, without  whom, the evil of slavery could never have continued as it did, to such  extreme that it is necessary to address it here in order for the U.S.  House of Representatives to avoid degradation of historical fact and  blatant hypocrisy for generations to come.                                time  1015    Whereas, the Democratic Party Platform of 1840, 1844, 1848, 1852, and  1856 states: ``That Congress has no power under the Constitution to  interfere with or control the domestic institutions of the several  States, and that such States are the sole and proper judges of  everything appertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by the  Constitution; that all efforts of the abolitionists, or others, made to  induce Congress to interfere with questions of slavery . . . are  calculated to lead to the most alarming and dangerous consequences; and  that all such efforts have an inevitable tendency to diminish the  happiness of the people and endanger the stability and permanency of  [[Page H3702]]  the Union, and ought not to be countenanced by any friend of our  political institutions.''   Again, from the Democratic Party Platform of those years.   Whereas, the Democrat Party Platform of 1856 further declares that  new States to the Union should be admitted ``with or without domestic  slavery, as the State may elect.''   Whereas, the Democratic Party Platform of 1856 also resolves that  ``we recognize the right of the people of all the territories . . . to  form a Constitution, with or without domestic slavery.''   Whereas, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 penalized officials who did  not arrest an alleged runaway slave and made them liable for a fine of  $1,000, which is about $28,000 in present-day value. Law enforcement  officials everywhere were required to arrest people suspected of being  a runaway slave on as little as a claimant's sworn testimony of  ownership. The Democratic Party Platform of 1860 directly, in seeking  to uphold to Fugitive Slave Act, states that ``the enactments of the  State legislatures to defeat the faithful execution of the Fugitive  Slave Law are hostile in character, subversive of the Constitution, and  revolutionary in their effect.''   The Democratic Party Platform again.   Whereas, the 14th Amendment, giving full citizenship to freed slaves,  passed in 1868 with 94 percent Republican support, 0 percent Democratic  support in Congress; the 15th Amendment, giving freed slaves the right  to vote, passed in 1870 with 100 percent Republican support and 0  percent Democratic support in Congress.   Whereas, Democrats systematically suppressed African Americans' right  to vote, and by specific example in the 1902 constitution of the State  of Virginia actually disenfranchised about 90 percent of the Black men  who still voted at the beginning of the 20th century and nearly half of  the White men.   So they suppressed Republican voters as well.   The number of eligible African-American voters were thereby forcibly  reduced from about 147,000 in 1901 to about 10,000 by 1905; that  measure was supported almost exclusively by Virginia Democrats.   Whereas, Virginia's 1902 constitution was engineered by Carter Glass,  the future Democratic U.S. Representative, Senator, and Secretary of  the Treasury under Democrat President Woodrow Wilson, who proclaimed  the goal of the constitutional convention as follows: This Democrat  exclaimed: ``Discrimination! Why, that is precisely what we propose.  That, exactly, is what this Convention was elected for--to discriminate  to the very extremity of permissible action under the limits of the  Federal Constitution, with a view to the elimination of every,'' and I  won't use his word, but African-American ``voter who can be gotten rid  of legally,'' which was said by a Democrat and applauded by his fellow  Democrats.   Whereas, in 1912, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson's  administration began a racial segregation policy for U.S. Government  employees, and by 1914, the Wilson administration's civil service  instituted the requirement that a photograph be submitted with each  employment application.   Whereas, the 1924 Democratic National Convention convened in New York  City at Madison Square Garden; the convention commonly was known as the  ``Klan-Bake'' due to the overwhelming influence of the Ku Klux Klan in  the Democratic Party.   Whereas, in 1964, the Democratic Party led a 75-calendar-day  filibuster against the 1964 Civil Rights Act.   Whereas, leading the Democrats in their opposition to civil rights  for African Americans was a member of the Democratic Party, Senator  Robert Byrd from West Virginia, who was a known recruiter for the Ku  Klux Klan.   Whereas, Democrats enacted and enforced Jim Crow laws and civil codes  that forced segregation and restricted freedoms of Black Americans in  the United States.   Whereas, on June 18, 2020, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the  removal from the Capitol portraits of four previous Speakers of the  House who served in the Confederacy, saying this these portraits ``set  back our Nation's work to confront and combat bigotry''; the men  depicted in the portraits were Democrat Robert M.T. Hunter, Democrat  Howell Cobb, Democrat James L. Orr, and Democrat Charles F. Crisp.   Resolved,   One, that the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall remove  any item that names, symbolizes, or mentions any political organization  or party that has ever held a public position that supported slavery or  the Confederacy, from any area within the House wing of the Capitol or  any House office building, and shall donate such item or symbol to the  Library of Congress.   Two, that any political organization or party that has ever held a  public position that supported slavery or the Confederacy shall either  change its name or be barred from participation in the House of  Representatives.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
