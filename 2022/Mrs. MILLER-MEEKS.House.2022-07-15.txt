 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the Honorable  Representative Rodgers, for yielding me time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8296. The Supreme  Court recently took the important and correct step to return the power  to regulate abortion back to State legislators and voters within the  individual States while recognizing the sanctity of life.   This concept is so novel and repugnant to the Democrats that they  would put forward a radical and extreme abortion bill that would permit  abortion even up until birth for any reason. Only seven countries,  including China and North Korea, are this extreme.   As a doctor, I am knowledgeable that mid- to late-term abortion is a  barbaric procedure which can include dismemberment of the baby and  crushing of the skull. This is far more cruel than many of the laws of  States that define prisoner abuse of convicted felons and what  constitutes animal cruelty. It is a procedure done when the mother is  given anesthesia, but the baby can feel pain. Madam Speaker, even  though you cannot hear it scream, it can respond to music and respond  to touch and the voice of its mother.   We wouldn't allow animals to be treated this cruelly.   Do Democrats think that this elevates women and is compassionate?   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from the Charlotte  Lozier Institute.              [From the Charlotte Lozier Institute, Feb. 2014]      Gestational Limits on Abortion in the United States Compared to                            International Norms                        (By Angelina Baglini, J.D.)         Abstract: The United States is one of only seven countries       in the world that permit elective abortion past 20 weeks.       Upholding laws restricting abortion on demand after 20 weeks       would situate the United States closer to the international       mainstream, instead of leaving it as an outlying country with       ultra-permissive abortion policies.        This report compares gestational limits in United States       abortion law with gestational limits in the abortion law of       the international community. The goal is to determine where       the United States stands in comparison to international       norms, with its federal policy enshrined in Roe v. Wade,       which allows abortion past 20 weeks and without restriction       until fetal viability.        The sample group for this project included a total of 198       countries, independent states, and semi-autonomous regions       with populations exceeding 1 million. Of these 198 countries,       independent states, and regions worldwide, 59 allow abortion       without restriction as to reason, otherwise known as elective       abortion or abortion on demand. The remaining 139 countries       require some reason to obtain an abortion ranging from most       restrictive (to save the life of the mother or completely       prohibited) to least restrictive (socioeconomic grounds) with       various reasons in between (e.g., physical health, mental       health).        Currently, the United States permits abortion on demand       through viability, which is usually marked around 24 weeks.       For this report, it is appropriate to compare the United       States with the other 58 countries that allow abortion on       demand up to some point in pregnancy. The remaining 139       countries require some reason to obtain an abortion (that is       to say, they do not permit abortion on demand) and are, by       definition, more restrictive than the United States on the       issue of gestational limits. To require some reason before       obtaining an abortion is inherently more restrictive than not       requiring any reason at all.        This report finds that the United States is one of only       seven countries in the world that permit elective abortion       past 20 weeks. This finding suggests that current proposals       in the United States to restrict elective abortions past 20       weeks would move the United States from the fringe, ultra-      permissive end of the spectrum to a position closer to       international norms.                     Terminology and Method of Comparison         Not all countries or statutes use the same terminology when       drafting restrictions on late-term elective abortion. When       drafting a restriction on elective abortion past 20 weeks of       pregnancy, the most common measurement of ``weeks of       pregnancy'' is gestational age, or in short form       ``gestation.'' Gestational age marks the duration of       pregnancy, which is most commonly and medically measured from       the date of the woman's last menstrual period. The woman's       last menstrual period is the most identifiable date by which       to measure the duration of pregnancy, and occurs       approximately two weeks before conception or fertilization.        The vast majority of countries in this international survey       of abortion laws use gestational age to measure duration of       pregnancy. Over 80 percent of countries maintaining some       restriction on elective abortion use gestational age as the       method of calculating duration of pregnancy. However, a       minority of countries measures duration of pregnancy from       ``conception'' or ``fertilization.'' One country measures       from the time of ``implantation,'' which occurs approximately       one week after conception or fertilization. Some statutes do       not even specify a method of measurement, simply using the       vague term ``weeks of pregnancy'' without indicating a       precise method measuring the duration of pregnancy.        Conception or fertilization is the moment when an ovum and       sperm unite, which creates a unique human organism. The date       of conception or fertilization is often difficult to       determine, as few women know the exact date they conceived.       Because the last menstrual period is a more ascertainable       date, in many cases doctors add two weeks to the woman's last       menstrual period to approximate the date of conception or       fertilization.        This report uses gestation to compare restrictions based on       duration of pregnancy. More than 80 percent of countries       already use gestation in establishing duration of pregnancy       restrictions on elective abortion  [[Page H6640]]       and measuring the age of the unborn child using gestation is       in line with common medical practice.        For those countries that use a different measurement of       age, such as conception or fertilization or pregnancy, this       study converts the measurement of age into gestation by       adding two weeks to date back to the woman's last menstrual       period. Using gestation as a common method of measuring       duration of pregnancy restrictions on elective abortion       produces a more meaningful comparison.          International Gestational Limitations on Elective Abortion         The sample group of countries for this project included a       total of 198 countries, independent states, and semi-      autonomous regions with populations exceeding 1 million.        Of these 198 countries, independent states, and regions       worldwide, 59 allow abortion without restriction as to       reason, otherwise known as elective abortion or abortion on       demand.        The remaining 139 countries require some reason to obtain       an abortion ranging from most restrictive (to save the life       of the mother or completely prohibited) to least restrictive       (socioeconomic grounds) with various reasons in between       (e.g., physical health, mental health).        Of the 59 countries permitting elective abortion:        9 countries limit elective abortion before the 12th week of       gestation,        36 countries limit elective abortion at 12 weeks gestation,        6 countries limit elective abortion between 12 and 20 weeks       gestation,        7 countries permit elective abortion past 20 weeks or have       no gestational limit.        1 country maintains a federal system where abortion policy       is determined at the state/territory level, and at least two       of those states permit elective abortion past 20 weeks        Australia is the one country where a federal system is in       place, but abortion policy is determined on the state or       territory level. Three states or territories within Australia       permit elective abortion, and two allow elective abortion       past 20 weeks. However, other states and territories of       Australia maintain more restrictive abortion policies and       some do not permit elective abortion at all. Due to the       diverse range of abortion policy in Australia, from       restrictive to ultra-permissive, this study does not include       Australia, as a whole, as a country that permits elective       abortion past 20 weeks.        More than 75 percent of the countries permitting abortion       without restriction as to reason do not permit elective       abortions past l2 weeks gestation.        Only 12 percent (7 out of 59) of the countries permitting       abortion without restriction as to reason permit elective       abortion past 20 weeks gestation.        The U.S. is among these 7 countries that permit elective       abortion past 20 weeks. This is true whether 20 weeks is       measured from the last menstrual period (gestational age),       conception, or implantation. No matter how duration of       pregnancy is measured, whether by gestational age or       conception or fertilization, or implantation, all countries       in this category pass the 20-week threshold. These countries/      territories are:        Canada (no restriction in law)        China (no restriction in law)        Netherlands (24 weeks)        North Korea (no restriction in law)        Singapore (24 weeks)        United States (viability)        Vietnam (no restriction in law)        The United States is within the top 4 of most permissive       abortion policies in the world (7 out of 198) when analyzing       restrictions on elective abortion based on duration of       pregnancy.             Implications for Current Policy in the United States         Under U.S. law, abortion on demand is permitted without       restriction through viability. Viability can vary, and is       decreasing in terms of weeks of gestation as perinatal       medicine advances, but normally occurs no earlier than 24       weeks.        Recently, in the United States there has been great       interest in restricting abortion on demand after 20 weeks.       Two states have had 20-week laws on the books since before       Roe v. Wade. Eleven more states have enacted 20-week laws in       recent years. A proposed 20-week law in Albuquerque, New       Mexico failed to gain majority support in 2013 but was       notable for the engaged citizen activism that resulted in the       proposal being put on a municipal ballot for a direct vote.        There is also interest at the federal level in restricting       elective abortion after 20 weeks. In 2013, the U.S. House of       Representatives passed a 20-week law. A similar law has been       introduced in the U.S. Senate.        Permitting abortion on demand past 20 weeks places the       United States among the top 4 percent of most-permissive       countries in the world based on duration of pregnancy       restrictions on abortion. If the United States adopts a       federal policy restricting elective abortion past 20 weeks,       or if more states adopt such policies, the U.S. will more       closely align itself with the international norm that limits       elective abortion past 12 weeks. Policies imposing       gestational limits on elective abortion have been       overwhelmingly adopted by countries permitting abortion on       demand, indicating policies that encourage woman's safety in       limiting abortion to early pregnancy and policies that       protect unborn children from pain and prolonged exposure to       the risk of-abortion.                                 Conclusions         In terms of gestational limits, the United States ranks       among 7 countries with the most permissive abortion policies.       The clear norm among countries that permit elective abortion       is to limit abortion to before 20 weeks gestation, and       elective abortion is more commonly limited to 12 weeks (the       first trimester).        Twenty-week abortion laws in the United States are neither       extreme nor unreasonable. Rather, they move the United States       closer to international norms of legislating what is safe and       healthy for the mother and what grants unborn children more       protection in the womb.     Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues on every  seat in every aisle of this Chamber to vote against this extreme,  radical, and cruel abortion bill, H.R. 8296.
