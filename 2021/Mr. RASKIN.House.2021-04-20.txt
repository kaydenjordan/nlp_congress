Sec. 4.  House Resolution 316 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 5.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021, is       amended--        (1) in section 11, by striking ``April 22, 2021'' and       inserting ``May 20, 2021'';        (2) in section 16, by striking ``calendar day of April 22,       2021'' and inserting ``legislative day of May 20, 2021''; and        (3) in section 17, by striking ``April 22, 2021'' and       inserting ``May 20, 2021''.        Sec. 6. (a) At any time through the legislative day of       Thursday, April 22, 2021, the Speaker may entertain motions       offered by the Majority Leader or a designee that the House       suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV with       respect to multiple measures described in subsection (b), and       the Chair shall put the question on any such motion without       debate or intervening motion.        (b) A measure referred to in subsection (a) includes any       measure that was the object of a motion to suspend the rules       on the legislative day of April 19, 2021, or April 20, 2021,       on which the yeas and nays were ordered and further       proceedings postponed pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX.        (c) Upon the offering of a motion pursuant to subsection       (a) concerning multiple measures, the ordering of the yeas       and nays on postponed motions to suspend the rules with       respect to such measures is vacated to the end that all such       motions are considered as withdrawn.        Sec. 7. (a) House Concurrent Resolution 30 is hereby       adopted.        (b) For purposes of the joint session to receive the       President of the United States on April 28, 2021, former       Members, Delegates,  [[Page H1969]]       and Resident Commissioners shall not be admitted to the Hall       of the House or rooms leading thereto.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule, House Resolution 330, providing for three measures.   First, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 51, the  Washington, D.C. Admission Act, under a closed rule. It provides 1 hour  of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform and provides  for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1333, the NO BAN  Act, and H.R. 1573, the Access to Counsel Act of 2021, both under  closed rules. The rule provides an hour of debate on each bill equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on the Judiciary and provides one motion to recommit on each  bill.   The rule deems as passed H.R. 316, providing for the expenses of  certain committees, and H. Con. Res. 30, providing for a joint session  of Congress to receive a message from the President of the United  States. The rule also restricts former Members' access to the House  floor during the joint session.   Additionally, the rule provides authority through April 22 for the  majority leader or his designee to move to en bloc postponed votes on  any suspension bill considered on April 19 or 20 on which the yeas and  nays were ordered.   Finally, the rule provides for recess instructions, same day, and  suspension authority through May 20.   Madam Speaker, Tocqueville wrote in ``Democracy in America'' that in  our country voting rights and democracy are always either contracting  and retreating and shriveling away or voting rights and democracy are  growing and expanding.   What a proud day for the United States Congress when we get to keep  the trajectory of American democracy moving forward by voting to admit  a new State to our beloved Union.   America began with 13 original States, and we in Congress have  exercised our powers under Article IV, Section 3 37 different times to  admit 37 new States to the Union, which means that nearly 75 percent of  the States in America today were admitted after the original 13.   Today, we can keep the dynamics of democratic political growth and  inclusion going in America by beginning the process of admitting  Washington, Douglass Commonwealth to the Union by passing H.R. 51.   We have the opportunity to do something that hasn't happened here  since 1959, when Alaska and Hawaii were admitted to the Union in  January and in August of that year.   We can vote to admit a new State to the Union, and what a State it  will be: A community of 712,000 taxable, draftable, law-abiding  American citizens who actually pay more Federal taxes per capita now  than do the people of any State, more in hard dollars than the people  of 22 States combined. It is a community of people who have fought in  every war that the Union has ever fought, going all the way back to the  American Revolution.   And it was a community, significantly, that came to the aid of  democracy, that came to the aid of the Union, that came to the aid of  this Congress when we called on January 6, 2021.   More than 850 officers in the Metropolitan Police Department came and  fought shoulder to shoulder with our Capitol officers in what has been  described as waves of medieval violence by insurrectionists and  Fascists attacking them with bats and sticks and American flagpoles and  Confederate flagpoles and Trump flagpoles. They sent more than 150  National Guardsmen from Washington, D.C., 154 D.C. National Guard, 850  Metropolitan Police Department to come and defend a democracy that they  are not yet a part of.   Now think about that. We had people who came and stormed the Capitol,  laid siege to the Congress of the United States with fictionalized  claims about a denial of their right to vote, and right in this city  there are 712,000 American citizens who we know have their voting  rights denied every single day, their rights to representation denied  every single day, and they came to defend us against those who would  have torn down the very citadel of democracy.   Think about that when we are deciding how to vote on H.R. 51.                                time  1445    The current status of the people in Washington, D.C., subjects them  to two different forms of political domination and exclusion.   On the one hand, all of their locally adopted laws ultimately can be  overturned by a Congress which they are excluded from, and it has  happened many times throughout the history of the District of Columbia,  as Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting Delegate, will  tell you. Congress has tampered with the laws of adoption, laws of  marriage, criminal justice laws, and voting laws in the District of  Columbia.   But it is not just that. It is not just that the rights of democratic  self-government are subject to the will of other people. It is also  that this community of taxpaying, draftable American citizens is  excluded from participating in Federal legislation because they don't  have voting representatives in the House and in the Senate.   That means on matters relating to war and peace, the confirmation of  U.S. Supreme Court Justices and other Federal judges, the development  of Federal budgets, the regulation of commerce domestically and  internationally, Federal criminal law, and Federal civil law, the  people of Washington, D.C., are dealt out. They are excluded. And they  want in. They want to enter the Union.   Most of us in Congress represent communities that were not part of  the original 13 but then came in later. Now, I come from Maryland,  which was one of the original 13, but most of the people in Congress  represent States that came in later.   So, this is an act of fundamental democratic and civic self-respect  on their part to be asking for equality and inclusion, and it is a  matter of basic constitutional patriotism and democratic respect that  we vote to admit them today.   I am very happy that we are kicking this process off by bringing this  rule to the floor.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me address a couple of the specious constitutional objections  that have been raised by our colleagues on the other side.   To begin with, it would be unconstitutional to turn the District of  Columbia into a State. It would almost certainly be that, but that is  not what the proposal is. The proposal is to redraw the boundaries of  the District of Columbia to cede the residential lands to the new State  to admit it. For that, there is both sound constitutional and  historical precedent.   For one thing, Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 says that Congress  shall ``exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever'' over  the district that is to become the seat of government, meaning that  Congress has the authority to modify the boundaries of the District of  Columbia, which it has done.   It did that, actually, in 1791. Not long after the original  boundaries were set, James Madison and 13 other Founders themselves  voted to alter the boundaries. But our colleagues seem to believe that  the boundaries of the District can't be altered by Congress.   In 1846, most significantly, Congress gave one-third of the District  of Columbia to the Commonwealth of Virginia at the behest of slave  masters, who correctly anticipated that the slave traffic would be  abolished within the District of Columbia. It was given back,  demonstrating that the authority of Congress to change the boundaries  of the District exists.   If Congress can alter the boundaries of the District of Columbia in  1846 in order to serve the slave masters and to protect their  institution, surely the Congress in 2021 can modify the boundaries of  the District of Columbia in order to admit a new State and empower  hundreds of thousands of people to live in political equality in the  country.   My distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania invites us to believe  that the 23rd Amendment is a constitutional impediment to adopting  statehood for Washington, D.C. He doesn't explain why it is  unconstitutional. He just asserts it would be unconstitutional.   The 23rd Amendment was adopted in order to give people living within  the seat of government the possibility of voting for President and to  have electoral college votes in a manner decided by Congress and then,  in Section 2, requiring Congress to act in order to organize the  electoral college in the manner of a State legislature organizing the  electoral college for the State.   As I understand H.R. 51, introduced by Congresswoman Norton, this  problem is taken care of at the moment of statehood admission because  it repeals the statute which organizes the electoral college for the  District of Columbia.   In other words, the moment the new State comes into being, the  current statute that organizes the Presidential electors is repealed,  so there is nothing to worry about. I agree that there is a certain  kind of messiness in still having the 23rd Amendment on the books, but  Congresswoman Norton has said she will be the first to introduce a  formal constitutional amendment to repeal the 23rd, and who would  oppose it?   Our colleagues have not been able to find a single person who would  oppose it. Everybody would agree it would be simply nonsensical to keep  it within the Constitution once the 712,000 people have negotiated an  exodus from the Federal seat of government in order to become their own  State.   So, I think that that is a red herring. It is an irrelevant  distraction to this journey toward statehood and political equality  that we are on.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia an additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentlewoman very much for her comments, and I want to  reemphasize the point that she made at the end, which is that Congress  has the exclusive authority to admit new States.   Congress has admitted 37 new States. None of them have ever been  struck down by a court, despite serious constitutional objections being  raised against almost every State.   Everyone knew that Hawaii and Alaska could not be admitted because  they were not contiguous. Everyone knew that Texas couldn't be admitted  because it was a separate republic, and there was no authority to admit  a republic to the Union. It was said Utah couldn't be admitted because  they were practicing polygamy there. And so on.   There have always been constitutional objections made, but the courts  have always deemed this to be a political question, which means that,  in the juridical context, it is up to Congress to decide. And Congress  has always been guided, in the final analysis, by the overriding  dynamic of American political history, which is democracy has to govern  for people who live here.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Madam Speaker, I want to say a word in response to my  colleague about the national political logic of statehood.   There is both powerful constitutional principle and national  political logic that infuses every statehood admission going back to  the very beginning of the Republic.   The constitutional principle is simply that of no taxation without  representation and the consent of the governed. People who are part of  the American Nation should be able to participate equally as complete  citizens.   That is why Thomas Jefferson set out in the Northwest Ordinance that  once a community got to be of a certain size--60,000, which, of course,  is less than 10 percent of the size of Washington, D.C., today--that it  would be eligible to come into statehood, to petition for statehood.  The only real constitutional prerequisite is a republican form of  government, that is the Republican Guarantee Clause.   That is the high-minded political ideal of constitutional principle,  but it is also the case, as I have tried to argue with my colleagues  across the aisle, that there is a hardcore political logic that is  operated, and we see it in their arguments that they don't want to  admit two Democratic Senators to the Republic, which is what former  President Trump said in objection to D.C. statehood. He said there is  no way we would accept two new Democrat Senators.   Actually, although I consider it a degradation of the process and a  sort of tawdry form of argument, nonetheless, it has been very much  part of American political history, which is why States have tended  to enter the Union in pairs, like animals boarding Noah's Ark together.    That was the situation with Kansas and Nebraska, in the Kansas- Nebraska Act; that was the situation of Missouri and Maine in the  Missouri Compromise; that was Vermont and Kentucky; that was Alaska and  Hawaii back in 1959.   So, I say to my friends, okay, they don't see the problem of taxation  without representation in Washington. They don't see the problem of  governance without representation. They don't see the irony or the  paradox or the contradiction of people putting their lives on the line  to defend this Congress, this Union, on January 6 who don't get to vote  for voting representatives in Congress.   They don't want to see that, fine. But they can at least see this: It  has been in the Republican platform since 1940 that Puerto Rico should  be admitted as a State. Every 4 years, they have said that the millions  of people, American citizens, who live in Puerto Rico should be  admitted as a State. It was in the platform in 2016. It would have been  in 2020 if they had had a platform. They decided not to have a platform  for the American people in 2020. But in any event, they have taken a  very strong position--Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, you name it.   In fact, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico is a Republican  who has introduced statehood legislation in this Congress, who is  fighting for statehood.   So, fine, there is the basis for common ground. Let's get together.  The Democrats have been arguing for statehood for Washington, D.C., for  a long time. The Republicans have been arguing for statehood for Puerto  Rico for a long time. I assume everybody means it. Let's get together  and do it the way this has happened periodically, systematically,  throughout American history. That is the national political logic of  allowing both of these states to come in together.   Not everybody gets everything that they want, and I do think that it  is antithetical to the democratic form of government to say you don't  want people to be represented because you don't like the way they are  going to vote because they disagree with you on issues. I think that is  fundamentally undemocratic and un-American.   Madam Speaker, in any event, we have the grounds for a compromise,  and I am still looking for some colleagues across the aisle to stand up  and say they will stand for the position  [[Page H1973]]  that they have embraced for decades, to say these two states should  come in together.                                time  1515    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon).    Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman invites us to return the  District of Columbia to Maryland, which, of course, debunks the  argument that Congress cannot modify the boundaries of the District of  Columbia.   But, in any event, that is not what the people of Washington, D.C.  have asked for. They have used their rights as American citizens under  the Ninth Amendment of the Constitution to organize a new State and to  petition Congress for admission to the Union. Neither has the Maryland  General Assembly asked for a return of the land to Maryland. So that  certainly answers a set of political conditions that don't exist in the  real world.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time to close.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, let me start by saying that the majority leader hardly  needs me to defend him, but I know that he was a strong supporter of  the D.C. voting rights constitutional amendment where there was  actually bipartisan support.   In those days, Republicans understood the grievous injustice being  perpetrated against the people of Washington, D.C., and they supported  granting people in D.C. two Senators, or what my colleague would call  two ultraliberal Senators, as well as the Representatives in the House  to which they were due.   There were certainly people who were saying there were other ways of  accomplishing it. Now, unfortunately, that bipartisan consensus  collapsed even though it passed the Senate and the House back in the  day. I don't hear any of my colleagues saying they are for it now.   Mr. Hoyer, the majority leader, is supporting the only viable vehicle  for getting equal rights for people in Washington, D.C., that exists  today, which is statehood, which is how 37 new States entered the Union  with Congress' exercise of its powers under Article IV of the  Constitution.   The gentleman waxed eloquent about the vision of a great Capital  City, but being a strict textualist, I assume that he wants to pay some  attention to the text of the Constitution. Article I, Section 8, Clause  17, the District Clause, sets a maximum, a ceiling that the District  may be no more than 10 miles square, but there is no minimum there. It  didn't say it must be at least 6 miles square or 2 miles square or 3  miles. No, that is up to Congress. In other words, it is a political  question within congressional power, our plenary power, over the  District of Columbia.   Finally, the gentleman, I suppose, gets to the heart of the matter  when he says that, for him, it is all about two ultraliberal Senators.  I would ask every Member of this body to think about that for a second,  reflect on that. In America, I don't think we deny people voting rights  based on how they are going to vote. I don't think we deny entire  States and political communities representation based on predictions of  who they might elect.   In fact, there is a Supreme Court case about that called Carrington  v. Rash. When armed services members in Texas were disenfranchised  because it was suggested they would vote in a way more identified with  the national government than with local cultural values in Texas, the  Supreme Court struck it down and said that, in American democracy, we  do not allow government to disenfranchise people based on predictions  of how they are going to vote or who they are going to elect.   That is precisely what the gentleman invites us to do here, to deny  712,000 taxpaying, draftable U.S. citizens, who came to our aid on  January 6, to deny them their equal rights under the Union, under the  flag, because he predicts that they are going to elect people whose  policy views are contrary to his own.   Madam Speaker, I would suggest that is totally antithetical to the  meaning of American constitutional democracy. Everyone should take a  walk around Washington. You will see flags in the yards of all the  people here, yards that we pass by every day when we come to  Washington, and they say, ``D.C. 51.'' They want their statehood. Let's  listen to the people of Washington.   If you can't quite stomach that, then read the Republican Party  platform itself, which calls for Puerto Rican statehood, and let's see  if we can do it together. Let's bring in millions of disenfranchised  people in America.   Still, I get radio silence from my colleagues on that. Not a single  one will opine about whether or not the people of Puerto Rico should be  admitted as a State.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  rule and the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 330         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2321) to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to       establish a plan to respond to irregular migration surges at       the border, to establish an irregular migration surge border       response fund, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Homeland Security. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. When the committee rises and reports the       bill back to the House with a recommendation that the bill do       pass, the previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2321.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
