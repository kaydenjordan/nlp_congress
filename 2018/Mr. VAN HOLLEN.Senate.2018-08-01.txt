 Madam President, I thank the Senator from Florida,  and I thank him not only for his leadership on the specific issue that  was in the Defense authorization bill regarding ZTE but also for his  leadership on the broader issue of protecting the United States against  the grand theft of our technology by China and the risks that China  poses to our national security in many areas.   I want to review what happened with respect to ZTE, which is a  Chinese telecommunications company.   No. 1, for many years, they have been about the business of stealing  technology from American companies. If you look at lawsuits and patent  lawsuits filed over the last decade, you will see it has been grand  larceny. We have a Chinese telecommunications company that has been  ripping off U.S. companies in order to gain a market advantage, and  they have been doing that in coordination and cooperation with the  Government of China.   They are stealing our technology. What are they using it for? Well,  they are a big telecommunications company. We heard testimony from the  Director of the FBI, and we heard testimony from the heads of U.S.  intelligence agencies that they pose an espionage threat to the United  States. All of them have said that it would be a great danger to our  national security and the privacy of millions of Americans to let them  anywhere near our telecommunications networks.   First, they steal our technology. Second, they plan to use a lot of  what they stole from us to spy on us. Then they went about violating  U.S. sanctions on North Korea and on Iran, not just once, twice--and  then they were caught again. Each time, they were warned, but they  continued to flagrantly violate our sanctions.   That is why the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, finally got fed  up with everything they were doing, and he imposed sanctions on ZTE,  including what is called the denial order saying that U.S. companies  should not be transferring technology to ZTE, which was then using that  technology to get market advantages and to potentially spy on the  United States. That was the right thing to do. Secretary Ross made a  decision based on the law and based on our national security interests.   A few days later, this is the tweet that went out from the President.  On May 13, President Trump tweeted:         President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give       massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into       business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce       Department has been instructed to get it done!    That was the tweet. With that tweet, which caught the Secretary of  Commerce and so many others by surprise, the President reversed the key  sanctions provision that the United States had imposed on ZTE for  violating our sanctions and for other bad behavior. This Senate, on a  bipartisan basis, said: Wait a minute. Secretary Ross was right. ZTE  violated our sanctions. They pose an espionage threat, and, by the way,  they have stolen a whole lot of U.S. technology over the years. He was  right.   That is why, on a bipartisan basis, we passed a provision that was  included in the NDAA to reimpose those sanctions  [[Page S5541]]  that Secretary Ross and the Commerce Department had put on in the first  place to protect our national security. Yet, as the weeks went by in  the conference committee, despite the best efforts of our ranking  member and many others, this got dropped.   This got dropped because the White House wanted it dropped based on  that earlier tweet. It got dropped because ZTE had spent $1.3 million  in lobbying fees over the last couple of months. That is a lot of  money. It was the highest amount of dollars spent in that period of  time for any lobbying issue before this Congress, but it is a pittance  for ZTE to pay to get its way and work with the administration to get  the provision that had passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis dropped.   I cannot tell you how difficult this is at this point in time. We  have a bill before us that in all other respects is a really good  bill--and a really good bill for our national security.   I want to commend the chairman and ranking member and others who have  been involved in that. But in the middle of a bill that is supposed to  help protect our national security, we now have a big hole because, by  taking out the amendment we had to penalize ZTE, the final result  creates unnecessary exposure.   It is sad to be here today. I am glad to join with my friend and  colleague, the Senator from Florida, who has been a leader on this, and  I think we both very much regret the fact that the Senate is in this  position now and that the country is in the position now.   I thank the Senator for his leadership and yield back to him the  remainder of the time.
