 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the  previous order in relation to the veto messages on S.J. Res. 9 and S.J.  Res. 24 so that, beginning at 2:20 p.m. today, there be up to 20  minutes for debate, concurrently and equally divided between the two  leaders or their designees, prior to rollcall votes on the passage of  S.J. Res. 9 and S.J. Res. 24 in the order listed, the objections of the  President to the contrary notwithstanding.    Mr. President, we all know we are down to the wire right  now, so we need to keep moving with this CR so we can avoid a damaging  and completely unnecessary shutdown.   This is a straightforward, bipartisan CR that simply keeps the  government funded so we can continue work on our full-year bills. It  includes absolutely essential, time-sensitive reauthorizations for the  FAA and others and extends urgently needed funding for disaster relief  and our allies in Ukraine.   I worked closely with the Senator from Maine and leadership in both  parties to put together a truly straightforward bill that can pass the  Senate, pass the House, and be signed into law. I am confident there is  enough support for this to pass the Senate and the House just as soon  as we put it up for a vote. The question is how quickly we can all work  to get this done.   I understand there are Senators who don't think there is enough in  this bill, but this is not meant to be the end-all, be-all when it  comes to legislating; it is meant to prevent a devastating shutdown. I  think we all understand there is more work to do on many of these  issues.   Many of you want to do more on disaster relief--something we must do  after we prevent a shutdown that cuts off relief to communities in the  middle of a recovery. I want to address the childcare funding cliff  head on, which we have got to do after we pass this so we can save  parents and kids from a shutdown that would mean they would lose their  access to Head Start. I know there are colleagues concerned about doing  more on border security--something I am willing to continue to  discuss--but time is of the absolute essence here, and a shutdown would  mean the folks who are working at our southern border would be forced  to work without paychecks.   A shutdown is no solution to anything. We have got 12 bipartisan  appropriations bills I have worked with many Members on both sides of  the aisle to pull together, and I want to get them passed and address  all of these critical issues, but we need to prevent a shutdown first.   So let's not act like this CR is the last bill Congress is ever going  to pass. Let's get this done so we can avoid a shutdown that hurts our  families, hurts our economy, hurts our national security, and more.  Then let's get back to work on the other issues that are important to  everyone here and to the folks we work for back home. I urge all of our  colleagues to vote yes now on the motion to proceed.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I urge that we go to the vote.                          Vote on Motion to Proceed     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I share my  colleague's concern about making sure our national parks stay open. In  fact, I don't want any Federal facilities to close their doors, any  Federal workers to miss a paycheck, or any programs families rely on be  undermined by a completely unnecessary shutdown, which is why I am  working around the clock to make sure we do pass this bipartisan CR  package, which we released yesterday.   So I hope the senior Senator from Utah will reconsider his recent  vote against moving forward on that CR and start working with us to get  this straightforward CR across the finish line so we can avoid this  shutdown and get back to passing our 12 bipartisan appropriations bills  because that is the only serious solution here. That is the best way to  make sure families are able to keep enjoying our national parks and  park rangers and all of our public servants can do the work the  American people are counting on and get the paycheck they deserve.   There are a lot of programs that we all care about that will be hurt  by a shutdown, so we are not going to solve this problem one by one,  carve-out by carve-out. As I said earlier, you don't stop a flood one  drop at a time; you build a dam.   We have a straightforward, bipartisan CR package to avoid a shutdown  and keep our national parks open. Let's get our jobs done and get that  passed.   So I object.
