 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a lifelong  leader of West Michigan's economic development community, Birgit Klohs,  president and CEO of The Right Place in Grand Rapids, MI. Ms. Klohs has  made an immense impact on western Michigan over the past 33 years and  has helped reshape the region and State's future.   Born in West Germany, Ms. Klohs left her home country to attend  Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, where she graduated with a  bachelors of business administration in finance. While going to school  full time, she began her economic development career in service to the  Berrien County Economic Development Corporation as an industrial  consultant and then eventually moved to the Michigan Department of  Commerce where she served as an account executive focusing on western  Michigan.   Later, as assistant director of the Office for Economic Expansion at  Grand Valley State University, Ms. Klohs was asked to join the region's  first-ever European foreign investment mission in conjunction with The  Right Place. The Right Place, an organization started in 1985 by Grand  Rapids area business executives, was concerned that the region was  missing out on economic opportunities. That trip involved discussions  with a German company that 2 years later broke ground on a new  manufacturing plant just north of Grand Rapids, a highlight in Klohs'  career dedicated to keeping and growing jobs in the region.   Mrs. Klohs applied for the directorship of The Right Place and began  leading the organization as president and CEO in 1987. At that time,  The Right Place had a small staff serving one county; after Ms. Klohs'  dynamic leadership and expertise, it grew into a  [[Page S854]]  team of more than 30 professionals serving a six-county region.  Throughout her three decades of leadership, The Right Place has  assisted thousands of west Michigan companies to invest more than $5  billion and create 48,500 new jobs throughout the region.   Ms. Klohs also helped the region, known for its manufacturing  heritage, to grow its skill and sophistication in making things, from  medical devices to office furniture. In the process, she helped the  region grow and increase the job opportunities across many sectors.  Those efforts attracted attention worldwide, with ``The Economist''  last year citing Grand Rapids as ``the most successful intensive  manufacturing city in America'' and Forbes ranking Grand Rapids No. 2  on its list of the top 15 industrial cities in America.   Over her career, Ms. Klohs worked closely with five Michigan  Governors to pursue economic development opportunities around the  globe. The region is now home to 136 foreign companies, including more  than 50 from her homeland of Germany. She is credited with fostering  countless public-private ventures that advance the economic prosperity  of the region, including the Medical Mile which is the 10th largest  life science cluster in the United States, the Michigan Manufacturing  Technology Center West, and partnerships with Hello West Michigan, the  first employer-driven relocation and job information center in the  Nation.   Most recently, The Right Place recognized that economic prosperity  was not being shared by all citizens. That led to the creation of a New  Community Transformation Fund to uplift communities of color through  capital investment. As the pandemic reared its ugly head throughout  2020, The Right Place quickly pivoted to assist in delivering $10  million in emergency financial aid to 1200 struggling businesses in the  Grand Rapids community and harnessed the region's manufacturing  ingenuity and supply chains to create and distribute lifesaving  personal protective equipment.   Ms. Klohs' commitment to the region and State was not limited to The  Right Place. Among the boards she chaired or served on are the Michigan  Economic Development Corporation, the Gerald R. Ford Airport Authority,  the International Crossing Authority, and the Western Michigan  University Board of Trustees, her alma mater.   Ms. Birgit Klohs was fond of saying that economic development was ``a  team sport.'' After 33 years as captain of one of the Nation's most  successful teams, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  congratulating her for her well-earned retirement from The Right Place  and to wish Birgit and her family health and happiness in the years  ahead.                            ____________________
