 Mr. Chairman, this bill does a number of important things  for our aviation industry, for safety, and for the traveling public,  including providing stable funding and a clear regulatory framework. In  my home State of Ohio, all these are critically important.   The partnership between the Federal Government and the airports is  strengthened in this legislation. Stable funding for the Airport  Improvement Program ensures that airports can continue to evolve, grow,  and plan thoughtfully for the long term.   Ohio's airports provide nearly $14 billion of economic activity for  the State. They support 75,000 direct and indirect jobs; they are  partners with our Reserve and Guard military wings; and they are the  front door to interstate and international commerce for our  communities.   Ohio's airports employ long-term planning, using a variety of funding  mechanisms to maximize the value of investments in facilities and  infrastructure. This bill advances and supports that growth. I am  pleased to see long-term certainty for the aviation industry through a  5-year reauthorization, and I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill and pass H.R. 4.
