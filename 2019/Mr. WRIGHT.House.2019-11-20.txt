 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced the K-9 Hero  Act last week.   Military and law enforcement K-9s work in tandem with the brave men  and women who serve our great Nation. Once these heroes retire from  service, the medical treatment they need is often significant enough to  create a financial hardship for the individuals who care for them.   The K-9 Hero Act creates a grant program to assist nonprofits that  take in retired working dogs or provide financial assistance to the  owners of retired working dogs. These grants will cover medical costs,  such as veterinarian visits, medical procedures, diagnostic tests, and  medications, which tend to average around $3,000 per year per dog.   As most know, just a few weeks ago, a K-9 played a crucial role in  the capture and ultimate killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  This K-9 took off, racing down an underground tunnel before cornering  Baghdadi, leaving him nowhere to run. It is stories like these that  inspired me to introduce the K-9 Hero Act.   These dogs assist our Federal Government in ways that no man or  machine could, and it is unacceptable to me for them to live with  inadequate medical care--or even be euthanized, in some cases--after  sacrificing so much for our country.   This bill helps ensure these heroes are well taken care of during  retirement and that their need for medical care never prevents them  from finding a loving forever home. My K-9-loving colleagues on both  sides of the aisle, I believe, should support this legislation.                      Stop the Practice of Teleabortion     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my outrage over the  practice of teleabortion. This practice, which gets its name from  practitioners conducting abortions over the phone or computer, occurs  when chemical abortions are induced with no healthcare provider  present.   This practice sounds simple, except the woman taking the drugs isn't  in a medical facility, no certified medical personnel are present, and  if the drugs don't work as planned and the baby is not stillborn, it  may still end up in a dumpster and the mother may end up in an  emergency room.   The obvious danger is why I filed H.R. 4935, the Teleabortion  Prevention Act. This legislation protects women's health by making it a  Federal offense for healthcare providers to perform a chemical abortion  without first physically examining the patient, being present during  the chemical abortion, and scheduling a follow-up visit for the  patient.   Chemical abortions are induced using a two-step abortion pill regimen  that can be taken up until the ninth week of pregnancy. Given the  serious risks, the FDA has put regulations in place, but pro-abortion  groups are looking for ways to get around the law.   If these FDA regulations are ever lifted, chemical abortion drugs  could become available by prescription, enabling a single healthcare  provider to mail chemical abortion pills to women and young girls  across the country, regardless of State pro-life protections and  whether they have seen a doctor and had an ultrasound performed. This  legislation ensures these much-needed FDA regulations will not be  lifted.   No doctor should feel comfortable prescribing a life-ending  pharmaceutical drug without physically being there to administer it to  the patient.   If the woman's health argument is really more than subterfuge that  puts dressing on a tragedy, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 4935, the Teleabortion Prevention Act.                     National Medal of Honor Monument Act     Mr. Speaker, I rise because yesterday I had the privilege  of introducing the National Medal of Honor Monument Act, with my fellow  Texan, Congressman Marc Veasey.   Over the course of our history, over 3,500 United States servicemen  and -women have been honored with our Nation's highest military  decoration, the Medal of Honor.   The Medal of Honor is awarded to U.S. servicemembers who have  distinguished themselves with extraordinary acts of valor. These men  and women I am referring to went above and beyond the call of duty on  the battlefield in order to preserve our families and way of life.   This legislation ensures that their contribution and patriotism are  never forgotten. These heroic individuals deserve to be memorialized  with a monument in our Nation's Capitol, among the other great  Americans that have helped shape our Nation.   In Texas, we celebrate patriotism, American ideals, and our Nation's  heroes. Earlier this fall, the National Medal of Honor Museum  Foundation chose my hometown of Arlington, Texas, as the location for  the new National Medal of Honor Museum. This legislation makes it  official.   Congratulations to Mayor Williams and the rest of Arlington's  leadership for bringing it to the 6.8 million Dallas-Ft. Worth  residents and the over 14 million visitors Arlington welcomes each year  and, most importantly, the 1.8 million veterans and Active-Duty  military that call Texas home.                            ____________________
