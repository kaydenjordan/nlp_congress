 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm about an  issue that is badly impacting my constituents in the Fifth District of  New Jersey every single day: the cap on the State and local tax  deduction, which led to a major tax hike on my district imposed by the  ``moocher States.''   Right now, as congressional leadership considers year-end legislation  in these last days of the year, why would they not fix the biggest tax  problem of them all: the State and local tax deduction?   It is time to end double taxation.   I released this report last week on the impact of the SALT cap on the  Garden State. It is clear, taxes in north Jersey are through the roof.  People are leaving the State in droves, and our home values are  plummeting because of the end of the State and local tax deduction.   It is time to end that cap, and I am calling on Congress--Democrats  and Republicans--to come together, to reinstate the SALT deduction this  year and give a real tax cut to north Jersey.   This Congress, I introduced bipartisan legislation to fully reinstate  SALT, and I helped lead not one, but two bipartisan resolutions  overturning the harmful Treasury regulations that kept us from  deducting charitable contributions on our Federal taxes.   We have to fix this and reinstate SALT this year and cut taxes for  New Jersey families, first responders, and small businesses that are  the backbone of our community. We simply can't afford to delay and prop  up the moocher States anymore.                            ____________________
