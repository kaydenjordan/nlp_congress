 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on women like  Sara, an Afghani television presenter who fled amidst death threats,  had waited for years to be resettled in the U.S., only to have her  hopes dashed.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my friend and  former colleague, Xavier Becerra, for his long and effective record of  service on behalf of California in Congress.   Attorney General Xavier Becerra has been a true mentor and a friend  to me, especially during this transition serving as a new Member of  Congress.   His support and his service reaffirm that the children of immigrants  and immigrants themselves have a crucial role to play in our Federal  Government.   I want to congratulate Xavier Becerra on his well-deserved  appointment to serve as California's attorney general. While he is no  longer with us in the House, I know that his new appointment will be  even greater felt across our country during these troubling political  times.   I have no doubt that, as attorney general, Xavier will defend our  Constitution and fight for families in California and help our State  serve as a beacon of hope and progress in America.                            ____________________
