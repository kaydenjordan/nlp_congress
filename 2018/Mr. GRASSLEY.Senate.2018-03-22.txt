 Mr. President, Senator Cochran and I met while serving  together in the House of Representatives, but it was in the Senate that  we became close colleagues. Throughout his service, Senator Cochran has  remained devoted to the U.S. Senate functioning as a bipartisan,  deliberative body. It is a goal I have long admired about Senator  Cochran and a mission I share.   As only the second Republican to be elected to represent Mississippi  in the House of Representatives since Reconstruction and the first  Republican to win a statewide election in a century at the time he was  elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Cochran proved that it is ideas and  commitment to constituents that move communities and  [[Page S1940]]  States forward. Throughout his career, Senator Cochran continued to  prove time and again that this is the path to legislative success.   You really get to know a colleague when you travel with them. I know  Senator Cochran as a deliberative and thoughtful colleague. Though  collegial and cautious, Senator Cochran was dogged in his pursuit to  represent the interests of Mississippi. Senator Cochran and I often  exchanged ideas in the Senate Agriculture Committee while he served as  chairman. I can say with certainty that he represented the farmers of  his State extremely well.   A hallmark of Senator Thad Cochran's distinguished career has been  his ability to work effectively and thoughtfully on behalf of  Mississippi. He has a courteous manner but commands the attention and  respect of his colleagues. His deep institutional knowledge and  dedication to public office will make him a sorely missed member of the  United States Senate.   I thank him for his faithful service to this body and wish him well  in his retirement.
