 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here today to support this  historic bill that will put our economy back on the path to stable and  sustained growth.   This bill finally levels the playing field and restores the global  competitiveness of American businesses by moving to a territorial  system. This key aspect of our bill removes the punitive barriers of  the current worldwide system and allows companies to reinvest their  overseas profits in America, without fear of getting hit with an  excessive tax burden. This important change ensures that America  remains the best place to start, grow, or invest in a business.   As companies begin to see the benefits of this new territorial  system, I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman to  explore ways to move toward a residency-based taxation system to ensure  that American citizens have a level playing field around the global as  well.   I have heard from companies, American companies, that say as they  expand their operations overseas, the Tax Code has made it prohibitive  for them to hire Americans for these jobs. In fact, our current system  of citizenship-based taxation makes Americans nearly 40 percent more  expensive to employ overseas than their foreign counterparts.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much for his understanding of  this issue and look forward to our continued work to ensure that  talent, not tax burden, is the driving factor in the hiring decisions  of multinational companies.   I am proud to support this bill. I look forward to it growing the  economy and ensuring businesses of all sizes have the capital necessary  to hire more employees, grow their operation, and give Americans the  raise they deserve.
