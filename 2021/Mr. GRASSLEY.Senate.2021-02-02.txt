 Mr. President, I come to the floor to bring up the  point that there must be equal attention to the dangers of extremism,  whether it is extremism of the right or extremism of the left.   We have all been horrified by the senseless criminal acts that  occurred at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 of this year. A violent mob  was able to overrun Capitol Police and quickly gain access to the area  where a joint session of Congress was being held. Five people,  including a Capitol Police officer, died as a result of this attack.   I hope that together, Republicans and Democrats, we can get to the  bottom of what occurred on that day and ensure that it never happens  again   In the spirit of collaboration, I must direct everyone's attention to  something that has occurred to me, and that is the need to condemn all  political violence regardless of ideology. Like many Americans, I have  been deeply troubled by the rioting, looting, anti-police attacks, and  deaths that have occurred this summer.   While many very legitimately protested the death of George Floyd in a  peaceful manner, consistent with their rights under the First  Amendment, thousands of others did not do it in a peaceful manner and  probably did it for a lot of other reasons than just George Floyd's  death. One of the most upsetting aspects of the violence of this summer  has been how it has targeted innocent law enforcement officers. Over  700 officers were injured between May 27 and June 8, 2020. This number  is likely underreported as nearly 300 of those injuries occurred only  in New York City.   Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli testified at  a hearing in front of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution  that there had been 277 Federal officer injuries at the Federal  courthouse in Portland, adding further to that total previously given  to you. Officers were assaulted nightly there for months--slashed, hard  objects thrown at them, struck with objects like hammers and baseball  bats, even blinded by lasers.   In another offensive, 60 Secret Service officers were injured during  a sustained attack on the White House, which caused then-President  Trump to be taken to a secure bunker. The church across the street from  the White House was lit on fire as part of that continued assault. Over  300 people were charged federally for their roles in these weeks and  months of violence. Eighty of those charges related to the use of arson  and explosives. Others involved assaults on officers and the  destruction of government property.   However, the nationwide riots, which broke out in nearly every major  city in the country, were predominantly State offenses. At least 14,000  people were arrested in 49 cities. At least 25 people died in violence  related to the riots. Property Claim Services--a company that tracks  insurance claims relating to riots and civil disorders--estimates that  the insurance losses from the summer's civil unrest ``far outstrip''  all previous records to possibly exceed $2 billion.   It has been a relatively frequent sight at the summer's violent  events to see individuals acting in coordination in all black bloc,  holding the ``A'' symbol of antifa. An admitted antifa adherent in  Portland murdered a conservative protester. Antifa supporters have been  charged federally for promoting riots and using Molotov cocktails.  While that violence has slackened now since President Biden's electoral  victory was declared, it has far from abated. Antifa rioters attacked  the Oregon Democratic Party's headquarters on inauguration day itself.  The far left of this country continues to believe violence will get  more attention for their causes even after a Democratic victory win for  the White House.   Much of the violence of the summer was specifically investigated by  the FBI as domestic terrorism. FBI Director Chris Wray provides  statistics on domestic terrorism in his annual threats testimony. He  has previously testified that 900 to 1,000 domestic terrorism  investigations exist at any given time. There are also about 1,000-- what they call--homegrown violent extremism investigations. These are  cases in which an entirely U.S.-based person without direct contact  with a foreign terrorist organization is motivated by the global  jihadist movement, and, of course, there are thousands more  international terrorism investigations.   Former U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox testified in a subcommittee  hearing that over 300 domestic terrorism cases were opened due to the  violence just this past summer. This is a significant increase in the  ordinary amount of domestic terrorism in the United States. That this  violence occurred--and the facts and the figures that surround it-- should not be news to anyone. However, I must admit that I have been  extremely surprised by the responses of Democratic Members to this  violence.   For weeks and months, the most consistent response seemed to be to  deny the violence was occurring at all. I saw Jerrold Nadler on TV--the  chairman of the House Judiciary Committee--deny that antifa itself was  real. In a nationally televised debate with then-President Trump, then- Candidate Joe Biden wrongly stated that antifa was only an ``idea.''  This is even after FBI Director Wray had already testified to Congress  that antifa was absolutely a ``real thing'' and that the FBI had cases  and investigations against those calling themselves ``antifa.''   It seems that some Democrats are living in a different world than  those who have seen businesses boarded up, if not burned out, images of  violence in the streets, and terrifying attacks on police officers.  When the violence was admitted by those same people, it seemed to have  been condone rather than condemned.    Now, Vice President Harris previously said:         They're not going to stop, and everyone, beware. [ . . . ]       And they should not, and we should not.    You have seen that quote many times on various TV channels. Our new  Vice President did not disclaim the rioting and unrest and direct her  followers only to lawful action.   Congresswoman Pressley stated: ``There needs to be unrest in the  streets for as long as there is unrest in our lives.''   Speaker Pelosi famously said this on the widespread property damage.  As you saw, when asked about it, she was quoted as saying: ``People  will do what they do.'' That is a direct quote from  [[Page S233]]  her, and you have seen that many times on television.   Now, that indifference that seems to be expressed in those and in a  lot of other quotations we could give to the violence that our  constituents were enduring was dramatically shattered when a violent  riot came to this building itself. After that event, many Members of  Congress asked why a more militarized force had not protected them from  a group of then-President Trump supporters who had turned violent.  Police officers were again considered heroes and protectors unlike last  summer when they were attacked. The presence of National Guard members  was all of a sudden welcomed rather than decried unlike last summer, in  cities like Portland and Seattle, when mayors condemned, maybe, the  President or the Federal Government, generally, for interfering and  trying to bring peace to those cities.   Many of the people of this country would like to have such resources  available to them to ensure their safety, like every weekend in Chicago  when there are dozens of people hurt by shootings and a lot of people  killed in that same weekend.   Since the day of the attack on the Capitol, I have heard much of a  renewed focus among my Democratic colleagues on combating domestic  terrorism and political violence, and there is nothing wrong with  combating domestic terrorism and political violence. That is why my  first words today were that there needs to be equal attention to the  danger of terrorism, whether it is of the left or of the right. As I  indicated in my words just stated, this is very much welcomed--any  attention we can give to domestic terrorism and political violence--and  I hope that we will be able to work together to keep Americans safe.   However, any work that we do in this area must be focused on  preventing violence no matter what ideology is given to justify that  violence. In fact, in a recent Department of Homeland Security  bulletin, that bulletin noted the breadth of potential threats we may  be facing after the Capitol riot, including domestic violent extremists  ``motivated by a range of issues, including anger over COVID-19  restrictions, the 2020 election results, and police use of force'' as  well as ``racial and ethnic tension'' and homegrown violent extremists  ``inspired by foreign terrorist groups.''   The response that I have seen to the Capitol riot here in Congress  has not given me hope that we are in agreement about combating this  broad range of threats in the spirit of giving equal attention to the  dangers of domestic terrorism or any kind of violation of law, whether  it comes from the right or the left. I have seen that many Democratic  Members of Congress seem to be discussing the need to combat White  supremacism with reference to the Capitol riot. I am not going to find  fault with anybody who talks about any race of any kind thinking they  are supreme to anybody else because we are all individuals that God  loves, and if we were to return that love, we wouldn't have a lot of  problems in this country.   We must absolutely combat White supremacism, wherever it occurs, and  we have a responsibility to understand the true factors that led to the  attack on this building. I hope to learn more from law enforcement over  the coming weeks and months about what the involvement of White  supremacists or any other extremist was in this attack.   However, I am concerned that the use of the term may have a different  purpose: to try to portray any supporters of former President Trump,  who garnered over 74 million votes in the most recent election, as  White supremacists.   Congresswoman Cori Bush stated on the House floor that former  President Trump was a ``white supremacist president who incited a white  supremacist insurrection.'' I hope everyone can agree that such  rhetorical and inaccurate characterizations are dangerous.   More concerning seems to be the idea that violence committed by the  far left or for left-leaning ideologies is in some way tolerable  because of the left's assessment that the purpose of all that violence  is somehow noble. However, right-leaning thought, whether accompanied  by violence or not, is considered terroristic.   Former CIA Director John Brennan, whose credibility has been  questioned, praised incoming President Biden's inaugural reference to  defeating ``white supremacy'' and likened libertarians to ``religious  extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists.''   It is hard to see how libertarian political philosophy, a mainstream  conservative political ideology which is scarcely in any way associated  with violence, is related to the other terms that Mr. Brennan lists,  unless, of course, Mr. Brennan is simply referring to religious  Americans as religious extremists, or those who believe in the rule of  law rather than antifa rioting as ``authoritarians'' and ``fascists,''  or those who believe in having a functioning immigration system as  somehow they seem to be bigots or racists or nativists.   In short, these are all terms that are applied regularly and unfairly  to conservative Americans using peaceful means to argue for their ideas  of religious freedom, law and order, and secure borders, and probably a  lot of other things that they argue for. Congresswoman Jackie Speier  was even more direct in a tweet, suggesting that all Republicans be  labeled terrorists.   As a body, we may begin looking into domestic terrorism more  generally. I look forward to so doing. I am sure all Members will share  my commitment that the focus of our inquiry should be on all of the  politically motivated violence we have seen in this country and not  somehow just a subset of that politically motivated violence. The men  and women of this Nation who have been affected by antifa and other  leftwing extremists are entitled to much more than a cursory  acknowledgment of that fact. Likewise, I hope no part of our effort  will focus on demonizing the peaceful expression of ideas with which  Democratic Members disagree.   I will be sharing the ideas that I have on this subject and these  concerns that I have stated today directly with my friend, the incoming  Senate Judiciary chairman, Senator Durbin. He will get a letter from  me, and I look forward to working with Senator Durbin on the path  forward.   I yield the floor.
