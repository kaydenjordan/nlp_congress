 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1404, I call  up the bill (H.R. 6833) to amend title XXVII of the Public Health  Service Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the Employee  Retirement Income  [[Page H8331]]  Security Act of 1974 to establish requirements with respect to cost- sharing for certain insulin products, and for other purposes, with the  Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the Senate amendment to H.R.  6833.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Continuing Appropriations and  Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, which extends funding for  Federal programs and services through December 16.   With a 72-25 vote, the United States Senate approved this legislation  with the support of all Democrats and 22 Republicans, including  Senators Shelby and McConnell.   Before I begin, I want to acknowledge the millions of people in  Florida, Puerto Rico, Alaska, and elsewhere reeling from recent  disasters, stranded without power and other necessary resources, and  mourning the loss of loved ones. This institution will stand with  communities across America as they rebuild and recover.   With the many challenges facing our Nation and the world, including  devastating natural disasters and the high cost of living, we cannot  wait any longer to pass this bill.   This bill guarantees that we have the means to continue the important  work we are doing to help middle class and working families with the  cost of living, support vulnerable Americans by keeping roofs over the  heads of millions of families and food on their tables, uphold our  commitment to our veterans, and strengthen our national security. But  this is not enough, and this solution is only a short-term one.   The Appropriations Committee and House Democrats worked to clear all  12 government funding bills out of committee and pass six on the floor  of the House this summer. These are transformational bills needed to  meet the moment and tackle our Nation's biggest challenges.   The legislation before us allows additional time for bipartisan,  bicameral negotiations to enact final 2023 funding bills.   The bill also includes $12.35 billion in necessary emergency funding  to support the Ukrainian people and global democracy in the face of  Russia's grievous invasion of Ukraine. This body came together twice  earlier this year to deliver on our commitment to the courageous people  of Ukraine, but most of those resources have already been disbursed or  committed.   For that reason, this bill includes necessary security assistance for  Ukraine, including $3 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance  Initiative to keep weapons and ammunition flowing without interruption,  and $1.5 billion to replenish U.S. stocks of equipment sent through  drawdown authority.   We also help Ukraine protect its democracy by supporting the  continuity of its democratic government and delivery of citizen  services with $4.5 billion. This contribution ensures we continue  upholding our moral responsibility to support the people of Ukraine in  the face of a vicious invasion that continues to demand decisive action  from us.   The bill also includes safeguards over these funds, such as a  requirement of third-party monitoring and a certification by the  Secretary of State that protects against corruption.   With $2 million for the DOD Inspector General to monitor funds and  provide Congress with a report inventorying security assistance, we  ensure weapons are used for their intended purpose by their intended  recipients.   At the same time, this bill responds to the devastation that recent  natural disasters and extreme weather events have left behind. As the  climate crisis wreaks havoc on communities all over our Nation, this  legislation provides significant support for disaster response and  recovery efforts.   Included in this is a critical $20 million in funding to complete  previously authorized Army Corps of Engineers projects that will help  address the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, and upgrade its water  and wastewater infrastructure.   In the wealthiest Nation in the world, the bare minimum every person  deserves is drinking water that is clean and safe, and this bill gets  us one step closer to that minimum.   By fully funding the Disaster Relief Fund, this bill responds to  Hurricane Ian in Florida; to the crisis left behind in Puerto Rico  after the devastating Hurricane Fiona; and to the severe storm,  flooding, and landslides in Alaska, helping with recovery and disaster  relief efforts.   We also provide $1 billion in funding for the Low Income Home Energy  Assistance Program to help lower-income families cover the rising  energy costs of home heating and cooling; including $2.5 billion to  address the largest wildfire in New Mexico, in their history, that  started from prescribed burns on Federal land; and support these and  other communities all over the Nation, including Kentucky, California,  Louisiana, and Texas, by providing $2 billion to help address unmet  housing, infrastructure, and economic recovery needs in communities  recovering from recent wildfires, major storms, droughts, floods, and  extreme heat.   While this legislation provides a bridge to an omnibus, it is not  perfect. I am saddened that the continuing resolution does not fully  meet some of our country's most urgent needs, including the ongoing  COVID-19 pandemic and monkey pox outbreak. I will continue working to  provide the resources to combat these public health crises and support  the areas in need of additional resources to recover from natural  disasters.    Despite these shortcomings, the investments included in this bill are  urgent and necessary to avoid disruptions to vital Federal agencies, to  help communities get back on their feet, and to ensure we have the time  needed to negotiate a final funding agreement that meets the needs of  hardworking people.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.                                time  1130     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We need this bill. We need this bill to continue negotiating final  2023 funding bills.   With the bill before us, what is in this bill, and why is it so  onerous to some?   We provide relief to working families, our schools, our children,  small businesses, and communities across this Nation.   We support the people of Ukraine. We support them in what is the  fight for their lives, for their democracy, and for world democracy  against Russian aggression.   We protect communities everywhere in need of safe water. We help to  rebuild them from crushing natural disasters.   This bill will make a very real difference in the lives of Americans  everywhere, and I am proud to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  these bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Fairness for 9/11  Families Act.   9/11 is a day that left an indelible mark on all of us. We all  remember where we were. When the towers fell, they took so many  innocent lives, and the families left suffered irreplaceable loss. This  bill would provide catch-up payments to 9/11 survivors, spouses, and  dependents, who were unfairly excluded from the U.S. Victims of State  Sponsored Terrorism Fund. While no amount of money can make up for  their loss, this bill would fairly compensate them for their claims  against those responsible for one of our Nation's darkest days.   It would provide some relief to people like my constituents: Gail  Eagleson, who lost her husband, Bruce, on 9/11, and her son, Brett  Eagleson, who lost his father on 9/11. He was just 15 years old. That  dark day Bruce saved lives. He was an incredible human being, a devoted  husband, father, and friend. In helping to save lives, he lost his own.   Bruce would be proud to know that his son, Brett, has led the charge  on this fight. I have been so proud to work with him. It is an honor to  work with him to get this done. He never gave up. The families never  gave up.   While we cannot fill the hole in the hearts of these families, we can  say, We understand your sacrifice, your loss, and make justice work on  your behalf.   Mr. Speaker, today, I urge my colleagues to stand with all these  families. Do the right thing. Support this critical legislation. It is  so long overdue.                                time  1200     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 45) providing  for a correction in the enrollment of H.R. 6833, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.
