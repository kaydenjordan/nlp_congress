 Mr. Speaker, most people would think that the most  surprising bill to me that we voted on this year was the Articles of  Impeachment. Really, that wasn't a surprise to me because I serve on  the Judiciary Committee, and since January, we have been doing  investigations of President Trump. Many Republicans and I predicted all  along that the majority, the Democrats in this House, were going to  vote to impeach the President, so it really wasn't a surprise to me.   But this bill really surprises me, and let me tell you why. My  goodness, I have served in the Arizona House of Representatives for 6  years and another 3 years in the Arizona Senate. For years, every time  the Republican majority would cut taxes so that it would boom the  economy and help everyone, my Democratic colleagues then said: ``Oh, my  gosh, those Republicans, they are just helping the rich. They are just  helping the rich. They don't care about the little guy. They don't care  about the middle class.'' The same thing is said for years now, years  and years, by my Democratic colleagues and others that: ``Oh, those  Republicans, they just care about the rich.'' Oh, baloney.   The tax cut Republicans did in 2017, you can see the effect of those  tax cuts. The economy is booming.                                time  0930    There are more job openings than there are jobs to fill them.   This bill is an interesting bill because, in the 2017 tax cut bill  that the Republicans put through, it said--you know what--States that  are fiscally responsible, that don't have exorbitant property taxes,  those constituents in my State of Arizona--   What did you say, sir?   Did you say I was wacko?   Oh, thank you, sir.   Mr. Speaker, people in Arizona, we are responsible taxpayers. We  don't have exorbitant property taxes. I know people who live in New  Jersey, and I know how they complain how their property taxes are so  incredibly high.   The people in Arizona are fiscally responsible, and that is why  people are flocking to our State and other States with low taxes.  People in Arizona and other States that are fiscally responsible, they  don't want to subsidize the irresponsible States that have high taxes  by giving them huge deductions on their Federal taxes.   So, in the Republican tax bill, we capped the deduction at $10,000.  It seems reasonable to me. In fact, the gentleman from New Jersey, I  think, just said, recently, the average deduction is $9,000. Well, that  is below $10,000. That is below the $10,000 cap, so they can deduct it.   But here in this bill today, Democrats want to raise the cap to  $20,000 and then totally eliminate it in the next 2 years.   When the Republicans put forward amendments, one of the amendments  said let's not give this tax break to the top 10 percent of income  earners. Democrats rejected it.   Then Republicans had another amendment that said, well, let's not  give this big tax break to the top 1 percent income earners. The  Democrats rejected it.   So, please, the next time my Democratic colleagues, and Democrats  throughout the Nation, when they say it is the Republicans who are  always for the rich people, let's look at this bill, because the proof  is here. No, it is the Democrats.
