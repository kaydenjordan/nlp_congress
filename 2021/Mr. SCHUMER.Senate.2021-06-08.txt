 Mr. President, the Senate, today, will achieve an  important milestone for the session. We will confirm the first of  President Biden's judicial nominees--the first but, certainly, not the  last, not even close. We will soon confirm Julien Neals to be a judge  for the District of New Jersey. Afterward, we will turn to the  nomination of Regina Rodriguez to be a judge for the District of  Colorado. I greatly look forward to confirming what will be the first  of many judicial appointments during the Biden administration.    Mr. President, first, I, too, would like to thank  Senators Cantwell and Wicker for an amazing, bipartisan job; and  Senators Menendez and Risch, another great bipartisan contribution. All  the Members--just about every Member has contributed to this bill.   I do want to single out two of my staff members who just slaved over  this bill relentlessly, and that is Mike Kuiken and Jon Cardinal. Mike  is there. I don't know if Jon is here. But they deserve tremendous  kudos for what they did. Without them I don't think we would have had a  bill, to be honest with you--and everybody else, all the other staffs  who worked so hard.   Now, this is a quote from Dr. Vannevar Bush: ``Without scientific  progress, no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our  health, prosperity, and security in the modern world.''   That was Dr. Vannevar Bush, the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific  Research, writing in 1945. His report to President Truman was titled:  ``Science--The Endless Frontier''--an inspiration to the legislation we  considered today.   In the wake of Dr. Bush's report, we created the National Science  Foundation. We funded the National Laboratories. We split the atom. We  spliced the gene. We landed a man on the Moon. We unleashed the  internet. We generated 75 years of American prosperity and fostered an  innate sense of optimism in the American spirit.   We face a challenge now--in this century--to replicate the success of  the previous one. But the Federal Government's commitment to science,  unfortunately, has waned. As a percentage of GDP, we spend less than  half as much as the Chinese Communist Party on basic research.   We rely on foreign nations to supply critical technologies that we  invented, like semiconductors. That sunny American optimism has  flickered as well.   The world is more competitive now than at any time since the end of  the Second World War. If we do nothing, our days as the dominant  superpower may be ending.   We don't mean to let those days end on our watch. We don't mean to  see America become a middling nation in this century. We mean for  America to lead it. Passing this bill--now called the U.S. Innovation  and Competition Act--is the moment when the Senate lays the foundation  for another century of American leadership.   Let me say that again. This bill could be the turning point for  American leadership in the 21st century, and for that reason, this  legislation will go down as one of the most significant bipartisan  achievements of the U.S. Senate in recent history.   Around the globe, authoritarian governments believe that squabbling  democracies like ours can't unite around national priorities. They  believe that democracy itself is a relic of the past and that by  beating us to emerging technologies, they--many of the meritocracies-- will be able to reshape the world in their own image.   Well, let me tell you something. I believe they are wrong. I believe  that this legislation will enable the United States to outinnovate,  outproduce, and outcompete the world in the industries of the future. I  believe that the strongly bipartisan work on this bill has revealed  that in this Chamber, we all believe that another American century lies  on the horizon. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.    I yield the floor.                               Vote on S. 1260     Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Washington  for her incredible leadership not only  [[Page S3981]]  on this bill but on this issue for pretty close to a decade, and it is  long overdue.   You know, we have been working in a very bipartisan way on numerous  subjects, including the competition bill that just passed, but it  appears there are real limits to bipartisanship here in the Senate.   We are about to vote just to start debate--just to start debate on a  bill that is very simple--provide equal pay for women. It is a modest  proposal to address a real problem in our economy.   Women with the same jobs and same qualifications as their male  colleagues often make less money. It is too hard for too many women to  overcome that pay discrimination. This makes it easier for women to  achieve pay parity, and like the previous bill, will help unleash  strong economic forces to help America go forward because when women  are not getting the pay they deserve, it impedes our whole economy and  all of the human resources that we need.   Every Senate Democrat is ready to start debate on the Paycheck  Fairness Act, but Senate Republicans seem to be mounting another  partisan filibuster against this bill.   It is ridiculous that Senate Republicans will not even allow the  Senate to debate a straightforward piece of legislation to help provide  equal pay for working women in America, just like it was ridiculous for  the Republican minority to filibuster bipartisan legislation to create  an independent Commission on January 6.   Americans expect their government to make progress to improve our  country, but Senate Republicans once again seem to be choosing  obstruction.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 131.
