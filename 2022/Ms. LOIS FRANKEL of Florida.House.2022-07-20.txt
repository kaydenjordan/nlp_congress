 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr.  Larson, for spearheading this fight to keep Social Security secure.   It is hard to believe that Republicans actually want to stop the  program in 5 years so they can reassess. I tell you, that is big  trouble. It is big trouble if they do that for the millions and  millions of Americans who depend on Social Security; 4.5 million, Mr.  Larson who live in the State of Florida.   Our workers spend their lives working hard for these benefits, and so  don't they deserve when they retire to make sure that they have enough  money to see that their bills are paid? That is why the Social Security  2100 Act is so important.   It is going to improve a needed bump to the cost of living. It is  going to provide a special benefit for low-wage earners, folks like  waitresses and custodians, nurses' aides, people who are important to  our economy.   This is a big deal. It is a big deal, especially for the retirees who  depend on Social Security to cover their everyday expenses. Just ask  Alice from my hometown, who was a housekeeper her entire life. She  worked 40 hours a week until she turned 65. She is earning $923 a month  on Social Security. Her rent just increased to a whopping $855 a month.  That is not sustainable. That is not right. That is not what America is  about. No one who has worked hard their entire life should retire into  poverty.   I am proud to join my colleagues, overwhelming support from Democrats  for the Social Security 2100 Act. It has got the updates we need to  keep this critical program working now and for the future.   Let me just say, the timing of this bill could not be more urgent.                                time  1515
