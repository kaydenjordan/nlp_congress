 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Equality Act, landmark legislation that provides LGBTQ people with the  full protections of Federal civil rights law.   Among many other critical protections that the Equality Act extends  to LGBTQ people are housing protections for homeless youth who can be  harassed, assaulted, or even kicked out of shelters based on their  gender identity or sexual orientation. This is because 27 States across  the Nation lack LGBTQ nondiscrimination protections.   At the same time, LGBTQ youth are 120 percent more likely to  experience homelessness. Protecting young people, giving them the  resources to succeed early in life and keeping them safe and secure are  all values we share. The Equality Act takes a massive step forward to  advance these values, reflecting the tremendous progress forged by our  Nation and those who came before us.
