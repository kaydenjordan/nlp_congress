 Mr. Speaker, I rise as the water level in Lake  Mead sits at yet another all-time low. Today, Lake Mead, which provides  water for 25 million Americans, holds just 27 percent of its capacity.   Just 40 years ago, as you can see here, Lake Mead was actually above  full capacity. But now we face the threat of the worst megadrought in  12 centuries.   The clock is ticking, and we must act now.   That is why I am supporting the Wildfire Response and Drought  Resiliency Act. This package includes three of my bills to tackle our  drought, conserve water, enhance our research capabilities, and keep  more water in Lake Mead for Nevadans.   We cannot let politics get in the way of this. Water is not a  partisan issue.   Every Nevadan, every American, whether Democrat, Republican, or  Independent, needs a stable water supply.   Let's pass this package and help secure our future.                            ____________________
