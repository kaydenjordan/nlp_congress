 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major  General Benjamin Corell of Strawberry Point, Iowa, for his outstanding  service as a 37-year member of the Iowa National Guard.   Major General Corell retired last week after serving as Iowa National  Guard's top general since 2019, leading the Guard through the COVID  pandemic.   Throughout his decorated career, Major General Corell has deployed  overseas to Iraq, Afghanistan, Romania, and Kuwait, and has led several  of the National Guard's infantry divisions. He retired with a master's  degree and a career full of military awards and accomplishments.   Major General Corell plans to spend his retirement with his wife,  Beth, and their seven grandchildren, passing along the values that  guided him through his career. All three of his sons are  noncommissioned officers in the Iowa Army National Guard. I wish them  the very best as they follow in the footsteps of an excellent father  and role model.   Coming from a financially challenged family in rural Iowa with no  college education, Major General Corell's life journey represents the  very best of Iowa and the rest of the country and serves as a shining  example for generations to come.   I am grateful for Major General Benjamin Corell's service, and I wish  him a relaxing and fulfilling retirement.        O'Hara True Value Hardware Closing After 83 Years in Business     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize O'Hara True  Value Hardware in Ottumwa, Iowa, which is closing after 83 years in  business.   Martin and Florence O'Hara opened the doors of O'Hara Appliance in  January of 1940, but before long, the appliance store quickly shifted  into a hardware store, too. Martin had offered home repair advice for  years, and the shift came naturally.   The O'Haras value being family owned and operated, and their children  each grew into employees at the shop, including their son Mike, who  ultimately took over the business and who I know well.   For years, Mike O'Hara has continued his family's legacy in Ottumwa,  offering the best service and advice for all things plumbing,  electrical, automotive, construction, and repairs. You could take in  any kind of screw from any kind of product, and they could tell you  what it went for and how to replace it.   The store is also famous for having the best Christmas decorations in  town, to include live reindeer in a stable outside throughout December.   O'Hara has overcome numerous challenges over the last several  decades, including major fires, the flood of 1993, and most recently,  the COVID pandemic.   Mike's commitment to serving his community has always remained clear  and steadfast. I am proud to know Mike and his family, and I wish him  the very best in retirement--they so deserve that--but they are going  to be greatly missed. The town will cherish their memories from  O'Hara's and we will all miss going there for home repair needs.                            ____________________
