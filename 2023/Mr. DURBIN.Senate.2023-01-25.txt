 Mr. President, the State of Illinois is my home, and it  holds an important place in the history of the American labor movement.  All of us learned the name Upton Sinclair in our early days in school,  the author of the 1906 novel ``The Jungle,'' which told the story of  the horrendous working conditions endured by, largely, immigrant  workers in Chicago's meatpacking plants and led to Federal regulation.   A. Philip Randolph, founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car  Porters, one of America's first unions for African-American workers,  was a civil rights champion and a leader of the 1963 March on  Washington.   There is also the story of Mary Harris ``Mother'' Jones, an Irish  immigrant who survived the Great Famine in Ireland, the yellow fever  epidemic of 1867, which took the lives of her husband and children, and  after her own dress shop was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of  1871, she went on to become a woman labor organizer and a fierce and  beloved champion of coal miners. Before she died, she said she wanted  to be buried in a place of honor among coal miners. She is buried in a  town near my home called Mount  [[Page S83]]  Olive, IL, in the Union Miners Cemetery, the only union-owned cemetery  in America.   Aside from being legends of labor history, Upton Sinclair, A. Philip  Randolph, and Mother Jones had something else in common. They are all  members of the Illinois Labor History Society's Union Hall of Honor,  which was founded in 1969 to make sure that important figures and  defining chapters of America's labor history are not forgotten.   The society's highest honor is to be named to its Union Hall of  Honor. Last month, a longtime friend of mine, John Penn, was inducted  into the Illinois Labor History Society's Union Hall of Honor. After  nearly 60 years of protecting workers' rights in Illinois, the Midwest,  and our Nation, John has certainly earned that honor. He is one of 113  men and women who have been inducted into the Union Hall of Honor, but  to me John is one in a million.   He got his first union card in 1965, when he was 16 years old,  joining the Laborers' International Union of North America Local 362 in  Bloomington, IL. He took a break by joining the United States Air  Force, serving in Vietnam, Korea, Guam, and then returning back to  Bloomington and Local 362.   It was the same path taken a generation earlier by his father, Paul  Penn, a World War II veteran who rose to become president of the same  local. But John's family connections didn't win any special treatment.  He had to rise through the ranks, and rise he did--from business  manager of Local 362 to business manager of the 36-county North Central  Illinois Laborers' District Council, then business manager of the four- state Great Plains Laborers' District Council, and, in 2008, vice  president and regional manager of LIUNA's 10-State Midwest region and a  member of the international union's general executive board, positions  to which he has been reelected three different times.   Under John Penn's leadership, LIUNA Local 362 grew, giving a voice to  scores of workers who previously had never benefited from union  representation.   Some years ago, in response to several tragic accidents, John made  himself known to many by stopping all highway construction in McLean  County to force the State of Illinois to improve protections for  vulnerable construction workers and others on the State's roadways.  That action culminated in the creation of the Illinois State's Work  Zone Safety Committee and implementation of numerous policies that  saved lives.   Somehow, John also found time to resurrect Bloomington's Labor Day  parade, to serve on several community and State boards, including the  United Way of McLean County, the Children's Christmas Party for  Unemployed Families, Illinois Special Olympics, the McLean County  Promise Council, and the Bloomington-Normal Advancement and Economic  Development Council.   He was honored by his hometown newspaper, the Bloomington Pantagraph,  as its 2003 Person of the Year. He received a Thousand Points of Light  Foundation award from then-President Clinton in 1997 in recognition of  his volunteer efforts and those of all Bloomington-Normal building  tradespeople who he recruited over the years to take part in these  organizations.   At the end of this month, John Penn is retiring from this position  with the Laborers' union. As he begins this new chapter, Loretta and I  wish John and Mary, his wife of 55 years, good health, good times with  their daughter Shawn, their children and grandchildren.   John, you made a real difference for so many people. You are truly a  hall of famer, and thanks for all that you have done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in the last two centuries, Federal support  for scientific research has helped to split the atom, defeat polio,  explore space, create the internet, map the human genome, develop  vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, and so much more.   No nation has made such significant investments in science, and no  nation's scientists have done more to improve the quality of life.   But with the challenges we face today, from devastating diseases to  climate change, there is more progress to be made.   So America is at a turning point, and unless we commit to providing  strong and sustained funding increases for our Nation's premier medical  and scientific researchers, our position as the world leader will be at  risk.   That is exactly why, since 2014, I have continued to introduce  legislation to keep our Nation on the cutting edge. It is entitled the  American Cures Act.   This bill will provide our top medical research Agencies with 5  percent real funding growth every year. That is steady, predictable  growth, pegged above the rate of inflation.   This money would support the National Institutes of Health, the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense  Health Program, and the Veterans' Affairs Medical and Prosthetics  Research Program.   This investment would be game-changing for the Agencies. Consider the  National Institutes of Health. It is our Nation's--if not the world's-- premier medical research Agency. Their pioneering work at this single  agency saves lives and fuels our economy, supporting nearly 20,000 jobs  just in my home State of Illinois.   Today, the NIH budget is $47.5 billion. More than 95 percent of this  funding is competitively awarded to scientists, research institutions,  and small businesses in every State across the country.   Researchers supported by the NIH make tens of thousands of new  discoveries every year--breakthroughs that could literally change the  world.   In recognition of these remarkable feats, Congress has, on a  bipartisan basis, increased the NIH annual budget by more than $17  billion since I first introduced the American Cures Act in 2014.   This chart is an indication of that growth. It has gone from $30  billion to $48 billion in that period of time since 2014--a 58-percent  increase.   These increases would not have been possible without a bipartisan  effort in the U.S. Senate.   I enlisted a willing participant and ally and really effective Member  of the Senate, Patty Murray, to be part of this; former Senator Roy  Blunt of Missouri, who, when the Republicans were in majority control  of the Senate, kept up this promise to increase the spending; and  retired Senator Lamar Alexander from Tennessee, who shared our passion  for medical research.   Luckily, we had a leader at the time, Dr. Francis Collins, former  Director of the NIH, who really did his part in enlisting support for  these increases.   NIH is not the only Federal medical research Agency to see  significant funding increases. We have also secured $2.4 billion in  increased funding for the CDC over the last 9 years. That is a 35- percent increase since fiscal year 2014.   And while it is not reflected in the chart I just showed, both the  CDC and NIH also received billions in supplemental funding from COVID  rescue bills passed by the Senate in 2020 and 2021.   While this year's budget provided a 5.8-percent bump to the NIH, a  $2.5 billion increase, I am sorry to say we fell short of the 5-percent  real-growth target above inflation.   If we had met this target, NIH would have received $650 million, up  to a level of more than $48 billion.   That said, I am still encouraged about how far we have come. We  finally reversed a 22-percent decline in NIH purchasing power that took  place after 12 years of flat funding, but we need to step up our  efforts.    Diseases like cancer, stroke, opioid addiction, and mental illness  will not wait on us. Half of all men and one-third of all women in the  U.S. will develop cancer in their lifetime. Someone's mother, father,  brother, sister, or spouse is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease every  65 seconds.   And 1 in every 300 people will be diagnosed with ALS in their  lifetime. Sadly, a number of my closest friends already have received  this diagnosis.   Sustained and robust NIH funding will help cure, prevent, and treat  these diseases. It will help the people that we all care about the  most, and it already has.   Because of NIH funding--listen to this--the American Cancer Society  estimates that nearly 3\1/2\ million lives were saved between 1991 and  2019 as a result of improvements in cancer treatment, detection, and  prevention--a 32-  [[Page S84]]  percent drop in the cancer death rate since 1991.   Thirty years ago, HIV was a death sentence, but because of NIH  research, that is no longer the case.   And because of NIH funding, we are also on the verge of curing--yes,  curing--sickle cell anemia, an inherited blood disorder that primarily  affects African Americans.   Consider this: NIH funding contributed to research associated with  every new drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration from 2010  to 2019.   Let me repeat that for emphasis. There are only two countries in the  world that allow general advertising of prescription drugs--the United  States and New Zealand. You can't turn on the television without  hearing the story of a new drug. Every single drug approved by the Food  and Drug Administration from 2010 to 2019 started off with government- funded, taxpayer-funded research at the National Institutes of Health.   So when you see these wonderful drugs, understand we, as Americans,  put down the initial investment that made these drugs all possible.   However, there is a real threat to our Nation's investment in medical  research. The new House Republican majority, after more than a dozen-- in fact, 15--painful and embarrassing failed votes to secure the  Speaker, announced that Speaker McCarthy had finally won the day, he  made some deals, agreements with MAGA Republicans for that to happen.   One of those agreements would literally devastate funding for medical  research in the future. What a price to pay.   He reportedly agreed to hamstring government funding for 2024 at 2022  levels--a senseless move--senseless move--that would cut funding for  scientific breakthroughs by roughly 7 percent and delay the delivery of  new cures and treatments for those most in need.   So I would like to know, for the record, which diseases and  conditions would Speaker McCarthy and the House Republicans like us to  slash funding for? Cancer? Alzheimer's? Parkinson's? Diabetes? ALS?  Heart disease? Which one?   Speak up, Mr. Speaker. This is supposed to be a new transparent House  of Representatives. If you are going to cut funding in medical  research, what can we put on the back of the burner, and how can we  explain that to the families across America?   Now is not the time for political horse-trading that puts one person  in power at the expense of everyone waiting for a cure.   We need to build on the bipartisan success which we have had to date  and we have achieved over the past decade and continue to prioritize  medical research funding that creates jobs but, most importantly, saves  lives.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 65         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Interagency Patent       Coordination and Improvement Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Decisions by the United States Patent and Trademark       Office relating to patents may implicate, or have relevance       to, information housed at or involving other Federal       agencies.        (2) Entities submitting patent applications to the United       States Patent and Trademark Office may also submit       information to, or share information with, other Federal       agencies, necessitating accuracy and consistency in those       representations.        (3) Research has shown that patent examiners may benefit       from additional information that is housed at, or is       available to, Federal agencies other than the United States       Patent and Trademark Office in order to assess prior art and       the state of science and technology.        (4) The Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual       Property and Director of the United States Patent and       Trademark Office is encouraged to work with other Federal       agencies.
