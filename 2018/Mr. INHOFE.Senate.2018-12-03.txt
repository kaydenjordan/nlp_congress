 Madam President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Reed, as the  Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and  the cochairs of the Senate Army Caucus, it is our honor to pay tribute  to a great leader and an exceptional officer of the U.S. Army, MG Brian  E. Winski, the chief of legislative liaison for the Office of the  Secretary of the Army, as he prepares to leave this position for a new  post in the Army of even greater importance to our Nation. Major  General Winski provides outstanding leadership, advice, and sound  professional judgment on numerous critical issues of enduring  importance to the Army, Congress, and this Nation.   Major General Winski has served our Army and our Nation for more than  30 years. A native of Wisconsin, Major General Winski was commissioned  in 1988 as an infantry officer from the University of Wisconsin. He has  been a true professional, dedicated soldier, leader, and officer.  Throughout his career, he has commanded our great soldiers at many  levels and deployed to combat numerous times in defense of the nation.   He has served in various command and staff positions over multiple  combat tours to Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan. He was a rifle platoon  leader in Desert Shield/Storm, infantry battalion executive officer  during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, chief of operations for the 101st  Airborne Division in Iraq, reconnaissance squadron commander in Iraq,  Division Operations Officer for the 101st Airborne Division in  Afghanistan, and brigade combat team commander in Iraq.   Major General Winski has extensive joint and interagency experiences.  He has served as the operations director CJ-3 for Regional Command East  in Afghanistan, G-3 Chief of Operations for Multi-National Division  North in Iraq, and as a military professor in the leadership department  at the Naval War College.   His other assignments included service in the 82nd Airborne Division,  the 101st Airborne Division AASLT, the 3rd Infantry Division, the 1st  Cavalry Division, the Joint Readiness Training Center, the Naval War  College, and the Army Legislative Liaison office. Major General Winski  recently served as the Director of Army Operations, Readiness, and  Mobilization, HQDA G-3/5/7.   For the past 18 months, Major General Winski has implemented and  enhanced strategic partnerships with Congress. Through his leadership,  the Army significantly advanced relationships with both legislative  chambers and improved and broadened congressional support for Army  priorities. Major General Winski managed complex issues through  multiple legislative cycles, enabling the Army to receive the necessary  resources to improve readiness, accelerate modernization, and reform  processes to support combat operations, sustain the all-volunteer  force, and improve the quality of life for soldiers, Army civilians,  and their families.   On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, we thank  Major General Winski, his wife Kim, and their entire family for their  continued commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to this great  Nation. We join our colleagues in wishing him future successes as he  continues to serve our great Army and Nation.  [[Page S7255]]                                ____________________
