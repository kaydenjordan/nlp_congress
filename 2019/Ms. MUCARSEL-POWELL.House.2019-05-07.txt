 Mr. Speaker, today we mark 1 year since former  White House Chief of Staff John Kelly led the Trump administration in  implementing the cruel policy of separating families at the border and  criminalizing refugees and asylum seekers.   After John Kelly left the administration, he joined the board of  Caliburn days before HHS awarded Caliburn a $341 million no-bid  contract to keep detaining migrant children in Homestead, Florida. In  doing so, this administration is compounding cruelty with corruption.   While the zero-tolerance family separation policy may have ended, it  has caused chaos and irreparable harm to our community. We can and we  must do better.   We have to reform our broken immigration system and recognize that  seeking asylum is legal. We must reunify families, and treat migrants  searching for a better life in our country with the dignity that they  deserve.                            ____________________
