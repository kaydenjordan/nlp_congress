 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  would like to begin by thanking my colleague, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho), for his leadership on this very important issue. I  am very proud to have helped shape this strong bill, and I appreciate  the gentleman's bipartisan collaboration.   Mr. Speaker, the international community has reached consensus on  many norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace. One key  agreement reached by the joint 2015 Group of Governmental Experts is  that responsible states do not use cyber means to damage or impair the  operation of critical infrastructure that provides services to the  public. Yet states regularly flaunt these international rules of the  road.   The North Koreans spread the WannaCry pseudo-ransomware last May. The  Russians have targeted the electric grid in Ukraine and were behind  NotPetya, the most devastating cyber incident in history. Closest to  home, Russia launched an assault on our elections with the goal of  undermining citizens' faith in our democracy.   President Obama recognized that protecting the Nation's cyberspace  has three components: improving our defenses to prevent hackers from  getting in; increasing resilience to minimize the damage when they do  get in; and imposing costs on states that act against our national  interest.   His executive orders, particularly 13694 and 13757, focused on this  last point, holding nations accountable through sanctions when they or  their agents target our critical infrastructure. Mr. Yoho's bill  codifies large portions of these executive orders, and it goes further  by requiring the President to both designate critical cyber threats and  to sanction them.   I strongly support the underlying policy and the enhancements made by  my friend from Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I think we also need to go further. The September 2015  Obama-Xi accord on Chinese economic espionage, which remains one of the  most successful examples of cyber deterrence, relied on the threat of  sanctions targeting the beneficiaries of China's spying, not just PLA  members. We must continue to work together in a bipartisan fashion to  maximize the efficacy of sanctions, which are intended not to punish  but to shape behavior.   Most importantly, though, I hope the President takes more aggressive  actions to protect American interests in cyberspace. I criticized  President Obama's response to Russia's election interference as too  little, too late, and, unfortunately, President Trump has been reticent  to act against Russia.   The norms we talk about are norms of behavior, and I remain deeply  concerned that our absence of action in response to malign state  activity is developing into a norm in and of itself. Actions, as they  say, speak louder than words.   However, all told, Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important first step  in recognizing that cyber threats are the new weapon of choice for  states that seek to sow discord and engage in conflict below the level  of the threshold of war.   I again thank Congressman Yoho for introducing the bill and Chairman  Royce and Ranking Member Engel for supporting it. I strongly support  H.R. 5576, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, last month, President Trump stripped  former CIA Director John Brennan of his security clearance. That was  not done because Director Brennan posed a threat to national security.  No, it was done to silence a political opponent.   Mr. Speaker, all Americans agree that the President should not be  able to order the IRS to initiate an audit against a rival, and we  should all be able to agree that he may not use his authority to revoke  a security clearance. Yet the President has announced that he intends  to invalidate the clearances of other current and former officials who  disagree with his policies.   That is why I introduced H.R. 6680 with my colleagues, Mr. Lieu and  Ranking Member Schiff of the Intelligence Committee, that will prevent  the administration from revoking security clearances for political  reasons. My bill would give agency officials the basis to push back on  White House demands that more clearances be revoked outside of judicial  processes and protocols.   Mr. Speaker, granting, denying, or revoking security clearances for  political retribution or the stifling of political dissent is un- American, and it should never be tolerated or allowed. I urge my  colleagues to support this important legislation.                            ____________________
