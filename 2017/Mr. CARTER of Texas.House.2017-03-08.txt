 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that we are here  hoping to end the continuing resolution on the Department of Defense,  and I rise in support of the bill we are debating today.   We all know too well that continuing resolutions are unacceptable  burdens on the least and the greatest of our DOD assets, our Members,  and civilians at a time of unprecedented threats to our Nation. I thank  Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairwoman Granger for bringing this bill to  the floor and for their unwavering commitment to the men and women in  uniform, which will continue under their leadership in the future.   I also thank this committee for fully funding an increase of Active,  Guard, and Reserve soldiers. I am also co-chair of the Army Caucus, and  providing them with the modern equipment and training necessary to keep  them alive and the greatest fighting force on Earth is very important  to the defense of our Nation.   We have more that we need to consider.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. McClintock). The time of the gentleman  has expired.    Army Vice Chief of Staff Daniel Allyn recently  told the House Armed Services Committee that our Army requires  modernization equipment to win decisively, but today we are outraged,  outgunned, and outdated. At the present time, he says that only three  of the Army's 58 brigade combat teams are ready to fight. It is  crucial, and I urge my colleagues to support this appropriations bill  and fully fund our armed services.
