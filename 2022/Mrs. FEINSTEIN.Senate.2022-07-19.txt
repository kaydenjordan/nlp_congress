 Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing legislation  that would guarantee legal rights for millions of marriages in the  United States. Americans should be free to marry the person they love,  regardless of their sexual orientation or race, without fear of  discrimination or fear that their marriages will be invalidated.   Very simply, this bill makes clear that the Federal Government and  the States must recognize a legal marriage--as has been the law of the  land for same-sex couples since 2015 and for interracial couples since  1967.   I have long been an ally and advocate for the LGBT community. I spent  two decades as a supervisor and mayor of San Francisco, when the city  was at the forefront of elevating their voices and advancing their  rights, and I watched firsthand as the LGBT community fought for legal  recognition of their lives, relationships, and personal dignity.   That is why I first introduced the Respect for Marriage Act in 2011.  The initial version of the bill would have repealed the discriminatory  Defense of Marriage Act--commonly referred to as DOMA--and ensured that  legally married couples, including same-sex couples, were treated  equally under Federal law.   In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that same- sex couples have the right to marry under the U.S. Constitution. The  Court recognized that committed couples should be able to marry,  regardless of their sexual orientation--a belief that the American  people have held for quite some time. In fact, a recent poll placed  support for same-sex marriage at 71 percent.   Fifty-five years ago, in Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court ruled  that ``the freedom to marry . . . a person of another race resides with  the individual, and cannot be infringed by the state.'' Support for  interracial marriage has grown exponentially since then, and a 2021  Gallup poll found it has reached an approval rating of 94 percent.   Unfortunately, we may now be taking a step backward. Following the  Supreme Court's decision overturning the longstanding constitutional  protections provided by Roe v. Wade, it became clear that this  conservative Supreme Court is open to revisiting many other established  constitutional rights, including the right to same-sex marriage and the  right to interracial marriage.   Overturning Obergefell and Loving would be a disastrous return to a  patchwork of State laws where couples could be subject to State- sanctioned discrimination. The legal ramifications would be far- reaching, from disrupting tax filings and benefits to calling parental  rights into question--and beyond.   That is why I, along with my colleagues in the House and the Senate,  am reintroducing the Respect for Marriage Act: to ensure that Federal  law protects marriage equality and to ensure that States cannot  discriminate against valid same-sex or interracial marriages.   Inequitable treatment of LGBT Americans and discriminatory marriage  laws belong in our history books, not in our Federal code.   I thank Senators Baldwin and Collins for their leadership on this  important issue and urge the rest of my colleagues to support this  bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing legislation  that would guarantee legal rights for millions of marriages in the  United States.
