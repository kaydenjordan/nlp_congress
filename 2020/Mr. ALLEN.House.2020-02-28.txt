 Madam Speaker, we all agree that the current youth vaping  trend is cause for concern, and we must evaluate strategies to prevent  young people from using e-cigarettes and tobacco products. But this  bill does nothing to address the youth vaping epidemic or the use of  illicit products that have been linked to the outbreak of lung  illnesses as just described by our ranking member.   That is why this body has taken steps to address this issue,  including passing legislation to raise the minimum age to buy tobacco  products from 18 to 21.   But the flavored tobacco ban and excise tax increase act is a  textbook example of Federal overreach. H.R. 2339 would instead ban all  flavors for all tobacco products and impose a new excise tax on  nicotine used in vaping.   I find it confusing that many of my colleagues who support banning  these tobacco products also support legalizing marijuana. Where is the  common sense in this House?   Instead of putting a partisan, overreaching bill on the floor,  Democrats should work with Republicans on bipartisan solutions that  actually address the youth vaping epidemic that we are going to talk  about here probably the entire time we are debating this issue.
