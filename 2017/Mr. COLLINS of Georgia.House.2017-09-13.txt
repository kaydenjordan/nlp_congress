Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 513 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 513         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3697) to       amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to       aliens associated with criminal gangs, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from       September 15, 2017, through September 22, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on House Resolution 513,  currently under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien  Gang Member Removal Act. Before I discuss the rule, Mr. Speaker, I  would first like to take this opportunity to thank all the first  responders who have been working tirelessly in the wake of Hurricanes  Harvey and Irma, and to send my thoughts and prayers to those who have  suffered loss because of these storms.   Georgia saw much of Hurricane Irma's devastation firsthand, and I  would like to thank the men and women who are responding to the people  in need and rebuilding our communities. I am grateful to all of those  who have played and are playing a part in these recovery efforts.   As someone who is still back home without power, I understand the  need that is going on in Florida all the way up through northeast  Georgia. This is truly a ``from the beach to the highlands'' kind of  issue, and we are continuing to thank our law enforcement, our first  responders, and especially those that work for the power companies and  others getting the utilities back on that we take for granted so many  days. I just want to say thank you to them.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today provides for 1 hour of debate  equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from two  of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Johnson from Louisiana  and Ms. Lofgren from California. Much of H.R. 3697 received  consideration by the Judiciary Committee as part of a larger bill, the  Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny Oliver in Honor of State and Local Law  Enforcement Act.   After a lengthy and thorough debate, the Judiciary Committee marked  up and reported favorably that legislation on May 24.   As a cosponsor and strong supporter of the Davis-Oliver Act, I hope  to see that legislation pass before the full House. Today we have an  opportunity to increase public safety by moving an important piece of  that bill forward as H.R. 3697.   I want to recognize Representative Barbara Comstock, my colleague  from Virginia, for introducing the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal  Act. I also want to thank Representative Comstock and this bill's  cosponsors--Chairman Goodlatte, Chairman Sessions, Congressman Peter  King, and Congressman Labrador--for their work on this issue.   From fiscal years 2016 to 2017, ICE agents made over 8,000 gang- related criminal arrests, leading to over 2,600 convictions. America's  families, friends, and neighbors are watching the problem of  transnational gang violence grow, and ICE reports that membership of  these gangs is comprised largely of foreign-born nationals. Many of  these gang members terrorizing our streets are here illegally.   MS-13, in particular, has experienced growth at the expense of  American neighborhoods and public safety. In fact, the Department of  Justice has said that MS-13, which originated in Central America, has  10,000 members in the United States, and 40,000 members worldwide. As  if this wasn't a clear enough threat, the other transnational gangs are  on the rise as well.   Sophisticated gang leaders have recognized that our immigration  system is susceptible to exploitation and have taken advantage. MS-13  violence has hit communities in Boston, New York, Virginia, and  Washington, D.C., particularly hard, but the problem is not limited to  these areas.   In my home State of Georgia, ICE agents recently arrested an  individual who played an active role in a murder in Virginia. In  northern Virginia, at least eight murders have been attributed to MS-13  since last November. This is unacceptable.   While it is not the only step we can take, one major way we can help  to address this problem is to make sure that transnational gang members  who are seeking to bring their tactics to our soil do not exploit our  immigration laws. We need to use all the tools in our toolbox to  address this problem of gang violence, and the underlying bill we are  considering today helps us do that. It recognizes that transnational  gang members have taken advantage of our immigration laws while  addressing existing flaws in our system.   This bill becomes clear that Congress will uphold its duty to protect  the safety of the American people and provide critical tools to law  enforcement.   Importantly, while this bill cracks down on criminal alien gang  members and strengthens our system, it preserves due process and burden  of proof protections. The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act takes  the commonsense step of ensuring that criminal gang members are  ineligible for asylum, special immigration, juvenile status, and  temporary protected status.   The bill also adds grounds of inadmissibility and deportability for  criminal alien gang members, and it requires that criminal alien gang  members are kept in custody prior to and during the immigration court  proceedings.   Mr. Speaker, under New York City's sanctuary city policy, a criminal  alien who was an admitted gang member was allowed to leave Rikers  Island after serving time for another offense. This was a particularly  egregious case of how flaws in the system are serving gangs, but it  also highlights the clear challenge under existing statutes.    Under current law, the criminal alien's self-admission of gang  affiliation is not reason enough to deport  [[Page H7326]]  that individual. To be deported, the alien has to be convicted of  another independent crime, even if he or she admits to being part of a  gang.   In Houston, two MS-13 members kidnapped three young girls, ultimately  killing one. These individuals, gang members from El Salvador, were in  the United States illegally.   In yet another instance, a sheriff's deputy in Frederick County,  Maryland, was attacked by a known member of MS-13. This is disturbing  on its own, but what makes it even more so is that the gang member had  been previously apprehended and released by Customs and Border Patrol.   For each of the stories I have shared with you today, there is  another that I haven't. The violent and brutal actions of transnational  gangs operating on our soil have led to far too many tragedies as they  prey on our vulnerable neighborhoods, recruit children, and commit  unthinkable crimes.   Mr. Speaker, let me also make it clear that these violent gangs are  targeting immigrant communities. According to the police chief in  Maryland, MS-13 has ratcheted up its extortion of immigrant families  and businesses. The gang threatens not only the individuals in the  United States, but their families back home if these law-abiding  immigrant individuals don't meet the gang's demands.   Concern for our fellow citizens tells us that we should not be  admitting these individuals to our country, and we should be removing  them when they commit crimes or yoke themselves to gangs that  perpetrate violence.   These criminal alien gang members should not be let back onto the  streets to victimize more people while their immigration proceedings  are ongoing, and they shouldn't be allowed to exploit our laws to gain  the benefits reserved for the vulnerable individuals seeking to enter  our Nation.   The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act makes important strides in  protecting the safety of our citizens and our communities.   Mr. Speaker, we in this House are taking a stand against the  senseless violence and lawlessness and the criminal enterprise that  these gangs bring to our soil. We are strengthening our laws against  transnational gangs and ensuring criminal alien gang members can and  will be removed from this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend from  Florida that I have no more speakers on this side, and I am ready to  close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I believe today's debate has made this very clear. We  are talking about gang members from some of the most violent gangs in  the world. We are talking about removing members of those gangs that  are in this country and are attempting to come to this country  illegally.   We are a nation of laws. It is our duty to uphold those laws and to  strengthen those laws when necessary. This is a time when it is  necessary.   We are not talking about singling out certain community groups,  religious groups, or law-abiding citizens as someone said on the other  side or would have you believe. We are talking about strengthening and  enforcing our laws against known criminal alien gang members who are  putting our communities at risk and threatening our citizens and legal  residents.   The Federal Government's highest responsibility is to protect the  safety of our Nation and the American people. Cracking down on illegal  criminal alien gang members is one critical way we can do that.   The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act takes important strides to  better combat gang violence, and I look forward to supporting this rule  and the underlying bill to strengthen public safety and uphold the rule  of law.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Rule  governing debate of H.R. 3697, the ``Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal  Act of 2017'', and the underlying bill.   I oppose this unwise and irresponsible legislation because regular  order was not observed in bringing this bill to the floor, the bill  contains several constitutional and procedural defects, and is an  unnecessary diversion and distraction from the real issues facing the  American people.   As Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Crime Subcommittee, I am  highly disappointed that this bill was rushed to the floor without any  thorough and thoughtful consideration by the Judiciary Committee.   In particular, there was no markup or hearing on this legislation  that has such wide ranging and profound effect on a mass scale.   This bill extends the definition of ``criminal gangs'' as defined  under 18 USC section 521, and amends the INA to now include a  definition for criminal gangs as:   An ongoing group, club, organization, or association of 5 or more  persons that has as one of its primary purposes the commission of  certain listed offenses, including:   --a felony drug offense, including felony simple possession of  marijuana (this would impact high school kids who may gather to smoke  marijuana);   --bringing in and harboring certain aliens (this would cover  sanctuary sites like churches that aid undocumented immigrants);   --identity fraud offenses (including knowingly possessing a false  identity document);   --crimes involving obstruction of justice; and burglary.   A bill of this nature where the consequences are so severe to many  innocent parties, including a 13 or 14 year old juvenile, demands a  more robust dialogue with a prudent and judicious approach.   As legislators on the Judiciary Committee, we argue vigorously on  behalf of the American people, as is the case in any other Committee;  and in doing so, we will sometimes disagree.   So to suggest that we would not have been able to debate the merits  of this bill, so instead bypass the regular process is disheartening.   Are we passionate about the issues that impact our legislative  process, governance, and the American people? Yes we are! And we will  continue to probe vigorously, as a legislative body having  jurisdiction, notwithstanding the subject matter.   We will not stay quiet as to not offend a few when so many issues  with catastrophic consequences may result if we don't speak up.   So Mr. Speaker I make no apologies for doing my job and questioning  where necessary on behalf of the American people.   We should be having vigorous debate on matters such as jobs, schools,  health care, victims of Charlottesville, victims of climate change,  building bridges, healing broken communities, and bringing this country  together for `all' the American people, we are instead debating a  damaged bill in order to advance the President's campaign promise on  mass deportation, thus, distracting us from the people's business. We  are also uniting in protecting the American people against violent  crime.   I care deeply about crime as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Crime  Subcommittee, thus, if we want to have that debate here on the floor,  let's have a wholesome conversation.   The FBI reports some 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs,  and prison gangs with about 1.4 million members that are criminally  active in the U.S. and Puerto Rico today.   Many are sophisticated and well organized; all use violence to  control neighborhoods and boost their illegal money-making activities,  which include robbery, drug and gun trafficking, prostitution and human  trafficking, and fraud.   Striking, for this conversation, in these 33,000 street gangs, a  significantly larger percentage were non illegal immigrants, as this  bill's objective purports.   Some of those street gangs include: 211 Crew, American Front, Aryan  Brotherhood of Texas, Aryan Circle, Aryan Nation, Aryan Republican  Army, Born to Kill, Dead Man Incorporated, European Kindred, just to  name a few here that are mainly white supremacist  [[Page H7332]]  gang groups. We could go on, as gangs are found everywhere, in almost  every ethnic group.   As a result, I oppose this Rule and the underlying bill for several  reasons; first, it has a discriminatory effect in targeting the  immigrant community by criminalizing immigration, and thereby, raises  due process and racial profiling concerns.   I offered an amendment which would have cured this defect by  requiring a uniform legal standard in the Secretary of Homeland  Security's designation of `criminal street gang' for purposes of ICE  enforcement.   Based on the government's own data via the FBI, it is clear that  criminal street gangs are not exclusively limited to the immigrant  community.   Second, I oppose this Rule because the bill has a sweeping effect  that will criminalize and/or deport anyone remotely connected to a  supposed gang member, even where there is no conviction and alarmingly,  no arrest.   My second amendment would raise the standard of proof from a mere  belief that someone is associated with a criminal street gang, to clear  and convincing evidence.   This bill lacks a constitutional construct for how Homeland Security  is to determine its designation of a `criminal street gang'.   That is why I offered my third amendment, which would have required a  uniform legal standard which will govern the identification of Criminal  Street gang members for purposes of ICE enforcement.   According to this bill, `any' immigrant, including minors, such as a  13 or 14 year old juvenile, would be subject to the harsh penalties of  detention and deportation.   If we begin to criminalize people merely for their associations, then  we are heading down a terribly dark road. Statistics show that the  brain does not fully develop until the age of 25, and thus to punish  juveniles for the mere associations they may have, is a bad idea and  bad legislation.   According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention recent report, nationally, 48,043 juvenile offenders were  held in residential placement facilities as of October 28, 2015.   Due to this bill's vague nature, it would add to that alarming  number, and further complicate mass incarceration.    This bill would capture individuals, even those with permanent  residence status, so long as the government believes the individual is  associated with a criminal street gang.   My amendments attempted to fix some of the glaring defects in this  bill. In its current form, the bill is bad for our country and does not  keep our communities safe, but instead does the opposite.   For all the reasons stated above, I oppose this Rule and the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 513 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
