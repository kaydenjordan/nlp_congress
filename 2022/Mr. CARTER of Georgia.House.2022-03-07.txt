 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the life of Joel Williams.   Joel was born December 19, 1942, in the family farm kitchen in  Dacula, Georgia. Unlike many children nowadays, Joel grew up without  electricity and indoor plumbing, learning to read by kerosene lamps.   His drive and determination revealed themselves early as he earned  valedictorian honors at Dacula High School and graduated magna cum  laude from Shorter College. He then went on to attend Walter F. George  School of Law at Mercer University where he was the first honor  graduate of the class of 1967.   Joel began his legal career as an assistant attorney general of the  State of Georgia under Arthur K. Bolton. He then left Washington for  Savannah in 1971 to become vice president and chief compliance officer  for Savannah Foods and Industries. During this time, he met his wife of  25 years, M'Liss Gurney Williams, and had two beautiful daughters.   Joel committed his life to political and community service. Through  all of his achievements, Joel was most proud of his daughters and  grandchildren. Joel was a loving and devoted father. The children he  raised and grandchildren he loved will forever remember the man Joel  was throughout his life.                            ____________________
