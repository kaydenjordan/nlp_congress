 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc  amendment.   I have done financial counseling for low-income clients at Legal Aid  and I learned firsthand that people don't struggle by choice.   I was an attorney at the Federal Trade Commission where my work  involved enforcing the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I have seen  how predatory debt collection tactics hurt our families and our  communities. Consumers face harassment at home and at work. They  frequently get misinformation about debts they might not even legally  owe. The problems around debt collection are pervasive.   Data from the Urban Institute shows that 68 million Americans had a  debt in collection before the pandemic, and most consumers sued by  collection agencies don't have legal representation.   My amendment will update the law so consumers get advance notice of  legal action against them and accurate details about what they legally  owe. Strengthening protections for consumers will help individuals and  families get through this economic crisis and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the en bloc  amendment and the underlying bill. I thank Chairwoman Waters and  Chairman Perlmutter for their leadership.
