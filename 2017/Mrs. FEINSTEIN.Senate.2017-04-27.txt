 Mr. President, I wish to introduce a Senate  resolution to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the 1992 Los Angeles  civil unrest.   On March 3, 1991, an African American named Rodney King was driving  on a Los Angeles interstate when officers attempted to pull him over  for allegedly speeding. By the time he pulled over and exited his car  following a high-speed chase spanning 8 miles, there were multiple LA  police department units on the scene.   King was tasered two times, and camcorder video footage recorded by a  civilian witness--George Holliday--from his nearby apartment balcony  depicted the brutal beating of King by four officers who surrounded  him. The officers struck King repeatedly until he was bloodied and  disfigured with a fractured cheekbone, 11 broken bones at the base of  the skull, and a broken ankle. The video footage shows King being  struck by batons over 50 times,   Holliday's video was sent to news outlets and aired around the world.  It shook the Nation and raised outcries about excessive force by police  officers. But even before the videotape had become public, community  leaders in Los Angeles had highlighted on numerous occasions the use of  excessive force by LAPD officers.   In fact, in the immediate aftermath of the Rodney King beating, then- Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley formed  [[Page S2629]]  the Christopher Commission to thoroughly examine thousands of excessive  force complaints made against LAPD officers in the late 1980s. So  when--a year later on April 29, 1992--the four LAPD officers caught on  tape were acquitted after standing trial for using excessive force  against Rodney King, the entire Nation was in shock. The verdict  appeared completely incompatible with the brutal videotape footage that  flooded our TV screens at the time.   When the verdict became public, hundreds gathered at the Los Angeles  County Courthouse to protest, and a national debate immediately began  over racial injustice and excessive use of force by police against  racial minorities. Shortly thereafter, at the intersection of Florence  and Normandie in South Central Los Angeles, the public's frustration  boiled over and violence erupted, setting off a flash point that the  police simply could not quell. Looting, vandalism, and physical attacks  became rampant, and I will never forget the image of Reginald Denny  being dragged out of his semi-trailer truck to be severely beaten in  the middle of the street.   From then on, the unrest overtook the city, including neighborhoods  like Koreatown, Hawthorne, Compton and Long Beach. The city, quite  literally, was on fire. For 6 days, the city was in a state of  emergency.   All told, there were more than 60 individuals who lost their lives  amid the looting and fires, and thousands of individuals were injured  or arrested, while countless more lost their businesses and places of  employment. Over 3,600 fires were set and over 1,100 buildings in Los  Angeles were damaged or destroyed.   Images of the smoke clouds over the city evoked the devastation felt  by so many Angelenos. The 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest was felt so  deeply and so personally by so many communities throughout the city.   The African American community decried not only the verdict returned  against Rodney King but also mourned the death of high-schooler Latasha  Harlins and so many other victims of violence and excessive use of  force. The civil unrest was symptomatic of the deep frustrations felt  by the African-American community against a criminal justice system  that continually failed to protect them.   Similarly, the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest was sharply felt by the  Latino community in Los Angeles.   According to one report following the unrest, one-third of those  killed and half of those arrested were Latino, and countless Latino  businesses were looted or destroyed.   The Korean-American community in Los Angeles was also deeply  impacted, referring to the unrest as ``Sa-I-Gu,'' to commemorate the  date ``April 29'' in Korean to mark it as a significant date in Korean  history. Amidst the torched and decimated businesses, 35 to 40 percent  of the property damage was suffered by those businesses owned by  Korean-Americans--with estimates of up to 1,600 Korean-American-owned  stores completely destroyed.   There is no question that those fateful 6 days have impacted  generations of Angelenos. We must resolve to never forget the 1992 Los  Angeles civil unrest and what emerged from those fires.   We must offer our condolences for the families who lost their loved  ones or who bear the scars, both mental and physical, from that time  and commend those who have worked so hard to come together to heal  community rifts, rebuild a stronger Los Angeles, and continue to  promote ongoing dialogue, civility, and unity among all communities.   That is the purpose of this resolution we are introducing today.   I want to thank Senator Harris for working with me on the resolution  to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of this historic event in  California.   I yield the Floor.                            ____________________
