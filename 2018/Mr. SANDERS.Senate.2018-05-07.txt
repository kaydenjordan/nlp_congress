 Mr. President, on April 27, 2018, the Vermont  Federal Executive Association recognized several Federal employees in  the State of Vermont with Excellence in Government awards. At a time  when many Federal agencies are being asked to do more work with fewer  resources, it is important to recognize examples of exceptionally good  work by members of the Federal workforce.   Vermont is fortunate to have close to 5,000 Federal employees working  across the State, and I am proud of their commitment to public service.  I would like to congratulate the 2018 Excellence in Government award  winners who were chosen for this recognition by their peers in VTFEA.   The awards are as follows: Supervisor of the Year, Amanda Duquette,  Office of Contracting, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services;  Employee of the Year, Caitlin Moynihan, Homeland Security  Investigations, Burlington Field Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement; Excellence in Mission Support, Staffing Management Team,  Northeast Regional Office, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services;  Excellence in Operational Execution, Targeted Enforcement Unit/Sensor  Team, U.S. Border Patrol, Newport Station, U.S. Customs and Border  Protection and the FEMA Adjudication Team, Personnel Security,  Operations, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; Safety/Valor  Award, Laurent Giroux, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and John  Zavala, U.S. Border Patrol; and Unit Excellence, Operations Unit  Mentoring Team, Law Enforcement Support Center, U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement.   Once again, I congratulate these Vermont Federal employees for  receiving these awards.                            ____________________
