 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Guam's  Liberation Day.   Madam Speaker, 79 years ago, on July 21, 1944, following 2\1/2\ years  of occupation, the United States servicemembers landed on the southwest  part of Guam to liberate over 20,000 CHamorus and Americans from the  Imperial Japanese military.   On December 8, 1941, the feast of Santa Marian Kamalen, Guam's patron  saint, the sound of bombs dropping and planes flying overhead drowned  out our otherwise quiet and isolated island. This day was the start of  the occupation in Guam.   This period in Guam's history was a treacherous one, but the people  of the island persevered and displayed a great sense of resiliency,  willpower, patriotism, and hope. Guamanians never fail to display these  traits today and have been tested time and time again. From war to  natural disasters, most recently Super Typhoon Mawar, which ravaged our  community in May, Guamanians have always held these traits close to  their hearts.   These traits are unchangeable and have forged our island's culture of  peace, ``harmony,'' or ``inafa'maolek'' to make good in the world. They  guide our way of life and advance our distinct cultural identity that  is recognizable around the world. This is known as the Hafa Adai  spirit, and Guamanians are proud to share this with everyone they meet  and wherever they go.   Liberation Day is an island-wide celebration that brings all  Guamanians together in celebration of the national and local cultural  identity, democracy, and freedom. On this day, we remember those who  fought, endured, sacrificed, and gave their lives to protect our island  home and Nation. This day allows us to remember the sacrifices of the  people who came before us and thank those who currently fight on the  front lines for our freedom, families, and values.   Guam has a long history with the armed services and plays a large  role in contributing to military strength, providing thousands of  soldiers, marines, sailors, airmen, guardians, and coastguardsmen. Guam  is proud to have the highest number of enlistments per capita across  the country.   As home to the Joint Regional Marianas, Naval Base Guam, Andersen Air  Force Base, and Marine Corps Camp Blaz on Guam, our island is the tip  of the spear in our fight against our enemies in the Indo-Pacific  region.   Our strategic and unparalleled location, invaluable assets, and most  importantly, our servicemembers contribute to the strength and the  might of the world's greatest fighting force.   The past 79 years have been a momentous period for growth, change,  and progress for our island. The people of our island have changed to  form an even more diverse melting pot of cultures that honors our  differences throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Today is a day on which  we celebrate the values, people, traditions, and cultures that make  Guam and America a great place to live. I am proud to stand here and  speak today representing such a diverse and significant part of  America.   As we commemorate the 79th anniversary of Guam's liberation, we  recognize the contributions Guam has and will continue to make for our  Nation.   We are proud to be where America's day begins and fly the American  flag in the middle of the Pacific. Let us also celebrate and recognize  this day as a day in which we recommit and redeliver on our promises to  fight for freedom and democracy across the Nation, Pacific region, and  the world.                            ____________________
