 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a little more than 2 weeks, the  Judiciary Committee will open its hearing on the nomination of Judge  Neil Gorsuch for the U.S. Supreme Court. This is the 14th Supreme Court  confirmation process in which I have participated. Over that time,  while some things have changed, others have stayed the same.   The conflict over judicial appointments, especially to the Supreme  Court, remains at its core a conflict over the proper role of judges in  our system of government. The two sides of this conflict want two very  different kinds of judges. Some of my colleagues, joined by their  liberal allies, instead want judges who owe their fidelity to a  particular political agenda.   For them, the judiciary is simply a backup plan for achieving  political objectives. If the legislative branch does not deliver, they  go to the executive--as they often did in the previous administration.  If that does not work, they figure that the courts offer a second or  third bite at the political apple.   This vision is fundamentally inconsistent with the way our system of  government was destined, designed, and intended to be. Instead, the  Framers devised the role of the judiciary on the wisdom of Montesquieu,  who posited:         Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the       life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary       control. . . . Were it joined to the executive power, the       judge might behave [as] an oppressor.    That was Montesquieu. Reflecting this wisdom, the Constitution endows  the judge with the role of saying what the law is, rather than what he  wishes the law would be.   Alexander Hamilton rightly observed: The people's liberty cannot be  endangered by the judiciary ``so long as the judiciary remains truly  distinct from both the legislature and the executive.''   The stakes in this conflict over judicial power are really enormous.  The choice determines whether the people or unelected judges will  govern the country and define the culture. Our system of government and  the liberty it makes possible allow only one answer. The confirmation  process allows us to determine which kind of judge Neil Gorsuch is and  which kind of Justice he will be.   The dynamics of the confirmation process often reveal what kind of  judge Senators and interest groups really  [[Page S1568]]  seek. Those who want political judges, for example, use a variety of  strategies to determine how a judicial nominee, especially to the  Supreme Court, will rule on issues and cases they care about. In fact,  most of the time it seems that the policy consequences of how a judge  will rule is the only thing that some Senators and advocates really  care about.   For example, when President Bush nominated Chief Justice John Roberts  in 2005, one Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee said that the  real question was this: ``Whose side is Judge Roberts really on, on the  really important issues of our time?''   Another Democratic Senator said: ``Before we vote, it is important to  know where Judge Roberts stands on key issues.''   Another said that she needed to know whether ``Judge Roberts will  stand with us and with our families or be on the side of major special  interests.''   Now, something is seriously wrong when the confirmation process for a  Supreme Court nominee sounds more like an election campaign for a  Senator or a Senate seat. Unfortunately, the same thing is happening  again today regarding Judge Gorsuch. If a corporation won a case before  him on the Tenth Circuit, for example, those groups claim that he is a  champion of corporate interests, no matter the legal grounds of the  decision, the facts, or anything else.   If another decision's result does not sufficiently advance the  feminist agenda, they say that he is anti-woman. This radical approach  seems to say that judges are free to decide every case based on the  political popularity of the result and, therefore, that the judge  personally intends every outcome. These advocates do not distinguish  between the commands of the law and the personal preferences of the  judge.   In this view, statutes and the Constitution mean whatever judges want  them to mean, making unelected, unaccountable, lifetime appointees the  master of the people. Political judges take away from the people the  power to govern themselves and undermine their liberty. Using political  or theological litmus tests in the quest for such political judges,  demanding that they take sides and insisting that they make commitments  to certain policy agendas before even taking office, poses a similar  threat to the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.   There is nothing mainstream about political judges and nothing  mainstream in the tactics used to appoint them. In contrast, impartial  judges are consistent with the principles on which our system of  government is based and the independence that judges must have. When  Judge Gorsuch took his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth  Circuit in 2006, he took the oath required by title 28, section 453, of  the United States Code. He pledged to administer justice without  respect to persons and to faithfully and impartially discharge his  judiciary duties.   Now, I want to suggest that my colleagues try an experiment. Ask your  constituents whether judges should make up their mind on a case before  hearing all of the evidence and arguments. Ask whether judges should  take positions on issues before those issues even come before them in  court.   I know what Utahns would say. The ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct,  for example, twice states this principle:         A judge shall not, in connection with cases, controversies,       or issues that are likely to come before the court, make       pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with       the impartial performance of the adjudicative [functions and]       duties of judicial office.    State codes of judicial conduct include the same commonsense  protection for judicial impartiality. The California code, for example,  prohibits statements, whether public or not, that ``commit the judge  with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come  before the courts.''   Now, this has been the consistent practice of judicial nominees  before the Judiciary Committee. Elena Kagan came before the Judiciary  Committee in June 2010, after being nominated by President Obama to  replace Justice John Paul Stevens. On June 29, 2010, she said that it  would not be appropriate for her to comment on an issue that could come  before the Court.   Samuel Alito--Justice Alito--came before the committee in January  2006, after being nominated by President Bush to replace Justice Sandra  Day O'Connor. On January 11, 2006, he said:         But the line I have to draw, and I think every nominee,       including Justice Ginsburg, has drawn, is to say that when it       comes to something that realistically could come before the       Court, they can't answer about how they would decide that       question. That would be a disservice to the judicial process.    Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Ginsburg appeared before the Judiciary  Committee in July 1993, nominated by President Clinton to replace  Justice Byron White. On July 20, 1993, she said this: ``A judge sworn  to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would  show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it  would display disdain for the entire judicial process.''   Antonin Scalia came before the committee in August 1986, after being  nominated by President Reagan to replace Justice William Rehnquist. On  August 5, 1986, he said that taking positions in a hearing on issues  that could come before him was not just a slippery slope but, in his  words, a precipice. He said: ``I just cannot do it, and I think the  only way to be sure that I am not impairing my ability to be impartial  in future cases . . . is simply to respectfully decline to give an  opinion.''   Let me reach even further back. Justice Abe Fortas came before the  Judiciary Committee in July 1968, after being nominated by President  Johnson to replace Chief Justice Earl Warren. The committee sent the  nomination to the full Senate and said these words in its report:         To require a Justice to state his views on legal questions       or to discuss his past decisions before the committee would       threaten the independence of the judiciary and the integrity       of the judicial system itself. It would also impinge on the       constitutional doctrine of separation of powers among the       three branches of Government as required by the Constitution.    Judge Thurgood Marshall came before the committee in July 1967,  nominated by President Johnson to replace Justice Tom Clark. The  committee sent the nomination to the full Senate and its report noted  that the nominee had said he would ``wisely and forthrightly decline to  give a judicial opinion on hypothetical questions.''   Just 2 years earlier, when the committee reported the nomination of  Abe Fortas to be an Associate Justice, its report said: ``We have  always felt it would be unfair to ask any nominee for any judicial  office to give a legal opinion on the basis of a hypothetical  question.''   I think the point is obvious. Every nominee, of either party, for  decades has taken the same position, and it is the right position. It  reflects a commitment to judicial independence, to impartiality, and to  the integrity of the judicial branch of government.   If my Democratic colleagues and their liberal allies believe that  Justices Kagan, Alito, Ginsburg, Scalia, Fortas, and Marshall were all  wrong, they should say so. If they believe that judges should prejudge  cases by committing to particular outcomes, then they should make that  case. If they believe that the oath of judicial office and code of  judicial conduct are all misguided, then, it seems to me, they should  be upfront about it. I, for one, believe that judges should be  impartial, that they should follow the law, and that they should stay  within their designated role.   America needs impartial, not political, judges. I don't care which  party you are in. If you are an attorney, you have to appreciate judges  who are impartial, especially if you are an honest attorney.   We need judges who will follow, rather than lead, the law. The  Constitution, after all, is the primary way that the American people  set rules for government, and that includes--God bless it--the judicial  branch. The Constitution cannot control judges if judges control the  Constitution.   Yesterday the Judiciary Committee received a letter signed by more  than 30 prominent members of the Supreme Court bar. In combination,  they have argued more than 500 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Though they hold different political and legal views, they are united  in strongly supporting Judge Gorsuch's nomination. They  [[Page S1569]]  write that he is fair-minded, principled, and ``has the unusual  combination of character, dedication, and intellect that would make him  an asset to our Nation's highest court.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in  the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   I believe the record demonstrates that Judge Neil Gorsuch is an  impartial judge and will, when confirmed, be an impartial Supreme Court  Justice. He will take the law as he finds it and apply it ``without  respect to persons,'' just as the oath commands. With him on the bench,  the law--made by the people's elected representatives--will determine  winners and losers. In doing so, he will be exactly the kind of Justice  America needs.   Judge Gorsuch has a tremendous reputation on the Tenth Circuit Court  of Appeals, supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. Judge Gorsuch  is a brilliant lawyer and an even more brilliant judge.   He is a person of impeccable reputation and integrity. He is exactly  the type of person you would want deciding your case if you had a case  before the Supreme Court. He is exactly the type of person whom other  judges could emulate and follow, so he is exactly the type of person we  want on the Supreme Court.   I have heard some ugly rumors that some of my colleagues in this body  might, because of political concerns and political pressure, want to  vote against Judge Gorsuch. I would caution them not to do that.   I think Judge Gorsuch will basically please almost everyone in this  body over the years that he serves as a Supreme Court Justice. He is a  really fine man. He is a fine family man. He is a very fine lawyer and  a fantastic court of appeals judge.   He will make a great Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. So I urge my  colleagues on both sides to vote for him and help us fill this void so  that the Court can continue to act as the Court should.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      March 1, 2017.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: We       write to express our strong support for Judge Neil Gorsuch's       nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of       the United States. The undersigned are members of the Supreme       Court bar with substantial experience before the Court.       Collectively, we have argued more than 500 cases before the       Court. Many of us, moreover, worked with Judge Gorsuch (or       litigated against him) when he was in private practice;       served alongside him in the Justice Department; or have       appeared before him in the Court of Appeals. We hold a broad       range of political, policy, and jurisprudential views. But we       are unified in offering our support of Judge Gorsuch's       nomination.        Fairminded, dedicated, smart, and unfailingly polite, Judge       Gorsuch is someone all of us would be pleased to appear       before. He is principled in his approach to the law, but also       keenly aware of practical consequences. He is a thoroughly       kind and decent person. Respectful of colleagues and counsel       alike, Judge Gorsuch has the unusual combination of       character, dedication, and intellect that would make him an       asset to our Nation's highest court.        We hope this information will be of assistance to the       Committee in its consideration of Judge Gorsuch's nomination.       We thank you for your time and attention, and urge you to       support his confirmation.            Very truly yours,          Lisa Blatt, Richard P. Bress, Michael A. Carvin, John P.             Elwood, Roy Englert, Miguel A. Estrada, Mark Evans, H.             Bartow Farr, III, David C. Frederick, Dan Himmelfarb,             William M. Jay, Peter D. Keisler, Michael K. Kellogg,             Jeffrey A. Lamken, Christopher Landau, Maureen E.             Mahoney, Ronald Mann, Roman Martinez, Deanne E.             Maynard, Matthew D. McGill, Eric D. Miller, Glen D.             Nager, Aaron M. Panner, Mark A. Perry, Carter G.             Phillips, Richard H. Seamon, Stephen M. Shapiro, Mark             T. Stancil, Kathleen M. Sullivan, Amir C. Tayrani,             Christopher J. Wright.     I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, with all the division and conflict in  politics today, it would take something truly compelling to unite all  100 Senators, including Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and  liberals. Well, it has happened. This week I sent to Secretary of State  Rex Tillerson a letter, signed by all 100 Senators, asking that it be  conveyed to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter supports the  decades-long quest by Agudas Chasidei Chabad of the United States to  recover from Russia its collection of sacred religious texts and  manuscripts.   Chabad was established in the 18th century in Russia and is today the  largest Hasidic Jewish organization in the world. The organization's  past leaders, or rebbes, accumulated this collection of sacred texts,  which includes a library and an archive and is central to Chabad's  religious life. The Soviets took control of the library in 1920 and in  1927 arrested the sixth rebbe and sentenced him to death. He was  allowed to leave Russia later that year but had to leave the library  behind. In 1933, the sixth rebbe and the archive moved to Poland.   In 1940, after both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland,  the sixth rebbe fled to the United States without the archive. It was  confiscated, first by the Nazis and then by the Soviets. Chabad has  since worked to reclaim both the library and the archive.   It is important to place the letter we sent this week in its full  context because this is only the latest in a long series of actions by  all three branches of the U.S. Government to support Chabad's quest.  Members of Congress, for example, began calling for the return of these  works in the 1930s. Just weeks before the Soviet Union dissolved on  Christmas Day 1991, both President Mikhail Gorbachev and a state  arbitration panel ordered that the library be returned to Chabad. On  January 24, 1992, the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe  wrote President Boris Yeltsin, urging him to carry out the court's  order and return the collection.   Unfortunately, both President Gorbachev's directive and the court's  order were effectively nullified when the Russian Federation replaced  the Soviet Union. Within a few months, however, the U.S. State  Department expressed ``strong support'' for returning the full  collection to Chabad. On May 31, 1992, all 100 Senators signed a letter  to President Boris Yeltsin urging the collection's ``quick release.''   On February 20, 2005, all 100 Senators signed a letter to President  Putin, again urging that the collection be returned to Chabad. The  letter said this: ``The religious texts that Chabad seeks to retrieve  consist of rare and irreplaceable books, archives and manuscripts on  Chabad philosophy, Jewish religious law, prayer and tradition. . . . We  urge you to return these sacred religious texts, archives, and  manuscripts to Chabad, which would be a significant example of your  government's commitment to justice, human rights, and religious  freedom.''   Chabad filed suit against Russia in Federal court. During this  litigation, the United States filed statements of interest reiterating  its ``strong support'' for returning the collection to Chabad. On July  30, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered  Russia to return both the library and the archive to Chabad.   I am truly grateful to all of my colleagues for your support of  Chabad and their effort to recover this important component of their  religious life. As striking as this unity is, I hope my colleagues also  see it as part of a much longer story of extraordinary faith and  commitment in the face of loss and persecution. I hope and pray that  such efforts will be successful and that Russia will respond favorably  to Chabad's request. It would indeed be a demonstration of their  commitment to justice, human rights, and religious freedom.   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the 1992, 2005, and 2017  Senate letters to which I referred be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                       Washington, DC, May 31, 1992.      Hon. Boris Yeltsin,      President of the Russian Republic,      Moscow, Russia.        Dear Mr. President: We understand that you have personally       committed yourself to secure the return of the Lubavitch       texts, and we appreciate your having taken a stand on behalf       of an act of justice.        When the Senate was in recess, the U.S. State Department       issued a statement (copy attached), with which we now wish to       associate ourselves. In particular, it is our hope and       expectation that you will fulfill your commitment decisively       through the quick release of the Schneerson-Agudas Chabad       collection.        Thank you for your attention to this important matter.                                   ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, February 24, 2005.      Hon. Vladimir Putin,      President, Russian Federation.        Dear Mr. President: We, the undersigned members of the       United States Senate, respectfully request your assistance in       returning the Schneerson collection from the Russian State       Library and the Russian State Military Archive, to its       rightful owners in the United States: Agudas Chasidei Chabad       of United States (hereafter referred to as ``Chabad'').        The religious texts that Chabad seeks to retrieve consist       of rare and irreplaceable books, archives and manuscripts on       Chabad philosophy, Jewish religious law, prayer and       tradition. The first portion of the Schneerson collection was       seized by the former USSR around the time of the Bolshevik       revolution and placed in the Russian State Library, where it       remains to this day.        The second portion of the Schneerson collection is in       storage at the Russian State Military Archive. It had been       assumed that this portion of the collection had been       destroyed or captured by Nazi Germany during the holocaust       and Nazi occupation of Warsaw, Poland in World War II. Chabad       recently learned that the Soviet Army captured this portion       of the Schneerson collection from the Nazis and transferred       it to the Russian State Military Archive.        Chabad has worked tirelessly to secure the release of these       texts, archives, and manuscripts that comprise the sacred       heritage of an entire community. On May 31, 1992, the entire       United States Senate collectively appealed to then-President       Boris Yeltsin to honor his own commitment to return the       Schneerson collection. A copy of this appeal is enclosed.       Since 1992, however, a mere eight volumes have been released.        We urge you to return these sacred religious texts,       archives, and manuscripts to Chabad, which would be a       significant example of your government's commitment to       justice, human rights, and religious freedom.                                   ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      President, Vladimir Putin,      Russian Federation,      Moscow, Russia.        Dear Mr. President: We are writing respectfully to reaffirm       our support and request for the return of the Schneerson       collection of sacred texts from the Russian State Library and       the Russian State Military Archive to its rightful owners,       Agudas Chasidei Chabad of United States (``Chabad'').        On May 31, 1992, all one hundred members of the United       States Senate appealed to then-President Boris Yeltsin to       honor Russia's commitment to return the collection to Chabad.       On February 24, 2005, all one hundred members of the United       States Senate again signed an appeal for your assistance in       returning the collection. Copies of these letters are       attached hereto. Since 1992, eight volumes of the collection       have been returned to Chabad. We hereby respectfully request       your assistance in seeing the return of the entire       collection.        Thank you for your attention to this important matter.                            ____________________
