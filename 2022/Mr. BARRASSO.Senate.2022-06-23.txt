 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight sharing the  concerns of every Member of this body, to find the best way to protect  children who go to school, so that children can go to school in safety  and parents can send their children to school feeling that the children  will be safe.   And after we have seen the tragedies across the country, I think  every Member is here trying to find the best solution, and I think that  the one that Senator Cruz and I have offered is one that will provide  the kind of safety and security for our kids, for our schools, and for  our communities; and that is why we have introduced this substitute  amendment that we are bringing to the floor this evening in an effort  to do just that. We bring this at a time when the Nation's attention is  focused on what has happened at schools and communities across the  country and how to best address it.   And as a physician, a doctor who served in a State legislature and  now in this body, I have seen the devastating impact of mental health  challenges and problems in families and how much that has contributed  to what we have seen with these terrible acts. So what we bring here  tonight is legislation focused on safe schools and mental health while  protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.   And, with that, I would turn to Senator Cruz to make a motion to that  effect.
