 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and congratulate Georgia Abbey on her recent retirement as  executive director of Leadership Centre County.   Leadership Centre County was founded in 1991 and is dedicated to the  development of qualified leaders within the Centre County community.  Over the years, more than 1,000 members have graduated from the program  who then went on to be committee chairs, board members, and volunteers  in Centre County organizations. I am proud to be one of those  Leadership Centre County graduates.   LCC has eight different values that all members strive to illustrate.  These values include gratitude, mutual respect, and inclusion. The  organization believes that effective leaders improve the quality of  life for their communities.   For the past 21 years, Georgia Abbey has played a major role in  achieving the goals of Leadership Centre County. Her result-oriented  and high-energy management of LCC has contributed greatly to the  tremendous success of this organization.   Madam Speaker, I wish Georgia and her husband, Kevin, all the best in  the next phase of life following retirement.                            ____________________
