 Mr. Speaker, I rise to defend our daughters'  right to privacy and safety.   This spring, a 16-year-old girl swimming for a local swim team in my  district was banned from the YMCA for speaking out against men  undressing in the girls' locker room. My constituent, Abbigail, was  simply exercising her right to privacy and safety. She should not be  punished for defending herself and her teammates.   In Congress, I am committed to defending our daughters from the Biden  administration's radical changes to Title IX that will make this an  everyday occurrence for young girls across our country.   The YMCA should immediately reverse their decision and apologize to  Abbigail and her family. YMCA leadership should prioritize the safety  and privacy of young girls instead of prioritizing a radical, leftwing  political ideology that is allowing adult men to expose themselves in  front of our young girls. Men should never be allowed to violate girls'  locker rooms and bathrooms.   Governor Pritzker continues to promote policies that put our  daughters at risk. His failure to address the concerns of parents and  protect the safety and privacy of young girls in Illinois is deeply  concerning to parents.   Please, we must speak out to protect our daughters and end this  madness.  [[Page H3489]]                                ____________________
