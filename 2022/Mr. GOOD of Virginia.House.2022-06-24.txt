 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Laura Mulligan Thomas.   On May 18, 2022, Laura Mulligan Thomas, alongside her students,  presented her final concert as director of the Charlottesville High  School orchestra.   After a 40-year career at Charlottesville High School, Ms. Thomas  will begin her retirement on June 30, 2022. She began in 1982 with a  group of just eight CHS students as part of the CHS orchestra. Now that  orchestra includes over 100 students and is internationally recognized.   Ms. Thomas has received a number of awards, including winning the  2022 American String Teachers Association's Elizabeth A. H. Green  School Educator Award. Beyond the accolades she has received, I  specifically want to thank her for her commitment to supporting the  students of Charlottesville High School.   Perhaps the greatest testament to Ms. Thomas' work is knowing that  many of her students have gone on to become music teachers just like  her.   I thank Laura Mulligan Thomas for her dedication to Charlottesville  High School and her community. I wish her the best in her retirement.                            ____________________
