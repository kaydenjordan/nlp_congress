 Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate and dedicate  this time to one of our local activists in Tarrant County, Linda  Cozzen, who was a great friend of mine.   Linda was born in Canada and became a U.S. citizen at the age of 8  when her grandparents immigrated to the United States.   Linda and her brother were orphans, and their entry into the country  in Texas would not have been possible were it not for the great work of  the President and Senator from Texas, Lyndon Johnson, who was one of  her heroes. President Johnson had a huge impact on Linda's life, which  is one of the reasons why she was so active in politics in Fort Worth  and Tarrant County.   Over the years, she served on a lot of different committees: The 820  Corridor Democratic Club, the Southwest Democratic Club, Tarrant County  Democratic Party, Tarrant County Democratic Club, League of Women  Voters. She was a precinct chair, and so many others for over 20 years.   She also served as campaign manager for numerous candidates in local  and State elections. And she was a proud alumna of Texas Christian  University also in Fort Worth, TCU.   Ms. Cozzen's story highlights the importance of incorporating  immigrants into our democracy and providing them with an opportunity to  participate in our political system.   Linda was a great friend, and someone who always just had encouraging  words for me and so many others. She was at literally every single  Democratic event in Tarrant County.   It has really been a sad week when everybody found out about her  untimely passing, and our blessings go out to her family and all of her  friends who will miss her.                            ____________________
