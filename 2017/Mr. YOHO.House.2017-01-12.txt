 Mr. Speaker, today I will reintroduce the WINGMAN Act, a  vital veterans' bill that will expedite the claims process for veterans  who come to our congressional offices seeking assistance with their  benefit claims. The current process leaves thousands of veterans and  their families remaining in limbo awaiting resolution on their claims.  The status quo is unacceptable, and it must change.   No servicemember should have to wait to receive benefits they have  more than earned. This ends with the passage of the WINGMAN Act, which  removes the middle man and allows staff to access these records  directly, after obtaining a privacy release form without having to wait  on the VA bureaucracy. I think if we just listen, this is about  customer service. Yes, they are constituents, but they are also  customers. Every Member of this Congress--all 535 Members--represents  approximately 700,000 constituents, and I like to think that we are in  the customer service business as is the VA, the Veterans  Administration.   If we can't service our customers, where else can they go?   Last Congress, WINGMAN passed this House unanimously. It passed the  Veterans' Affairs Committee unanimously, but it was held up by one  Senator who thought he know more than the 435 Members of this body and  that he knew more than the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Fortunately,  that Senator from Nevada is no longer here, and we are resubmitting  this. I am hopeful that this Congress--the Members of this Chamber-- will, once again, reform the veterans' claims process and that our  colleagues in the upper Chamber will as well.   Before I close, I would also like to take a moment to recognize  Representatives Rodney Davis of Illinois, Kyrsten Sinema, and John  Delaney for being coleads on this bill. All three of my colleagues have  demonstrated their commitment to fighting for our veterans every day of  every year that they have served in Congress.   We have right now right over 150 cosponsors of this bill, and it is a  privilege to have their support. I thank them for helping to lead the  charge to enact this change and others that are so desperately needed  to better assist veterans and their families. Without their support,  WINGMAN would not have the broad, bipartisan support that it does now.  I urge the remainder of our colleagues to support WINGMAN as well. Let  our Nation's veterans know that we've got their six.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to the burden  ObamaCare has placed upon my constituents.   They have seen their healthcare costs rise while their quality of  care has lowered. It is imperative that we repeal ObamaCare  immediately.   I also emphasize to the folks here and at home that, as we repeal  ObamaCare, we will make sure there is a stable transition period during  the replacement so that people do not have the rug pulled out from  under them. This transition period will give us the time we need to  ensure our healthcare reform is full of truly patient-centered  solutions that allow patients, families, and doctors to direct their  health care.   Congress must focus on the principles of affordability,  accessibility, and quality to provide the American people with genuine  healthcare reform, but we can only get to that point by repealing  ObamaCare now. I promise to read the bill before voting on it, unlike  how it was passed.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to speak in  favor of H.R. 238, the Commodity End-User Relief Act.   I thank Chairman Conaway for his leadership and his continued  commitment to positive reforms through the Agriculture Committee. It  has been a privilege to work with him on issues impacting our Nation's  rural communities.   I also thank Subcommittee Chairman Austin Scott for his work in  bringing this bill to the floor yet again.   This bill will provide much-needed relief to the end users of this  country in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill. End  users in the bill are the farmers and ranchers and public utilities  across our country. When costs increase for them, they increase for all  Americans. The farmer was not the reason for the economic recession  that began in 2008. The rancher was not the reason, nor was the power  company.   So why bring them under the umbrella of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street  reform?   Rural America is not Wall Street. It is this view held by some of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle that has alienated so many in  rural America.   The Agriculture Committee has approved this measure four times  through regular order in the committee. Its commonsense reforms have  [[Page H411]]  garnered bipartisan support in the 114th Congress and the 113th  Congress. It is my hope that with this new administration taking office  next week, these commonsense changes will finally be signed into law.   I implore my fellow colleagues to listen to rural America. Remember,  they are not Wall Street.   I thank Chairman Conaway, Subcommittee Chairman Austin Scott, and  Ranking Member David Scott for making this a priority. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
