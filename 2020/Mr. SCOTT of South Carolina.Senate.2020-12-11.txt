 Mr. President, today I would like  to take a moment to recognize and honor Mayor Joseph T. McElveen of  Sumter, SC. Mayor McElveen served in the U.S. Air Force after  graduating from the Citadel in 1968 and from the University of South  Carolina Law School in 1971.   Mayor McElveen has served on the city council, as a member of the  S.C. House of Representatives for Sumter County, and now is retiring  after serving as mayor of Sumter. He has dedicated over 20 years of his  life to serving the great people of Sumter and has seen prosperity and  growth come to Sumter County firsthand.   I want to thank Mayor McElveen for his service and for emulating in  his life what it means to be a public servant.                            ____________________
