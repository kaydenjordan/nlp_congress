 Mr. Speaker, let me say that the gentleman from New  York is doing an excellent job. He has translated the great leadership  of the New York legislature and brought it here to the House. We thank  the gentleman for his service.   I have been affected by the gentleman from Georgia's comments. We  have been on this floor together, and I know that we have a heart of  service. As well--coming from Georgia, coming from Texas--we know  veterans and we certainly know Active-Duty persons as well.   So I rise to support the policy underpinnings of this legislation  that has been so well articulated by the gentleman from New York.  [[Page H1402]]    And it is important to note, just as background: When this government  was wrongly shut down, we lost $11 billion, $3 billion that we will  never see again and $8 billion that we may see again. But, in the  course of that, all of us interacted with our veterans, many of them  devastated because some of them were in positions that caused them to  be furloughed. That means they were not getting a paycheck.   Some of them, of course, are disabled veterans or veterans who are  engaged in the veterans' health system.   And we know that these veterans have pride. So this bill is an  authorizing bill that affirms that pride, that allows veterans--many of  them young veterans, having been in the Afghanistan war, having been in  the Iraq war, having been in Syria--many of them young with young  children, that they can go to get their medical care--that is well  needed--by now having childcare during their medical care visits.   And I am glad the gentleman from New York made it clear over and over  again that this is an authorizing bill. There is no need for paygo.  There is no need for the offset. That will be handled. This is a policy  point.   This is Democrats, hopefully joined by Republicans, to affirm our  commitment to the service of veterans. But, as I do that, maybe the  gentleman from Georgia would join me in reconsidering the new tax cuts  by the GOP, which would cost $3.8 trillion to the deficit this second  round and create $3.2 trillion in the Federal deficit over a decade.                                time  1245    Maybe my good friend will join me and indicate that our veterans are  more important, that services to our families are more important, and,  therefore, let's reconsider this deficit-busting GOP tax bill.   But as relates to this policy, I am grateful to the leadership of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee. I thank the gentleman from New York in the  Rules Committee for bringing forward this thoughtful, smart veterans  bill. Remember, you have been hearing us talk about smart border  security, and we are working on that right now to keep the government  open, but this is a smart bill.   I have a veterans hospital in my area, formerly in my district, and I  know how important Medicare is.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the rule, and I rise to support the  underlying legislation, which is authorizing legislation to help  veterans have childcare when they go to get their medical care.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 494) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets  Act of 1968 to reauthorize the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant  program, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 494         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

It is the sense of the Congress that the use of best       practices is encouraged for all activities for which grants       under part R of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act of 1968 may be used.       SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR JUVENILE                     ACCOUNTABILITY BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM.         Section 1001(a)(16) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control       and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10261(a)(16)) is       amended to read as follows:        ``(16) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out       projects under part R $30,000,000 for each of fiscal years       2020 through 2024.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include  [[Page H1404]]  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very special bill to my heart and to my  constituents and to the many, many advocates dealing with the  reformation of the juvenile justice system and the importance of such.   I would like to take note of many of them, but, in particular, the  National Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Council and  Coalition that represent decades of work all over the Nation,  organizations that recognize that the best place for our young  juveniles that have had some encounter with the system is not in a  detention-like jail.   I hope that as we move forward on criminal justice reform and  juvenile justice reform that we can reform the places and the attitudes  toward juveniles who run awry of the system all over the Nation.   This bill is named for Tiffany May Joslyn, a champion for criminal  justice reform, who formerly served as deputy chief counsel of the  Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations Subcommittee,  and whose life tragically was cut short on March 5, 2016, in a car  accident, which sadly also claimed the life of her brother Derrick. She  was just 33 years old.   Her family loved her. Her family still remembers how much she talked  about her work on the House Judiciary Committee and the Subcommittee on  Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations that I served on  at that time as the ranking member.   So passage of this bill last Congress in this body was both bitter  and sweet, but I would understand that Tiffany, in the place where she  is, would have been proud as she championed these causes fearlessly.  This moment is for both her and for all of the millions of young people  that will be helped by this bill.   We worked very hard on this bill, and it is a bipartisan bill. It  has, I believe, those who have an interest in doing the very best for  our Nation and for our young people.   The Tiffany Joslyn bill will help stem the epidemic of juveniles  within the criminal justice system by reauthorizing the juvenile  justice system and the juvenile accountability block grant program and  providing funding to State and local governments for the creation of  antibullying and antigang prevention programs and intervention.   It is clearly important to recognize that it is only us that can  begin to reframe the old-fashioned attitudes about ``lock'em up.'' We  know that there was a period of time, Mr. Speaker, when it was a shift  so that schools and the education system were saying: Get the bad  apples out of your classroom, not even into the principal's office or  not even into the auditorium for detention.   They leaped from the classroom into the hands of law enforcement  officers who then, as we have seen some of the untoward actions, had to  wrestle them down or there was emotional encounters, but they went  downtown, as many of us would say, to the county jail or to the  detention center.   We hope that we will provide other tools to be able to intervene on  behaviors by way of providing resources to some of our well-documented  groups and organizations and new ones that have creative ways of  intervening in a juvenile's life. How many of us have heard the story  of how a pilot, a lawyer, a doctor started out their life, and then how  they wound up as being contributing citizens because someone  intervened. This bill is about intervention.   In addition to reauthorizing the juvenile justice programs, the  Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability Block Grant, and the Bullying  Prevention and Intervention Act clarifies how to address the  occurrences of bullying through developmentally appropriate  intervention and prevention techniques, which center on evidence-based  models and best practices.   Best practices bring people together, because it doesn't matter  whether you are Republican or Democrat, it brings people together, and  that is best practices that rely on schools and communities rather than  the involvement from law enforcement and the justice system.   What we want is to put a big red stop sign in front of the life of  every juvenile that might be awry with the system, and procedures and  rules to be able to find an alternative way.   H.R. 494 is designed to help both the victims and perpetrators of  bullying. Research studies have shown that approximately 25 percent of  school bullies will be convicted of a criminal offense in their adult  years. Let's put a stop sign there. Let's not have that happen.                                time  1300    We also recognize that cyberbullying has become an epidemic,  particularly for young people. Their life is centered around  technology. Many times they are in their home, bedroom, et cetera, only  with technology, and they use that in a way--because their brains are  not matured until 25 and over, they use it in a way that they don't  fully comprehend how vicious, how devastating this could be to the  receiver of that information, how exposing that could be to the  receiver of that information.   Let's get in their lives. Let's use this legislation to do so.   It also includes provisions for gang prevention programs which will  help guide our children toward socially beneficial paths. If we want  our children to learn, we must be able to maintain a safe and healthy  school environment.   Bullying is a massive issue in our Nation's schools. Over the years,  I have worked with young children as young as 10 or 12. Some of them  have organized their own antibullying organizations, looking to us to  affirm them, and I hope in this legislation we will have the  opportunity to do so. If we want our children to learn, that is what we  must do.   The National Center for Educational Studies shows that 14 percent of  12- to 18-year-olds surveyed reported being victims of direct or  indirect bullying. One out of four kids is bullied. Cyberbullying is in  the midst of that. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation.   I also urge them to consider that we may have short memories on some  things, but I am sure many of us can go back and remember that middle  school, that early age leading up to 18 and then going off, some to  college and some on, at some point, to work. We remember that  indecisive moment. We remember wanting to have friends and wanting to  be liked. And then we remember the alternative of those who might take  advantage of that.   With that in mind, here we are with an opportunity to deal with best  practices and to help our young people in the best way possible.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the ``Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile  Accountability Block Grant Reauthorization and the Bullying Prevention  and Intervention Act'', which we passed in the last Congress, here in  the House.   This bill is named for Tiffany May Joslyn, a champion for criminal  justice reform, who served as Deputy Chief Counsel of the Crime  Subcommittee and whose life tragically was cut short on March 5, 2016,  in a car accident, which sadly also claimed the life of her brother,  Derrick. She was just 33 years old.   So passage of this bill last Congress in this body, was both bitter  and sweet. Tiffany would have been proud, as she championed these  causes fearlessly. This moment is for both her and for all the millions  of young people that will be helped by this bill.   The Tiffany Joslyn bill will help stem the epidemic of juveniles  within the criminal justice system by reauthorizing the Juvenile  Accountability Block Grant program (JABG) and providing funding to  state and local governments for the creation of bullying and gang  prevention programs.   It also includes provisions for gang prevention programs, which will  help guide our children towards socially beneficial paths.   If we want our children to learn, we must be able to maintain a safe  and healthy school environment. Bullying is a massive issue in our  nation's schools.   The National Center for Educational Studies reports show that 14  percent of 12- to 18-year-olds surveyed, reported being victims of  direct or indirect bullying. One out of 4 kids is bullied.   This is why I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.   It will authorize such appropriations as may be necessary, which is  anticipated to be at least $30 million per year.   In addition to reauthorizing juvenile justice programs, the Tiffany  Joselyn Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Reauthorization and  [[Page H1405]]  the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act clarifies how to address  the occurrences of bullying through developmentally appropriate  intervention and prevention techniques, which center on evidence-based  models and best practices that rely on schools and communities rather  than involvement from law enforcement and the justice system.   H.R. 494 is designed to help both the victims and perpetrators of  bullying. Research studies have shown that approximately 25 percent of  school bullies will be convicted of a criminal offense in their adult  years.   Bullying is not just in a schoolyard anymore; it is a crisis that's  taking over our nation. Gone are the days that children can come home  and seek solace and escape from their bullies; technological advances  have made it easy for young people to be tormented on social networks  at any time from any place.   They are never out of harm's reach. This needs to end. Americans  children should be protected, and no child should be persecuted for  exercising their American right to be themselves.   It is time for us to come to a conclusive solution to America's  bullying crisis so that we may keep all of our children safe.   My bill, H.R. 494, provides the solution that we need.   This is why I support this bill and ask my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me, first of all, thank the ranking member for his kind support  of this legislation. I think we have been together long enough to know  how important this kind of work is; and a tribute to his father, who  certainly probably ran across a few juveniles in the course of his work  as a law enforcement officer. So I thank the gentleman so very much.   I want to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Nadler, for his  support of this legislation and continued work in this area.   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield such time as he may consume  to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), the chair on  the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman.   We are inquiring, and I am just going to say it publicly. We were  about to engage the ranking member, but we are inquiring to be sure  that the bill is complete. Its language was, ``and Anti-Bullying and  Intervention Act.'' That is what the bill has carried over a period of  time, so I was trying to get a ruling about that addition to the title.    That is clearly what we are trying to do. If I might  engage the gentleman in a dialogue: it reads, ``the Tiffany Joslyn  Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program Reauthorization Act,'' and  it has always read, over the years, ``and Anti-Bullying and  Intervention Act.'' It is in my text here, ``and the Bullying  Prevention and Intervention Act.''    We are awaiting a ruling, and may have to--but I at  least want to get it on the Record. You see what I am saying?    And that is the name that has been carried over the  years that we have had----    I believe so.    Mr. Speaker, if I might, I assume I can proceed.    First of all, I want to thank the ranking member for  his courtesies, and thank the committees for their courtesies.   I would not desire to not move forward H.R. 494. So any motion for  amending at this time, I would like unanimous consent to withdraw and  to emphasize what the bill is in my debate.  [[Page H1406]]     I seek to not withdraw H.R. 494, just any request  for editing the legislation.    I yield to the gentleman.    That is my desire at this time.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Does the gentleman?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   So I will close at this time asking for support of this legislation.  But as I do so, I cannot help but thank--I think we have had----    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia for engaging in the colloquy on  this important issue, and I think we have created a record that  indicates that this bill is the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability  Block Grant Program Reauthorization Act, and it does cover bullying  prevention and intervention, and we will move forward with that  understanding and recognize the importance of those elements of the  bill.   I want to just take a moment in my closing to acknowledge again the  National Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Coalition and to  indicate their support for a bill that has gone unfunded now for 6  years, and to indicate in their letter that H.R. 494 updates the JABG  to reflect current research and practices; incentivizes States to use  graduated sanctions and incentives grounded in positive youth  development; enhanced antibullying measures, gang prevention programs,  and additional youth violence prevention and intervention services. It  also updates the JABG to include evidence-based practices such as  trauma-informed practices and mental healthcare.    I am excited about this legislation. And I close by saying bullying  is not just a schoolyard action anymore; it is a crisis that is taking  over our Nation.   Gone are the days that children can come home and seek solace and  escape from their bullies. Technological advances have made it easy for  young people to be tormented on social networks at any time from any  place. They are never out of harm's reach.   This needs to end. American children should be protected, and no  child should be persecuted for existing or exercising their American  right to just be themselves. It is time for us to come to a conclusive  solution to America's bullying crisis so that we may keep all of our  children safe. I think we are on the right path by passing H.R. 494 and  moving it to the Senate. That is why I support this bill and ask my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California  for her leadership, and I thank  [[Page H1408]]  both the ranking member and the full committee chair. And I thank Mr.  Deutch from Florida, for it looks like, in this instance, Florida and  Texas and many other States certainly are--how should I say it?--in  coalition with the number of veterans that we have and the stories that  we have heard about fraudulent activities as it relates to our  veterans.   I would think that all veterans want to do after battling on behalf  of this Nation and securing this Nation is to come home to a safe and  secure community and people who welcome them and treat them with the  dignity that they deserve. Unfortunately, because veterans have  resources through their veterans benefits, they are targeted by those  who have no goodwill, but evil intent.   Currently, there are approximately 21 million veterans of the United  States Armed Forces living in our country. It is estimated that about  30 percent of all Vietnam veterans have had post-traumatic stress  disorder, and up to 20 percent of veterans serving in more recent  conflicts in the Middle East are estimated to suffer from PTSD in a  given year.   Given the extreme sacrifice of our veterans and the hardships many of  them continue to face after their military service, it is our duty, to  the best of our ability, to have an appropriate measure of compensation  for them, particularly for those in need.   For instance, we provide disability payments to those with service- connected disabilities, pensions for veterans with limited income,  education and training under the GI Bill, and various life insurance  benefits.   Over 71,000 veterans live in my congressional district.   H.R. 450 provides law enforcement with another tool to bring to  justice those who knowingly defraud a veteran of their benefits or  engage in fraud in connection with obtaining veterans benefits.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, there are many of them. 476,515 veterans  are living with PTSD and need their benefits.   Mr. Speaker, how many have come to us in our offices and indicated  that, through a telemarketing scheme, they have given up their benefits  or they have taken their benefits to invest or buy something that  either is never seen or doesn't help them, and never is their money  returning back to them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida in particular for  being sensitive enough to listen to his constituents. In listening to  my constituents and solving cases in our offices, there are cases that  come into our offices where veterans have had their benefits taken away  or they wind up homeless because resources are taken away and they  don't have the necessary resources.   This is a good, good step to acknowledge their service and how  important they are; to stop those who think that they are easy prey  from defrauding our veterans; and to make the right kind of legal  traps, if you will, that law enforcement can place, not for veterans  who have served us, but for those who wish to defraud them.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentleman from Florida and ask my  colleagues to support H.R. 450, the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans  Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 450, the  ``Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2017,'' which provides an  additional tool to deter, detect, and punish fraudulent activity  against veterans.   The Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2017 would make it  unlawful to knowingly execute, or attempt to execute, any scheme or  artifice to defraud an individual of veterans' benefits, or in  connection with obtaining veterans benefits.   We honor our veterans' service and their sacrifices; it is important  that we protect veterans from fraud and ensure the integrity of the  system of benefits we provide for them.   Currently, there are approximately 21 million veterans of the United  States Armed Forces living in our country.   It is estimated that about 30 percent of all Vietnam veterans have  had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and up to 20 percent of  veterans serving in more recent conflicts in the Middle East are  estimated to suffer from PTSD in a given year.   Given the extreme sacrifice by our veterans and the hardships many of  them continue to face after their military service, it is our duty to  provide, to the best of our ability, an appropriate measure of  compensation for them--particularly for those in need.   For instance, we provide disability payments to those with service- connected disabilities, pensions for veterans with limited incomes,  education and training under the GI Bill, and various life insurance  benefits.   Over 71,749 veterans reside in my 18th Congressional District and one  of my top priorities is to fight for their benefits and to fight for  the rights of our most patriotic Americans.   H.R. 450 provides law enforcement with another tool to bring to  justice those who knowingly defraud a veteran of their benefits or  engage in fraud in connection with obtaining veterans' benefits.   Mr. Speaker, 476,515 veterans are living with PTSD and need their  benefits to obtain needed care for their disorder; it is criminal that  some are left untreated.   Those who defraud veterans and the system of veterans' benefits harm  the victims and diminish resources needed to pay the claims and fund  the programs that are needed to help those who have served their  country.   I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 450.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much, and  I acknowledge the words of the  [[Page H1411]]  ranking member of the full committee and acknowledge the work of the  chairman, Mr. Nadler, of the committee.   I am glad that these bills that we have just debated and one coming  up that I know is Mr. Collins' bill dealing with the fees to provide  resources to those who file lawsuits, justified lawsuits, and have no  recourse, these bills are coming out of the Judiciary Committee in a  bipartisan manner.   This is a very important statement that we are making with the new  majority and working with the minority on very important issues.   This is an issue that has claimed our attention for decades, the fact  that we are working every day to improve and, as Mr. Collins has just  indicated, to never to have to talk about sex trafficking, human  trafficking again. If we can eliminate this scourge, I think all of us  will find peace.   Just a few years ago, as the ranking member on the Homeland Security  Committee, we did the first human trafficking hearing with then- Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson in Houston, Texas, to  listen to many who claimed and documented that Houston, Texas, was the  epicenter of human trafficking in that region, in the Nation.   It is not something that we are proud of, but we are proud of the  advocates who work without ceasing with law enforcement to put, again,  a red stop sign in front of this travesty.   So I acknowledge the work that has been done by many of my  colleagues, the work that has been done by Congresswoman Wagner and  many others who gathered.   That hearing was the first in history in that community, and the  first field hearing that was addressing that question. It was quite a  few years ago.   But I want to acknowledge from my hometown Jackie Aluotto, who has  found and saved lives of victims of human trafficking in our own  community; Kathryn Griffin, who, likewise, has been at the forefront of  stopping human trafficking, and particularly of young children sex  trafficking, and has been a refuge for many who have suffered;  Constable Alan Rosen; Constable May Walker; Sheriff Gonzalez; Mayor  Sylvester Turner, who has an outstanding program in the city of  Houston.   So I rise to support H.R. 507 for several reasons, not the least of  which being how much it will impact the local community and the work  that is being done. This measure will strengthen the effectiveness of  the 2017 act in various ways, which I am very proud to have supported.                                time  1345    The 2017 act directed the Attorney General to study issues related to  human trafficking in response to trafficking concerning services and  benefits for victims, criminal justice, domestic sex trafficking of  children, and interagency coordination and training.   For example, H.R. 507 increases the personal safety of victim service  providers who may face intimidation or retaliation for their  activities. While many of us may not realize, sometimes these providers  within the context of the law, may have one or two of these individuals  at their own homes, or have secreted them somewhere, so they are in the  eye of the storm.   As I indicated, we had the first human trafficking hearing of any  committee in Houston, Texas, several years ago under the auspices of  the Homeland Security Committee.   I am proud of the facts that came out, giving the local people the  opportunity to talk about the difficulties and challenges that they  face trying to stop the scourge of human trafficking, particularly with  young people.   Our committee determined this very point, that the safety of these  victims should be our number one concern. Innocent people who have been  turned into human trafficking products by the heinous traffickers  deserve our protection. As such, this training and funding is critical  to ensure that human trafficking victims are treated as victims and  afforded justice, respect, and dignity.   Second, H.R. 507 ensures that law enforcement officers and  prosecutors make every attempt to determine whether an individual is a  victim of human trafficking before arresting the individual for or  charging the individual with an offense that is a direct result of  victimization of that individual.   This will ensure that law enforcement officers do not add trauma and  pain to the victims that have already endured an enormous amount of  suffering.   Let me remind my colleagues, that human trafficking, even beyond the  scourge of drugs, is a product that can be used or is used over and  over again. How devastating, how deadly, how heinous it is that these  individuals can be used in human trafficking, sex trafficking, and the  acts that they may be called upon to do over and over again.   As a result, H.R. 507 will ensure that most effective practices are  standardized so that sex trafficking victims are ultimately protected  and treated with respect at all times.   Lastly, the legislation ensures the effective prosecution of  traffickers and individuals. For these reasons, I would say that this  would be a bill that all of us support. Let's put up more than a stop  sign and fight human trafficking and sex trafficking.   Support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 507, which directs the  Attorney General to study issues relating to human trafficking, and for  other purposes.   Madam Speaker, it is of the upmost importance that we pass this  important legislation and uphold the ideals of this country by  protecting human trafficking victims.   This bill is intended to improve the implementation of the Putting  Trafficking Victims First Act of 2017.   The 2017 act directed the Attorney General to study issues relating  to human trafficking in response to trafficking concerning services and  benefits for victims, criminal justice, domestic sex trafficking of  children, and interagency coordination and training.   I support H.R. 507 for several reasons. This measure will strengthen  the effectiveness of the 2017 act in various ways, which I was proud to  support.   For example, H.R. 507 increases the personal safety of victim service  providers, who may face intimidation or retaliation for their  activities.   We had the first human trafficking hearing of any committee in  Houston, Texas, several years ago under the auspices of the Homeland  Security Committee.   Our committee determined this very point: that the safety of these  victims should be our number one concern.   Innocent people who have been turned into human traffic products by  the heinous traffickers deserve our protection.   As such, this training and funding is critical to ensure that human  trafficking victims are treated as victims and afforded justice,  respect, and dignity.   Second, H.R. 507 ensures that law enforcement officers and  prosecutors make every attempt to determine whether an individual is a  victim of human trafficking before arresting the individual for, or  charging the individual with, an offense that is a direct result of the  victimization of the individual.   This will ensure that law enforcement officers do not add trauma and  pain to the victims that have already endured an enormous amount of  suffering.   As a result, H.R. 507 will help ensure the most effective practices  are standardized so that sex trafficking victims are ultimately  protected and treated with respect at all times.   Lastly, the legislation ensures the effective prosecution of  traffickers and individuals who patronize or solicit children for sex  and facilitate access for child victims of commercial sex trafficking  to the services and protections afforded to other victims of sexual  violence.   H.R. 507 identifies a broad range of important initiatives that  States should undertake that would provide meaningful assistance to  these victims: increasing victims' personal safety, ensuring the  correct treatment of human trafficking victims by law enforcement and,  ensuring the effective prosecution of all traffickers.   Each of these initiatives should help ensure that these victims are  not revictimized and help enable them to be guided back to a normalized  life.   Mr. Speaker, for all of these reasons, I am pleased to support this  bill.   This legislation is all about pointing out, finding, saving the  victims, making sure they get treatment, and making sure that human  trafficking is identified.   I am also pleased that this measure, maintains the commitment to  maintaining a report on State safe harbor laws.   As we all know, safe harbors play a critical role in preventing  youth, forced into the sex trade, from being revictimized again and  stigmatized a second time by the criminal justice system, almost  similar to the little girl who was looking for love.   Instead, she got victimized and turned into a human trafficking  product.  [[Page H1412]]    H.R. 507 also fosters better collaboration among the Federal, State,  and local law enforcement in the fight against sex trafficking and  encourages States to adopt protections for trafficking victims by  providing rehabilitation and recovery services for victims of human  trafficking.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure and, as  well, to be reminded of all those children who will be helped and  saved.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 752 ``Open  Book Equal Access to Justice Act'' which will amend titles 5 and 28,  United States Code, to require the maintenance of databases on awards  of fees  [[Page H1415]]  and other expenses to prevailing parties in certain administrative  proceedings and court cases to which the United States is a party, and  for other purposes.   In 1980, Congress passed the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) as a  means to help individuals, retirees, veterans, and small businesses  recover attorney's fees and costs associated with suing the federal  government.   Congress intended the EAJA to remove a barrier to justice for those  with limited access to the resources it takes to sue the federal  government.   Payments of EAJA attorney's fees come from the budget of the agency  who action gave rise to the claim.   While the original EAJA legislation included a requirement to track  payments and report to Congress annually, Congress and the agencies  halted tracking and reporting of payments made through EAJA in 1995.   Without any direction to track payments, most agencies simply do not  do it and Congress and taxpayers are unable to exercise oversight over  these funds.   H.R. 752 reinstates the tracking and reporting requirements of the  original EAJA legislation by requiring the Administrative Conference of  the United States (ACUS) to develop an online, searchable database to  facilitate public and Congressional oversight over the program.   This will allow public access to information on the amount of  attorney's fees being paid under EAJA, to whom the taxpayers' money is  being paid, and from which agencies.   The Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act helps ensure that  agencies are operating under the public eye and that taxpayer dollars  are being spent effectively and properly.   Allowing plaintiffs to recoup legal costs when they sue the federal  government for reparations they deserve is only fair.   Many Americans do not have the resources to take on our sprawling  bureaucracy, but EAJA gave them the power to do that by removing a  barrier to justice for those with limited access to resources.   Since the original reporting requirements were halted by Congress,  there is no information on payments made under the law.   Tracking and reporting payments will help preserve the integrity of  this law and help Congress make sure it is working effectively for the  people it was intended to help.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 752.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Clerk  be directed to make the change in the engrossment of H.R. 494 that I  placed at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to recognize and  acknowledge gun victims in America.   This week in the Judiciary Committee, we held an important hearing on  beginning the first steps toward real commonsense gun safety  legislation.   In listening to witnesses from law enforcement, victims and near- victims, representatives from the health profession, and, yes, those  who advocated for the Second Amendment, I would argue that, in this  tribute to gun victims, recognizing the pain of their families and  those lives lost, that no one is challenging the Second Amendment.   But with 100 persons a day dying by gun violence in the United  States, it is without question that we must move quickly on universal  background checks; we must move quickly on making bump stocks illegal;  we must move quickly on the question of assault weapons; we must move  quickly on closing loopholes and straw purchases; and we must work with  the mental health community to ensure that we address that very  sensitive question to help people who are disturbed and challenged.   Mr. Speaker, I honor those who have lost their lives, and I honor  them by our action.                            ____________________
