 Madam Speaker, I am proud to speak before the U.S. House  of Representatives in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the House  passage of the 19th Amendment that gave all women the right to vote.  This centennial is one of the most important in our Nation's history,  and I am thrilled to be celebrating it with my colleagues here on the  House floor.   The fight for women's suffrage in my State of Arizona began when we  were still a territory in the 1800s. Brave women, like Josephine Hughes  of Tucson, Frances Munds of Prescott, and others, led the suffragist  movement in Arizona so that women in Arizona won the right to vote even  before the 19th Amendment passed.   Let us celebrate the many women and men who fought for so much over  so many years to ensure the right to vote for women in America.   As the daughter of a great mother, as the mother of a wonderful  daughter, and as the grandmother to a 1-week-old granddaughter, I am so  proud to be here today to honor this great, historic moment.                            ____________________
