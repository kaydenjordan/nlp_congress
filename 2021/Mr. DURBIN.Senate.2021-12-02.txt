 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it has been a great source of debate  over the past couple of years over a very basic question: How was  Jeffrey Epstein able to take his own life in Federal prison on August  10, 2019?   Last week, we found some answers in the New York Times. It pointed  out a series of stunning failures within the Bureau of Prisons.   According to the Times: ``The newly obtained records offer no support  to the explosion of conspiracy theories that Mr. Epstein's death was  not a suicide. . . . But they do paint a picture of incompetence and  sloppiness by some within the Bureau of Prisons.''   That incompetence and sloppiness was evident from the moment Jeffrey  Epstein entered the Metropolitan Correctional Center. On his intake  screening form, Mr. Epstein was described as ``a Black male,'' with no  prior record of sex offense convictions. A 5-second Google search would  tell you that not only was Jeffrey Epstein White, he was one of the  most notorious sex traffickers in recent history.   And what about the night he died? He had already attempted suicide in  the weeks leading up to his death, so you would think that the  officials in the Bureau of Prisons would keep close watch over this  potentially suicidal inmate.   In fact, the opposite happened. Jeffrey Epstein was left alone,  unmonitored, in his cell. The two officers on duty were allegedly  dozing off and scrolling on their phones. And the next morning, Epstein  was found dead with a bed sheet tied around his neck. Because of these  failures, the survivors of Epstein's despicable crimes will never get  to see him brought to justice.   Six months after Epstein died, former Attorney General Bill Barr  handpicked Michael Carvajal to lead the Bureau of Prisons. It could  have been a new beginning for the Bureau, a chance to get to the bottom  of widely publicized neglect and mismanagement--and to hold the  appropriate parties accountable. But that fresh start never came  because, since day one, Director Carvajal of the Bureau of Prisons has  shown no intention of reforming that institution.   Consider the case of the warden who ran the Metropolitan Correctional  Center the night Jeffrey Epstein died. How did Director Carvajal  respond to that warden's failure of leadership? Well, if you can  imagine it, he actually rewarded him. Director Carvajal appointed the  same warden to lead a different facility, the largest Federal prison in  the United States: FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey.   And it seems that warden hasn't learned any lessons in leadership  since Mr. Epstein's death. Last month, an inmate in FCI Fort Dix was  attacked from behind and stabbed in the eye.   These are not isolated incidents. For years, the Bureau of Prisons  has been plagued by corruption, chronic understaffing, and misconduct  by high-ranking officials. And in the nearly 2 years since Director  Carvajal took control of the Bureau, he has failed to address the  mounting crises in our Nation's Federal prison system.   It is far past time for new, reform-minded leadership in the Bureau  of Prisons.   A few weeks ago, the Associated Press published a breathtaking  investigation into the Bureau. They concluded that it is a ``hotbed of  abuse, graft and corruption, and has turned a blind eye to employees  accused of misconduct.''   Since 2019, more than 100 Federal prison workers have been arrested  for, charged with, or convicted of crimes, including sexual abuse,  murder, and introducing contraband into the prison. Altogether, these  crimes account for two-thirds of the criminal cases against all  Department of Justice personnel, even though BOP employees comprise  less than a third of the workforce.   I want to share a few of the stories from the Associated Press  report. At one Federal prison in Mississippi, an official responsible  for investigating the misconduct of other staff members was arrested  for his own misconduct. He was not only accused of stalking and  harassing his fellow employees, but he was allowed to remain in his  position. He was even authorized to continue investigating one of his  accusers.   In California, a warden of a Federal women's prison was arrested and  indicted earlier this year for molesting an inmate. He even kept lewd  photos of the victim on his government-issued cell phone. He allegedly  told the woman that she shouldn't even try to report the assault  because he was ``close friends'' with the official who would  investigate it.   The list goes on. It is a recurring pattern of misconduct by  officials within the Bureau of Prisons who believe they can abuse  inmates and break the law with impunity. In some cases, that is exactly  what they have done.   The details in the AP investigation are shocking. And for those of us  who have been following Director Carvajal's tenure, they are the latest  disturbing examples of failed leadership.   Time and again, he has categorically failed to uphold his chief  responsibility as Director. And what is that responsibility? Protecting  the health and safety of inmates and correctional officers.   Today, the Bureau suffers from chronic and significant understaffing.  Director Carvajal has failed to contain outbreaks of COVID-19, which  has led to tens of thousands of inmates and staff contracting the  virus. And when it comes to reforming our Federal prison system, he has  failed.   In 2018, congressional Democrats and Republicans came together on an  overwhelmingly bipartisan basis to enact the FIRST STEP Act. It was a  historic piece of reform legislation to create new pathways for prison  inmates to better themselves while they serve their time, so they can  return to society once released.   Nearly 3 years later, the Bureau of Prisons still hasn't implemented  most of these reforms.   One example, under the FIRST STEP Act, low-risk inmates are eligible  to earn time credits, reducing their sentences. They do this by  completing programs designed to prevent them from committing another  crime.   Last month, the inspector general at the Department of Justice found  that  [[Page S8878]]  the Bureau of Prisons has not applied these earned time credits to any  of the approximately 60,000 eligible inmates.   Now the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, is charged with  overseeing the Bureau of Prisons. We have tried to get answers from  Director Carvajal and his team. We have repeatedly requested  information.   We have asked for details about the inmate banking system. Now, there  is a heck of a story. It purportedly has little oversight by the Bureau  of Prisons, has allowed inmates to avoid paying child support and  restitution to crime victims and other obligations.   The Bureau reportedly allowed Larry Nassar, the so-called doctor who  abused hundreds of young gymnasts before he was sentence to life in  prison, to spend thousands of dollars from his Bureau of Prisons  account on himself but pay only $300 toward the debt he owes his  victims.   The Bureau has delayed responding to our questions--or just flatout  ignored them.   It is past time to replace Director Carvajal. This can't wait any  longer. The Associated Press's investigation shows us that lives are  literally at stake.   I know Attorney General Garland understands the urgency. I am calling  on him today to move immediately to dismiss Director Carvajal and to  bring real reform to the Bureau of Prisons.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise in support of my Connecticut  colleagues in their effort to pass the bipartisan background check  bill, H.R. 8.   I want to thank my friends Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal for  their leadership on this issue.   I am sure, as Senator Blumenthal just recounted, that tragic  experience at Sandy Hook Elementary School 9 years ago is still fresh  in their minds and motivates them to stand up, time and again, and to  speak out on behalf of the families who lost their children and those  wonderful educators and administrators who gave their lives that day.   What will it take? Is there a crime involving guns in America so  horrific that finally we will say enough?   Other countries have. Australia did. They had a terrible shooting.  They came to the conclusion that this was just unacceptable in their  nation. They wouldn't let it become normal. Some States have done that.  Connecticut did after Sandy Hook. They said our State will be  different. We are not going to stand just idly by.   But when it comes here to Washington in this national legislature, in  this Senate, it appears there is nothing sufficiently awful, so  specifically outrageous that it will move us to act.   This last week, it was Oakland County, MI, Oxford High School. Four  children got up in the morning, blurry-eyed, brushed their teeth,  grabbed their lunches, headed off to school--and never came home. That  was the reality of this.   Senator Murphy has said those other students, lucky enough to  survive, will never forget that day as long as they live. They will be  telling their grandchildren about the day they had to dive out of a  window to escape this gunman who was going through their school.   I have always thought, of the most terrible gun crimes that have  happened--and there have been so many, so many--Sandy Hook is the  worst. I can't imagine a classroom of 20 first graders and the teachers  being gunned down at their desks. Oh, my God.   For every parent and every grandparent, it is the worst nightmare in  the world, and it happened there--20 of them. Certainly, many of us  believed that would be the moment that America would come to its senses  and say: Let's do something. If we can't do everything, let's do  something to show we care. But as a national legislature, we failed.   And the proposal that we brought to the floor that was objected to  today is the most basic thing in the world. OK. You have second  amendment rights, unless--unless--you have given those up by committing  a felony crime and being convicted of it, unless you were so mentally  unstable that you shouldn't own a gun. That is basically it. That is  all we said. Are those unreasonable? I think not. Eighty-four percent  of Americans happen to believe that is a pretty sensible thing to do-- 84 percent. But when it comes to the U.S. Senate, we can't get 51  percent to vote that way--at least not yet.   So I thank my colleagues Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal for  reminding us of the terrible tragedy in their lives and in their State  just 9 years ago. But I will tell you that as horrible as Sandy Hook  was, 900 people have died by gunfire in Cook County, IL, which I  represent, just this year, and 40,000 Americans lost their lives to  guns last year. We can't do anything about that. They are gone.   But what about tomorrow's victims? What about next week's victims?  What about the next high school? We can do something about that, and  this bill would pass today if Republican Senators would allow it.   Let's be very candid about this. This is a partisan issue. It  shouldn't be. Those gunmen--I don't think anyone reports their  political status, and certainly the victims are not identified that  way. But in this Chamber, it is an article of faith, political faith,  that Republicans won't touch anything related to gun safety--anything.   The bill that was objected to, proposed by Senator Grassley, the  protecting communities bill--first, let me say Chuck Grassley is my  friend. I mean it. I don't just say that as political, idle talk. He is  my ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. We disagree on a  lot of things. We sure do agree on a lot of things too.   The bill that he described is a step in the wrong direction, as was  mentioned by Senator Murphy. That bill doesn't fix the gaping holes in  the background check system. It makes them worse. To say that people  who have been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital can  leave that hospital, walk out the door, and buy a gun, that doesn't  even make sense.   You would certainly want to ask someone, some medical expert, what is  their state of mind? Have they fully recovered? Are they ready? Can  they make a basic decision that we can trust? That is not too much to  ask for those who are involuntarily committed to a psychiatric  hospital.   Unfortunately, the Grassley bill, which we objected to, would  automatically restore a person's right to buy a gun the minute they  walked out of the hospital. The bill also wipes away the NICS  background check system for the records of--listen--175,000 people in  this country who have been found, in the words of the statute,  ``mentally incompetent.'' This bill would allow them--permit them to  buy guns immediately.   How can that make any sense at all?   Surely, the definition may not be the best, but let's work on that  instead of just saying, on a blanket basis, go out and buy a gun if you  want to.   The bill also weakens gun laws on the books. The bill would allow gun  dealers to sell handguns directly to people from other States. How does  that make us safer? And it would bar the ATF from requiring gun dealers  to submit reports of multiple purchases of long guns--a key indicator  of gun trafficking in many border States.   We are a long way from where we should be, but Senator Grassley has  challenged me as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a  hearing, mark up the bill.   I accept the challenge. We may not get to first base on this, but we  are not going to stay in the stands and in the bleachers as kids are  being gunned down at Oxford High School, and we are ``celebrating''--if  that is the word--all of the gun deaths of the past with anniversaries  that bring back bitter memories and tragic occurrences.   So, yes, the Senate Judiciary Committee will have a hearing. We are  going to move forward as best we can. Maybe there is common ground out  there. I pray, for the victims and their families--I pray that there  is.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
