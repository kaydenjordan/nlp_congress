 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring some thunder to the  House Chamber and recognize the now two-time Stanley Cup Champion Tampa  Bay Lightning.   Behind the leadership of Captain Steven Stamkos and Stanley Cup MVP  Victor Hedman, the Bolts have enshrined themselves as one of the  greatest teams of all time.   Although COVID prevented fans from attending the playoffs, the  distant thunder of the greatest fans in hockey and the determination of  the Lightning got them to the top of the mountain, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, as we say in Tampa Bay, Stanley Needs a Tan. And let me  just say, it is sunny back in Tampa Bay.   While one Tampa Bay championship run comes to an end, another begins.  Best of luck to the Tampa Bay Rays as they begin their quest to secure  their first World Series title.   Let's make Tampa Bay Title Town USA.                            ____________________
