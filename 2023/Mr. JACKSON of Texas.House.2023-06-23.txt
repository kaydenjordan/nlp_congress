 Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, multiple disasters  have struck Texas-13 over the last month, from devastating floods in  May to a series of deadly tornadoes in the last week, first in Perryton  and later in Matador and Afton.   While we continue to assess the most recent damage, we already know  that hundreds of homes, businesses, and properties were destroyed. Many  of my constituents were injured, and tragically, lives were lost.   Despite the wreckage, my constituents, assisted by their community,  local officials, and volunteers from across the State, came together to  provide water, food, fuel, and so much more to their neighbors in need.   The Federal Government must act to do everything it can to bring the  needed aid to the Texas Panhandle and help expedite the recovery and  cleanup efforts.   For too long, the Federal Government has forgotten about rural  America. We cannot let this happen here. It may take months to rebuild,  but I know we will do it thanks to the steadfast spirit of the Texans I  represent.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the brave people of the Texas  Panhandle, and I ask that you please join me in praying for them at  this time.                            ____________________
