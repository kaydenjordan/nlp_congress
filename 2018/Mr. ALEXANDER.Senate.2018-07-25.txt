 I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I thank Mr. Blunt, the Senator from  Missouri, for his leadership on these commonsense provisions that would  help literally hundreds of thousands of restaurants, grocery stores,  convenience stores, pizza stores, and other food retailers as they work  to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's menu labeling rule.   I am very disappointed that some Democrats have blocked Senator  Blunt's commonsense legislation. He has worked hard on it and has taken  a piece of legislation that had bipartisan support in the House of  Representatives. He has worked with Senator King of Maine in a  bipartisan way. Nevertheless, there have still been objections.   When Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, they included  a provision that mandated nutrition labeling in restaurants and food  retailers that have over 20 stores nationwide. The proposed rule was  published in December 2014, and the final menu labeling rule went into  effect on May 7, 2018. The final rule required restaurants nationwide  to display calories on menus and menu boards and have additional  nutrition information available upon request. Senators Blunt and King  and I support consumers having access to nutrition information to make  healthier, more informed dietary choices for themselves and their  families.   While I commend the FDA for addressing concerns raised during the  process in the final rule, a few significant problems remain  unaddressed, including the following: employees being subject to  criminal penalties for inconsistencies in calorie information; a clear  amount of time for restaurants to correct violations before  enforcement; restaurants being subject to frivolous civil lawsuits for  minor violations; and flexibility for restaurants where a majority of  orders are placed online.   To address those concerns, Senators Blunt and King, here in the  Senate, and a bipartisan group in the House, as Senator Blunt has  outlined, introduced the bipartisan Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure  Act. The idea was to make the menu labeling rule more workable for  restaurants and to make access to information on nutrition easier for  customers.   The act, led by Representatives Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Loretta  Sanchez, passed the House twice--both times with strong bipartisan  votes and most recently in February with a vote of 266 to 157, with 152  Republicans and 32 Democrats in support.   However, after Senate Democrats raised concerns that the House bill  would further delay the implementation of the rule, Senator Blunt and I  worked out a targeted solution to help give restaurants the flexibility  and certainty they would need to comply with the rule without delaying  its implementation or enforcement.   Our substitute provisions include the following:   No. 1, they clarify legal liability.   For example, if I am a 21-year-old manager at the Chick-fil-A in  Chattanooga, I would be pretty hesitant to sign a statement, as is  currently required by the rule, that could subject me to criminal and  financial penalties if one of my employees were to put extra slices of  cheese on a sandwich. Today, the rule requires a restaurant manager to  certify that the restaurant makes menu items a certain way to meet the  posted nutritional values.   Our amendment changes that. It no longer puts an individual employee  on the hook for a meal item that doesn't match its posted calorie  count. Our amendment maintains the requirement for restaurant  headquarters to certify  [[Page S5342]]  that the nutrient analysis of menu items is complete and accurate.   It is nearly impossible for menu items to be prepared in precisely  the same way every time, and individuals should not be at risk of  criminal and financial penalties based on small differences in how menu  items are prepared.   No. 2, they establish a clear timeline for corrective actions.   If the FDA finds a violation of a sign being out of place or  discrepancies in the calorie content, it is reasonable for a store to  have a clear timeframe to fully correct the violation without being  subject to penalties. This provision would clarify that restaurants  have 30 days to correct violations, and if, after 30 days it is not  resolved, the FDA could move ahead with enforcement action.   No. 3, they protect restaurants from frivolous lawsuits for minor  violations.   This provision clarifies, let's say, if a consumer determines that a  chicken sandwich labeled as having 500 calories actually has 550  calories, the Federal, State, or local enforcement authorities could  take action, but prevents the consumer from suing the restaurant for  damages. This protects restaurants from facing frivolous lawsuits or  class action lawsuits that result in years of litigation and  settlements on minor discrepancies that rarely benefit the consumers.   No. 4, they allow access to nutrition information online.   If you are ordering a pizza for your family, there is a good chance  that you are placing that order online or on a mobile app and that it  is being delivered to your home. Restaurants with over 75 percent of  orders placed online should not have to invest in maintaining and  updating in-store menu boards only a small portion of customers will  ever use.    To summarize, the intent of the FDA menu labeling rule was about  increasing consumer access to nutrition information, not about finding  minor problems to trigger fines and penalties on local businesses.   These provisions are based on bipartisan legislation introduced in  both Chambers, passed twice in the House of Representatives, to  accommodate the diverse business models in the food industry and  provide certainty to restaurants and their employees.   These four provisions in the Blunt-King legislation were carefully  negotiated to address concerns of Democratic Members, to ensure  Americans will soon be able to access nutrition information, and will  not delay or stop FDA's ability to implement or enforce the menu  labeling requirements.   I am disappointed some of our Democratic colleagues rejected these  commonsense provisions that would have helped restaurants provide  calorie counts for Americans and that would have made it easier for  those Americans to obtain that information.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for  his leadership and his remarks.   The President of the United States has got the world's attention with  his tariffs. He met today with the President of the European  Commission, but what should get more attention than  [[Page S5368]]  the tariffs is President Trump's solution for the tariffs: zero  tariffs, zero barriers--which, as the President said at the G7 summit  in June, is the way it should be. He said that again last night and  again today. After his meeting with the President of the European  Commission in the Oval Office, President Trump said: ``If we could have  no tariffs and no barriers and no subsidies, the United States would be  extremely pleased.''   Well, so would I, Mr. President, but that is not what is happening.  Piling tariffs on top of tariffs with no end in sight is a trade war  and will hurt American workers.   But the basis of the President's long-term solution is  ``reciprocity,'' a word he has also used many times, which means, when  it comes to trade, other countries should do for the United States what  the United States does for them. Taking steps in the direction of  reciprocity, rather than a trade war, would be much better for the  American worker.   Today I have come to the floor with Senator Jones to introduce  legislation that would delay the administration's proposed 25 percent  tariff on automobiles and auto parts imported from other countries into  the United States until the President has the benefit of a second  opinion from the International Trade Commission about the effects those  tariffs would have on the more than 7 million Americans who work in the  auto industry.   After the President and the Congress have received the International  Trade Commission's study and the President has this second opinion, he  may still continue with the section 232 investigation if he chooses to  do so.   I have no doubt that there is a trade problem, and some countries are  taking advantage of us. I also have no doubt that shooting yourself in  both feet at once is not the right solution to our problem, which is  what would happen if we continue these tariffs for a long time. That is  not the best way to solve the problem.   These tariffs are dangerous. These tariffs are going to cost us jobs.  These tariffs are going to lower our family incomes. These tariffs are  going to undo much of the good the President and the Congress have done  during the last year and a half to create this booming economy, which  is booming like none of us have seen for a long, long time. We don't  want to interrupt that.   A better strategy is the one that the President himself has suggested  and that I believe would be much more effective: Insist on reciprocity.  Say to other countries: Do for our country what we do for you--just as  the President said at the G7 summit: ``no tariffs, no barriers is the  way it should be.'' And just as he said today to the President of the  European Commission.   May I suggest a first step in that direction? It might be to agree on  the same tariffs on light trucks and cars that are traded between the  United States and the European Union. Currently, the European Union  levies a 10-percent tariff on light trucks that come from the United  States, and the United States levies a 25-percent tariff on trucks  imported from the European Union. Similarly, the European Union levies  a 10-percent tariff on cars imported from this country. The United  States levies a 2.5 percent tariff on cars that come to us from Europe.  A first step for the solution would be to make these tariffs the same.   Now, my late friend Alex Haley once told me that if I begin a speech  by saying ``instead of making a speech, let me tell you a story,''  someone might actually listen to what I have to say. So let me tell you  a story about how tariffs affect Tennessee.   This is a story about a Canadian company, Onward Manufacturing  Company, which 8 years ago had a choice between locating its new plant  either in the United States or in China. The company chose Dickson, TN,  where today about 300 Tennesseans have good-paying jobs making Broil  King gas grills, which the company then exports to Canada and Europe.   The company decided on Tennessee instead of China because NAFTA--the  North American Free Trade Agreement--made it possible to buy materials  and parts to manufacture their grills in the United States and Canada  without paying tariffs. That is the advantage of zero tariffs.   Broil King buys the steel and aluminum the company uses to make  grills from U.S. producers. But in 2016, our country imposed tariffs on  steel from China that is used to manufacture grills. That increased the  cost of imported steel, and that had the effect of increasing the price  of steel made in the United States.   Then, on March 23 of this year, our country imposed another 25  percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, after the Commerce  Department's section 232 investigation concluded that those imports  were a threat to national security. This also had the effect of raising  the price of steel and aluminum that Broil King used to make gas grills  in Dickson, TN. Prices for U.S.-produced steel that Broil King buys are  up by 40 percent since January, according to the trade publication  Steel Benchmark.   This is called shooting yourself in one foot. Now, here goes the  other foot.   Europe and Canada then responded to the U.S. tariffs on steel and  aluminum by imposing tariffs on U.S. products sold in Europe and  Canada, including gas grills.   Broil King exports about 60 percent of the grills the company makes  in Tennessee to Canada and Europe. Remember, they located their plant  here so they could do that.   The company told me last week that they are losing money on every  grill they sell in Europe because of the combination of steel and  aluminum tariffs and the response by Europe and Canada.   Broil King is also hurt by the March 2018 announcement that tariffs  would be imposed on $50 billion by the United States on Chinese goods  because the company buys some parts from China that it uses to make gas  grills in Tennessee.   Now, here is what is causing the owners of Broil King to wonder why  they ever decided to locate a plant in Dickson, TN, instead of China.  The new U.S. tariffs do not apply to barbecue gas grills made in China  that are already assembled, which means that every one of Broil King's  competitors in China can import their grills into the United States  without any tariff on it.   So here is the bottom line. These new tariffs make it difficult to  make a profit on gas grills made in Dickson, TN, and leave the U.S.  market wide open for gas grills made in China.   That is what happened to one small company that employs 300  Tennesseans and buys its steel and aluminum from U.S. suppliers when we  begin piling tariffs on top of tariffs with no end in sight. That is  what happens with a trade war.   That is why I like what the President said this morning to the  President of the European Commission. ``If we could have no tariffs and  no barriers and no subsidies,'' the President said, ``the United States  would be extremely pleased.'' So would workers in Tennessee. That would  be better for the 300 workers in Dickson, TN.   Here is another story. It is about Electrolux. I visited Springfield,  TN, outside Nashville, a few weeks ago. The mayor and the chamber of  commerce officials rushed up to me. The new tariffs on steel had been  announced, and the largest employer in Springfield--Electrolux, which  makes home supplies--had cancelled a $250 million expansion. Electrolux  buys all of its steel from U.S. suppliers, but, of course, when you  raise the price on imported steel, the price of U.S. steel also goes  up, and Electrolux concluded that it could not be competitive in the  U.S. market and with exports at the higher price.   Of course, it sounds good to say that putting a 10-percent tariff on  Chinese-made goods is good for us, but Electrolux also buys some  components made in China. Last week, the company said the latest U.S.  tariffs on Chinese-made goods would cost the company $10 million during  the second half of this year if the proposed 10 percent tariffs go into  effect after a comment period ending in late August. That is Electrolux  in Springfield, TN.   Now, if we were moving toward a policy of reciprocity--do for us what  we do for you--there would be zero tariffs, and the people of  Springfield would have a $250 million expansion and the jobs that come  with it instead of a 25-percent tax on the U.S. steel that Electrolux  buys.   Then there are the stories about the effects of steel and aluminum  tariffs on  [[Page S5369]]  tire companies. We have three big tire companies in Tennessee.  Bridgestone is one of them, with 1,700 employees. I will talk about it  for just a moment.   Bridgestone tires all have steel cords to make them stronger. None of  that steel is produced in the United States. All of it is imported. Now  all of it has a 25-percent tax. Who pays that? The American consumer.  The same must be true for every tire-making company.   Here is one more story. You have probably heard of Bush Brothers'  beans. They can one-third of all the beans in the United States. Their  plant is in Chestnut Hill, in the mountains of East Tennessee, near  where I live.   The cans are made of tin-plated steel that is mostly imported. There  is not enough produced in the United States. Bush Brothers & Company  estimates that the new tariff on steel will reduce its revenues and  raise prices by as much as 8 percent.   Even the workers in Chestnut Hill who can one-third of all of the  beans in the United States would benefit from a zero tariff policy such  as the one the President talked about today, instead of a trade war  that piles tariffs on top of tariffs.   We have many more stories. We have over 900 auto parts suppliers in  Tennessee. They are in 88 of our 95 counties. Almost all of them use  steel and aluminum. When the prices go up, revenues and profits go  down. That has an effect on 136,000 Tennesseans. Those are the people  who work in our automotive industry. That is one-third of our entire  manufacturing workforce.   Tariffs are taxes, pure and simple--taxes we pay. Existing tariffs on  steel and aluminum are bad enough, but nothing could do more damage to  Tennessee's auto industry than the proposed tariffs on imported  automobiles and automotive parts. Those, combined with already imposed  tariffs on steel and aluminum, will cost us jobs and lower our family  incomes.   I respectfully said to President Trump both publicly and privately  that he and the Republican Congress have accomplished an enormous  amount in 18 months. I am very proud of that. This booming economy is  something that benefits so many Americans. But I am afraid that if we  do not move quickly toward the President's announced long-term goal of  no tariffs and that if we continue to pile tariffs on top of tariffs,  we will take this economy in exactly the opposite direction and undo  much of the good the Republican President and the Republican Congress  have already done.   What would take us in the right direction is the goal of reciprocity  that the President talked about today. That is why, in the meantime,  until we shift gears into this long-term goal of no tariffs, no  subsidies, no barriers, and take steps toward it, Senator Jones and I  have developed this bill to make sure the President has all the facts  before he makes a decision on the proposed 25-percent tariff on  imported cars and parts. It simply requires the Commerce Department's  investigation to be delayed while we get more facts about the impact of  these tariffs on the automotive industry.   The President is right to focus on China. China steals our  intellectual property, and it imposes other trade barriers. But tariffs  on steel and aluminum and uncertainty surrounding the negotiation of  NAFTA threaten to destroy many more U.S. jobs than they might save.   We should remember the lessons of history. Presidents have tried this  before.   When I first came to the Senate, President George W. Bush imposed  steel tariffs. Within a year, he dropped the idea because the tariffs  destroyed more jobs in the automotive industry than existed in the  steel industry at that time, according to the Consuming Industries  Trade Action Coalition.   Let's look at today. Last year, the U.S. steel industry employed  about 139,000 Americans, according to the Congressional Research  Service. About 162,000 worked in the aluminum industry. That is around  300,000 Americans who work in the steel and aluminum industry. To put  this in perspective, the automotive industry employs 20 times that many  Americans--more than 7 million, according to the Auto Alliance, and  136,000 of those, as I have said, are Tennesseans.   There are only eight aluminum smelting plants operating in the United  States that employ Americans. They employ about 4,000. Seven of those  are actually producing. One is curtailed. Alcoa, which produces about  half the aluminum produced in the United States, doesn't even want the  tariffs. It makes me wonder, who does want the tariffs on aluminum?   The main reason those smelting plants--one of which is in my hometown  and my father worked at for 40 years--have closed has nothing to do  with trade. It is because aluminum plants need a lot of cheap  electricity to run through the bauxite ore to make aluminum ingots, and  they can't buy electricity that cheap in the United States. The 10- percent tariff already imposed on aluminum is not nearly enough to  offset the cost of electricity.   The reason I have been so outspoken about this is that no state is  more likely to be more damaged by tariffs on aluminum and steel and on  automobiles and auto parts than Tennessee. In many ways, over the last  40 years, we have become the Nation's No. 1 auto State, with our more  than 136,000 Tennesseans working in the automotive industry. There are  three big assembly plants--General Motors, Volkswagen, and Nissan--and  over 900 auto suppliers in 88 of our 95 counties. As Senator Jones  said, 35 years ago, we were the third poorest state and textile plants  were moving overseas. Things looked bleak for us. In came the auto  industry with better paying jobs, and our family incomes have been  going up ever since in almost every county. I don't want to see that  hurt. Tennesseans who work in the auto industry would benefit, as they  have under NAFTA, from zero tariffs instead of a trade war that piles  tariffs on top of tariffs.   In conclusion, the President has gotten the world's attention with  his tariffs. As a tactic, perhaps he is wise to do that. He had the  President of the European Commission in his office today, but what  should get more attention and what I hope gets more attention also from  the President is the solution he talked about again today. ``If we  could have no tariffs and no barriers and no subsidies,'' the President  said, ``the United States would be extremely pleased.'' That is the way  it should be. Let's move toward that goal as rapidly as we can. Piling  tariffs on top of tariffs with no end in sight is a trade war. It hurts  American workers.   The basis of the President's solution is reciprocity--a word he has  used many times--which means when it comes to trade, other countries  should do for the United States what we do for them. Taking steps in  that direction would be the right way to go.   In the meantime, the bill Senator Jones and I have introduced will  make certain that President Trump has before him all the facts--in  effect, a second opinion--before he makes a decision regarding the  proposed 25-percent tariffs on imported automobiles and automotive  parts.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Nelson):   S. 3272. A bill to authorize the President to provide assistance to  the Governments of Haiti and Armenia to reverse the effects of  deforestation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign  Relations.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for  his leadership and his remarks.   The President of the United States has got the world's attention with  his tariffs. He met today with the President of the European  Commission, but what should get more attention than  [[Page S5368]]  the tariffs is President Trump's solution for the tariffs: zero  tariffs, zero barriers--which, as the President said at the G7 summit  in June, is the way it should be.

The President is right to focus on China. China steals our  intellectual property, and it imposes other trade barriers. But tariffs  on steel and aluminum and uncertainty surrounding the negotiation of  NAFTA threaten to destroy many more U.S. jobs than they might save.   We should remember the lessons of history. Presidents have tried this  before.   When I first came to the Senate, President George W. Bush imposed  steel tariffs. Within a year, he dropped the idea because the tariffs  destroyed more jobs in the automotive industry than existed in the  steel industry at that time, according to the Consuming Industries  Trade Action Coalition.   Let's look at today. Last year, the U.S. steel industry employed  about 139,000 Americans, according to the Congressional Research  Service. About 162,000 worked in the aluminum industry. That is around  300,000 Americans who work in the steel and aluminum industry. To put  this in perspective, the automotive industry employs 20 times that many  Americans--more than 7 million, according to the Auto Alliance, and  136,000 of those, as I have said, are Tennesseans.   There are only eight aluminum smelting plants operating in the United  States that employ Americans. They employ about 4,000. Seven of those  are actually producing. One is curtailed. Alcoa, which produces about  half the aluminum produced in the United States, doesn't even want the  tariffs. It makes me wonder, who does want the tariffs on aluminum?   The main reason those smelting plants--one of which is in my hometown  and my father worked at for 40 years--have closed has nothing to do  with trade. It is because aluminum plants need a lot of cheap  electricity to run through the bauxite ore to make aluminum ingots, and  they can't buy electricity that cheap in the United States. The 10- percent tariff already imposed on aluminum is not nearly enough to  offset the cost of electricity.   The reason I have been so outspoken about this is that no state is  more likely to be more damaged by tariffs on aluminum and steel and on  automobiles and auto parts than Tennessee. In many ways, over the last  40 years, we have become the Nation's No. 1 auto State, with our more  than 136,000 Tennesseans working in the automotive industry. There are  three big assembly plants--General Motors, Volkswagen, and Nissan--and  over 900 auto suppliers in 88 of our 95 counties. As Senator Jones  said, 35 years ago, we were the third poorest state and textile plants  were moving overseas. Things looked bleak for us. In came the auto  industry with better paying jobs, and our family incomes have been  going up ever since in almost every county. I don't want to see that  hurt. Tennesseans who work in the auto industry would benefit, as they  have under NAFTA, from zero tariffs instead of a trade war that piles  tariffs on top of tariffs.   In conclusion, the President has gotten the world's attention with  his tariffs. As a tactic, perhaps he is wise to do that. He had the  President of the European Commission in his office today, but what  should get more attention and what I hope gets more attention also from  the President is the solution he talked about again today. ``If we  could have no tariffs and no barriers and no subsidies,'' the President  said, ``the United States would be extremely pleased.'' That is the way  it should be. Let's move toward that goal as rapidly as we can. Piling  tariffs on top of tariffs with no end in sight is a trade war. It hurts  American workers.   The basis of the President's solution is reciprocity--a word he has  used many times--which means when it comes to trade, other countries  should do for the United States what we do for them. Taking steps in  that direction would be the right way to go.   In the meantime, the bill Senator Jones and I have introduced will  make certain that President Trump has before him all the facts--in  effect, a second opinion--before he makes a decision regarding the  proposed 25-percent tariffs on imported automobiles and automotive  parts.                                  ______
