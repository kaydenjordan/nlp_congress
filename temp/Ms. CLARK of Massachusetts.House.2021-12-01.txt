 Madam Speaker, for almost 50 years, the  law has recognized that the decision of whether to have or not have an  abortion is protected by the Constitution. Yet, in the last decade,  State lawmakers have pushed through nearly 500 restrictive laws that  make abortion difficult and sometimes impossible to access. This fight  has reached a breaking point.   The Mississippi law being challenged at the Supreme Court today would  ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, well before viability. Anti- abortion policies are about power and control, control over our bodies  and control over our families. We won't stand for it. We will defend  our rights and freedom to access safe and legal abortion.   Keep your bans off our bodies. Keep out of our doctors' offices and  family decisions. Keep our constitutional rights in place.                            ____________________
