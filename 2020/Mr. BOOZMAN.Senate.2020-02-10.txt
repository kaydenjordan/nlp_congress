 Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to an  exceptional leader and member of the Senior Executive Service of the  Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Ms. Jacqueline  Wicecarver.   A native of Rector, AR, Jackie joined the Department of Defense in  1978 as a member of the U.S. Army Materiel Command in Rock Island, IL.  Within the next 10 years, Jackie and her family moved five times.  During this time, Jackie held a variety of positions within the  Department of Defense and received high praise in each position for her  exceptional level of professionalism, dedication to duty, and  outstanding contributions to the mission.   In 1990, Jackie joined the Department of Defense Office of Inspector  General as a staff auditor and rose through the ranks, joining the  Senior Executive Service as the Assistant Inspector General for  Acquisition and Contract Management in 2011. In January 2017, she was  selected to lead nearly 600 auditors and support personnel as the  Deputy Inspector General for Audit.   In her role as the Deputy Inspector General for Audit, Jackie has  provided guidance, counsel, and mentorship to many auditors as they  worked to complete more than 320 audit reports that identified over $7  billion in potential savings to the Department of Defense. Most  significantly, under Jackie's direction, the Office of Inspector  General completed two full financial statement audits of the Department  of Defense. These financial statement audits have been described as the  largest in history.   Jackie has been honored with the Department of Defense Inspector  General Medal for Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Meritorious  Civilian Service Award, and the President's Council on Integrity and  Efficiency Award.   Jackie has served her country for more than 40 years as a Department  of Defense civilian. On behalf of the Senate, I thank Jackie and her  family--her husband James of 50 years, their children Christopher and  Jennifer and four grandchildren, Caitlyn, Wade, Tate and Quinn--for  their continued commitment and sacrifice in service to our Nation. I  wish her future success as she transitions into retirement.  [[Page S960]]                                ____________________
