 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, as a liberated  Democrat to say that the moral movement for justice everywhere cannot  condone injustice anywhere. We cannot allow ourselves to be induced to  believe that there is a binary choice, that we must choose either peace  officers or peaceful protesters.   No, there is a righteous choice. And the righteous choice will cause  us to conclude that we must choose justice for the police just as we  choose justice for the protestors. Crimes committed against the police  must be punished and crimes committed by the police must be punished.   We are a Nation of laws, and if the law is to prevail, all criminals  must be punished. But not only must they be punished; they must be  punished expeditiously against those who commit crimes against people  just as we would have them be punished expeditiously against those who  commit crimes against the police. ``Injustice anywhere,'' as Dr. King  put it, ``is a threat to justice everywhere.''   Mr. Speaker, I stand and I rise as a liberated Democrat to say we  cannot condone crimes against the police nor can we condone crimes  committed by the police.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, Ms. Fudge,  [[Page H4404]]  for allowing me the time. I acknowledge Mr. Scott for the outstanding  work that he has done on this legislation, among many other pieces of  legislation.   I have an amendment that speaks for itself. This amendment deals with  the entry exams that fail the diversity test at many elite schools-- elite schools, by the way, that are funded with tax dollars that come  from poor communities, elite schools that can accept tax dollars but  cannot accept the students who are from communities that are affording  the schools the tax dollars.   The amendment reads: If applicable--meaning if you haven't done it  already--develop an implementation plan to replace entrance exams or  other competitive application procedures with methods of student  assignments to promote racial and socioeconomic diversity.   This amendment does deal with minorities, but it also deals with  other persons who happen to be disadvantaged. Mr. Speaker, that is  another way of saying poor White people. They, too, suffer from  disadvantages associated with the elite tests that can fail even some  of the best that come from schools that have little resources.   I believe that if this amendment is passed, this amendment is going  to encourage schools to do what John Lewis would call the right thing,  the just thing, the fair thing.   Mr. Speaker, I support the amendment and beg that my colleagues would  support it as well.
