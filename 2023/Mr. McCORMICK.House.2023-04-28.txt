 Mr. Speaker, I too have major concerns about this  nomination.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of President Biden's nominee  for Secretary of Labor, Julie Su. America's labor secretary should  defend both American workers and understand the economy which provides  jobs, feeds families, and keeps our communities strong.   Unfortunately, Ms. Su oversaw and distributed about $32.6 billion in  fraudulent unemployment claims paid out to death row inmates,  international criminal syndicates, and other fraudsters. She has tried  and failed to obscure this fact in front of the Senate Committee.   While she was doing this, Su also denied or delayed over 5 million  legitimate unemployment insurance claims. She was also an architect and  key enforcer in California law that effectively outlaws freelance work  in California, destroying the livelihoods of thousands of families.   Our Nation's 1099 employees are just as important to this country as  the liberal elite donors that are so set on destroying the American  working class.   The facts are clear, President Biden should pick someone else to be  his Labor Secretary.   I urge my colleagues in the United States Senate to stand with  America's workers, to stand for American prosperity, and stand for a  better nominee for the Department of Labor.
