 I just want to stress that if this--if what       we're talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is       impeachable. This is precisely the misconduct that the       Framers created a constitution, including impeachment, to       protect against.    Mr. Manager NADLER. All of the legal experts who testified before the  House Judiciary Committee--those invited by the Democrats and those  invited by the Republicans--all agreed that the conduct we have charged  constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors.   Professor Michael Gerhardt, the author of six books and the only  joint witness when the House considered President Clinton's case, put  it simply: ``If what we are talking about is not impeachable, then  nothing is impeachable.''   Professor Jonathan Turley, called by the Republicans as a witness,  agreed that the articles charge an offense that is impeachable. In his  written testimony, he stated: ``The use of military aid for a quid pro  quo to investigate one's political opponent, if proven, can be an  impeachable offense.''   Thus far, we have presented the core factual narrative. None of that  record can be seriously disputed, and none of it will be disputed.   We can predict what the President's lawyers will say in the next few  days. I urge you, Senators, to listen to it carefully. You will hear  accusations and name-calling. You will hear complaints about the  process in the House and the motives of the managers. You will hear  that this all comes down to a phone call that was perfect--as if you  had not just seen evidence of a months-long, government-wide effort to  extort a foreign government. But you will not hear a refutation of the  evidence. You will not hear testimony to refute the testimony you have  seen. Indeed, if the President had any exculpatory witnesses--even a  single one--he would be demanding their appearance here, instead of  urging you not to permit additional witnesses to testify.   Let me offer a preview of the path ahead. First, we will examine the  law of impeachable offenses, with a focus on abuse of power. That will  be the subject of my presentation. Then, my colleagues will apply the  law to the facts. They will demonstrate that the President has  unquestionably committed the high crimes and misdemeanors outlined in  the first Article of Impeachment.   Once those presentations are concluded, we will take the same  approach to demonstrating President Trump's obstruction of Congress-- the second Article of Impeachment. We will begin by stating the law.  Then we will review the facts, and then we will apply the law to the  facts, proving that President Trump is guilty of the second Article of  Impeachment as well.   With that roadmap to guide us, I will begin by walking through the  law of abuse of power. Here, I will start by defining the phrase in the  Constitution ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''   When the Framers selected this term, they meant it to capture, as  George Mason put it, all manner of ``great and dangerous offenses''  against the Nation. In contemporary terms, the Framers had three  specific offenses in mind: abuse of power, betrayal of the Nation  through foreign entanglements, and corruption of elections.   You can think of these as the ABCs of high crimes and misdemeanors:  abuse, betrayal, and corruption. The Framers believed that any one of  these offenses, standing alone, justified removal from office.   Professor Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School explained this well  before the House Judiciary Committee. Here is his explanation of why  the Framers created the impeachment power.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Professor FELDMAN. The Framers provided for the impeachment       of the President because they feared that the President might       abuse the power of his office for personal benefit, to       corrupt the electoral process and ensure his reelection, or       to subvert the national security of the United States.    Mr. Manager NADLER. That is the standard as described by Professor  Feldman. All three appear at once--abuse, betrayal, and corruption.  That is where we have the strongest possible case for removing a  President from office. Later on, we will apply this rule to the facts.  [[Page S489]]    Abuse: We will show that President Trump abused his power when he  used his office to solicit and pressure Ukraine to meddle in our  elections for his personal gain.   Betrayal: We will show that he betrayed vital national interests-- specifically, our national security--by withholding diplomatic support  and military aid from Ukraine, even as it faced armed Russian  aggression.   Corruption: President Trump's intent was to corrupt our elections to  his personal, political benefit. He put his personal interest in  retaining power above free and fair elections--and above the principle  that Americans must govern themselves, without interference from  abroad.   Article I thus charges a high crime and misdemeanor that blends abuse  of power, betrayal of the Nation, and corruption in elections into a  single unforgivable scheme. That is why this President must be removed  from office, especially before he continues his effort to corrupt our  next election.   The charges set forth in the first Article of Impeachment are firmly  grounded in the Constitution of the United States. Simply stated,  impeachment is the Constitution's final answer to a President who  mistakes himself for a King.   The Framers had risked their freedom, and their lives, to escape  monarchy. Together, they resolved to build a nation committed to  democracy and the rule of law--a beacon to the world at an age of  aristocracy. In the United States of America, ``We the people'' would  be sovereign. We would choose our leaders and hold them accountable for  how they exercised power on our behalf.   In writing our Constitution, the Framers recognized that we needed a  Chief Executive who could lead the Nation with efficiency, energy, and  dispatch. So they created a powerful Presidency and vested it with  immense public trust. But this solution created a different problem.   The Framers were not naive. They knew that power corrupts. They knew  that Republics cannot flourish--and that people cannot live free--under  a corrupt leader. They foresaw that a President faithful only to  himself would endanger every American. So the Framers built guardrails  to ensure that the American people would remain free and to ensure that  out-of-control Presidents would not destroy everything they sought to  build.   They imposed elections every 4 years to ensure accountability. They  banned the President from profiting off his office. They divided the  powers of the Federal Government across three branches. They required  the President to swear an oath to faithfully execute the laws.   To the Framers, the concept of faithful execution was profoundly  important. It prohibited the President from exercising power in bad  faith or with corrupt intent, and thus ensured that the President would  put the American people first, not himself.   A few Framers would have stopped there. This minority feared vesting  any branch of government with the power to remove a President from  office. They would have relied on elections alone to address rogue  Presidents. But that view was decisively rejected at the Constitutional  Convention.   Convening in the shadow of rebellion and revolution, the Framers  would not deny the Nation an escape from Presidents who deemed  themselves above the law. Instead, they adopted the power of  impeachment. In so doing, they offered a clear answer to George Mason's  question: ``Shall any man be above justice?'' As Mason himself  explained, ``some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is rendered  indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose, as well as by the  corrupt ability of the man chosen.''   Unlike in Britain, the President would answer personally--to Congress  and thus to the Nation--for any serious wrongdoing. But this decision  raised a question: What conduct would justify impeachment and removal?   As careful students of history, the Framers knew that threats to  democracy can take many forms. They feared would-be monarchs but also  warned against fake populists, charismatic demagogues, and corrupt  ``kleptocrats.''   In describing the kind of leader who might menace the Nation,  Alexander Hamilton offered an especially striking portrait. Mr. Schiff  read this portrait in his introductory remarks and it bears repetition.         When a man unprincipled in private life, desperate in his       fortune, bold in his temper . . . known to have scoffed in       private at the principles of liberty--when such a man is seen       to mount the hobby horse of popularity--to join in the cry of       danger to liberty--to take every opportunity of embarrassing       the General Government & bringing it under suspicion--to       flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of       the day--It may justly be suspected that his object is to       throw things into confusion that he may ride the storm and       direct the whirlwind.    Hamilton was a wise man. He foresaw dangers far ahead of his time.  Given the many threats they had to anticipate, the Framers considered  extremely broad grounds for removing Presidents. For example, they  debated setting the bar at maladministration, to allow removal for run- of-the-mill policy disagreements between Congress and the President.   They also considered very narrow grounds, strictly limiting  impeachment to treason and bribery. Ultimately, they struck a balance.   They did not want Presidents removed for ordinary political or policy  disagreements, but they intended impeachments to reach the full  spectrum of Presidential misconduct that might threaten the  Constitution, and they intended our Constitution to endure for the  ages. They adopted a standard that meant, as Mason put it, to capture  all manner of ``great and dangerous offenses'' incompatible with the  Constitution. This standard, borrowed from the British Parliament, was  ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''   In England, the standard was understood to capture offenses against  the constitutional system itself. That is confirmed by the use of the  word ``high,'' as well as by parliamentary practice.   From 1376 to 1787, the House of Commons impeached officials on a few  general grounds--mainly consisting of abuse of power, betrayal of  national security and foreign policy, corruption, treason, bribery, and  disregarding the powers of Parliament.   The phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' thus covered offenses  against the Nation itself--in other words, crimes against the British  Constitution.   As scholars were shown, the same understanding prevailed on this side  of the Atlantic. In the colonial period and under newly ratified State  constitutions, most impeachments targeted abuse of power, betrayal of  the revolutionary cause, corruption, treason, and bribery. These  experiences were well-known to the Framers of the Constitution.   History thus teaches that ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' referred  mainly to acts committed by officials using their power or privileges,  that inflicted grave harm on society. Such great and dangerous offenses  included treason, bribery, abuse of power, betrayal of the Nation, and  corruption of office. And they were unified by a clear theme.   Officials who abused, abandoned, or sought to benefit personally from  their public trust--and who threatened the rule of law if left in  power--faced impeachment and removal. Abuse, betrayal, corruption--this  is exactly the understanding that the Framers incorporated into the  Constitution.   As Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson wisely observed, ``the  purpose of the Constitution was not only to grant power, but to keep it  from getting out of hand.''   Nowhere is that truer than in Presidency. As the Framers created a  formidable Chief Executive, they made clear that impeachment is  justified for serious abuse of power.   James Madison stated that impeachment is necessary because the  President ``might pervert his administration into a scheme of . . .  oppression.''   Hamilton set the standard for removal at an ``abuse or violation of  some public trust.''   And in Massachusetts, Rev. Samuel Stillman asked: ``With such a  prospect [of impeachment], will dare to abuse the powers vested in him  by the people?''   Time and again, Americans who wrote and ratified the Constitution  confirmed that Presidents may be impeached for abusing the power  entrusted to them.  [[Page S490]]    To the Framers' generation, moreover, abuse of power was a well- understood offense. It took two basic forms. The first occurred when  someone exercised power in ways far beyond what the law allowed--or in  ways that destroyed checks on their own authority.   The second occurred when an official exercised power to obtain an  improper personal benefit, while ignoring or injuring the national  interest. In other words, the President may commit an impeachable abuse  of power in two different ways: by engaging in clearly forbidden acts  or by taking actions that are allowed but for reasons that are not  allowed--for instance, to obtain corrupt, private benefits.   Let me unpack that idea, starting with the first category: conduct  clearly inconsistent with the law, including the law of checks and  balances. The generation that rebelled against George III knew what  absolute power looked like. It was no abstraction to them. They had a  different idea in mind when they organized our government. Most  significantly, they placed the President under the law, not above it.  That means the President may exercise only the powers vested in him by  the Constitution. He must also respect the legal limits on the exercise  of those powers.   A President who egregiously refuses to follow these restrictions, by  engaging in wrongful conduct, may be subjected to impeachment for abuse  of power. Two American impeachment inquiries have involved claims that  a President grossly violated the Constitution's separation of powers.   The first was in 1868, when the House impeached President Andrew  Johnson, who had succeeded Abraham Lincoln after his assassination at  Ford's Theatre.   In firing the Secretary of War, President Johnson allegedly violated  the Tenure of Office Act, which restricted the President's power to  remove Cabinet members during the term of the President who had  appointed them.   The House of Representatives approved articles charging it with  conduct forbidden by law. That is an action that is an abuse of power  on its face. Ultimately, the Senate acquitted President Johnson by one  vote. This was partly because there was a strong argument that the  Tenure of Office Act, which President Johnson was charged with  violating, was itself unconstitutional--a position the Supreme Court  later accepted. Of course, historians have also noted that a key  Senator appears to have changed his vote at the last minute in exchange  for promises of special treatment by President Johnson. So perhaps that  acquittal means a little less than meets the eye.    In any event, just over 100 years later, the House Judiciary  Committee accused the second Chief Executive of abusing his power in a  manner egregiously inconsistent with the law. The committee charged  President Nixon with obstruction of Congress based on his meritless  assertion of executive privilege to cover up key White House tape  recordings.   We will have more to say about the obstruction charge in a moment.   But the Nixon case also exemplifies the second way a President can  abuse his power. President Nixon faced two more Articles of  Impeachment. Both of these articles charged him with abusing the powers  of his office with corrupt intent. One focused on his abuse of power to  obstruct law enforcement. The other targeted his abuse of power to  target political opponents. Each article enumerated specific abuses by  President Nixon, many of which involved the wrongful, corrupt exercise  of Presidential power and many of which were likely not statutory  crimes.   In explaining its second article, the House Judiciary Committee  stated that President Nixon's conduct was ``undertaken for his personal  political advantage and not in furtherance of any valid national policy  objective.''   That should sound familiar to everyone here. It reflects the standard  I have already articulated: the exercise of official power to corruptly  obtain a personal benefit while ignoring or injuring the national  interest.   To be sure, all Presidents account to some extent for how their  decisions in office may affect their political prospects. The  Constitution does not forbid that. Elected officials can and should  care about how voters will react to their decisions. They will often  care about whether their decisions make it more likely that they will  be reelected. But there is a difference--a difference that matters-- between political calculus and outright corruption.   Some uses of Presidential power are so outrageous, so obviously  improper, that if they are undertaken for a President's own personal  gain, with injury or indifference to core national interests, then they  are obviously high crimes and misdemeanors. Otherwise, even the most  egregious wrongdoing could be justified as disagreement over policy or  politics, and corruption that would have shocked the Framers--that they  expressly sought to prohibit--would overcome the protections they  established for our benefit.   There should be nothing surprising about impeaching a President for  using his power with corrupt motives. The House and Senate have  confirmed this point in prior impeachments. More important, the  Constitution itself says that we can do so.   To start, the Constitution requires that the President ``faithfully  execute'' the law. A President who acts with corrupt motives, putting  himself above country, has acted faithlessly, not faithfully executing  the law.   Moreover, the two impeachable offenses that the Constitution  enumerates--Treason and Bribery--each require proof of the President's  mental state. For treason, he must have acted with a ``disloyal mind,''  according to the Supreme Court. And it is well established that the  elements of bribery include corrupt motives.   In sum, to the Framers, it was dangerous for officials to exceed  their constitutional power. But it was equally dangerous--perhaps more  so--for officials to use their power with corrupt, nefarious motives,  thus perverting public trust for private gain.   Abuse of power is clearly an impeachable offense under the  Constitution. To be honest, this should not be a controversial  statement. I find it amazing that the President rejects it. Yet he  does. He insists there is no such thing as impeachable abuse of power.  This position is dead wrong. All prior impeachments considered of high  office have always included abuse of power. All of the experts who  testified before the House Judiciary Committee, including those called  by the Republicans, agreed that abuse of power is a high crime and  misdemeanor.   Here is testimony from Professor Pam Karlan of Stanford Law School,  joined by Professor Gerhardt.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Yes, sir.    Mr. Manager NADLER. Professor Turley, who testified at the Republican  invitation, echoed that view. In fact, he not only agreed, but he  ``stressed'' that ``it is possible to establish a case for impeachment  based on a non-criminal allegation of abuse of power.''   Professor Turley is hardly the only legal expert to take that view.  Another who comes to mind is Professor Allen Dershowitz--at least Alan  Dershowitz in 1998. Back then, here is what he had to say about  impeachment for abuse of power.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          No. It plainly does not. Everything we know       about the history of impeachment reinforces the conclusion       that impeachable offenses do not have to be crimes. And,       again, not all crimes are impeachable offenses. We look,       again, at the context of the gravity of the misconduct.    Mr. Manager NADLER. This position was echoed by the Republicans'  expert witness, Professor Turley, in his written testimony.   There, he stated: ``It is possible to establish a case for  impeachment based on a non-criminal allegation of abuse of power.''   He also stated: ``It is clear that high Crimes and Misdemeanors can  encompass non-criminal conduct.''   More recently, Professor Turley--again, the Republican witness at our  hearing--wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post entitled ``Where  the Trump defense goes too far.'' In this piece, he stated that the  President's argument ``is as politically unwise as it is  constitutionally shortsighted.'' He added: ``If successful, it would  also come at a considerable cost for the Constitution.'' Although I  disagree with Professor Turley on many, many issues, here, he is  clearly right.   I might say the same thing of then-House Manager Lindsey Graham, who,  in President Clinton's trial, flatly rejected the notion that  impeachable offenses are limited to violations of established law.   This is what he said:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
