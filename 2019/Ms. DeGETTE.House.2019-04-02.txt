 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. DeSaulnier for  yielding to me. I also want to thank him and my colleague, Mr.  Cicilline, for sponsoring this important piece of legislation.   This really is a very concerning trend that is taking place in our  society as more and more local news organizations in our communities  are shutting down or becoming nonexistent. Maintaining a truly free and  independent press is vital to our democracy.   I guess he is our favorite Founder tonight, Thomas Jefferson, also  said: ``Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a  government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I  should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.''                                time  1800    We, as a society, rely on members of the press to be our watchdogs,  to sound the alarms and hold our government leaders accountable when  necessary.   According to a study from the University of North Carolina, over the  last 15 years, the newspaper industry has seen over 1,800 mergers or  closures of print newspapers.   That is a staggering 20 percent of all newspapers in the country that  have now closed since 2004.   In my home State of Colorado, we have three counties--Costilla, Baca,  and Cheyenne--that have no daily or weekly papers at all.   And, in my hometown of Denver, where we have seen explosive  population growth, we now only have one daily newspaper, The Denver  Post. Our other newspaper, the Rocky Mountain News, published its last  issue in 2009, 2 months shy of what would have been its 150th  anniversary.  [[Page H2982]]    While it may have outlived the competition and it now serves as our  city's only remaining daily paper, The Denver Post, too, has faced its  share of hardships in recent years.   In 2013, The Post had over 250 employees, but today the number is  less than 100. On April 8, 2018, in response to another round of  devastating layoffs at the paper, The Denver Post's own editorial board  published an op-ed entitled ``As Vultures Circle, The Denver Post Must  Be Saved.''   In that op-ed, the editorial board wrote: ``The smart money is that  in a few years The Denver Post will be rotting bones. And a major city  in an important political region will find itself without a  newspaper.''   These are not my words. These are The Denver Post's own employee's  words. The massive decline in the number of reporters covering our  local communities is not happening just in Denver. It is happening all  over the country, and it is threatening to have real, tangible impacts  on our communities.   Now, we heard Congresswoman Lofgren question how we are going to get  coverage of local government in our newspapers.   At The Denver Post, one of the layoffs they had was their one  employee who covered Congress. So we are not only now not having  coverage on local governments, but also of the U.S. House of  Representatives.   Nationwide, the number of full-time reporters covering our State  legislatures is down 35 percent from 2003.   And, while the reporters who remain continue as an invaluable service  to our communities, frankly, they can't do it all, and, as a result,  certain stories absolutely go unreported.   A joint study by the University of Notre Dame and the University of  Illinois at Chicago found a connection between local newspaper closures  and increased interest rates on local bonds. In fact, the study found  that the closure of a local newspaper results in local taxpayers paying  an extra $650,000 in interest per loan.   That is $650,000 in local taxpayer dollars that could otherwise go to  schools, police, firefighters, potholes, or any other of a host of  local needs, all lost simply because they didn't have local newspapers  watching out on local government.   We often talk in Congress about the fox guarding the henhouse, but in  too many small and rural communities there is no one guarding at all.   At the end of the day, for the sake of our democracy, we need local  newspapers. We need local reporters. We need our watchdogs doing what  they do best. We need to find ways to protect local news outlets and  help them thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. DeSaulnier for highlighting this  pressing issue affecting our communities and for having us here to  discuss this tonight.
