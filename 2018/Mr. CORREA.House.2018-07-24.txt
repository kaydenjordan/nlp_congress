 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to say I represent the  Golden State of California, and I am proud to say that California was  the first State in the Union to implement, to accept the Affordable  Care Act a number of years ago, and when we did so, we knew it was a  work in progress. After all, Medicare continues to be a work in  progress after 60 years. One of those areas we knew we had to change  was the medical device tax.   In California, there are over 1,000 medical technology companies,  many of which are small to medium, that employ more than 70,000  Californians. Many of those live and work in my district, and these are  good-paying middle class jobs.   The research and development of groundbreaking medical technology  helps improve patient care and treatments not only for Americans, but  for folks throughout the world.   In recognition of the medical tax device's negative impact on  innovation and investment, Congress delayed its implementation on two  separate occasions. Unfortunately, the temporary suspension of this tax  is scheduled to expire at the end of this year. If reinstated, this tax  will impede future investments and domestic innovation and restrain  hiring and job growth.   Since research and development in this area of technology takes a  number of years, the uncertainty about the future of this tax will  delay essential research and development and growth in many areas of  the State of California. That is why repealing the medical tax device  permanently will encourage economic growth and hiring in Orange County  and in my area.   The medical device industry represents jobs not only for the next  generation, but for the next 20 to 30 years in this country. Mr.  Speaker, therefore, I urge passage of H.R. 184.
