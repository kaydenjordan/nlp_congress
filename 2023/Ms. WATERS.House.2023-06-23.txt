 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3564, the MAGA housing scam act,  which follows the blueprint of the GOP tax scam by helping the wealthy  at the expense of the middle class.   Homeownership is a quintessential part of the American Dream, and it  is the single most important way that households today can build  wealth. That is why expanding access to homeownership is one of the  best ways that we can grow the middle class.   Unfortunately, the dream of homeownership is becoming further out of  reach for a growing number of households due to a worsening storm of  rising interest rates and home prices, fueled by an undersupply of new  housing.   In fact, house prices have skyrocketed by 40 percent since 2020, and  first-time homeownership rates have plummeted to an all-time low.    Moreover, housing costs are a primary driver of inflation, which is  hurting every household in America. It is against this backdrop that  Republicans are actually working to make homeownership more expensive  for everyone, especially the middle class.   The MAGA housing scam act would affect two different types of fees  that apply to mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which  make up the vast majority of mortgages today.   First, this bill would extend a guarantee fee of 10 basis points for  another year, costing all future home buyers an additional $5 billion.   Second, this bill would reverse recent changes to loan level price  adjustments, better known as LLPAs, which are another type of fee on  mortgages backed by Fannie and Freddie. The amount of this fee is risk- based, meaning that it varies depending on characteristics of the  borrower and loan, such as income and downpayment; whether the loan has  a fixed or a variable rate of interest; and whether the loan is a cash- out refinance.   FHFA, which is the agency that regulates Fannie and Freddie, is  responsible for determining the amount of the LLPAs and recently made  changes to this fee to help middle-class borrowers.   To illustrate, a middle-class borrower, say, with excellent credit,  who makes maybe a 5 percent downpayment on a median-priced home would  have their LLPA reduced by nearly half under FHFA's changes.   This bill would reverse the recent changes made by FHFA, resulting in  higher fees for middle-class borrowers. Again, the LLPAs, are only one  of two fees affected by this bill. Altogether, this bill would hit  middle-class borrowers with a double whammy of both an extension of a  10-basis point guarantee fee, and an increase in the LLPAs.   During the debate in the Rules Committee on this bill, I pointed out  how this bill hurts middle-class borrowers who have worked hard to  build excellent credit but can't afford a 20 percent downpayment.   Republicans doubled down, insisting that those with lower  downpayments are riskier borrowers and deserve to pay more. What they  failed to understand is that middle-class borrowers who can't afford a  20 percent downpayment are already required to purchase private  mortgage insurance, which can add hundreds of dollars to a borrower's  monthly mortgage cost. Private mortgage insurance protects Fannie and  Freddie from the risks associated with the lower downpayment.                                time  0930    Charging a higher LLPA for risks that are already covered by an  insurance policy is simply unfair.   During the Rules Committee debate, Republicans called FHFA's changes  redistributive. Let's be clear: FHFA made changes to ensure that  middle-class home buyers are not unfairly charged more for risks that  are already covered by private mortgage insurance.   This is hardly redistribution. It is ensuring that middle-class  borrowers have a fair shot at homeownership. Mr. Davidson's bill, on  the other hand, would absolutely redistribute costs from the middle  class to the wealthy.   Let me break this down for the Record.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined that this bill  would cost $1.8 billion before the addition of the manager's amendment.  That represents $1.8 billion in fees that otherwise would have  primarily affected the wealthiest home buyers who could barely notice  such a nominal fee increase.   In order to pay for this cost, Republicans added a 10-basis point  guarantee fee that would increase costs for all home buyers to the tune  of $5 billion.   Mr. Chairman, for all these reasons and more, I urge my colleagues to  oppose H.R. 3564, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Cleaver).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, before I delve into additional remarks, the  Congressional Budget Office deemed this bill to cost $1.8 billion. Why  then would Mr. Davidson, with his amendments, create more money than  even the Congressional Budget Office said his bill would cost?   He has raised it $5 billion more. Who pays for that? I don't care how  you put it. Whether it is paid for tomorrow, next month, next year, 10  years from now, who pays for that? The home buyers pay for that and  that must be noted.   The bill is increased by $5 billion by Mr. Davidson, even more than  the Congressional Budget Office said the bill would cost at $1.8  billion. Why would he do that? Why would he charge home buyers more  money than even the Congressional Budget Office said the bill would  cost?   Accordingly, I will explain further. Currently, middle-class  borrowers who cannot make a 20 percent downpayment are charged higher  LLPAs and must purchase private mortgage insurance.   I am going to say it again. If you are paying less than 20 percent,  you have to get private mortgage insurance to  [[Page H3118]]  cover the risks that may be posed to the enterprises.   This is an unfair double charge on middle-class borrowers for the  same risks. Don't forget, they have paid their g-fees. Everybody has to  pay the g-fees to help write the undercosts of the operation of FHFA.  They pay those, and it is determined on each individual loan. It  depends on the characteristics of that loan.   You build in the question of risk in those fees and then you pay  private mortgage insurance, which means the middle-class borrowers are  paying more than the wealthy borrowers.                                time  0945    In fact, borrowers with PMI also have excellent credit, with median  FICO scores of 754 as of December 2020, and are more likely to be  first-time home buyers. They also pose less loss severity to the  enterprises than borrowers who have the means to make a downpayment of  20 percent or more.   FHFA's mortgage pricing changes that reduce this unfair double charge  on borrowers with PMI is a critical step to making the dream of  homeownership attainable for the middle class in America.   I oppose this bill, and I oppose my Republican colleague, who is part  of the message going out from FOX News.   I oppose this bill because, first of all, the $5 billion is an  increase. The Republicans are forever saying that they are trying to  cut budgets. They don't want to increase the amount of taxes. Yet, here  he is increasing the amount that he claims he is charging homeowners,  when even the Congressional Budget Office says it costs $1.8 billion,  and now, he is asking for $5 billion. Well, I don't quite understand  that, and nobody else should understand that. It is not needed.   Again, they keep talking about credit scores. These middle-class  homeowners, who could not afford to pay maybe 20 percent down, have  good credit scores, equal credit scores to the wealthy home buyers. I  don't get why he keeps talking about these credit scores.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I will take a minute to say that the representation that  middle-class home buyers who may not have 20 percent down also have bad  credit is not true. The record should reflect that that is not true.  That is made up by someone who would like to throw credit scores into  this argument and argue that these middle-class buyers, who can't pay  20 percent down, all have bad credit. They do not. They have good  credit, and they are eligible for a loan. The only thing they don't  have is 20 percent down, and they get mortgage insurance in order to  cover that.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Cleaver).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, the MAGA housing scam act would reverse critical cost  savings for middle-class borrowers as provided by FHFA.   Before FHFA's May 1 changes, a middle-class borrower with a high  credit score and a 5 percent downpayment on a medium-priced home would  have paid an LLPA fee of $81 in addition to private mortgage insurance.  Today, this borrower would pay half of that fee, allowing them to  access affordable homeownership.   Similarly, a borrower with the same credit score and a 40 percent  downpayment on the same priced home would have paid only $27 before May  1 and today pays just $20. These are cost savings that Republicans not  only want to eliminate but now they want to add an additional $5  billion in fees for everyone.   This is a scam, not a protection for the middle class. This is  messaging by FOX News.   What is that $5 billion for? Why is it that Mr. Davidson is wanting  to raise more money than even the Congressional Budget Office says the  bill costs? This is not to be understood.   I know that there is an attempt to try to make the argument that  somebody wealthier is paying for those who have less income, less  money, less resources. It is not true.   Don't eliminate private mortgage insurance. If you pay less than 20  percent, you pay for private mortgage insurance in addition to the GSE  fees. Middle-class borrowers were paying more than even the wealthier  borrowers, so it had nothing to do with the credit score because the  credit score of that home buyer who only paid less than 20 percent is  as good as the credit score of the wealthier buyer. It had nothing to  do with that at all.   Again, I don't know why this argument is being made by the other  side. It is an attempt, I think, to message in a way that goes directly  to constituents who they make angrier because their government is  making them do something they should not be making them do.   Don't politicize this. This is about homeownership. This is about the  American Dream. This is about making sure that those people who can  afford to buy a home are able to do so.   The idea that anybody would say that, if you can't make a 20 percent  downpayment but can pay for private mortgage insurance, you must not  have good credit scores, that is an absolute untruth. As a matter of  fact, you would not be able to get that loan if you had bad credit  scores.   I wish the opposition would stop making that argument because it does  not fly. That person who is paying, again, private mortgage insurance  also has a good credit score. They didn't have the 20 percent down, but  they are paying for it with their private mortgage insurance.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1000     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose H.R. 3564, which harms middle-class home  buyers and their ability to access homeownership on fair and affordable  terms.   This bill responds to a misinformation campaign, again initiated by a  friend of the Republicans, FOX News, and propagated by extreme MAGA  Republicans. It protects wealthy home buyers and imposes billions in  new fees on all home buyers.   Mr. Chair, I also oppose this bill because it completely ignores our  Nation's worsening housing crisis, which is locking millions out of the  dream of homeownership. MAGA Republicans are instead focused on a  minuscule fee in the home-buying process that does nothing to address  our Nation's housing shortage and rising housing costs that are driving  inflation.   We have a shortage of 14 million homes nationwide and more than  582,500 people experiencing homelessness on any given night, with  homelessness rising faster in rural communities than anywhere else in  the country. Meanwhile, U.S. renters are paying more of their income on  rent today than ever before. These are the real problems that  Republicans should be working to solve, not increasing fees by billions  of dollars according to the CBO.   In fact, this bill is opposed by Americans for Financial Reform,  Center for Responsible Lending, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the  National Housing Law Project, and the National Housing Resource Center.  Industry groups such as the Mortgage Bankers Association and the  National Association of Realtors are also very concerned about this.   Republicans are forever worried about the fact that we are not making  enough cuts. Yet, in the negotiations that just occurred on raising the  debt limit, they wanted to cut, cut, cut, cut. They are not only  jeopardizing middle-class homeowners, but they are increasing the  amount of money--more than even needed--than the Congressional Budget  Office has said the bill would cost.   Why $5 billion? I don't get it. I don't understand, but I am through  with it.   Mr. Chair, I simply ask for a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Well, actually, I don't even want to waste another minute on this  pointless and redundant amendment.   Anyone who pays attention to government oversight knows that the GAO  already makes all of its reports resulting from legislative mandates  publicly available on the GAO's website as soon as they are issued to  Congress.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters: one from Americans  for Financial Reform and one from Public Citizen.                                 Americans for Financial Reform,                                                       May 23, 2023.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Chairman, House Committee on Financial Service, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McHenry and Ranking Member Waters: We are       writing to express our opposition to H.R. 3564 ``Middle Class       Borrower Protection Act of 2023.'' The bill's title is ironic       because it would, in fact, make mortgages more expensive for       many middle-class American families.        Record housing prices have put homeownership increasingly       out of reach for my Americans. The US median home sales price       is $436,800 as of the first quarter of 2023. That's a 32       percent increase from 2020, when the median was $329,000.       However, Americans have not become 32 percent richer in the       last three years. Rather, inflation, rising demand, and the       increasing amount of homes owned by private equity and Wall       Street firms have all contributed to these price increases.       Meanwhile, rising rents make it increasingly difficult for       first-time home buyers to save for a down payment. To afford       a 20 percent down payment on a $436,800 home, a homebuyer       would need $87,360 for the down payment, a sum that many       middle-income American families simply do not have.        Given these trends, the FHFA should be commended for making       mortgages more affordable for first-time homebuyers,       borrowers participating in the Enterprises' affordable       mortgage programs, and creditworthy borrowers who lack a 20       percent down payment. These borrowers will see reduced or       eliminated loan level price adjustment fees. The FHFA will       also increase loan level price adjustment fees for vacation       home and investment property mortgages, cash-out refinances,       and large loan amounts. Taken together, these actions       demonstrate an important first step towards a more equitable       mortgage pricing framework that supports middle class       homebuyers over investors and second-home owners.        We oppose H.R. 3564 because it would rescind the FHFA's       more equitable pricing framework and instead require the FHFA       to increase fees for many first-time home buyers and those       who do not have a 20 percent down payment. It would require       the FHFA to impose a risk-based pricing model, one that would       ultimately benefit housing investors and vacation home owners       while making homeownership more difficult for middle class       Americans.        H.R. 3564 will disproportionately harm homebuyers of color.       Because of our history of racial discrimination, a large       racial wealth gap persists that makes it less likely that a       homebuyer of color will be able to pay for a 20 percent down       payment through their personal savings, assistance from their       families, or inheritance.        Opponents of the FHFA's pricing matrix have spread       significant misinformation about its impacts on mortgage       pricing. To be clear: under the new framework, borrowers with       good credit and higher down payments will continue to pay       lower mortgage costs than borrowers with good credit and       lower down payments, because these borrowers will still be       required to pay for monthly mortgage insurance until they       reach 20 percent equity.        Optimally, Americans for Financial Reform believes the       loan-level price adjustment fees should be eliminated       altogether because this will increase pricing transparency       and make homeownership more affordable. These fees are       unnecessary from a risk-mitigation perspective because Fannie       Mae and Freddie Mac already have charge guarantee fees to       cover the credit risk of acquiring single-family loans from       lenders. However, the changes recently made by FHFA are a       step in the right direction of mitigating the adverse effects       of the adjustment fees, which is why we support FHFA's       actions. H.R. 3564 would move us in the wrong direction by       further entrenching the loan-level price adjustment fee       flawed framework and making it even more inequitable.        At a time when more and more Americans are struggling with       the cost of housing, it defies comprehension that Congress       would seek to increase fees for middle class homebuyers. For       these reasons, we urge you to oppose this legislation.            Sincerely,      Americans for Financial Reform.                                   ____                                                Public Citizen 50,                                                        May 22, 2023      Chair Patrick McHenry,      Ranking Member Maxine Waters,      Hon. Members of the Committee,      House Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chair McHenry, Ranking Member Waters and Members of       the Committee: On behalf of more than 500,000 members and       supporters of Public Citizen, we offer the following comment       on legislation slated for a vote May 24, 2023, before the       House Financial Services Committee. We address these bills in       three parts. The first part involves a cluster of capital       formation bills. The second part is a bill with multiple       titles that purports to respond to the recent bank failures.       The third part is a housing bill.                             1. Capital Formation         The first cluster of bills involves capital formation.       Average investors enjoy an ample range of opportunities for       savings and wealth creation, and one of the most approachable       is the public securities markets. There are thousands of       public companies that offer stocks and bonds. Each of these       public companies provide detailed disclosures on an annual       (10k) or quarterly (10Q) basis, and sometimes more frequently       (8k) following a major event that could affect the stock       price. These documents are reviewed by the Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC) after they are subject to an       independent audit. Most of these documents are studied by       Wall Street analysts who publish critical information that an       ordinary reader might miss. Investors may also choose a       mutual fund, where experts select a portfolio of stocks,       usually involving a certain risk appetite, or sector. Or,       given that stock-picking can be difficult for even the most       seasoned professional, investors may essentially choose       ``all'' stocks through an index fund. Again, these       investments are subject to rigorous registration and       disclosure, with non-complying brokers subject to fines and       expulsion from the industry for shoddy sales practices.        Then there are investment opportunities that fail to meet       these standards. That's often because the underlying business       is untested, or perhaps even shady. Sophisticated investors       know to avoid them. But Wall  [[Page H3122]]       Street salesmen want to earn commissions, and even selling       such eschewed junk can generate those commissions. What       prevents them are safeguards that Congress and the SEC have       erected to deter the unscrupulous from pawning off the odious       to unsuspecting victims.        The following cluster of bills are part of a years-long       effort by Republican and some Democratic enablers to strip       away some of those safeguards.      The Increasing Investor Opportunities Act        This misleadingly titled bill would expose investors to       greater risk by increasing the limit that a closed-end fund       can invest in a private fund, which are subject to less       regulation and disclosure. Currently, the SEC caps the amount       that closed-end funds can invest in private funds at 15       percent of net assets, if the closed-end fund is sold to non-      accredited investors, who are investors with lower income and       total wealth. If a closed-end fund has more than 15 percent       of net assets in private funds, it must sell that fund only       to accredited investors. This bill would allow closed-end       funds to invest 100 percent of their net assets in private       funds and still be sold to non-accredited investors. Many       private funds are simply bad products that sophisticated       investors have avoided. This bill would allow them to be       sloughed off on those with less investment experience and       less income and savings to lose. We oppose this bill.      The Retirement Fairness for Charities and Educational           Institutions Act of 2023        This bill claims to level the playing field between 401(k)       plans and 403(b) plans so that both accounts can invest in       collective investment trusts (CITs). However, the bill would       gut securities laws and allow securities salespeople to sell       other, far riskier investments, to 403(b) plans. A 403(b)       plan is one that is available to public school organizations.        Securities laws require that mutual funds and variable       annuities that are sold to 403(b) plans must be registered       with the SEC. Registration requires the disclosure of basic       information such as risks and costs. The SEC reviews this for       accuracy. This helps investors avoid products that are unfit       for a risk-averse portfolio.        This bill would allow unregistered variable annuities and       other pooled investment vehicles to be sold to these public-      school teachers. The bill does this by amending the       Investment Company Act and the Securities Act. This would end       the disclosures about risks and costs. We believe this bill       is a craven effort to expose hard-working public-sector       workers to investment vehicles that can't be sold to people       paying attention to important details. We oppose this bill.      The Access to Small Business Investor Capital Act        This bill would allow business development companies (BDCs)       to obscure critical information such as acquisition costs and       other expenses (acquired fund fees and expenses, or AFFEs).       Instead of highlighting them, sales documents could bury this       information in a footnote to the fee table. This will be       confusing if not misleading. We oppose this bill.      The Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act        This bill would allow firms to promote risky investments at       various forums such as social clubs or college events without       providing basic disclosures regarding the securities. The       bill also prevents the SEC from offering any restrictions on       these quasi sales events. We oppose this bill.      A bill to except quotations of Rule 144A fixed-income           securities from certain regulatory requirements        This bill would end the prohibition on publishing certain       riskier securities (governed under Rule 144Af and Rule 15c2-      1) from using a quotation medium other than a national       securities exchange (such as over-the-counter securities).       The SEC did provide an exemption from this prohibition, but       it was time limited. This would make the exemption permanent.       We opposed the original exemption, and we oppose making it       permanent and therefore we oppose this bill.                     2. Response to Recent Bank Failures         The next bill is an amalgam of irrelevant, wrongheaded       responses to the recent failure of three large regional       banks. This legislation masks the Republican (and wayward       Democratic) sponsorship of a major deregulation effort       approved in 2018 known as S. 2155. S. 2155 led to the       failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. S. 2155       increased from $50 billion to $250 billion the size of bank       that would face ``enhanced supervision'' (as provided under       Title I, Section 165 of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act). Enhanced supervision includes       regular, frequent stress tests. Tellingly, Silicon Valley       Bank (SVB) promptly grew from just under $50 billion in       assets before approval of President Trump's S. 2155, to $211       billion by the end of 2022. It was not due for another stress       test until 2024. When the Federal Reserve raised interest       rates precipitously and after persistent, vocal warning to       markets, SVB's lazy strategy of holding copious long term,       low interest baring Treasury securities proved fatal. It       collapsed March 10, 2023, a billboard for the disastrous       deregulatory policy of S. 2155. Rather than acknowledge       accountability, Republicans have projected their culpability       by complaining that regulators failed; some even blame       ``woke'' capitalism, as SVB devoted some attention to       diversity and inclusion.      The Increasing Financial Regulatory Accountability and           Transparency Act        Title I of this bill would complicate the FDIC's resolution       process for failing banks by requiring new and extensive       analyses of the systemic risk exception. While we believe       this exception should be used with great caution, the bar is       currently high: at least two-thirds of the board members of       the FDIC and Federal Reserve must support it, and it must be       signed by the Treasury Secretary who must consult with the       President. We oppose this title.        Title II would revise the Fed's emergency lending authority       with several limitations that would slow down the ability to       deploy stabilization tools. There are already a number of       limits, the recent failure of three large banks does not make       a case for such additional limitations. Instead, Congress       should amend the statute (12 USC 1828 13c) that includes an       exception to a bank controlling more than 10 percent of the       nation's deposits (as JP Morgan does) acquiring another bank,       namely if that bank is failing. The statute should authorize       the FDIC to accept a second-best bid if from a bank with less       than 10 percent of deposits. In its current form, we do not       support Title II.        Title III would add another voting member to the Financial       Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and eliminate FSOC's       Climate-related Financial Risk Advisory Committee. Given that       climate change is the gravest threat to humanity (which is       bad for business), Congress should improve oversight rather       than reduce it, especially since the recent calamity was       caused by simple failure to understand interest rate maturity       mismatches, hardly the gravity of climate change. We oppose       this title.        Title IV is an ad hominem retort to Federal Reserve Vice       Chair Michael Barr, who issued a report identifying S. 2155       as one of the factors causing the collapse of SVB. The bill       would establish qualifications for Vice Chair that Barr does       not meet. Legislating should be about policy, not personal       attacks. We clearly oppose this title.        Title V would require the FDIC Chair, OCC Comptroller of       the Currency, NCUA Chair, and the Fed's Vice Chair of       Supervision to testify before Congress on a semiannual basis       (currently, only the Fed Vice Chair of Supervision is       required to testified semiannually). This is the only title       of the bill Public Citizen does not oppose. We oppose all the       other titles, and this bill.                               3. Housing bill       The Middle-Class Borrower Protection Act        This bill would stymie the ability of Freddie Mac and       Fannie Mae (overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency)       to appropriately price credit risk. It would compromise the       safety and soundness of the housing finance market. We oppose       this bill.        Once again, the committee majority are doing Wall Street's       bidding by bringing a counterproductive mark-up of       deregulatory bills instead of increasing the safety and       soundness of our financial system. Responsible lawmakers       concerned about investor protection, financial stability and       housing must not support this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                    Public Citizen.     Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record letters of opposition to H.R. 3564  from the Center for Responsible Lending, the National Housing Resource  Center, the National Housing Law Project, and the National Fair Housing  Alliance.           [From the Center for Responsible Lending, Sept. 2020]  More Harm and No Good--So-Called ``Middle Class Borrower Protection Act      of 2023'' Leaves Borrowers and Taxpayers Less Financially Secure         The Center for Responsible Lending OPPOSES H.R. 3654, the       so-called ``Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023,''       and urges Members of Congress to do the same. As written, the       bill would: (1) undo the Federal Housing Finance Agency's       recent cost changes for mortgages under the loan-level-      pricing-adjustment framework used by Fannie Mae and Freddie       Mac and (2) subject any future framework changes to the       Administrative Procedure Act. Yet. rather than protecting       America's middle class, these proposals would make it more       expensive for middle-class consumers to become homeowners       using conventional mortgage loans and more difficult for many       consumers to enter America's middle class by obtaining       affordable, conventional mortgage credit. Here is what       policymakers, advocates, and consumers need to know:        (1) H.R. 3654 Undermines Middle Class Borrowers By Undoing       The Pricing Reductions That Were Recently Made For Them. This       bill would eliminate the reductions in loan-level-pricing       adjustments (LLPAs) that the Federal Housing Finance Agency       (FHFA) recently established. Those reductions were targeted       to the lower wealth, credit-worthy borrowers who       disproportionately make up or seek to enter America's middle       class.        (2) H.R. 3654 Makes it Harder for More Americans to Enter       the Middle Class by Raising the Cost of a Conventional Home  [[Page H3123]]       Loan for First-Time And Working-Class Borrowers.       Homeownership continues to be the single most important       factor in determining the ability of an American household to       build wealth and enter or maintain middle-class status. Yet,       by eliminating the pricing reductions FHFA recently       implemented for lower-wealth and first-time homebuyers, the       proposed bill reinforces a two-tier housing finance system       where the conventional mortgage market continues to       prioritize wealthier borrowers while first-time, underserved       or rural borrowers with less wealth are dependent upon       government-backed loans from federal agencies. That result is       inconsistent with the statutory purpose and mandate of Fannie       Mae and Freddie Mac. As the FHFA has noted, ``[a]chieving a       liquid, resilient housing finance market throughout the       country requires improved access to responsible mortgage       credit across different market segments of creditworthy       borrowers.        (3) H.R. 3654 Makes All Taxpayers More Vulnerable by       Disrupting Safety And Soundness Regulation of for Fannie Mae       and Freddie Mac. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the       Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission stated unequivocally that       the primary cause of the crisis was a failure on the part of       the government to regulate the financial industry,       particularly in the secondary mortgage market. Based on its       own experience in that regard, Congress created an       independent FHFA, empowered it to assume conservator       responsibilities for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and ensured       that it would have the ability to act swiftly and       independently from the political process to manage each       government-sponsored enterprise's safety and soundness       considerations. Under H.R. 3654, FHFA would Jose the ability       to act swiftly on pricing considerations tied to safety and       soundness by being subjected to the Administrative Procedure       Act. That result would require the Agency to delay       implementation of pricing changes for an extended period that       often does not match changing dynamics in the financial       markets. As a result, taxpayers would be a greater risk for,       once again, having to bail out the enterprises.        @ Making homeownership more expensive for moderate income       borrowers and less accessible for first-time, workingclass,       rural and other underserved borrowers is not protecting       America's middle class. Likewise, depriving the enterprises'       conservator of the tools needed to swiftly respond to safety       and soundness considerations raised by pricing and, in the       process, increasing the likelihood of another taxpayer funded       bail out is not protecting American taxpayers. For each of       these reasons, H.R. 3654, the ``Middle Class Borrower       Protection Act of 2023,'' is bad public policy and should not       be enacted. CRL urges Members of Congress to vote against the       measure.                                   ____                                                       May 21, 2023.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Chairman, U.S. House Financial Services Committee,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, U.S. House Financial Services Committee,           Washington, DC.      Subject: The Current Mortgage Market: Undermining Housing           Affordability with Politics        We are writing to show support for the Federal Housing       Finance Agency (FHFA) changes to the Loan Level Price       Adjustments (LLPAs). The past LLPA pricing framework unfairly       raised the costs for many first-time homebuyers who had       downpayments of less than 20 percent. The main area of growth       for first time homebuyers will be people of color and this       disproportionately disadvantages them. The median downpayment       in 2021 was 17 percent and for first-time- homebuyers it was       7 percent. These homebuyers with lower downpayments will also       be paying mortgage insurance which mitigates the risk to the       Enterprises and raises the costs for the homebuyer.        Reducing the LLPA fees for first-time homebuyers and       participants in the affordable housing programs also helps       the Enterprises meet their mission goal of supporting       homeownership in America. Ironically, the LLPA framework was       instituted in 2009 in response to the financial crisis and       has unfairly put the burden of the Enterprises' financial       recovery and future catastrophic risk on first-time-      homebuyers and especially borrowers of color, despite their       communities being the greatest victims of the financial       crisis.        We believe the solution is eliminating the LLPAs       altogether. Unnecessary LLPA fees raise the cost of       homeownership and reduce opportunities for Americans who       would like to become homeowners. Our organization urges you       to prioritize fair and inclusive mortgage pricing to promote       equitable and sustainable homeownership.            Signed,      National Housing Resource Center.                                   ____                                     National Housing Law Project,                                                      June 22, 2023.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker of the House of Representatives.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Chair, House Financial Services Committee.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, House Financial Services Committee.        Dear Speaker McCarthy, Leader Jeffries, Chair McHenry, and       Ranking Member Waters: The National Housing Law Project       writes to express our strong opposition to H.R. 3564, the so-      called ``Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023''.        H.R. 3564 would repeal the structure of upfront fees       related to residential mortgages developed by the Federal       Finance Housing Agency (FHFA) and instituted by the       government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and       Freddie Mac, on May 1, 2023, and reinstate the prior fee       structure. It would also prohibit any changes to the fee       structure for at least two more years.        Contrary to the claims of H.R. 3564's cosponsors, the       FHFA's updated fee structure does not uniformly shift the       cost of lower fees for borrowers with low credit scores to       those with high credit scores. Instead, it represents a       carefully calibrated effort to balance risk to the GSEs'       balance sheets with their obligation to provide broad and       equitable access to homeownership in light of the realities       of the housing market.        As explained in a May 23, 2023, letter opposing H.R. 3564       from Americans for Financial Reform (AFR), the updated fee       structure that the bill would rescind serves to make the       homebuying market more equitable than it has been       historically by lowering mortgage costs for first-time and       first-generation homebuyers who are disproportionately people       of color. Moreover, reverting to the prior fee structure       would actually harm the many middle-income families around       the country who have never owned a home and who are unable to       save for a large down payment by restoring higher upfront       fees for their loans.4 H.R. 3564 is the epitome of bad       policy: a misleadingly named bill that seeks to erase 18       months of careful work by the government's own experts in       housing finance for the sole purpose of ratcheting up       political controversy. We urge you to oppose this       legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lisa Sitkin,      Supervising Attorney.                                   ____                                [May 22, 2023]  NFHA Issues Statement Opposing the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act         Washington, D.C.--Nikitra Bailey, Executive Vice President       of the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), issued the       following statement opposing the Middle Class Borrower       Protection Act of 2023 introduced by Rep. Warren Davidson (R-      OH). The bill would require the Federal Housing Finance       Agency to reverse recent changes to its single-family pricing       matrix for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.        ``We are concerned that Congress is attempting to set       mortgage pricing fees for loans purchased by the Government       Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). This is the role of their       regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). A       return to the former pricing matrix would raise the cost of       homeownership and make it more expensive for first-time       homebuyers and borrowers of color seeking conventional loans.       The bill also fails to advance housing affordability and does       not offer a solution for the millions of mortgage-ready       consumers who desire and can succeed in homeownership.        ``Prior to FHFA mandating upfront Loan Level Price       Adjustment (LLPA) fees, the GSEs had a stronger track record       of purchasing loans made to Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native       communities. Since FHFA instituted LLPAs in 2008, the GSEs       have grossly underserved the very borrowers on whom the       health of the future housing finance system depends. LLPAs       also unfairly place the potential burden of future       catastrophic risk on the backs of the borrowers who were most       harmed by the Great Recession.        ``LLPAs must be eliminated. They force creditworthy first-      time homebuyers and borrowers of color to pay more for       mortgages, which prices them out of the conventional market.       The GSEs' charters mandate that they serve the whole of the       market--not just wealthier borrowers purchasing second homes       and investors. FHFA's recent changes move the system toward       greater safety and soundness, which is ultimately in       everyone's best interest.''     Mr. Chair, these organizations all fight hard for  homeownership, especially for middle-class Americans. They are  absolutely opposed to this bill.   Again, I don't understand why we are spending time on this amendment.  It does not accomplish anything at all. It would require GAO to do  something it already does.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Ms. Pettersen's amendment  which is simply holding Republicans accountable for their claims about  the impacts of the bill.    They claim that this bill will help middle-class home buyers, so I  don't see why there should be any objection to this amendment which  would make the implementation of the bill contingent on the truth of  its claims.   Republicans held hearings on this topic where their own witnesses  repeatedly debunked MAGA Republicans' claims that these changes would  result in higher credit score borrowers paying higher mortgage fees  than lower credit borrowers.   If we agree that the goal of this bill is to help middle-class  borrowers, then I think we should be able to agree on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge Members to support this amendment.
