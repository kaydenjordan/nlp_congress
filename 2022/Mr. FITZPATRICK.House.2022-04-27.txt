 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  tremendous accomplishment of the 2020 Pennridge High School women's  varsity soccer team.   At a time when our schools were just reopening, the Pennridge women's  soccer team seized the moment and went on to win their first PIAA Class  4A title on November 21, 2020.   This victory was years in the making, following a 2018 overtime loss  in the final tournament game. Thanks to the visionary leadership of  Coach Audrey Anderson, the Pennridge women's varsity team pushed past  the adversity and clinched the championship win.   With both teams battling through a contentious 80 minutes of  regulation and 27 minutes of overtime, freshman forward Tori Angelo  chipped a pass over to junior Leah Malone to score the game-winner with  just a few minutes remaining.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize these champions today for  their leadership and their outstanding efforts in their 2020 season,  and I formally enter their names in the Record:   Head Coach Audrey Anderson, Assistant Coach Jason Lollar, Assistant  Coach Erin Stevenson, captain Lindsey DeHaven, captain Leah Malone,  captain Maddie Angelo, captain Emily Kriney, Sierra Shaeffer, Cady  McKean, Anna Croyle, Zoe Sabol, Liv Grenda, Riley Hepler, Tori Angelo,  Kera Dam, Casey Malone, Brielle Tasher, Jess Levush, Joey Tomlinson,  Lauren Atchley, Lavi Baldovin, Lindsey Balmer, Raina Adelman, Sophie  Craig, Aubrey Long, Avery Drumbore, Danae Luecke, Lauren Moylan, Maggie  Hayes, Ryan Hodder, Sammi McBride, Sam Kiwak, and Phia Lowery.   Madam Speaker, along with that victory, it is with a heavy heart that  I recognize the team's assistant coach who recently passed away, Robert  Lee Miller.   Anyone who had the privilege of knowing Robert knows that he could  always be found on the soccer field, lending his strengths and gifts to  coach dozens of teams and mentor thousands of youth players.   As our Bucks County community mourns his loss and remembers his  passion for the game, I would like to offer a moment of silence for  Robert Miller.   Madam Speaker, we are incredibly grateful for the inspiration and  impacts that the coaches of the entire Pennridge women's soccer team  and, of course, the team's parents have had on our community. They are  a tremendous asset.   We are very proud of all of them, and I look forward to seeing them  all and presenting them with flags individually that were flown over  the U.S. House of Representatives.                            ____________________
