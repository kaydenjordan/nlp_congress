 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the Grand Columbia  Council of the Boy Scouts of America. This organization has enriched  the communities of central Washington through its efforts to promote  conservation, outdoor recreation, and youth development.   Since its founding 95 years ago, volunteers for the Grand Columbia  Council have sought to teach the values of the Scout oath and Scout law  to over 1,000 boys and girls every year, making an investment in our  youth by supporting leadership, character, career development, and  healthy habits.   Every year these volunteers host the River Run Regatta, a month of  scouting activities that culminates in Scout Me In Day, an event that  encourages the expansion of the Scouts and seeks to foster the  relationships between our lakes, forests, mountains, and the future  generations who will harbor them.   Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues in supporting the Grand Columbia  Council and the efforts of the Boy Scouts of America throughout the  Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support this bloc of bipartisan amendments, which contains two  amendments I have offered with my friends across the aisle.   Mr. Soto and I introduced an amendment which will support important  fertilizer research and development through the fertilizer management  initiative, as this body authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill.   I also would like to speak on an amendment I offered with Mr.  Panetta, which will empower agriculture employees to provide personal  protective equipment for our essential agriculture workers. This  pandemic has affected every aspect of our lives, but what has not  changed is the critical role that our farmers, our ranchers, and our  agricultural employees play in putting food on our tables and securing  our Nation's food supply.   It is my hope that this amendment will lead to a larger conversation  about how we ensure the safety of those working hard to feed our  country and strengthen our agricultural industry.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments, and I  look forward to continuing our bipartisan work.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this group of  partisan, antiresource development amendments offered by several House  Democrats. These provisions offered on the Interior appropriations bill  will hamstring our Nation's efforts to secure our energy independence.   Many of these amendments seek to prohibit oil and gas development,  and, Mr. Speaker, I have just got to say, it is really quite ironic to  see my colleagues who just yesterday voted for sweeping legislation  mandating $900 million a year from the oil and gas industry for  conservation projects to now, just one day later, not even 24 hours  later, offer amendments to restrict the very industry that those  projects depend upon.   This is hypocrisy, plain and simple. But it is exactly what I shared  in a message with my constituents yesterday. Democrats are trying to  have their cake and eat it too. From the Green New Deal to Mr. Biden's  energy plan to these irresponsible amendments we have here before us,  Democrats continue to put forward ideas that are not based in reality  and will harm our Nation's energy security.   Another partisan amendment seeks to block the recent finalized rule  by the Council on Environmental Quality to modernize severely outdated  and burdensome National Environmental Policy Act regulations, something  that has not been done for 40 years.   According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Unlock American  Investment coalition, we are now seeing infrastructure project delays  of up to 20 years across our country. This is unacceptable, and it  prevents critical repairs and construction of roads, of bridges, of  airports, railways, renewable energy projects, even water  infrastructure projects in the West and many more things.   At a time when American jobs and the economy are facing significant  challenges, these provisions threaten our Nation's resiliency, our  energy independence, and our ability to recover from this pandemic.   Please, Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on these amendments.
