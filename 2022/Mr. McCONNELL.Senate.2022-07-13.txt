 Madam President, this morning, this all-Democratic  government produced yet another absolutely terrible, terrible inflation  report. Inflation during the month of June shattered the experts'  predictions. We are now--listen to this--at 9.1 percent annual  inflation; yet another fresh 40-year high, the most out-of-control  inflation that American families have seen since the early 1980s. Food  costs are up more than 10 percent. Energy costs are up more than 40  percent. The costs of the fuel that drives us to work, delivers our  goods, and drives our economy are all up over 60 percent.   These are staggeringly--staggeringly--bad numbers. And they were  fueled directly by the reckless spending spree that the Democrats  rammed through on party lines just last year.   Remember, right before the $2 trillion spending spree, President  Biden said:         The biggest risk is not going too big . . . it's if we go       too small.    The Senate Democratic leader said:         I do not think the dangers of inflation, at least in the       near-term, are very real.    These were gigantic--gigantic--unforced errors. One leading economist  recently said the so-called American Rescue Plan was ``arguably the  biggest fiscal policy mistake in several decades.''   Our core inflation rate here in America is more than 2 percentage  points higher than in Europe. Inflation is uniquely bad here because  our all-Democratic government has made uniquely bad choices. And now  American families are dealing with the fallout every single day.   It is no secret how much the American people disapprove of the course  Washington Democrats have put us on. They say so in poll after poll  after poll. So you might think by now that our colleagues would be  ready to try a different approach.   Well, guess again. President Biden and his party, fresh off of  spending America into inflation, now want to tax-hike us into  recession. They are behind closed doors playing around with what may  amount to the single largest tax increase in American history. Tucked  inside are exactly the sort of radical ideas that working families can  least afford right now.   They want a giant tax hike on passthrough small businesses, a  category--listen to this--that encompasses 95 percent of all businesses  in the country--95 percent of them. Take it from a constituent of mine  in Mount Sterling, KY, who put it this way:         Small business is already in a struggle to survive with all       the taxes and regulations we have to deal with. Adding       another tax is only making things worse.    Democrats also want a so-called ``methane fee'' that amounts to a big  new tax hike on domestic natural gas, while their inflation has pushed  American families' natural gas prices and electricity costs up through  the roof already.    If following reckless spending and runaway inflation with a gigantic,  painful tax hike sounds like a bad idea to you, believe me, you are not  alone. Even some House Democrats are lighting their hair on fire over  what a terrible idea these discussions are.   One House Democrat from New Jersey is telling reporters that she is  ``not  [[Page S3246]]  for any type of legislation that raises taxes . . . especially right  now, as my constituents are facing inflation, cost of living  [increases] . . . [and] housing prices.''   Well, let me put it this way. When House Democrats from the Northeast  start trying to sound more like Ronald Reagan running against Jimmy  Carter, you know they have gotten themselves into a fix.   Too bad every single House Democrat except one and every single  Senate Democrat voted for the $2 trillion mistake that brought us to  where we are. The Democrats complaining about inflation today voted in  lockstep for the bill that brought us here. And now their answer to  picking families' pockets once is to now pick the families' pockets yet  a second time. The same Democrats that spent us into inflation now want  to tax us into recession.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on an entirely different matter,  this week, I have been discussing the historic term the Supreme Court  just concluded--the most consequential and pro-Constitution term since  Brown overturned Plessy almost 70 years ago.   Back in 2015, in one fell swoop, the Obama-Biden administration took  aim at domestic energy production, harmed the separation of powers, and  attacked the rule of law.   Remember, after Americans elected Republicans in 2010 to place a  check on the leftwing agenda, President Obama infamously said he would  just ignore the will of the people and work around Congress. Here was  his quote. He said, ``I've got a pen.'' He said, ``I've got a phone.''   Thus began a whole series of unconstitutional power grabs by the  executive branch, a sort of crime spree against the Constitution. For  example, when Democrats could not get harmful and unpopular  environmental restrictions through Congress because the people's duly  elected representatives did not support them, the bureaucrats at the  Obama EPA decided to pretend that some obscure lines in an old law  actually gave them enormous sweeping regulatory powers to manage our  economy which nobody had ever noticed before.   The EPA effectively wrote and passed a giant piece of legislation,  the so-called Clean Power Plan, as one branch of government acting  alone. They tried to make law without involving actual lawmakers. The  Obama EPA just up and decided they could start giving orders and  issuing edicts and remake our country's electricity grid by brute  force.   Of course, the pretext was simply false.   As Justice Scalia once wrote, ``Congress . . . does not alter the  fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary  provisions--it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouse  holes.''   When the legislative branch actually intends to hand over giant  chunks of our power to unelected bureaucrats, we make it pretty darn  clear. The Obama-Biden EPA had no lawful authority to grab control of  electricity generation all across America. And that is exactly what the  Supreme Court affirmed last month.   The ruling was a huge win for American ratepayers and anybody who  wants affordable and reliable energy; but it was also a landmark legal  victory for our very system of government. The Supreme Court applied  the plain text of the law and reaffirmed that the unelected  administrative state is not allowed to reach way beyond the powers that  Congress has actually given it. With any luck, this will be part of a  sea change that has been a long time coming.   Remember a few months ago, a young district judge in Florida applied  the plain, straightforward text of a statute and overturned the  administration's illegal and unilateral mask mandate for public  transportation. That was the Centers for Disease Control stepping way,  way over its boundaries.   And this past January, the Supreme Court put the brakes on President  Biden's blatantly illegal attempt to have the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration, OSHA, force 84 million American workers to get  the COVID vaccine whether they wanted it or not.   As Justice Gorsuch wrote in concurrence back then:         The central question we face today is: Who decides? The       only question is whether an administrative agency in       Washington . . . charged with overseeing workplace safety may       mandate the vaccination or regular testing of 84 million       people . . .    Justice Gorsuch continued:         Or whether . . . that work belongs to state and local       governments across the country and the people's elected       representatives in Congress.    On issue after issue, our courts are beginning to answer that  question the way the Constitution commands. ``Who decides?'' is the  question. The answer: The people decide and the Members of Congress  they elect.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
