 Madam Speaker, I rise today to praise a great man from my  district after his passing recently. Donald Harris was a developer with  a conscience, a visionary, a dreamer, a thinker. He helped rebuild  Newark and created housing projects in areas that needed redevelopment.   His housing projects were more than just buildings. Mr. Harris used  them to educate new residents on proper homeownership and how to move  forward in this economy to sustain their lives. He made sure his  projects created more opportunities for African Americans and other  minorities. That is why he earned the Golden Broom Award for improving  Newark's quality of life.   He was a man whose faith guided him to help those in need. He was an  example for all of us to follow.   Madam Speaker, I am here to honor Donald Laverne Harris for a life  well lived.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the actions of  Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona and support this resolution.   There have been many times when I have stood on this floor and  disagreed with my Republican colleagues. At times, I have done so with  passion. But I have never supported or promoted violence against any of  them. The vast majority of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, have  shown that they feel the same way.   We know that there is a line that cannot be crossed when it comes to  how we refer to our political rivals, and Representative Gosar has  crossed that line. He crossed it when he created a video that depicts  attacking President Joe Biden and killing Representative Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez.   This behavior is unacceptable from any Member of Congress. It would  not be tolerated in any workplace in the country, and it should not be  tolerated here.   That is why we must censure Representative Gosar and remove him from  his committees. We must show the country that inappropriate actions,  like his video, have consequences. We must remind all Members that  there is a certain decorum to how we treat each other that must be  respected at all times. We must show the country that we can debate as  Democrats and Republicans but still respect each other as Americans.   Madam Speaker, I heard the gentleman from Florida mention Wile E.  Coyote and the Road Runner. Yes, it is true that they are cartoons, but  neither one of them can pick up a gun. Congressman Gosar can.
