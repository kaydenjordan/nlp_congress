 Will the gentleman from Maryland yield?    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, we have had a dialogue back  and forth about the need for amendment, the need for debate on the  floor. And what I would ask the gentleman is, for example, if the  gentleman would agree that in 2004 we had former President Jimmy  Carter, Democrat, and James Baker, Republican--hardly ideologues from  the standpoint of division that we see today--agree that there are  issues of bail and balance.   And what I would ask is: Why don't we have a debate here on the  problems and concerns and potential fraud with mail-in ballots that is  a nonpartisan concern? That is one example, and there are bunch. Why do  we not have that debate robustly here on the floor for the American  people to see, if we are talking about transparency?   And I ask the question respectfully of the gentleman from Maryland.                                time  1000     Madam Speaker, I would point out that the Speaker of the  House came to the floor and used her magic minute, but doesn't stay on  the floor and debate. There is no debate on this floor.   And then the Speaker said that there were amendments, 56 amendments.  Forty-nine of them are Democratic amendments, hand-selected by a small  group in the Rules Committee. Forty-nine are Democratic amendments.   So don't buy into the Kabuki theater that you are seeing on the floor  of the House of Representatives.   You know what?   I can't ask to take down the words of the Speaker, even though the  essence of her argument is that I am a bigot. Let's be very clear. The  arguments being distilled on the floor today is that Republicans, my  colleagues and I, that we are bigots.   Why?   Because they use fancy words like ``voter suppression'' to say that  we are wanting to tamp down people's access to polls.   Nothing can be further from the truth. Heaven forbid we want to use  voter identification. Heaven forbid we want to honor the will of the  people through their legislature in the States passing rules to make  sure that our system is actually working, using voter identification  that the American people use to fly, that the American people use to do  everything else. If I demand that, I am a bigot.                                time  1030
