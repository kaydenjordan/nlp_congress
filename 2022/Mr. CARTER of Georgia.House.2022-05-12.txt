 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Savannah Paper Mill as it celebrates its 85th year in operation.   My father worked at this paper mill. In fact, I worked at this paper  mill, originally known as Union Bag, then Union Camp, then  International Paper, and now International Paper, and I have the utmost  respect for anyone in that line of work.   At the height of the 1950s, the Savannah Paper Mill employed up to  5,000 people. As the years have passed, the same location, now owned by  International Paper, has modernized and trimmed the workforce down to  about 650 employees. Some of them come from a generation of paper mill  workers that have been there from the start.   The Savannah Paper Mill has always been a visual landmark in the  city, long before the hospitality industry became the city's number one  market. In the 1950s, the mill could produce 1.25 million tons of kraft  paper and linerboard in any given year and quickly became one of the  largest mills in the State.   Its proximity to fruitful timber produced optimal conditions for the  mill to operate at its highest level, and it remains true today.   Like the rest of Savannah, the paper mill contributed greatly to the  war effort in World War II as well, producing paper packaging, a  critical war material.   I am proud to be the son of a paper mill worker, and I thank the  Savannah Paper Mill for their many years of industry and hope for  continued success.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  sponsoring this Special Order tonight. It is extremely important and  timely at that.   Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure today to recognize the Members of  the United States National Guard that call our district home.   The First Congressional District of Georgia is home to every branch  of the military in America. It is home to Moody Air Force Base, Kings  Bay Naval Base, Hunter Army Airfield, and Fort Stewart. All of those  are in the First Congressional District of Georgia.   Make no mistake about these great installations, they were placed  here along the 110 miles of pristine coastline for a reason. It is  because of our great weather, and it is because of our proximity to the  Port of Savannah and the Port of Brunswick.   In addition to those branches of the military and to those military  bases, we also are home to the Combat Readiness Training Center at the  Air Dominance Center in Savannah.   The Air Dominance Center is home to the Air National Guard in  Savannah. Unfortunately, the President, in his budget for fiscal year  2023, has proposed closing the most efficient, the most utilized combat  readiness training center here in America, the one located in Savannah,  and, oh, by the way, the one that is about to complete a $24 million  hangar built for stealth fighters. Unbelievable.   In fact, they have invited me to the ribbon cutting that is to be  held in September, with the intention now of this administration  wanting to close it down in April of next year. No wonder taxpayers get  so upset about wasteful government spending. This is the most ludicrous  thing I have ever heard.   On top of that, think about the world stage that we are in right now.  Madam Speaker, do you realize that we are potentially on the brink of  world war III? Think about it. Russia has attacked Ukraine. An errant  missile, a mistake, they hit a NATO country, all of a sudden it  triggers NATO Article 5, and all of a sudden we are in world war III.  And this President and this administration are talking about closing a  combat readiness training center? You have got to be kidding me. We  ought to be opening more. This is the most ludicrous thing I have ever  heard.   The Savannah Combat Readiness Training Center represents the most  uniquely cost-efficient taxpayer investment thanks to the shared  airfield between the National Guard Bureau and the 165th Airlift Wing.   This can't be allowed to happen. This has got to be stopped, and I am  prepared to do what it takes to ensure that it doesn't.   I am here today to say that I appreciate and that I value members of  the Georgia National Guard and members of the United States National  Guard and that we are going to do everything we can to make sure that  the Combat Readiness Training Center in Savannah stays open.   God bless our country, God bless our troops, and God bless the  National Guard.
