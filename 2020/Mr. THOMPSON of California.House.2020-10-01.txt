 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  bill and thank the Chairman for his tireless dedication to our natural  resources and to supporting efforts to get folks outside to enjoy our  National treasures.   The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear just how desperately our  communities need access to the outdoors for their emotional and  physical well-being.   The provisions included in America's Conservation Enhancement Act  will do just that by increasing access to public lands and  reauthorizing wildlife conservation programs, so our hunters, anglers,  and birdwatchers can continue doing what they love.   The ACE Act will create more opportunities for the people in America  to enjoy the outdoors, while providing critical financial relief to the  businesses around these public lands.   This legislation is a win for our environment, our economy, and for  our sportsmen and women who will be able to access these lands for  generations to come.   As a longtime outdoorsman, I am proud of this legislation and urge my  colleagues to vote yes.
