 Madam Speaker, last week, the  unthinkable happened. A grandmother, Litha Verone, was innocently  shopping in a local supermarket with her precious young grandson when  they were both brutally murdered by a deranged man with a semi- automatic weapon.   My heart breaks for Litha's family for their unbearable loss.   But, once again, prayers and good wishes are not enough. On so many  levels we must take action passing commonsense gun legislation,  strengthening our mental health system, reaching out to those in  trouble because in the last moments of her life, a grandmother watched  in horror as her grandchild was shot and killed by a man who should  never have had a gun.   Madam Speaker, last week, the unthinkable happened, and we must not  stop thinking about it.                            ____________________
