 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the work  the House is doing to address the opioid epidemic sweeping our Nation.   Sadly, in 2016, our Nation lost more people to overdose deaths than  were lost during the entire Vietnam war. One of those lives lost was  Samantha Huntley, whose picture I have here.   Samantha was an outgoing cheerleader at Kickapoo High School in  Springfield, Missouri. When she was 16, she was in a car wreck and  broke her back. Her doctor prescribed opioids to deal with the pain,  and when they ran out, Sam turned to heroin.   At age 18, she confessed to her mom she needed help, but she was  never able to beat her addiction. Tragically, Sam succumbed to an  overdose last year, at age 20.   This epidemic must not take any more of our young people. That is why  we are passing over 70 bills this week to address this crisis. Now is  the time to prevent other tragedies so beautiful, amazing youth like  Samantha can live.                            ____________________
