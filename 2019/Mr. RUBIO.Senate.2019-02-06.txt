 Mr. President, it is my privilege to highlight a  Florida small business that displays the unique entrepreneurial spirit  found across my home State of Florida. As chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies ingenuity, hard work, and dedication  to improving their community. Today, it is my distinct privilege to  honor Haynes Security Services, Inc., of Miami, FL, as the Small  Business of the Week.   Founded in 2011, Haynes Security Services has grown from a small firm  focused on security consulting, to a full-service security company with  35 employees and more than $600,000 in annual revenues. It has done so  in the heart of Liberty City, which has a long, proud, yet complicated,  history. In recent years, Liberty City has been characterized as a  community that suffers with poverty, schools that have struggled,  majority single-parent households, and a declining workforce. However,  history tells us that this a community that not that long ago was  thriving with entrepreneurs, economic opportunity, and strong families.  I think those virtues, those values, and those ambitions still remain  in the heart in the soul of the people who live in Liberty City.   On February 1, 2019, I held a committee field hearing in Liberty City  to have an in-depth discussion with community advocates about ways that  small business policies and collaboration between Federal and city  agencies can encourage economic growth and upward mobility in our more  vulnerable communities. We discussed how, together, we can support an  upward mobility that honors the men, women, and children who live in  that community and to provide jobs in the community that support safe  and affordable housing options. Small businesses are rooted in their  communities, and when an owner of that business also grew up in that  community, they are going to hire local citizens, and they are going to  support local partnerships and organizations.   It is at the hearing that I learned of Edward ``Ed'' Haynes. Haynes  Security Services is a shining example of what is possible in Liberty  City and communities just like it. After spending 6 years in the U.S.  Marine Corps, Ed joined the Miami Shores Police Department, becoming  the organization's first African-American police officer. In the early  1990s, Ed's background and expertise led him into the private security  industry where he consulted before founding Haynes Security Services in  2011. Combined, Ed has more than 30 years of security experience under  his belt.   As Ed's company has grown from just 1 employee to 30 officers, he  ensured that it remains family-owned and operated and rooted in the  Liberty City community. He relies on his wife Adriene, who is the chief  financial officer, and his daughters, Chakara, who provides human  resources support, and Candyce, who is in charge of the company's  marketing. Ed noted the incredible responsibility in providing for 30  families, including those of his own daughters.   Today, Haynes Security Services provides a wide range of security  services, including investigations, security consultations, executive  protection, and electronic security solutions. Recently, the company  took on larger contracts to provide security for the Miami-Dade  Metrorail, large real estate development companies, as well as major  events in Miami. In addition to these services, Haynes Security  Services also provides private security licensing and certification  training as required by the State of Florida.   In 2017, Ed and his team were named the Veteran-Owned Business of the  Year by both the Small Business Administration South Florida District  Office and the State of Florida. Throughout the company's history,  Haynes Security Services has worked closely with the Florida Small  Business Development Center, SBDC, at Florida International University.  This partnership has given Ed and his team the strategic assistance and  knowledge they need to pursue major contracts and secure access to  capital. Ed credits the practical know-how and dedication of the SBDC  consultants with much of the recent success that Haynes Security  Services has experienced.   Ed's unique experience and success in the Miami community has given  him a platform to give back to his neighborhood. Beginning with his  time in the Marine Corps, Ed has remained committed to serving others.  Today, he continues this service by mentoring young people and through  motivational speaking, where he uses his story to encourage people to  reach their full potential.   Companies like Haynes Security Services are a great example of the  success that is possible with vision, hard work, and quality service.  It is also a testament to the impact that locally owned and operated  small businesses, who hire people from the community and are committed  to the families who live there, can have on places like Liberty City. I  would like to congratulate Ed, Adriene, Chakara, Candyce, and all of  the employees at Haynes Security Services on being named Small Business  of the Week. I wish you the best of luck as you grow your business and  stay active in your community.                            ____________________
