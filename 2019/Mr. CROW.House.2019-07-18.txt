 Madam Speaker, I rise today in solemn memory of the 12  lives lost and the many lives changed forever 7 years ago in the Aurora  theater shooting.   Since then, I have come to know many of the victims' families, and I  stand in awe of their courage and strength. Many have become stewards  in our community, and their example is an inspiration to us all, people  like State Representative Tom Sullivan, who honors his son's life by  serving in the Colorado State Legislature and fighting every day for  commonsense gun violence prevention, or Sandy and Lonnie Phillips, who  lost their daughter and have spent their days since advocating for  survivors around the country.   Today, my only wish is to tell them that we haven't forgotten.   Looking at this Chamber, it may seem as if we have moved on. In the 7  years since, little has changed. Our country is no safer. We disagree  about how to solve the problem, but we do agree that there is a  problem. There is a public health crisis in our country, and it doesn't  matter if you live in a red or blue district.   I stand here today, committed to making a change, committed to  showing families in our community that just because time has passed,  our urgency to addressing gun violence has not.                            ____________________
