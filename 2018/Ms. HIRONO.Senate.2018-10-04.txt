 Mr. President, tomorrow we will cast a very important  vote on whether to end debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to  be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.   Should he be confirmed to this position of awesome responsibility,  Judge Kavanaugh would be just one of nine people with the power to  change the American Government and the American way of life for at  least a generation. He would be hearing and deciding cases that touch  all facets of our lives, including the healthcare we receive when the  Texas case involving the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate makes  its way to the Supreme Court. This particular case is very important  because if Texas wins, that means the ACA's protections for those with  preexisting conditions--one out of four people in this country--would  be done away with.   The Supreme Court will also probably get a lot of immigration cases  and many cases about DACA, sanctuary sites, temporary protective  status, and family separation that are pending in the lower courts, and  also abortion, as courts weigh the burden imposed on a woman's right to  choose by laws limiting abortion in States like Texas, Iowa, and  Louisiana. It doesn't really matter? Of course it matters whether Roe  v. Wade is overturned, but even if Roe v. Wade is not overturned, with  Judge Kavanaugh's record, all of these limiting laws by States that I  just talked about will probably be supported by him, and at some point,  the right to an abortion that we have under Roe v. Wade will be pretty  much a nullity.   The Supreme Court will also be faced with cases that will address the  right of workers to bargain collectively with their employers, as  litigation comes up to the High Court in the wake of the Janus  decision, and many other important topics, including voting rights,  gerrymandering, the census, race-conscious college admissions, and  environmental laws.   The Supreme Court's decisions touch every aspect of American life.  With so much at stake, the Senate has an obligation to closely  scrutinize every nominee to the Supreme Court. We need to know that  they have the qualifications for the job. Do they have the proper  education? Do they have the necessary breadth of experience? Will they  treat everyone in the Court--including Court employees, law clerks, and  lawyers--with an even temperament? Can they keep their cool under  pressure and make reasoned decisions when the stakes are high? Can they  listen to the facts and apply the law without fear or favor, or will  they let the experiences they bring with them override objective  judgment? Will they insert their personal preferences where they don't  belong? We need to know if they can rule fairly. Will they give every  litigant who comes before the Court a fair hearing? Will they  acknowledge and put aside their biases, inherent and otherwise? These  last two considerations are especially important because the Trump  administration outsourced the vetting of Supreme Court nominees to the  Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. These ultra-rightwing  groups have spent decades supporting people like Brett Kavanaugh and  their ideological, outcome-driven jurisprudence.    After months of scrutinizing Judge Kavanaugh's record and evaluating  his performance before the Judiciary Committee in two hearings, it is  clear that the answer to most of these questions is no. His judicial  record is deeply ideological and outcome-driven, he remains a fierce  political partisan operative, and he holds troubling legal views on  Native Hawaiians, Native Americans, and Alaska Natives.   These patterns were clear based on the weeks I spent reviewing Judge  Kavanaugh's writings, his judicial decisions, and the small fraction of  his records made available from his time as a key White House aide to  President George W. Bush. I became even more certain of my decision to  oppose his nomination after his first hearing in the Judiciary  Committee and after reading the mostly dismissive non-answers he gave  to our followup written questions.   There are plenty of substantive reasons to oppose Brett Kavanaugh's  nomination, and I will continue speaking out about many of these  reasons in the coming days, but over the past 2\1/2\ weeks, we have  learned new information that underscored my concern that Brett  Kavanaugh lacks the character, candor, credibility, and temperament to  serve on the Supreme Court.   Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Dr.  Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh about Dr. Ford's account of  an attack on her by the nominee and a friend when they were all  teenagers. Dr. Ford conducted herself with grace and courage,  recounting the terrifying experience that has had a lasting effect on  her life.   In his testimony, Judge Kavanaugh dropped the polite veneer he  presented at his first hearing, during which he complimented all the  Senators he had met with and told the committee that ``[t]he Supreme  Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution.'' That was then,  but last Thursday, he launched into a partisan political screed that  contradicted everything he has ever professed to believe about the way  judges should behave. He said: ``This whole two-week effort has been a  calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up  anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been  unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the  Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing  opposition groups.''   I have to say, sitting there listening to him be so totally partisan  was bizarre. What he said was bizarre. He was angry, he was  belligerent, he was partisan, he went on the attack, and he argued with  Senators. He forgot who was  [[Page S6530]]  there to ask the questions and who was there to answer them. These are  not qualities to look for in a Supreme Court Justice.   More than 1,700 law professors across the country agree, including  Dean Avi Soifer and 6 other professors from the University of Hawaii  and 21 professors from Georgetown University Law Center, both my alma  maters. I want to quote what a law professor said:         We have differing views about the other qualifications of       Judge Kavanaugh. But we are united, as professors of law and       scholars of judicial institutions, in believing that Judge       Kavanaugh did not display the impartiality and judicial       temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our       land.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter  from the law professors be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Times, October 3, 2018]              Opinion--The Senate Should Not Confirm Kavanaugh         The following letter will be presented to the United States       Senate on Oct. 4. It will be updated as more signatures are       received.        Judicial temperament is one of the most important qualities       of a judge. As the Congressional Research Service explains, a       judge requires ``a personality that is even-handed, unbiased,       impartial, courteous yet firm, and dedicated to a process,       not a result.'' The concern for judicial temperament dates       back to our founding; in Federalist 78, titled ``Judges as       Guardians of the Constitution,'' Alexander Hamilton expressed       the need for ``the integrity and moderation of the       judiciary.''        We are law professors who teach, research and write about       the judicial institutions of this country. Many of us appear       in state and federal court, and our work means that we will       continue to do so, including before the United States Supreme       Court. We regret that we feel compelled to write to you, our       Senators, to provide our views that at the Senate hearings on       Sept. 27, Judge Brett Kavanaugh displayed a lack of judicial       temperament that would be disqualifying for any court, and       certainly for elevation to the highest court of this land.        The question at issue was of course painful for anyone. But       Judge Kavanaugh exhibited a lack of commitment to judicious       inquiry. Instead of being open to the necessary search for       accuracy, Judge Kavanaugh was repeatedly aggressive with       questioners. Even in his prepared remarks, Judge Kavanaugh       described the hearing as partisan, referring to it as ``a       calculated and orchestrated political hit,'' rather than       acknowledging the need for the Senate, faced with new       information, to try to understand what had transpired.       Instead of trying to sort out with reason and care the       allegations that were raised, Judge Kavanaugh responded in an       intemperate, inflammatory and partial manner, as he       interrupted and, at times, was discourteous to senators.        As you know, under two statutes governing bias and recusal,       judges must step aside if they are at risk of being perceived       as or of being unfair. As Congress has previously put it, a       judge or justice ``shall disqualify himself in any proceeding       in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.''       These statutes are part of a myriad of legal commitments to       the impartiality of the judiciary, which is the cornerstone       of the courts.        We have differing views about the other qualifications of       Judge Kavanaugh. But we are united, as professors of law and       scholars of judicial institutions, in believing that he did       not display the impartiality and judicial temperament       requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.     Judge Kavanaugh also tried to convince us that while he  ``liked beer,'' he was basically a choir boy--interested in nothing  more than sports, school, and service projects. This carefully painted  image has been directly contradicted by Judge Kavanaugh's own words in  his yearbook and by many of his high school and college classmates over  the past weeks.   These inconsistencies and contradictions were part of the reason I  joined many of my colleagues in calling for a full FBI investigation of  allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. I wanted the FBI to examine  inconsistencies and contradictions between his testimony and that of  others who knew him in high school, college, and beyond.   Last Friday, Senators Flake and Coons brokered an agreement to hold  off on a floor vote for at least a week while a supplemental background  investigation could be completed to look into these allegations. But I  was disappointed that as the days went by, it became more and more  clear that the White House rigged the investigation. The President  claimed to want the FBI to do a comprehensive investigation, but that  did not happen.   Our ranking member, Senator Feinstein, wrote to White House Counsel  Don McGahn and FBI Director Christopher Wray the day after the  investigation began to request a copy of the written directive sent by  the White House to the FBI. She got no response. The following day,  many other members of the committee also wrote to Mr. McGahn and  Director Wray about the supplemental investigation.   In addition to repeating the ranking member's request for an  explanation of the scope of the investigation, we also asked that it be  comprehensive. We wanted all serious allegations against the nominee to  be investigated. Of course, we would expect, in a comprehensive  investigation, that all appropriate witnesses would be questioned. We  asked that the FBI ``perform all logical steps related to these  allegations, including interviewing other individuals who might have  relevant information and gathering evidence related to the truthfulness  of statements made in relation to these allegations.'' We got no  response.   Just yesterday, I joined a letter with many of my committee  colleagues asking Chairman Grassley to prevent public  mischaracterization or selective leaks of the results of the FBI's  previous work. We urged him to ``call for a full Senate briefing by the  FBI . . . so that all Senators hear the same information and have the  same opportunity to question the FBI before any floor vote on the  Kavanaugh nomination.'' These are requests having to do with the most  recent FBI investigation. We asked for a meeting between the chairman  and the minority members ``to establish bipartisan ground rules for  public discussion of the information provided by the FBI'' and this  most recent, totally truncated and inadequate investigation--those last  were my words--but both requests were rejected.   I had hoped the FBI would exhaust all possible avenues of  investigation relevant to whether Judge Kavanaugh had a pattern of  drinking that resulted in aggression and belligerence toward women. I  had hoped they would follow leads given to them by Dr. Ford and Ms.  Ramirez. I had hoped they would be permitted by the White House to do  the job we know they can do--the job former Director James Comey said  they could do. Instead, as we now know, they were only allowed to do  the bare minimum.   As we know from news reports, there are dozens of people with  relevant information, some of whom say they have corroborating  evidence, who need to be interviewed, but they were not.   It is simply impossible, after seeing the results of the FBI's  supplemental work--and I hesitate to call it an investigation--that  anybody could think it was in any way, shape, or form the comprehensive  investigation the President promised. This so-called investigation is a  sham. It is a fig leaf for the Republicans to hide behind. It is a  talking point for their continued and predictable criticism of  Democrats. They will say: See? You wanted an FBI investigation, and you  got one. But now it isn't good enough for you.   Who are they kidding? This is a sham investigation. This so-called  investigation wasn't good enough for me, and it shouldn't be good  enough to satisfy the American people. Judge Kavanaugh has a burden-- not a burden of proof like in a court but the burden to show us he has  not just the credentials for the job but the temperament and the  character necessary for this lifetime appointment.   I have said many times that Democrats didn't need to manufacture  reasons to oppose Judge Kavanaugh's elevation to the Supreme Court.  Based on his record, his opinions and his dissents, his academic  writings and speeches, I had concluded before these new reports came  forward that he would not be fair and objective on the Supreme Court.  His views on reproductive rights, Native rights, legal protections for  workers, consumers, and the environment are all of deep concern to me,  not to mention his expansive views on Executive power, including  protecting a sitting President from criminal or civil proceedings.   Now that we have heard Dr. Ford's account and seen Judge Kavanaugh's  angry and combative reaction, it is evident that he should not serve on  and should not be confirmed to the Supreme Court for a lifetime,  decades of making decisions that will impact our  [[Page S6531]]  lives on all of these areas on which he has a very troubling record. We  can do better, and the American people deserve better.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
