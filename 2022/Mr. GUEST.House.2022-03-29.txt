 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life and  service of the late Congressman Don Young of Alaska, former dean of the  United States House of Representatives. It is fitting that this Coast  Guard reauthorization, which we are considering today, is named in his  memory.   Congressman Young made a lasting impact on this institution and his  legacy of service will endure far into the future.
