 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School  students as part of the ninth annual State of the Union essay contest  conducted by my office.   The essays follow, in alphabetical order according to the finalists'  names.       Isabelle Desroches, Burr and Burton Academy, Senior, Finalist    Civility in local politics is a topic of increasing importance. As we  attempt to compromise on enormous national issues such as immigration,  health care, and foreign policy, intense polarization has created  unbearable tension between parties, and leads almost daily to an  absence of civil discourse. Even more terrifying a sight in recent  years is the aggression and polarity that has seeped into local  elections through overly-aggressive yard signs, tempestuous town  meetings, and neighborhood altercations that craft rifts in our  communities. Hopefully, we can shift these themes before courtesy in  both national and local politics dies, and my generation is left sans  civility in our system.   We seem to be coming upon an age of wildly strong convictions.  Although history classes dive into both pros and cons of political  circumstances (such as the eras of Andrew Jackson or Lincoln), citizens  and politicians are more resistant than ever to accept the yin/yang  relationship that can be found in any political situation. Anyone who  follows news is chronically frustrated by this double standard. What we  must come to accept as a nation is that none of the pressing issues  that face us today can be solved without a common language of civility.   Rollo May, an existential psychologist, wrote about conviction in The  Courage to Create. ``The relationship between commitment and doubt is  by no means an antagonistic one. Commitment is healthiest when it is  not without doubt, but in spite of doubt,'' he wrote. May understands  what we must come to embrace and apply to our politics: our convictions  are strongest when we can cast doubt upon our own stance. A position  without doubt causes ignorance and paralyzation of thought. It is  courageous to doubt yourself and keep an open mind. We learn this in  school, yet students are often hard-pressed to find admirable examples  of these philosophies in our lives and on the national stage. As  politics become increasingly heated, we can agree that it is more  important than ever to preserve integrity and traditional decorum in  local elections as well; movements like this must initiate in the  strong roots of our society--our tight-knit communities. Our government  must set a precedent of positive influence and etiquette so that  progress and compromise can finally begin. We must work to create a  climate of dialogue instead of hostile debate, both in communities and  gradually on a national scale. Civility in politics is the foundation  of the progress we need to make in the coming years. Actively working  towards an attitude in politics that allows us to work in a bipartisan  fashion, and incorporate doubt in our convictions and empathy in our  approach is the only way we can ensure the survival of our American  political system as it was intended.        Livia Greenberg, Stratton Mountain School, Junior, Finalist    The chest closes as the throat tightens like a python strangling its  prey, the skin burning as it breaks out in angry hives and rashes,  forcing one to claw at their body as a lack of oxygen begins to shut  down vital organs. This is an allergic reaction--one that can be  experienced by the 15 million Americans with food allergies, one of  whom sent to the hospital due to a reaction every three minutes. The  device used to stop reactions, called an EpiPen, can be made for thirty  dollars; however, the lifesaving instrument retails for 600 dollars.  The exorbitant price of the EpiPen is a result of domination over the  healthcare market, with nothing stopping the company from raising  prices exponentially. Unfortunately, the EpiPen is not the only example  of why monopoly capitalism is an immoral system that abuses the  consumers who are in need of medical help. Multiple monolithic  companies are forcing those with medical needs to pay prodigious  amounts for necessities, a practice that must be broken apart with  government intervention.   Shattering medical monopolies needs to be one of the country's  priorities, and the most feasible solution to do so is to create a new  act that would outlaw inflexible patents and bolster smaller companies  financially. The federal government currently uses three anti-trust  acts as a guideline for what is a legal or illegal trust, but because  none of the acts address copyright, colossal companies have avoided  punishment by patenting products or drugs in a manner that makes an  alternative product illegal to sell. Even remotely similar products  have been banned by the FDA and are not allowed to be sold. By creating  a law that prohibits exceedingly unalterable patents, cheaper products  would be allowed into the healthcare market. With a government loan,  small-scale companies can develop the alternative competition, which  would drive the companies that currently have a monopoly into lowering  their prices in order to sell their product. In addition to reducing  the cost of medical necessities, the consumers would have more freedom  to choose which product they trust in case of an emergency and better  access to medication essential for life.   While both an ethical and economic issue, trusts are a problem that  can be solved with strong government action that keeps the wellbeing of  the American citizens at the forefront of concern. No one in the United  States should die because of an inability to afford medication due to  corporate greed. Creating a new anti-trust act will allow for more  companies to develop and sell vital medications at a more accessible  price, and will stop companies from nailing in innocent people's  coffins.           Seth Harte, Burlington High School, Freshman, Finalist    I'm the kid that dreams of writing movies but is reluctant because  I've heard too many stories of writers that fail. I love soccer and  want to play in the MLS but know how few make it. I want to be an  attorney someday but all I hear is how expensive it is to go to law  school. All of this noise makes me feel like there is no way to  succeed. But can't I try? I am starting to believe that we close the  door before we can open it because defeat feels inevitable. Our society  does not see the beauty in failing so we instead we just quit. I  believe this is because of our history, our grading systems, and social  media.   We learn from an elementary school age that we should never fail and  this philosophy is exhibited repeatedly throughout our schooling and  into adulthood. We are taught that to mess up is the worst thing we can  do because we have survived so long with a  [[Page S796]]  mindset that believes we will succeed. Although believing in ourselves  is good it makes it hard for us to fail with dignity and the knowing  that messing up is okay. According to MedBroadcast, one of the main  reasons for suicide is because of failure. We just can not handle  failing, in fact, we cannot deal with it so much that we end everything  because of a setback.    Our grading system has made it so only a specific type of learner  will succeed. It has also taught us that the word failure means that we  have been defeated or we did something wrong. The reality is that if we  tried we didn't fail. I believe that children should not be punished  for that. Psychology Today said that one of the leading reasons for  stress for students was the need to get A's. I believe that Vermont  should lean toward proficiency-based learning because it gets away from  the letter grade and lets kids learn at their own pace.   Social media has taken the 21st-century teens by a storm. According  to a 2015 study, the Washington Post said that teens consume nine hours  a day of social media. As a teenager myself, I constantly see examples  of people showing off their success which is nice; however, it makes a  lot of people feel bad about themselves. We should work towards a goal  of producing more positive content.   Our views of failure are false and missed interpreted, however, if  you can treat failure as not what we've been taught all our lives but  treat it as a way to improve as a human race and individuals we will  grow tremendously know that one failure will not determine your life,  getting straight A's are not needed to succeed and that there is more  behind what looks like that perfect photo. If I can go through life  believing this I know I will become that pro soccer player, that  attorney or that writer.         Alexis Jablonski, St. Johnsbury Academy, Senior, Finalist    Aldous Huxley, the author of ``Brave New World,'' seems to have  predicted the Trumpian era of disillusion and fear of immigrants.  However, the basic idea of welcoming immigrants is central to our way  of life; our diversity makes us stronger. Unfortunately, these values  are being threatened. Current immigration policy is shifting toward  exclusion of immigrant populations and has awakened an anti-immigrant  sentiment that does not align with the historical importance of  immigration in the U.S. These concepts are essential to America's  identity of inclusivity, and they need to be protected as we have gone  under such a dramatic shift in power and ideals. Trump continually  spews blatant falsehoods which undermine that character of immigrant  communities, in order to secure his campaign promise of a wall. It has  become evident that our president will continue to use hateful  rhetorical devices toward immigrant populations simply for his own  benefit. When in fact, his beliefs and promises do not align with that  of the American people. As demonstrated in Huxley's novel, when we  isolate those we deem as the other, we are constricting our growth as a  nation.   A prime example of an attempt to dehumanize and marginalize people  through the news is Trump's commentary on the Migrants passage through  Mexico. Trump has continually used fear tactics to dehumanize outsiders  and justify our hostility toward them. The media typically presents the  migrants through an overhead image of a crowd, thus neglecting their  humanity. ``The Caravan'' is an excuse to not view people as human.  According to our president, they are rapists, drug dealers, killers,  deceitful, job stealing terrorists coming in by the thousands. This  information is simply false, and aimed to incite fear among Americans.  Unfortunately today, our President's hateful rhetoric toward outsiders  has reframed our former charitable nature toward immigrant populations.  The image of the migrant people must be adjusted. We must look at their  faces to see their individual humanity, rather than a single entity.   We must remember the pillars by which our Nation was founded on,  those of which make it great. The fundamental notion of inviting  immigrants into our communities and providing them with equal  opportunities to thrive is integral to our lifestyle. We have promised  ourselves as Nation to provide stability to outsiders. We are an entire  nation based on blended cultures and thoughts; these values are what  offer us strength.   During Donald Trump's presidential campaign Americans were fascinated  by his explosive personality. Unfortunately, over the past two years,  we have learned that was not merely a campaign tactic. His continual  attacks on American democracy have activated catalysts for change. We  will no longer stand by, entranced and misinformed. We must encourage  activism and open discussion to promote understanding, we must evaluate  our media consumption and make educated decisions, and we must actively  seek the truth, in a world that is overwhelming us with inflamed  rhetoric. Only then, will we escape this self-inflicted Brave New  World.        Simon Rosenbaum, Vermont Commons School, Freshman, Finalist    When I was thirteen, I had twenty-one cents thrown at me. For a  moment, I didn't process what was happening. I looked up to see one of  my classmates looking back at me, waiting to see how I would react. I  left the change on the table, and left the lunchroom in the direction  of my next class. Instead, I shut myself in a bathroom stall and cried.  My name is Simon Rosenbaum and I've been Jewish my entire life. I wear  a yarmulke to school and often can't attend school events that are on  Friday nights because they interfere with the sabbath. However, I  haven't always practiced self-acceptance.   I began wearing a yarmulke halfway through seventh grade. I remember  weeks of emotional preparation for the snide remarks and lost friends  that were sure to come. Before the morning bell had even rung, my  kippah had already been grabbed and torn off. This was the result of  the few Jewish kids in the school pretending that they weren't Jewish  for fear of retribution from their classmates. I'm sad to say that they  were right. Vermont is an extremely non-diverse state. According to Pew  Research Center, over 93% of Vermonters are white, and approximately  94% of Vermonters are Christian or have majority Christian heritage.  Approximately two percent of Vermonters are Jewish, out of the eight to  eleven percent of Vermonters that practice non-Christian faiths. These  non-diverse societies lead to non-tolerant kids.   When I was in eighth grade, a paraeducator made Mein Kampf required  reading for students who she did not believe were working hard enough.  I later learned that she only engaged in this behavior around Jewish  students. To this day, she works in a Vermont middle school after a  school investigation ``didn't find any incriminating evidence''. Anti- Semitic incidents are far more commonplace in schools today then most  educators like to admit. According to a study for The Washington Post,  in 2018 a study reported that 69% of young Jews in America said that  they had ``personally experienced discrimination because of their  faith''. This is up from 39% in 2013 from the same study.    We can solve the issue of anti-Semitism in our schools by a variety  of actions. We should begin by instituting diversity experts as  consultants on three month pilot periods in every Vermont school to  observe systematic and ignorance based anti-semitism. Those consultants  would then make recommendations in the changing of diversity education  to the school board. If the board were to refuse the recommendations by  the consultant, the consultant could then appeal to the State Board of  Education. Another course of action we should be taking is to create a  zero-tolerance policy on anti-Semitism both inside and outside of  schools. If kids are shown the right examples while seeing the wrong  ones punished, then the precedent will be set for an effective change  in our diversity education. No educated child or adult would ever take  joy from a thirteen year old crying in the bathroom.             Andy Siki, Winooski High School, Senior, Finalist                                Climate Change    ``It's not enough to think it's important. We must make it urgent,''  says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswoman from New York.   Vermont is taking action on global warming by reducing energy use and  investing in clean energy. It is accomplishing these goals by using low  carbon transportation, protecting farms,  [[Page S797]]  making the community green and resilient, and recycling and composting.  By 2050 Vermont should be using 90% of clean energy sources. I'm part  of The Youth Lobby For Climate Change. We organize an annual rally at  the State House to show legislators that young people care about their  future. We talk about what we're doing right now, our future as a  state, and what will help our communities.   In 2016 electricity made up 28% of emission in our environment. Solar  power and other renewable energy sources can reduce that number.  Vermont already started putting solar panels in homes, businesses, and  schools to make a cleaner environment. Recently Elon Musk made a Tesla  battery to store the energy from solar panels inside a house. The  length of Vermont winters might make that storage difficult, but that's  a problem we need to fix. By using solar energy, Vermont could reach  the goal of using 90% renewable energy sources by 2050. Transportation  makes up 28% of the CO2 emissions. And Vermont can reduce this  greenhouse gas emission. We could have more bikes on the road, even an  electric assisted bike and a bike path. Karl Kemnitzer works with solar  bikes, and he said: ``Bikes and solar are a good combination, and it's  also been a lot of fun! An average solar panel puts out around 16 watts  per square foot . . . the bike is so efficient. I find that over a long  term, I am using about 200 watts on average as I ride along.''  Kemnitzer now needs to fit enough solar panels on a bike. He's taking  an engineering class and working on that problem.   Schools should start getting students involved in their community.  Schools can help affect our environment by recycling, reducing, and  composting food waste. At the Youth Climate Leaders Academy students  from Vermont and New Hampshire came together to make goals for their  schools. We worked on composting and made a goal to start composting by  January 2019. We would start in our classrooms then move to the  cafeteria.   Everyone wants to take action to change things but not everyone does.  At the Climate Leaders Academy I learned that you have to start by  making small changes and that will lead to big changes. If Vermonters  fix the small problem in their communities, we can not only affect the  whole state but also influence other states around us.     Ragulan Sivakumar, South Burlington High School, Junior, Finalist                                The Waste Land    In the year 2015, the United States produced 262.4 million tons of  waste, 130.63 million tons of which were landfilled. That is equivalent  to 2.23 lbs./day/American person of waste landfilled. Landfilling at  such a great rate requires us to create new landfills, taking away from  scenic beauty while also requiring us to use more natural resources to  create new products, costing us with long-term sustainability as well.  To address the United States' waste problem, taxes must be put on the  producers of materials that become waste, a governmental recycling  program must be created, and stricter recycling laws must be imposed.   Firstly, a landfill tax should be imposed on producers to reduce the  net amount of waste. Landfills they take up areas that could otherwise  be used and lose us many recyclable components, making them a detriment  economically. Environmentally, landfills enhance climate change by  forcing decomposition to occur anaerobically, producing methane, which,  according to the EPA, is over 25 times as efficient as carbon dioxide  at trapping heat. Since landfills hurt economically and  environmentally, a landfill tax should be imposed by ton of waste. This  tax would cause producers to reduce their landfill waste while also  creating an incentive for corporations to create more sustainable and  effective waste management programs. As the United Kingdom has shown, a  landfill tax can be incredibly effective, reducing the number of  landfills by 2/3 in 8 years. With the passing years, the tax could  progressively increase, further incentivizing the movement from waste,  reducing our waste problem all the while.   Secondly, a governmental recycling program should also be created to  complement the landfill tax. While the waste-reducing reasons are  obvious, the other incentive is that recycling is a massive industry.  As China has shown, recycling is a $200 billion industry. Thus, the  United States could create its own governmental recycling program via  some of the revenue from the landfill tax project, providing countless  jobs while also alleviating our waste problems by making waste  management feasible. Moreover, the recycling program would obtain the  base materials for industry through recycling which could then be  resold off, making the entire ordeal economically viable while also  reducing our waste.   Lastly, stricter recycling laws must be imposed. According to the  EPA, only 67% of paper is recycled, 26% of glass, 34% of metals, and 9%  of plastics, making it is obvious that stricter recycling laws are  needed. Imposing a fine for violators would ensure that recycling  guidelines are followed. Since no one would want to incur a fine for  something so menial, stricter recycling laws would enable the U.S. to  tackle the waste problem.    In summation, the U.S. has a waste problem and must address the  issue. We cannot continue with 130.63 million tons of landfilled waste  each year. By implementing the policies noted above, our country would  no longer be ``the waste land'': it would be a model for the rest of  the world in waste management.             Fiona Therese, Compass School, Sophomore, Finalist    There is a picture of me on the wall, near our kitchen table. It was  taken when I was five years old and entering kindergarten. I was  wearing a yellow dress and wearing a big sun hat. The girl standing  next to me, Ashley, was leaning on me and smiling. She was to become my  best friend.   School is supposed to be safe and fun. It's supposed to be where you  learn about new things and experiment with new ideas. It's supposed to  prepare you for challenges in the future. But today, too many of us are  scared of school because we don't know what might happen while we are  there. I was ten when I heard about the shooting in Sandy Hook. It was  the first time I realized that school might also be unsafe and that  someone might want to harm us. The state of our country is one of  confusion for us, as students. We are expected to go to school trusting  that nothing can happen. But the truth is, every day across the country  there are reports of gun violence. Even in my small school, we have  drills so that we'll know what to do if someone comes to school to  attack us.   In 2018, 113 people have been killed or injured in a school shooting.  On average, a shooting takes place at least once every eight days that  school is in session. After a shooting takes place, I have heard what  people express their sympathy through `thoughts and prayers.' The time  for prayers is over. We need change. Children should not fear going to  school. I should not have to look around my classroom and plan a  possible escape. I should be able to go to school with the same  optimism that I had when I was five.   The state of our union is one of fear because our country has not  passed adequate gun control. How many people need to speak out about  their lost children, family or friends before a change happens?   Guns rights advocates argue that our right to bear arms is protected  in the Constitution. I disagree. I believe that the Constitution is a  living document, one that transcribes our aspirations and hope. In a  letter to James Madison in 1789, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ``No society  can make a perpetual constitution. The earth belongs always to the  living generation and not to the dead.'' It is time to demand change.  The state of our union might be one of fear, but I have also seen hope.  The hope that I see comes not from our legislature in Washington, D.C.,  but in the protests across the country. My generation is on the move.  We are working hard to make our country and our schools safe again.  Although these are difficult times, I have seen that even young people  can be powerful when they work together. The state of our union is in  the hands of those who protest, those who march, those who write  letters, and those who demand change. So what is the state of our  union? It's one where fear must be met with strength and I'm proud to  be a member of a generation who is rising up to meet the challenges  that lie ahead.  [[Page S798]]                    Henry Wu, Essex High School, Junior, Finalist    It is the year 2060. You and your grandchildren are watching the  charred Earth slowly recede from view within your space capsule. ``What  happened?'' they ask. You breathe a deep sigh fraught with regret and  anger as you reluctantly tell the story of the Earth's demise.``It all  began in the 1970s . . . .''   When Exxon researchers learned that the burning of fossil fuels  influences climate, they hid their findings from the public. Other  fossil fuel companies were complicit in denying the existence of the  greenhouse effect for decades. Today, the oil and coal industries are  still the main drivers of carbon emissions, and $20 billion in annual  U.S. government subsidies perpetuates our dependence on them.   ``Our hunger for oil and coal was insatiable. We ate and ate, but it  poisoned us. We loved our cars and our plastics, but they killed us . .  . .''   The use of fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, and plastic  production releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat.  Rising global temperatures and more severe and frequent natural  disasters have already devastated human lives. In as few as twelve  years, rising sea levels and droughts will lead to severe food  shortages, heightened political instability, and widespread poverty. A  recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report found that  limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 deg.C, the target of the  Paris Agreement, will still cause $54 trillion in damage.   ``Back in Vermont, I was a teenager when I first noticed the  unbearable summer heat that made breathing difficult and forgot what a  white Christmas felt like. These were merely inconveniences, but that  all change in a few years. The searing wildfires and crippling  hurricanes that made headlines in California and the Carolinas soon  became commonplace. Entire cities vanished from the map because they  were submerged underwater. Could we have avoided this?''   The efforts of individuals--taking shorter showers, using public  transit, going vegetarian--can only do so much, but it's large  companies that wield influence over our government and society. A  carbon tax that fines businesses for pollution is an effective method  of keeping them in check. It's a regenerative economic measure that  could fund renewable energy research and implementation.   However, ordinary citizens still must help avoid catastrophe. In the  end, our politicians and business leaders have a say in our nation's  energy infrastructure, but it is our duty to convince them to adopt  necessary changes. We must write to our members of Congress and tell  them to resist corporate power. We must elect officials who will  champion a carbon tax, and we must fulfill our end of the deal in  giving up fossil fuels for renewable energy sources. So, what story  will we tell our grandchildren? A lament of despair and regret, or a  tale of teamwork and hope? The decisions we make today will provide the  answer. Breaking our fossil fuel addiction and investing in renewables  are drastic yet necessary efforts. The best time for action was forty  years ago, but the next best time is now.                            ____________________     Mr. President, all across our country--in Vermont, in  Illinois, in California--all across this country, people are asking a  very simple question. That question is, How does it happen that in the  midst of the extraordinary wealth that exists in our country--how does  it happen that so many people continue to hurt financially and struggle  desperately to keep their heads above water economically?   Today, despite unemployment being relatively low, some 40 million  Americans continue to live in poverty. We don't talk about poverty very  much here in the Senate, but we have 40 million Americans living in  poverty. Many of them are struggling to adequately feed their kids.  Many of them are forced to go, despite working, to emergency food  shelters just to stay alive.   Despite the United States having a GDP--gross domestic product--of  more than $20 trillion, we in this country embarrassingly continue to  have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country  on Earth. We don't talk about that either. Children are obviously the  future of America, and we continue to have one of the highest rates of  childhood poverty of any major country, and that includes 29 percent of  African-American children who live in poverty.   How does it happen that in a so-called booming economy--and we hear  from President Trump every other day about how the economy is booming-- the bottom 40 percent of our population does not have $400 in cash in  order to address a financial emergency? Think about that. The bottom 40  percent--almost half of Americans--don't have $400 in their pocket, in  the bank to address a financial emergency. Maybe the car breaks down,  maybe the kid gets sick, maybe one loses one's job, maybe one undergoes  a divorce; something happens, and 40 percent of the American people  don't have $400 in the bank to address that crisis.   In other words, today--and we saw this in the recent government  shutdown; today in America, many, many millions of families live  paycheck to paycheck in order to survive. That should not be happening  in the wealthiest country on Earth, and it is time we begin to talk  about that. It is not good enough to talk about a so-called booming  economy, forgetting about tens of millions of families who are not  seeing that booming economy but, in fact, are living under incredible  financial stress.   How does it happen that, in the so-called booming economy, tens of  millions of American workers today are working for wages that are so  low they cannot afford the escalating cost of housing? Some of them are  spending 40, 50 percent of their limited incomes on housing. For many  of these people, there is no health insurance available; the idea of a  vacation for the family is something not even to be thought about; and  the idea of being able to send one's kids to college is something that  is also not on the table. By the  [[Page S808]]  way, many of these individuals are working two or three jobs, 50, 60,  70 hours a week, just to survive.   This, again, is the wealthiest country in the history of the world.  Yet 30 million Americans today, as we speak, have zero health  insurance--no health insurance at all; 41 million people are  underinsured--which means their deductibles and their copayments are so  high that even though they have insurance, they still can't afford to  go to the doctor, and one out of five Americans today cannot afford the  prescription drugs their doctors prescribe.   In my view--a view I have held for a very, very long time, and it is  a view shared by people not only in this country in wide numbers, but  all over the world--healthcare is a human right, not a privilege.  Whether you are rich or whether you are poor, you have the right to go  to a doctor when you get sick, and you have the right to know that if  you end up in a hospital, you are not going to go bankrupt or suffer  from financial distress.   We are an aging population--no great secret there. We are an aging  population. In this Congress, instead of dealing with government  shutdowns precipitated by the President, we should be talking about how  we respond to the reality of an aging population. Yet what we don't  talk about is that about half of older Americans--half of older  Americans, those 55 and older--have no retirement savings and no idea  about how they will retire with dignity.   Think about what that means. Somebody is 60 years of age, they are  coming to the end of their work-life, and they have no money--or  virtually no money--in the bank. Maybe all they are going to get is  Social Security. They turn on the TV, and they hear folks around here  talking about cutting Social Security. Talk about why people in this  country are angry and why they are stressed out.   Here is the bottom line. We are the wealthiest country on Earth. In  fact, we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world, but  despite that wealth, a significant percentage of our population--our  children, our elderly people, our working men and women--struggle each  and every day to keep their heads above water economically. Not only  are they struggling, I think the pain they are feeling has to do with  the worry they have about the future for their kids because they know,  as many of us know, that unless we make some bold changes in our  economy, the younger generation today will have a lower standard of  living than their parents.   Imagine that--a so-called booming economy, yet we are looking at a  situation where the younger generation may well have a lower standard  of living than their parents.   I want to also say a word about another reality that currently  exists. While so many of our people are struggling, while so many of  our children are living in poverty, while 20 percent of folks on Social  Security are trying to live on less than $13,000 a year, there is  another pervasive reality in American society today; that is, the  people on top--the very wealthiest people in this country--have never  had it better, and the gap between the very, very rich--I am not just  talking about the rich; I am talking about the very, very rich--is  growing wider.   Here is the simple truth, a truth that we virtually never talk about  here in the Senate, a truth that is not heard much in the corporate  media; that is, the United States of America today has the most unequal  distribution of wealth and income of almost any major country on Earth,  and that level of inequality is worse today than at any time since the  1920s, the so-called Gilded Age of American society.   Today, if you can believe it, the three wealthiest people in this  country--three--own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 160  million people. Let me repeat that. The three wealthiest people in this  country own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 160 million  people. Today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent--not 1 percent; one-tenth  of 1 percent--own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.  Today, and since the Wall Street crash in 2008, about 46 percent of all  new income goes to the top 1 percent. Roughly speaking, half of all new  income goes to the bottom 99 percent, and half goes to the top 1  percent, and our great task here in the U.S. Senate is to keep the  government open while Trump tries to shut it down. Maybe, just maybe,  we should be talking about those issues. Maybe, just maybe, we should  be talking about an economy that works for all of us, not just the  people on top.   Today, the top 25 hedge fund managers on Wall Street--25 hedge fund  managers--earn nearly double the income of all 140,000 kindergarten  teachers in America.   What all of the psychologists tell us is that the most important  years of a human being's development are 0 to 4. Those are the most  impressionable years in terms of how we develop intellectually and  emotionally, and our childcare workers, our kindergarten teachers play  a very important role. Does anybody think it makes sense that you have  25 hedge fund managers on Wall Street who, today, earn nearly double  what 140,000 of our kindergarten teachers make? By the way, public  teachers in America are falling further and further behind other  occupations.   Having stated that reality--the fact that the middle class is  struggling and the fact that the people on top are doing phenomenally  well--I think it is fair to ask what the views are of the Republican  leadership here in the Senate--Republicans control the Senate--and what  our Republican President, President Trump, is proposing to address  these massive levels of injustice and inequality. Three people own more  wealth than the bottom half of America. What does the President and  what does Leader McConnell have to say about that? The sad truth is  that the Republican leadership today wants to make an embarrassingly  bad situation even worse.   After passing a $1 trillion tax giveaway for the top 1 percent and  large corporations last year, Republican leadership is coming back and  saying: Hey, we only gave 83 percent of the tax benefits to the 1  percent. That is not good enough. That is not good enough. We have to  do even better for our billionaires and corporate sponsors.   This time, the Republican leadership and the President want a tax  break of hundreds of billions of dollars that would go exclusively to  the wealthiest of the wealthy. I am not talking about the wealthy; I am  talking about the wealthiest of the wealthy--the top one-tenth of 1  percent, the wealthiest 1,700 families in America.   We have 127 million families in our country--a population of some 320  million people. As I have indicated, many of these families are  struggling. Many of these families are hurting. Today, many of these  families are wondering how they are going to pay their rent, pay their  mortgage, keep their lights on. Yet the legislation to repeal the  estate tax that Senator McConnell and President Trump are proposing  would benefit less than the top one-tenth of 1 percent of them--99.9  percent would see no tax reduction from the legislation.   Can anyone actually imagine bringing forward a piece of legislation  that does not help the bottom 99.9 percent? Can you imagine that? The  middle class are struggling. The gap between the rich and the poor is  growing wider. There are 30 million people without health insurance.  Our infrastructure is crumbling. And they come forward with a piece of  legislation that is designed to protect and benefit the top one-tenth  of 1 percent. The legislation would be of no benefit to 99.9 percent of  the people of this country.   I think it is clear that when the people of this country look at  Congress and say ``Those folks in Washington are not representing me.  They are representing their wealthy campaign contributors. They are  representing the billionaire class,'' there can be no clearer example  of that reality than this proposed legislation.   Once again, with all of the economic problems, all of the inequality  we face, imagine legislation that comes forward from the Republican  leadership and the President that benefits the top one-tenth of 1  percent--the 1,700 wealthiest families in this country.   It is no secret that our infrastructure--our roads and our bridges,  water systems, airports, wastewater plants--is crumbling all over this  country. All over this country, there are major infrastructural  problems. But I hear over and over again: We don't have the  [[Page S809]]  funding to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and put millions of  Americans to work at good-paying jobs rebuilding that infrastructure.  We just don't have the money.   Our schoolteachers are underpaid, but we don't have the money to  provide attractive salaries in order to get the best and the brightest  to do the most important work in this country; that is, teaching our  young people.   Today, we have veterans--people who put their lives on the line-- sleeping on the streets, but we don't have the money to house them.   Families in America cannot afford childcare, and public schools are  underfunded.   We don't have the money to address those crises, but somehow we do  have hundreds of billions of dollars available to provide tax breaks  for the top one-tenth of 1 percent.   We apparently have enough money to provide the Walton family--the  wealthiest family in America, the folks who own Walmart, the people who  pay their own employees starvation wages--by repealing the estate tax,  as Senator McConnell and President Trump would like to do, we have  enough money to provide the Walton family, the wealthiest family in  America, with a tax break of up to $63 billion. Veterans sleep out on  the street, teachers are underpaid, and 30 million Americans have no  health insurance. We can't address those issues, but we do have  legislation that would provide up to $63 billion in tax breaks for one  family.   We have, apparently, enough money available to provide the Koch  brothers--a family who spent some $400 million during the midterm  election to help elect Republican candidates; the Koch brothers, one of  the wealthiest, most politically active families in America--we have  enough money to provide them with up to a $39 billion tax break.   Under this legislation, we can provide a tax break of up to $27  billion to the Mars candy bar family and up to a $13.4 billion tax  break to the Cox cable family.   In other words, at a time of massive needs in this country, we don't  have enough money available to protect working families and the middle  class, but we certainly have more money than we know what to do with in  order to give incredible tax breaks to the richest people in this  country.   The estate tax that we are going to be proposing does not give  massive tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country--quite the  contrary. It says to those people that at a time of massive income and  wealth inequality, instead of repealing the estate tax, we must  substantially increase this tax on the multimillionaires and  billionaires of this country and in doing that, not only come up with  much needed revenue to address the needs of working families but also  to reduce wealth inequality in America.   That is why this week I will be introducing legislation for an estate  tax bill that would do exactly the opposite of what my Republican  colleagues propose to do. Let me briefly explain what is in the  legislation I am offering.   Under my bill, anytime someone inherits an estate in America of $3.5  million or less, that person will not pay one penny in estate taxes.  They will get to keep that inheritance tax-free. That population  includes 99.8 percent of the American people. The legislation I am  proposing would not raise taxes by a penny on 99.8 percent of the  American population.   If you are in the top two-tenths of 1 percent of the population--the  population that inherits over $3.5 million--your taxes will, in fact,  be going up, and they should be going up.   My legislation establishes a 45-percent tax on the value of an estate  between $3.5 million and $10 million, a 50-percent tax on the value of  an estate between $10 million and $50 million, a 55-percent tax on the  value of an estate in excess of $50 million, and a 77-percent tax on  the value of an estate above $1 billion. In other words, this bill  begins to create a progressive tax system in America, which is based on  ability to pay.   I know some may think otherwise, but the truth is, this is not a  radical idea. From 1941 through 1976, the top estate tax rate was, in  fact, 77 percent on estate values above $50 million. Back to 1976, the  top estate tax rate was 77 percent.   This bill would also close tax loopholes that have allowed  billionaire families, such as the Waltons, to pass fortunes from one  generation to the next without paying their fair share of taxes.   Under this legislation, the families of all 588 billionaires in our  country, who have a combined net worth of over $3 trillion, would pay  up to $2.2 trillion in estate taxes.   Let me make a confession here. This idea, this approach, was not  developed by Bernie Sanders. It is not a new idea. More than a century  ago, a good Republican President named Teddy Roosevelt fought for the  creation of a progressive estate tax to reduce the enormous  concentration of wealth that existed during the Gilded Age.   What is really quite remarkable is that what Teddy Roosevelt talked  about over 100 years ago during the Gilded Age of the 1920s, when  little children were working in factories and fields and the wealthiest  people were enjoying incredible wealth and luxury--the idea Teddy  Roosevelt proposed then is as relevant today as it was back then. Let  me quote what Teddy Roosevelt said more than 100 years ago:         The absence of effective state, and, especially, national       restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a       small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful       men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power.       The prime need is to change the conditions which enable these       men to accumulate power. Therefore, I believe in a graduated       inheritance tax on big fortunes, properly safeguarded against       evasion and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the       estate.    That was Teddy Roosevelt over 100 years ago. What Roosevelt said then  is absolutely true for today.   From a moral and an economic perspective, our Nation will not thrive  when so few people have so much wealth and power and so many people  have so little wealth and power. This wealth and income inequality is  not only unjust and unfair; the truth is, it is a real threat to our  economy and our democracy.   We need a tax system in this country that tells the billionaire class  that they are going to have to pay their fair share of taxes so that we  do not have 30 million people without health insurance, so that we do  not have young people graduating college $50,000, $100,000 in debt, so  that we do not have an infrastructure that is crumbling, and so that we  do not see our great country moving toward an oligarchic form of  society where a handful of families enjoy incredible wealth and power  at the expense of everybody else.   In my view, the fairest way to reduce wealth inequality, to invest in  the middle class and working families of our country, and to preserve  our democracy is to enact a progressive estate tax on the inherited  wealth of multimillionaires and billionaires. That is exactly what I  will be proposing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, all across our country--in Vermont, in  Illinois, in California--all across this country, people are asking a  very simple question. That question is, How does it happen that in the  midst of the extraordinary wealth that exists in our country--how does  it happen that so many people continue to hurt financially and struggle  desperately to keep their heads above water economically?   Today, despite unemployment being relatively low, some 40 million  Americans continue to live in poverty. We don't talk about poverty very  much here in the Senate, but we have 40 million Americans living in  poverty. Many of them are struggling to adequately feed their kids.  Many of them are forced to go, despite working, to emergency food  shelters just to stay alive.   Despite the United States having a GDP--gross domestic product--of  more than $20 trillion, we in this country embarrassingly continue to  have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country  on Earth. We don't talk about that either. Children are obviously the  future of America, and we continue to have one of the highest rates of  childhood poverty of any major country, and that includes 29 percent of  African-American children who live in poverty.   How does it happen that in a so-called booming economy--and we hear  from President Trump every other day about how the economy is booming-- the bottom 40 percent of our population does not have $400 in cash in  order to address a financial emergency? Think about that. The bottom 40  percent--almost half of Americans--don't have $400 in their pocket, in  the bank to address a financial emergency. Maybe the car breaks down,  maybe the kid gets sick, maybe one loses one's job, maybe one undergoes  a divorce; something happens, and 40 percent of the American people  don't have $400 in the bank to address that crisis.   In other words, today--and we saw this in the recent government  shutdown; today in America, many, many millions of families live  paycheck to paycheck in order to survive. That should not be happening  in the wealthiest country on Earth, and it is time we begin to talk  about that. It is not good enough to talk about a so-called booming  economy, forgetting about tens of millions of families who are not  seeing that booming economy but, in fact, are living under incredible  financial stress.   How does it happen that, in the so-called booming economy, tens of  millions of American workers today are working for wages that are so  low they cannot afford the escalating cost of housing? Some of them are  spending 40, 50 percent of their limited incomes on housing. For many  of these people, there is no health insurance available; the idea of a  vacation for the family is something not even to be thought about; and  the idea of being able to send one's kids to college is something that  is also not on the table. By the  [[Page S808]]  way, many of these individuals are working two or three jobs, 50, 60,  70 hours a week, just to survive.   This, again, is the wealthiest country in the history of the world.  Yet 30 million Americans today, as we speak, have zero health  insurance--no health insurance at all; 41 million people are  underinsured--which means their deductibles and their copayments are so  high that even though they have insurance, they still can't afford to  go to the doctor, and one out of five Americans today cannot afford the  prescription drugs their doctors prescribe.   In my view--a view I have held for a very, very long time, and it is  a view shared by people not only in this country in wide numbers, but  all over the world--healthcare is a human right, not a privilege.  Whether you are rich or whether you are poor, you have the right to go  to a doctor when you get sick, and you have the right to know that if  you end up in a hospital, you are not going to go bankrupt or suffer  from financial distress.   We are an aging population--no great secret there. We are an aging  population. In this Congress, instead of dealing with government  shutdowns precipitated by the President, we should be talking about how  we respond to the reality of an aging population. Yet what we don't  talk about is that about half of older Americans--half of older  Americans, those 55 and older--have no retirement savings and no idea  about how they will retire with dignity.   Think about what that means. Somebody is 60 years of age, they are  coming to the end of their work-life, and they have no money--or  virtually no money--in the bank. Maybe all they are going to get is  Social Security. They turn on the TV, and they hear folks around here  talking about cutting Social Security. Talk about why people in this  country are angry and why they are stressed out.   Here is the bottom line. We are the wealthiest country on Earth. In  fact, we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world, but  despite that wealth, a significant percentage of our population--our  children, our elderly people, our working men and women--struggle each  and every day to keep their heads above water economically. Not only  are they struggling, I think the pain they are feeling has to do with  the worry they have about the future for their kids because they know,  as many of us know, that unless we make some bold changes in our  economy, the younger generation today will have a lower standard of  living than their parents.   Imagine that--a so-called booming economy, yet we are looking at a  situation where the younger generation may well have a lower standard  of living than their parents.   I want to also say a word about another reality that currently  exists. While so many of our people are struggling, while so many of  our children are living in poverty, while 20 percent of folks on Social  Security are trying to live on less than $13,000 a year, there is  another pervasive reality in American society today; that is, the  people on top--the very wealthiest people in this country--have never  had it better, and the gap between the very, very rich--I am not just  talking about the rich; I am talking about the very, very rich--is  growing wider.   Here is the simple truth, a truth that we virtually never talk about  here in the Senate, a truth that is not heard much in the corporate  media; that is, the United States of America today has the most unequal  distribution of wealth and income of almost any major country on Earth,  and that level of inequality is worse today than at any time since the  1920s, the so-called Gilded Age of American society.   Today, if you can believe it, the three wealthiest people in this  country--three--own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 160  million people. Let me repeat that. The three wealthiest people in this  country own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 160 million  people. Today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent--not 1 percent; one-tenth  of 1 percent--own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.  Today, and since the Wall Street crash in 2008, about 46 percent of all  new income goes to the top 1 percent. Roughly speaking, half of all new  income goes to the bottom 99 percent, and half goes to the top 1  percent, and our great task here in the U.S. Senate is to keep the  government open while Trump tries to shut it down. Maybe, just maybe,  we should be talking about those issues. Maybe, just maybe, we should  be talking about an economy that works for all of us, not just the  people on top.   Today, the top 25 hedge fund managers on Wall Street--25 hedge fund  managers--earn nearly double the income of all 140,000 kindergarten  teachers in America.   What all of the psychologists tell us is that the most important  years of a human being's development are 0 to 4. Those are the most  impressionable years in terms of how we develop intellectually and  emotionally, and our childcare workers, our kindergarten teachers play  a very important role. Does anybody think it makes sense that you have  25 hedge fund managers on Wall Street who, today, earn nearly double  what 140,000 of our kindergarten teachers make? By the way, public  teachers in America are falling further and further behind other  occupations.   Having stated that reality--the fact that the middle class is  struggling and the fact that the people on top are doing phenomenally  well--I think it is fair to ask what the views are of the Republican  leadership here in the Senate--Republicans control the Senate--and what  our Republican President, President Trump, is proposing to address  these massive levels of injustice and inequality. Three people own more  wealth than the bottom half of America. What does the President and  what does Leader McConnell have to say about that?

I am not talking about the wealthy; I am  talking about the wealthiest of the wealthy--the top one-tenth of 1  percent, the wealthiest 1,700 families in America.   We have 127 million families in our country--a population of some 320  million people. As I have indicated, many of these families are  struggling. Many of these families are hurting. Today, many of these  families are wondering how they are going to pay their rent, pay their  mortgage, keep their lights on.

Veterans sleep out on  the street, teachers are underpaid, and 30 million Americans have no  health insurance. We can't address those issues, but we do have  legislation that would provide up to $63 billion in tax breaks for one  family.   We have, apparently, enough money available to provide the Koch  brothers--a family who spent some $400 million during the midterm  election to help elect Republican candidates; the Koch brothers, one of  the wealthiest, most politically active families in America--we have  enough money to provide them with up to a $39 billion tax break.   Under this legislation, we can provide a tax break of up to $27  billion to the Mars candy bar family and up to a $13.4 billion tax  break to the Cox cable family.   In other words, at a time of massive needs in this country, we don't  have enough money available to protect working families and the middle  class, but we certainly have more money than we know what to do with in  order to give incredible tax breaks to the richest people in this  country.
