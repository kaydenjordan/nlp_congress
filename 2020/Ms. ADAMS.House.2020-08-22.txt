 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for her  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 8015, the  Delivering for America Act. Our courageous postal workers and letter  carriers have been essential in keeping our country on track during  this pandemic. More of us than ever are relying on the U.S. Postal  Service to safely deliver medication and mail in a timely manner. But  now, this handpicked Postmaster General is engineering an  unconstitutional assault against the Postal Service from the inside  out.   I saw it myself just yesterday in Charlotte. Mail sorting machines  have been reassembled and removed. Workers are being prohibited from  working overtime. Letters and packages are piling up.   I was proud to help lead the charge of Chairwoman Maloney, Chairman  Connolly, and Mr. DeFazio earlier this month in a letter we wrote to  Speaker Pelosi. Now, I am proud to vote in favor of protecting the  essential institution. The U.S. Postal Service has been delivering for  us our entire lives. Now it is time that we deliver for them and for  America.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 8015.
