 Madam President, I ask to speak as in morning business  for 1 minute.    Madam President, Iowa continues to flood and in some  cases reflood. Since March, Iowa has been inundated with water on both  the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers and their tributaries. In the past  several weeks, there have been multiple tornadoes causing havoc as  well.   I am pleased that Congress passed a supplemental bill that will  provide some additional funds for recovery. However, I know we have  many challenges ahead of us, both for the people living in Iowa and  those who represent Iowa. Also, it would not surprise me if, after the  final tallies of the disaster that has been done through floods and  other natural disasters, we will need additional appropriations before  the end of the fiscal year.   I look forward to continuing to work with individuals, communities,  the State of Iowa, and the Federal Government to find ways to help Iowa  recover and come back stronger than ever and, of course, that will help  not only Iowa but other areas of the country that are likewise hit.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
