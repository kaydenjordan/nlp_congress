 Mr. Speaker, please accept this personal  explanation as I was unavoidably detained due to my presence at the  White House for the historic signing of the Abraham Accords between the  United States, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 185 and  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 186.
