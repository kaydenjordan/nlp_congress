 Madam Speaker, I hate no woman or man.   Today, the American people should receive clarity and truth. The  Constitution is the highest law of the land. The President breached and  violated the Constitution of the United States of America. The  President committed constitutional crimes. The President's crimes are  impeachable.   John F. Kennedy said: ``If this country should ever reach the point  where any man or group of men by force or threat of force could long  defy the commands of our court and our Constitution, then no law would  stand free from doubt . . . and no citizen would be safe from his  neighbors.''   The facts are undisputed.   First, President Trump violated his oath of office by placing his  personal political interests above the national interest by scheming to  coerce Ukraine into investigating a potential election opponent.   Second, President Trump betrayed the Nation's interests by  withholding the congressionally agreed $391 million to a fragile ally  against a very strong foe, Russia.   Third, the essential purpose of the scheme concocted by the President  was to enlist a foreign country to help in the 2020 election.   These acts are constitutional crimes and abuse of power. The truth  is, the President did ask for a favor. Those were his own words in the  July 25 call--no mention of corruption, only the mention of the Bidens.   The President was engaged in wrongdoing and is a clear and present  danger. He has a pattern, and his behavior remains a continuing threat  to America's national security.   The truth is that abuse of power does violate the Constitution while  both corrupting and cheating our American democracy. His acts betrayed  the Nation. He must take care to execute laws faithfully.   This is the truth. Why does the truth matter? Because it matters to  the farmer at his or her plow. It matters to  [[Page H12144]]  the waitress on an early-morning shift. It matters to the steelworker  building America. It matters to the teacher in a fifth grade class. It  matters to a mother kissing her military recruit going off to war.   The Constitution must be preserved. Our laws must be honored and  respected. The bloodshed and sacrifice of fellow Americans cannot be  ignored, trampled on, or rejected.   Our actions on the vote taken today must be for no personal gain or  grandeur.   The bright light of this constitutional democracy has been dimmed  because of his acts. The truth is no longer for all. It is for one man,  Donald J. Trump, his truth, his way.   We must reject that abuse of power because that is not America. No  one is above the law. Alexander Hamilton said impeachment was designed  to deal with ``the misconduct of public men'' and violations of public  trust.    The President has violated the trust. We must  impeach Donald J. Trump.   Madam Speaker, I hate no woman or man. Today the American people  should receive clarity and truth. The Constitution is the highest law  of the land. The President breached and violated the Constitution of  the United States of America. The President committed Constitutional  Crimes. The President's crimes are impeachable.   President John F.

The facts are undisputed. First, President Trump violated his oath of  office by placing his personal and political interest above the  national interest by scheming to coerce Ukraine into investigating a  potential election opponent.   Second, President Trump betrayed the national interest by withholding  vital, congressionally appropriated security assistance; $391 Million  to a beleaguered and besieged ally facing armed aggression from Russia,  America's implacable foe.   Third, the essential purpose of the scheme concocted by President  Trump was to enlist a foreign country to help him fix the 2020  presidential election in his favor, the very type of interference most  feared by the Framers.   These acts are Constitutional crimes and an abuse of power.   The truth is this President did ask for a favor--those were his own  words.   The truth is 391 million dollars was withheld. He jeopardized not  only Americans' national security by putting Ukraine at the mercy of  Russia. He also threatened honest and fair elections in 2020. In the  July 25 call--no mention of corruption/only the mention of the Bidens.   The President was engaged in wrongdoing and is a clear and present  danger. His pattern of behavior remains a continuing threat to  America's national security. The truth is that abuse of power does  violate the Constitution, while both corrupting act and cheating our  American democracy. His acts betrayed our nation.   The Framers were concerned about abuse of power as the Judiciary  Committee impeachment report said. The abuse of power was the use of  official power in a way that on its face grossly exceeds the  President's constitutional authority and violates the take care clause  which commands the President to faithfully execute the law--not to  demand a foreign country to investigate his 2020 opponent and deprives  Americans a fair and unfettered right to vote. This is the truth.   Why does the truth matter? Because it is the American way. It matters  to the farmer at his or her plough.   It matters to the waitress on an early morning bus for the breakfast  shift.   It matters to the steelworker helping to build America.   It matters to the teacher in her fifth-grade social studies class.   It matters to a Mother kissing her young military recruit before he  or she goes off to war.   The Constitution must be preserved, our laws must be honored and  respected, the bloodshed and sacrifice of our fellow Americans cannot  be ignored, trampled on or rejected and today our actions on the vote  taken today must be for no personal gain or grandeur.   The bright light of this constitutional Democracy has been dimmed  because of his acts--the truth is no longer for all--it is for one  man--Donald J. Trump--his truth, his way-- we must reject that abuse of  power--because this is not America. No one is above the law.   As Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist, impeachment was  Designed to deal with `the misconduct of public men' which involves  `the abuse or violation of some public trust.' '' The President has  violated that public trust and the House of Representatives must now  protect and defend the Constitution and impeach Donald J. Trump.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record several supporting documents.         The President: I would like you to do us a favor though       because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows       a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened       with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike       . . . I guess you have one of your wealthy people. . . The       server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things       that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding       yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have       the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like       you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that       whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man       named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they       say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do,       it's very important that you do it if that's possible.        President Zelenskyy: Yes it is very important for me and       everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a       President, it is very important and we are open for any       future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on       cooperation in relations between the United States and       Ukraine. For that purpose, I just recalled our ambassador       from United States and he will be replaced by a very       competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard       on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I       would also like and hope to see him having your trust and       your confidence and have personal relations with you so we       can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that       one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently       and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to       travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.       I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody       but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround       myself with the best and most experienced people. I also       wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends       and you Mr. President have friends in our country so we can       continue our strategic partnership I also plan to surround       myself with great people and in addition to that       investigation, I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that       all the investigations will be done openly and candidly. That       I can assure you.        The President: Good because I heard you had a prosecutor       who was very good and he was shut down and that's really       unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they       shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad       people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He       was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would       like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with       the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening       and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that       would be great. The former ambassador from the United States,       the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with       in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know       that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's       son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people       want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the       Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging       that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. .       . It sounds horrible to me.        President Zelenskyy: I wanted to tell you about the       prosecutor. First of all I understand and I'm knowledgeable       about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority       in our Parliament; the next prosecutor general will be 100%       my person, my candidate, who will be approved by the       parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September.       He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the       company that you mentioned in this issue. The issue of the       investigation of the case is actually the issue of making       sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and       will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I       would kindly ask you if you have any additional information       that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the       investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our       country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States       from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It       was great that you were the first one who told me that she       was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her       attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the       previous President and she was on his side. She would not       accept me as a new President well enough.        The President: Well, she's going to go through some things.       I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going       to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the       bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the       prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair       prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is       going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of       assets. It's a  [[Page H12145]]       great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their       incredible people.        President Zelenskyy: I would like to tell you that I also       have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United       States. Actually last time I traveled to the United States,       stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the       Trump.                                   ____       Putin Reclaims Crimea for Russia and Bitterly Denounces the West           (By Steven Lee Myers and Ellen Barry,-- Mar. 18, 2014)         Moscow.--President Vladimir V. Putin reclaimed Crimea as a       part of Russia on Tuesday, reversing what he described as a       historic injustice inflicted by the Soviet Union 60 years ago       and brushing aside international condemnation that could       leave Russia isolated for years to come.        In an emotional address steeped in years of resentment and       bitterness at perceived slights from the West, Mr. Putin made       it clear that Russia's patience for post-Cold War       accommodation, much diminished of late, had finally been       exhausted. Speaking to the country's political elite in the       Grand Kremlin Palace, he said he did not seek to divide       Ukraine any further, but he vowed to protect Russia's       interests there from what he described as Western actions       that had left Russia feeling cornered.        ``Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia in the       hearts and minds of people,'' Mr. Putin declared in his       address, delivered in the chandeliered St. George's Hall       before hundreds of members of Parliament, governors and       others. His remarks, which lasted 47 minutes, were       interrupted repeatedly by thunderous applause, standing       ovations and at the end chants of ``Russia, Russia.'' Some in       the audience wiped tears from their eyes.        A theme coursing throughout his remarks was the restoration       of Russia after a period of humiliation following the Soviet       collapse, which he has famously called ``the greatest       geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.''        He denounced what he called the global domination of one       superpower and its allies that emerged. ``They cheated us       again and again, made decisions behind our back, presenting       us with completed facts,'' he said. ``That's the way it was       with the expansion of NATO in the East, with the deployment       of military infrastructure at our borders. They always told       us the same thing: `Well, this doesn't involve you.' ''        The speed of Mr. Putin's annexation of Crimea, redrawing an       international border that has been recognized as part of an       independent Ukraine for 23 years, has been breathtaking and       so far apparently unstoppable.        While his actions, which the United States, Europe and       Ukraine do not recognize, provoked renewed denunciations and       threats of tougher sanctions and diplomatic isolation, it       remained unclear how far the West was willing to go to punish       Mr. Putin. The leaders of what had been the Group of 8       nations announced they would meet next week as the Group of       7, excluding Russia from a club Russia once desperately       craved to join.        Certainly the sanctions imposed on Russia ahead of       Tuesday's steps did nothing to dissuade Mr. Putin, as he       rushed to make a claim to Crimea that he argued conformed to       international law and precedent. In his remarks he made clear       that Russia was prepared to withstand worse punishment in the       name of restoring a lost part of the country's historic       empire, effectively daring world leaders to sever political       or economic ties and risk the consequences to their own       economies.        Mr. Putin, the country's paramount leader for more than 14       years, appeared to be gambling that the outrage would       eventually pass, as it did after Russia's war with Georgia in       2008, because a newly assertive Russia would be simply too       important to ignore on the world stage. As with any gamble,       though, the annexation of Crimea carries potentially grave       risks.        Only hours after Mr. Putin declared that ``not a single       shot'' had been fired in the military intervention in Crimea,       a group of soldiers opened fire as they stormed a Ukrainian       military mapping office near Simferopol, killing a Ukrainian       soldier and wounding another, according to a Ukrainian       officer inside the base and a statement by Ukraine's Defense       Ministry.        The base appeared to be under the control of the attacking       soldiers, who like most of the Russians in Crimea wore no       insignia, and the ministry said that Ukrainian forces in       Crimea were now authorized to use force to defend themselves.        The episode underscored the fact that the fate of hundreds       of Ukrainian soldiers, as well military bases and ships,       remains dangerously unresolved.        In the capital, Kiev, Ukraine's new prime minister, Arseniy       P. Yatsenyuk, declared that the conflict had moved from ``a       political to a military phase'' and laid the blame squarely       on Russia.        Mr. Putin's determined response to the ouster of Ukraine's       president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, last month has left American       and European leaders scrambling to find an adequate response       after initially clinging to the hope that Mr. Putin was       prepared to find a political solution--or ``off ramp''--to an       escalating crisis that began with the collapse of Mr.       Yanukovych's government on the night of Feb. 21.        Within a week, Russian special operations troops had seized       control of strategic locations across Crimea, while the       regional authorities moved to declare independence and       schedule a referendum on joining Russia that was held on       Sunday.        Even as others criticized the vote as a fraud, Mr. Putin       moved quickly on Monday to recognize its result, which he       called ``more than convincing'' with nearly 97 percent of       voters in favor of seceding from Ukraine. By Tuesday he       signed a treaty of accession with the region's new leaders to       make Crimea and the city of Sevastopol the 84th and 85th       regions of the Russian Federation.        The treaty requires legislative approval, but that is a       mere formality given Mr. Putin's unchallenged political       authority and the wild popularity of his actions, which have       raised his approval ratings and unleashed a nationalistic       fervor that has drowned out the few voices of opposition or       even caution about the potential costs to Russia.        Mr. Putin appeared Tuesday evening at a rally and concert       on Red Square to celebrate an event charged with emotional       and historical significance for many Russians. Among the       music played was a sentimental Soviet song called       ``Sevastopol Waltz.''        ``After a long, hard and exhaustive journey at sea, Crimea       and Sevastopol are returning to their home harbor, to the       native shores, to the home port, to Russia!'' Mr. Putin told       the crowd. When he finished speaking, he joined a military       chorus in singing the national anthem.        He recited a list of grievances--from the Soviet Union's       transfer of Crimea to the Ukrainian republic in 1954, to       NATO's expansion to Russia's borders, to its war in Kosovo in       1999, when he was a little-known aide to President Boris N.       Yeltsin, to the conflict in Libya that toppled Col. Muammar       el-Qaddafi in 2011 on what he called the false pretense of a       humanitarian intervention.        Since Russia's stealthy takeover of Crimea began, Mr. Putin       has said very little in public about his ultimate goals. His       only extensive remarks came in a news conference with a pool       of Kremlin journalists in which he appeared uncomfortable,       uncertain and angry at times. In the grandeur of the       Kremlin's walls on Tuesday, Mr. Putin sounded utterly       confident and defiant.        Reaching deep into Russian and Soviet history, he cast       himself as the guardian of the Russian people, even those       beyond its post-Soviet borders, restoring a part of an empire       that the collapse of the Soviet Union had left abandoned to       the cruel fates of what he described as a procession of       hapless democratic leaders in Ukraine.        ``Millions of Russians went to bed in one country and woke       up abroad,'' he said. ``Overnight, they were minorities in       the former Soviet republics, and the Russian people became       one of the biggest--if not the biggest--divided nations in       the world.''        He cited the 10th-century baptism of Prince Vladimir, whose       conversion to Orthodox Christianity transformed the kingdom       then known as Rus into the foundation of the empire that       became Russia. He called Kiev ``the mother of Russian       cities,'' making clear that he considered Ukraine, along with       Belarus, to be countries where Russia's own interests would       remain at stake regardless of the fallout from Crimea's       annexation.        He listed the cities and battlefields of Crimea--from the       19th-century war with Britain, France and the Turks to the       Nazi sieges of World War II--as places ``dear to our hearts,       symbolizing Russian military glory and outstanding valor.''        He said that the United States and Europe had crossed ``a       red line'' on Ukraine by throwing support to the new       government that quickly emerged after Mr. Yanukovych fled the       capital following months of protests and two violent days of       clashes that left scores dead.        Mr. Putin, as he has before, denounced the uprising as a       coup carried out by ``Russophobes and neo-Nazis'' and abetted       by foreigners, saying it justified Russia's efforts to       protect Crimea's population.        ``If you press a spring too hard,'' he said, ``it will       recoil.''        He justified the annexation using the same arguments that       the United States and Europe cited to justify the       independence of Kosovo from Serbia and even quoted from the       American submission to the United Nations International Court       when it reviewed the matter in 2009.        Mr. Putin did not declare a new Cold War, but he bluntly       challenged the post-Soviet order that had more or less held       for nearly a quarter-century, and made it clear that Russia       was prepared to defend itself from any further encroachment       or interference in areas it considers part of its core       security, including Russia itself.        He linked the uprisings in Ukraine and the Arab world and       ominously warned that there were efforts to agitate inside       Russia. He suggested that dissenters at home would be       considered traitors, a theme that has reverberated through       society with propagandistic documentaries on state television       and moves to mute or close opposition news organizations and       websites.        ``Some Western politicians already threaten us not only       with sanctions, but also with the potential for domestic       problems,'' he said. ``I would like to know what they are       implying--the actions of a certain fifth column, of various       national traitors? Or should we expect that they will worsen       the social and economic situation, and therefore provoke       people's discontent?''

Ukraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it       called a terrorist attack. American intelligence and military       officials said the plane had been destroyed by a Russian SA-      series missile, based on surveillance satellite data that       showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not       its point of origin.        There were strong indications that those responsible may       have errantly downed what they had thought was a military       aircraft only to discover, to their shock, that they had       struck a civilian airliner. Everyone aboard was killed, their       corpses littered among wreckage that smoldered late into the       summer night.        Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, blamed Ukraine's       government for creating what he called conditions for       insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where separatists have bragged       about shooting down at least three Ukrainian military       aircraft. But Mr. Putin did not specifically deny that a       Russian-made weapon had felled the Malaysian jetliner.        Whatever the cause, the news of the crashed plane, with a       passenger manifest that spanned at least nine countries,       elevated the insurgency into a new international crisis. The       day before, the United States had slapped new sanctions on       Russia for its support of the pro-Kremlin insurgency, which       has brought East-West relations to their lowest point in many       years.        Making the crash even more of a shock, it was the second       time within months that Malaysia Airlines had suffered a       mass-casualty flight disaster with international intrigue--      and with the same model plane, a Boeing 777-200ER.        The government of Malaysia's prime minister, Najib Razak,       is still reeling from the unexplained disappearance of Flight       370 over the Indian Ocean in March. Mr. Najib said he was       stupefied at the news of Flight 17, which had been bound for       Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, from Amsterdam with 283       passengers, including three infants, and 15 crew members.       Aviation officials said the plane had been traveling an       approved and heavily trafficked route over eastern Ukraine,       about 20 miles from the Russia border, when it vanished from       radar screens with no distress signal.        ``This is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic       year for Malaysia,'' Mr. Najib told reporters in a televised       statement from Kuala Lumpur. ``If it transpires that the       plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators       must swiftly be brought to justice.''        Mr. Najib said he had spoken with the leaders of Ukraine       and the Netherlands, who promised their cooperation. He also       said that he had spoken with President Obama, and that ``he       and I both agreed that the investigation must not be hindered       in any way.'' The remark seemed to point to concerns about       evidence tampering at the crash site, which is in an area       controlled by pro-Russia insurgents.        Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin also spoke about the disaster and       the broader Ukraine crisis, White House officials said, and       Mr. Putin expressed his condolences. But in a statement       quoted by Russia's RIA Novosti news agency, Mr. Putin said,       ``This tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in       the country, if military operations had not resumed in the       southeast of Ukraine.''        The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting on       the Ukraine crisis for Friday morning.        Adding to Ukrainian and Western suspicions that pro-Russia       separatists were culpable, Ukraine's intelligence agency, the       State Security Service, known as the S.B.U., released audio       from what it said were intercepted phone calls between       separatist rebels and Russian military intelligence officers       on Thursday. In the audio, the separatists appeared to       acknowledge shooting down a civilian plane.        The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry sent reporters a link to the       edited audio of the calls, with English subtitles, posted on       YouTube by the S.B.U.        According to a translation of the Russian audio by the       English-language Kyiv Post, the recording begins with a       separatist commander, identified as Igor Bezler, telling a       Russian military intelligence official, ``We have just shot       down a plane.''        In another call, a man who seems to be at the scene of the       crash says that a group of Cossack militiamen shot down the       plane. He adds that it was a passenger jet and that the       debris contains no sign of military equipment. Asked if there       are any weapons, he says: ``Absolutely nothing. Civilian       items, medical equipment, towels, toilet paper.''        Asked if there are any documents among the debris, the man       says, ``Yes, of one Indonesian student.''        Myroslava Petsa, a Ukrainian journalist in Kiev, said that       the people in the audio sounded shocked by what they had       found in the wreckage.        By Thursday night, American intelligence analysts were       increasingly focused on a theory that rebels had used a       Russian-made SA-11 surface-to-air missile system to shoot       down the aircraft and operated on their own fire-control       radar, outside the checks and balances of the national       Ukrainian air-defense network.         ``Everything we have, and it is not much, says       separatists,'' a senior Pentagon official said. ``That said,       there's still a lot of conjecture.''        Russian troops, who have been deployed along the border       with eastern Ukraine, have similar SA-11 systems, as well as       larger weapons known as SA-20s, Pentagon officials said.        Petro O. Poroshenko, Ukraine's president, said he had       called the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, to express his       condolences and to invite Dutch experts to assist in the       investigation. ``I would like to note that we are calling       this not an incident, not a catastrophe, but a terrorist       act,'' Mr. Poroshenko said.        Reporters arriving at the scene near the town of Grabovo       described dozens of lifeless bodies strewn about, many       intact, in a field dotted with purple flowers, and remnants       of the plane scattered across a road lined with fire engines       and emergency vehicles. ``It fell down in pieces,'' one       rescue worker said as tents were set up to gather the dead.       The carcass of the plane was still smoldering, and rescue       workers moved through the dark field with flashlights.        For months, eastern Ukraine has been the scene of a violent       pro-Russia separatist uprising. Rebels have claimed       responsibility for attacking a Ukrainian military jet as it       landed in the city of Luhansk on June 14, and for felling an       AN-26 transport plane on Monday and an SU-25 fighter jet on       Wednesday. But this would be the first commercial airline       disaster to result from the hostilities.        Despite the turmoil, the commercial airspace over eastern       Ukraine is heavily trafficked and has remained open.       Questions are likely to be raised in the coming days about       why the traffic line, which is controlled by Ukraine and       Russia, was not closed earlier.        With the news of the crash on Thursday, Ukraine declared       the eastern part of the country a no-fly zone. American and       European carriers rerouted their flights, and Aeroflot,       Russia's national carrier, announced that it had suspended       all flights to Ukraine for at least three days. The       conspicuous exception was Aeroflot flights to Crimea, the       southern peninsula that Russia annexed in March, a pivotal       point in the Ukraine crisis.        It was unclear late Thursday whether any Americans had been       aboard the flight. Russia's Interfax news agency said there       had been no Russians aboard.        In Amsterdam, a Malaysia Airlines official, Huib Gorter,       said the plane had carried 154 Dutch passengers; 45       Malaysians, including the crew; and 27 Australians, 12       Indonesians, nine Britons, four Belgians, four Germans, three       Filipinos and one Canadian. The rest of the passengers had       not been identified.        Prof. David Cooper, director of the Kirby Institute at the       University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, said that       a prominent AIDS researcher traveling to the 20th       International AIDS conference in Melbourne was among those on       the flight.        Professor Cooper, who was heading to the conference from       Sydney, said he was unaware how many other passengers were       also on their way to the conference, which is scheduled to       start on Sunday.        Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the Donetsk       People's Republic, an insurgent group in eastern Ukraine,       denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything       to do with the crash. He said that they had shot down       Ukrainian planes before but that their antiaircraft weapons       could reach only to around 4,000 meters, far below the       cruising level of passenger jets.         ``We don't have the technical ability to hit a plane at       that height,'' Mr. Purgin said.        Mr. Purgin did not rule out the possibility that Ukrainian       forces themselves had shot down the plane. ``Remember the       Black Sea plane disaster,'' he said, referring to the 2001       crash of a Siberia Airlines passenger jet, bound for       Novosibirsk from Tel Aviv, that the Ukrainians shot down by       accident during a military training exercise.        In comments broadcast on Ukrainian television, Vitali       Klitschko, the mayor of Kiev, said the crash illustrated the       threat to peace in Europe posed by the fighting in eastern       Ukraine. ``This is not just a local conflict in Donetsk and       Luhansk, but a full-scale war in the center of Europe,'' he       said. ``I'm certain the international community this time       will pay attention and understand.''                                   ____                              [From Defense One]     In Ukraine, the US Trains an Army in the West to Fight in the East                        (By Ben Watson, News Editor)         For more than two years, the U.S. military's contingent of       300 or so soldiers have been quietly helping train an       enormous allied military in western Ukraine. Meanwhile,       Russian-backed separatists appear to be keeping pace some 800       miles to the east, showcasing entire parking lots full of new       tanks and artillery just a 15-minute drive from the front       lines.        ``Every 55 days we have a new battalion come in and we       train them,'' said U.S. Army National Guard Capt. Kayla       Christopher, spokesperson for the Joint Multinational       Training Group-Ukraine, at Yavoriv Combat  [[Page H12147]]       Training Center in western Ukraine. ``And at the end of that       55-day period, we'll do a field training exercise with that       battalion.'' The U.S. and partnered armies have trained seven       battalions in the past roughly two years or so.        That's what she calls the ``main line of effort that you       tend to see most of the time in the news.''        Building a host-nation's military, the U.S. has learned       painfully in the 21st century, has rarely been a good news       story. And Ukraine's conflict has largely taken a backseat to       the sequel to one of those stories: the war on ISIS, in which       eight Americans have lost their lives fighting since 2014. In       the same period, Ukraine is believed to have lost nearly       4,000 soldiers to Russian-backed separatists.        Since Crimea was annexed in 2014, the U.S. and partner       militaries have helped grow Ukraine's forces from just over       100,000 troops to nearly 250,000 today. Just since January,       Capt. Christopher's unit of 250 soldiers has added another       3,000 or so Ukrainian soldiers to Kiev's ranks.        ``But that's not the real end state,'' she said.       ``Essentially, what we're trying to do is get them to the       point where they are running their own combat training       center,'' like the U.S. Army's National Training Center at       Fort Irwin, Calif., or the Joint Readiness Training Center at       Fort Polk, Louisiana.        In other words, their task is to build an army's entire       training infrastructure almost from the ground up--a tall       order following decades of not-so-casual corruption that has       plagued Ukraine's and many post-Soviet countries' militaries       across eastern Europe.        ``Our overall goal is essentially to help the Ukrainian       military become NATO-interoperable,'' Christopher said. ``So       the more they have an opportunity to work with different       countries--not just the U.S., but all their Slavic neighbors,       and all the other Western European countries that come'' and       train or exercise with Ukraine's military.        That includes Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Canada, and the       U.K. The U.S. has also sent a variety of non-lethal military       help to Ukraine--equipment like Humvees, medical supplies,       bulletproof vests, and radars to track the hundreds of       artillery shells that have fallen on the eastern Donetsk and       Luhansk regions. Maybe Javelin anti-tank missiles, Defense       Secretary Mattis said in August. But Christopher's unit is       far from the fighting. Their mission is ``training the       trainers'' and in particular, adding to Ukraine's NCO corps--      the stern disciplinarians who help ensure that units are fit       and ready for combat.                            Terrorism in the east         For Ukraine's new soldiers, combat means fighting       terrorists--at least according to the U.S. military's way of       looking at things.        ``They're called anti-terrorism operations rather than       something else because of the issue with the Russian-backed       separatists,'' said Capt. Christopher. ``So they're not       really Russians, you know. They're essentially terrorists.''        So the U.S. calls eastern Ukraine's most troubled regions       an Anti Terrorism Operation zone, or ATO, where those       Russian-backed forces have attacked and counterattacked       Ukraine's soldiers and civilians. (See, for example, this       interactive day-by-day map of alleged shelling by Ukrainian       government and separatist forces.)        In just the first two days of this month, UN monitors       recorded dozens of violations to the Minsk II ceasefire, an       agreement reached in February 2015 between Russia, Ukraine,       France and Germany. The deal never really stuck. It called       for all heavy weapons--tanks, rocket launchers and       artillery--to be pulled away from the front lines and kept in       monitored storage. By that time, more than 5,400 civilians       had already been killed in the fighting. In the months after       Minsk II was signed, the death toll barely slowed.        The UN calls these statistics ``a conservative estimate       based on available data,'' and inevitably incomplete ``due to       gaps in coverage of certain geographic areas and time       periods.'' Military casualties, especially injuries, have       been particularly underreported, the UN says.        Most of the civilians killed in the fighting were killed by       tanks and artillery, 55 percent; followed by IEDs, 36       percent; and small arms fire, 9 percent. For months it       puzzled observers how allegedly local separatists could have       obtained so much heavy weaponry, even factoring in Ukraine's       legacy as a sort of junkyard of old Soviet weapons factories.       The appearance of more advanced equipment--drones and armored       vehicles, for example--revealed Russia's hand in Ukraine as       early as January 2015, although President Vladimir Putin       didn't admit Russia's role until that December. Since then,       their advanced equipment has only grown more sophisticated       and deadly for Ukraine's frontline soldiers.        International ceasefire monitors aren't having an easy go       of their job in 2017, either. During the first six months,       they were restricted from or intimidated through armed       confrontation (see photo below) inside regions mandated by       the Minsk agreement no fewer than 480 times. More than 75       percent of those occurred in separatist-held areas.                                 A world away         U.S. troops are largely kept away from the conflict. That       is by design; the U.S. and the international community have       struggled with the appropriate response to Russia's invasion       of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.        Speaking alongside Ukrainian Prime Minister Petro       Poroshenko in August, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis       said, ``We do not, and we will not, accept Russia's seizure       of Crimea and despite Russia's denials, we know they are       seeking to redraw international borders by force, undermining       the sovereign and free nations of Europe.''        So far, sanctions have been the U.S. and its European       allies' preferred response, hitting Russia's major banks and       energy companies. But President Trump has indicated that he       feels sanctions may not be in the best interest of the U.S.       In August, he complained about a new round of sanctions       passed by Congress, calling it ``seriously flawed.'' But the       measure reached the Oval Office with a veto-proof majority,       and so he grudgingly signed it into law.        But that is a world away from the U.S. Army in Yavoriv, and       even the fighting on the other side of Ukraine feels remote,       Christopher said. ``It's actually pretty remarkable how       little you feel the effect of the conflict on the western       side of Ukraine. It's almost as if nothing is happening,''       she said. ``And if I didn't work directly with soldiers every       day, I don't think you would really know. I mean, we see it       on the news every day, and I work with soldiers every day. So       we know about it. But you go out into Lviv, or any of the       other big cities around this area and you really don't feel       the effects of there being war here.''        Except, perhaps, for the U.S. and NATO soldiers who for       months have had their phones and social media accounts       breached by what appear to have been Russian hackers. On top       of that, Moscow has spent the past few months ferrying troops       around its border with Ukraine and into Belarus for extended       exercises that run from the Barents Sea to the Mediterranean.        So Russia is hardly backing down from a tense region. And       apparently, neither is the U.S. Despite the Trump       administration's hesitancy, its approach in Ukraine is not       terribly different from the Obama administration's.        ``The U.S. will continue to press Russia to honor its Minsk       commitments and our sanctions will remain in place until       Moscow reverses the actions that triggered them,'' said       Mattis in August during the visit with Ukraine's Poroshenko.        For its part, Moscow's latest move has been not to reverse       its annexation of Crimea, but rather to fence off some 30       miles of land on the seized peninsula. One Russian lawmaker       even said in May that Moscow would use nuclear weapons if the       U.S. or NATO tried to enter Crimea.        Which would suggest that the U.S. Army's quiet mission in       Ukraine may go quietly on for many, many months to come.
