 Madam Speaker, before I begin my remarks, let me  thank my colleagues, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx and Congressman    David Price, for their beautiful, moving tributes to our colleague,  Walter Jones.   I wasn't an intimate friend of Walter's, but we did have a  friendship. Each encounter that I had with him was special because he  always had an eye toward that which was higher, noble, and good.   I heard some of the sentiments Members expressed, heartfelt  sentiments of loss, but also a great tribute and honor to this  extraordinary man who did try to rise above the difficulties and the  tensions here. I think both his life and his death taught us invaluable  lessons, and frankly, I think it is what the American people are  longing for from this body as well. So I thank the gentlewoman very  much for doing this.   Madam Speaker, tonight, I would like to talk about two women, two  women from very different places, two women from very different  cultures and different religions, two women with very different  stories. Together, these two women, differently and separately, are  reinterpreting in light of what was so that they can imagine what will  be.   The first woman's name is Nadia Murad. Nadia won the Nobel Peace  Prize in 2018. I know Nadia. She is a Yazidi from northern Iraq. The  Yazidis are a people bound by an ancient faith tradition, and they have  sought to live in peace in very harsh surroundings through the  centuries. Along with the Christians of the area, they have endured  many persecutions for a very long time. But nothing could have prepared  Nadia for what happened on August 15, 2014.   Nadia lived in a little village called Kawju in an area called  Sinjar, again, in northern Iraq. The town's residents were mostly  farmers and shepherds. At 21 years old, Nadia dreamed of owning her own  hair salon and becoming a history teacher. But then the unthinkable  happened.   The Islamic State, ISIS, invaded her village. ISIS rounded up  everyone and forced them into the schoolyard. The men were then  separated from women. As Nadia told us, she said that she never  realized how small her village was until she saw all of them in that  schoolyard.   They stood huddled on the dry grass. Some whispered to one another,  wondering what was going on. Others were silent, in shock. No one  understood what was happening, as Nadia said to us.   Nadia was then forced to watch as six of her brothers were massacred.  Her mother was executed along with 80 other older women. The bodies of  the men and women were then thrown into mass graves.   The rest of the women, including Nadia, were taken to Mosul, the  largest city held by ISIS at that time, and they were sold. They were  sold as sex slaves.   The depravity of ISIS further unfolded as they sought to carry out a  genocide, a complete extermination of Christians, Yazidis, and other  religious minority traditions in that area. The Yazidis were singled  out for persecution by ISIS because they were part of a Kurdish- speaking religion without a holy book.   Using that background as justification, what was called the ISIS  Research and Fatwa Department targeted women for sexual slavery in an  effort to lure young men into joining their cause. ISIS' twisted  bureaucracy of barbarity even prepared a document on this, and it was  called ``Questions and Answers on Taking Captives and Slaves.''   True to the dictates of the ISIS document, Nadia was bought and sold  several times, with Facebook used as one of the prime ISIS marketing  tools. She was repeatedly raped, burned with cigarettes, and beaten. At  one point, she attempted to escape, but she was caught. The vicious  gang rape that then ensued left her unconscious. She decided not to try  to escape again.   After months of unspeakable agony, one day, Nadia discovered that a  door had been left unlocked, and she fled. She found refuge with a  Muslim family who willingly helped her. In fact, the eldest son, at  great personal risk, took her in his car and got her to the Kurdish  lines where she was safe.   I was first introduced to Nadia by some friends in Lincoln's Yazidi  community. Through an interesting convergence of things, Lincoln,  Nebraska, which is my home, has the largest Yazidi population in  America. Many of the young men had served as our translators during the  height of the Iraq war.   Interestingly, one of the first pieces of legislation that I worked  on was to give special visas accommodating people to come to America  who had risked their lives alongside our troops, some of whom died, and  they were given special status to come here. Many have made their home  in Nebraska, and I am very proud of that.   When Nadia came to see me, I could sense the trauma in her face and  the wounds in her soul, so I tried to gently ask Nadia if she would be  willing to share her full story with those of us there in my office. I  told her that I thought it was important that we hear, in order to try  to understand, but only if she wanted to. She again gently answered  back that, yes, she would share her story.   She walked us through her nightmare. At one point, I looked over at  her Yazidi translator. Tears streamed down his face. My own chief of  staff sobbed. It was just too much to bear.   But in a real moment of pride for me, Madam Speaker, 1 month ago  today, Nadia Murad was my guest right here in the House Chamber for the  State of the Union. I was happy to see her again, and she gave me a  copy of her book called ``The Last Girl.'' Her fiance was with her,  Abid Shamdeen. What a gentle young man. He had served as well as a  translator at the height of the Iraq war and had earned his citizenship  to America.   Before the State of the Union event, Nadia and I spent about an hour  with a reporter from The Washington Post. The beautiful gift of  watching her interact with this reporter was this: She answered the  questions clearly, with great grace and purposeful resolve, as Abid  lovingly stood by her and translated her words and the full meaning of  them.    She was in Washington to raise awareness of the Yazidi genocide and  join us in the call for a new type of security settlement in northern  Iraq that would protect the ancient mosaic, the ancient tapestry of  religious pluralism that once existed there, including Christians and  Yazidis, as well as certain Islamic minority traditions.   While that was her primary motive before that reporter and us, again,  she gently and profoundly articulated the need to respect human  dignity. She used that pain in her soul to project healing on our  broken world.   Madam Speaker, when I first came to Congress, an older Member warned  me about something. He called it the tyranny of the urgent. He said to  be careful of the tyranny of the urgent, because what that will do is  subsume you into emergency after emergency without leaving any time for  reflection, for thought, for dialogue, for relationship.   We see that played out day after day, and, of course, the media begs  this as issues switch and controversies arise, and we are all summoned  to give various opinions on whatever negative thing just happened. The  tyranny of the urgent, we have to be careful of that because it robs us  of the chance to sit with a heroic woman like Nadia and listen  carefully to what she has to say.   This hour-by-hour D.C. and 911 fire alarm is distracting us from this  essential work of reflection and authentic governance. It is true now  more than ever.  [[Page H2351]]    A lot of what goes on here is outside the glare of television.  Recently, I had the chance to engage the Administrator of the United  States Agency for International Development who had come before the  House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and  Related Programs. I talked to him about a number of issues that were  important to me: the country of Haiti, the prospects for reforestation  around the world, conservation, the story of Nadia and so many Yazidis,  and this need for the new security settlement in northern Iraq.                                time  2045    The American people are generously helping with economic aid, under  the leadership of the Agency for International Development, to help  potentially create the conditions in which Yazidis and Christians could  return and once again flourish.   This was foremost in my mind as I spoke with the administrator in the  committee hearing. But I told the administrator this, that the name-- the name itself, the United States Agency for International  Development--really does not capture the fullness of the mission of  what we are trying to do.   Ultimately, this mission and our disposition, as reflected in policy,  ought to be about one thing expressed in two words: human dignity-- protecting human dignity and, in doing so, attacking the root causes of  poverty and attempting to create for the 21st century an imaginative  architecture for diplomatic relations, again, rooted in authentic  service to America's humanitarian impulse, creating the conditions for  international stability which are inextricably intertwined with our own  national security.   This is a properly oriented foreign policy trajectory of our Nation,  and, again, it is based on the idea that America's impulse is to be  charitable, America's impulse is to help--yes, to demand responsibility  but, also, to help create the conditions in which human life can  flourish.   This has profound meaning, Madam Speaker, where I live, particularly  in Nebraska, because one of the ways in which we express, in practical  terms, that humanitarian impulse is through agricultural policy. We  feed ourselves, and we feed the world.   Nebraska has a big role in doing just that, and this is true now more  than ever in our modern age. The land has been the source of our  vitality in America.   Particularly where I live but, really, across the country,  agriculture is so essential to our economic well-being, our life, our  way of life, our culture, to who we are as a people.   And again, where I live, production agriculture is so essential, in  corn and soybeans and livestock that cover much of our landscape. They  are an important part of America's export prowess.   The farm communities' and the ranch communities' efficiency, their  quality, their ingenuity allows us to provide food security for tens of  millions of vulnerable people in America and abroad, while ensuring  that Americans enjoy the lowest per capita grocery bills in all the  world.   Now, the challenge and the opportunity is to grow America's farm  family. And to look to the future, we should look to the past to see,  again, in this new century, a new connection starting to occur between  the urban and the rural.   This diversification of our farm family is happening rapidly, and so  we, importantly, are no longer talking in the language of producers and  consumers but, rather, in terms of connecting the farmer to the family.   You can now meet your farmer at the local farmers market. That is a  level of intimacy not seen since the early days of agriculture in  America.   What is at stake here, Madam Speaker, is this desire to bring people  closer to their food and into an authentic relationship with those who  grow that food.   Agriculture is creating an exciting new entrepreneurial space, and we  have seen a real uptick in young people entering the ag field. Young  people are being drawn to agriculture through exciting new niches,  including artisanal foods and crops, organics, and the farm-to-fork  movement.   Agricultural studies no longer sit off on the side in their own silo.  They are inextricably intertwined, an intimate relationship with  environmental science and conservation, as well as international  development.   Restaurants that focus on locally sourced foods are also growing in  popularity, and with that trend comes an increased interest in the food  of indigenous peoples--all exciting new spaces.   Still, at the heart of Nebraska and at the heart of America is the  traditional, large-scale American farm.   At the beginning of this, Madam Speaker, I talked about two women.  And we have heard about Nadia Murad, who is living with a deep wound  yet seeking ways to rebuild what once was a thriving tradition.   I want to talk about another woman I recently met now, though, a  fascinating young woman who has merged the millennial sense of  authentic connection with a traditional production ag operation.   Hannah Esch is an agricultural student at the University of Nebraska  in Lincoln and a Nebraska beef ambassador.   Hannah was surprised when she recently visited some young children in  a classroom in one of our counties and, when asked a basic question  about where food comes from, a third grader answered that eggs come  from cows since they are next to the milk in the grocery store. This  alarmed Hannah a bit, but it reinforced Hannah's desire to go deeper  into ag education and outreach.   Hannah is a specialty livestock producer with a fascinating  background as an agriculture pioneer. She is a part of a growing  movement of young agricultural entrepreneurs. She is a passionate  advocate for production agriculture, while also seeking emerging niche  opportunities.   In Nebraska, the average age of the farmer is 58 years old. I don't  know exactly what it is across the country, Madam Speaker, but I assume  it is somewhat similar.   What we have on our hands is, on the horizon, a generational  transfer. But there is also an interesting convergence of amazing new  opportunity on that same horizon.   Two dynamics are on the verge of breaking out: small-scale farm  production and the nimble, innovative use of technology in agriculture.   I met Hannah at an ag pioneers event organized by the Agribusiness  Entrepreneurship program at the University of Nebraska.   The businesses of these cutting-edge ag leaders range from organic  popcorn production to ag tech in the Internet of Things. Others were  leaders in the farm-to-table movement, boutique vegetable growers, and  specialty livestock sellers. Some were large grain producers  experimenting with cover crops that would enhance the soil and also  advance their own innovation in the precision agriculture space.    Not everybody in this room was young. Not everybody came from farm  families, interestingly. But what they shared was a passionate desire  to add value to traditional production agriculture and create the space  for a new food movement that is showing tremendous potential.   Of course, at that meeting, given this body recently passed a new  farm bill, an important piece of legislation that does basically one  thing--provides food security in two ways: The risk management policies  that protect agriculture producers from the vagaries, the ups and  downs, of weather, the supply problems as well as other difficulties  that arise in ensuring that a timely, good harvest is delivered, that  is the purpose of the farm bill, combined with its other purpose, to  help those who are in food-vulnerable circumstances through our  nutrition programs. We discussed the policies embedded in the farm  bill, including the value-added grants section and the assistance that  we give to beginning farmers and ranchers.   Another of the participants were the Brugger brothers. They were  engaging young people who could honestly, Madam Speaker, star in a  reality TV show.   They are adding enormous value to the farm commodities they produce.  These twins not only distill corn and raise cattle; they create a  sequence of value across multiple agricultural products, from hops to  whiskey to finished meats. Their vertical integration puts the value in  the value chain--in their pocket. That is an exciting entrepreneurial  place to be.   These brothers, however, are about more than food. They also want to  lure  [[Page H2352]]  members of their younger generation back to the small town. They want  to build community around artisanal agriculture.   This connectivity around food is one of the value propositions that I  wanted to highlight here that Hannah holds so dear. She has grown her  own premium brand of beef through the power of story.   Using Instagram and photos and video, Hannah sells her livestock  product directly via the Internet to a diverse range of customers from  around the country who yearn to know the provenance of their food.   Hannah draws interest in her beef by showing the life cycle of her  cattle, and, through compelling use of social media, she invites  customers into the intimate process of livestock production. Her  market, again, is to a world hungry for the authentic story behind what  is for dinner.   Madam Speaker, with Hannah and other ag pioneers, we are experiencing  a bit--or the front end, should I say?--of an emerging set of ideas  that will help shape our social and economic well-being for this  century. It is the entrepreneurial drive that these young people  possess to be stewards of the land, to grow the ag family, and to  create the space for genuine food relationship.   This millennial-driven movement signifies an embrace of the  traditional human-scaled model of agriculture for which our society is  yearning, while remaining firmly within and adding to the mainstream of  production agriculture that feeds America and feeds the world.   So what do Hannah and Nadia hold in common? I think they are  connected. They are from very different lands. They speak different  languages. They have different cultural mores.   What they are driving for is meaning around human dignity. Whether it  is Nadia, who has suffered the horrible loss of her family and her  extraordinary tradition--she is being driven by a purpose to pull out  of that tragedy deep meaning and projecting that on the world, speaking  to our hearts clearly through her suffering about the need for human  dignity.   It is our only way out, to express and rebuild our systems of  governance, our foreign relations, and our economics around this idea  of interconnectedness with respect for human dignity. It is a very  important driver, even in the life of an entrepreneur like Hannah, who  seeks, again, the authenticity of food relationship. I think there is  an intimate connection here between two women from two very different,  faraway places.   Madam Speaker, my wife was telling me recently--and I venture out  here a little bit because I don't know the name of this art form. It is  my understanding there is a type of porcelain that is very, very  delicate and fragile; and, if it should break, it is actually repaired  by gold so that, as beautiful as the original piece was, it becomes  more vibrant, more offering. Its brokenness shows more beauty.   In listening to Nadia and her deep woundedness and watching her young  fiance lovingly escort her through the storytelling of her wounds to  the world, it is that porcelain being repaired by gold, and it shines  all the more beautifully.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
