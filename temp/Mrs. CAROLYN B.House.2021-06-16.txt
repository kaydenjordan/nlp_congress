 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 256, Congresswoman  Lee's legislation to repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military  Force against Iraq.   In 2002, Congress voted to authorize the use of force against Iraq  based on what would later prove to be false, baseless, and misleading  intelligence provided by the Bush administration. A year later, Saddam  Hussein was overthrown; a democratic government was established; and,  finally, in 2011, a formal declaration of the end of our mission was  announced.   But 10 years later, this authorization for the use of force remains  on the books.   We must repeal this 19-year-old authorization that has been used and  abused to justify expansive military actions across the globe. If we  are serious about preventing forever wars, we must repeal the AUMF and  exercise Congress' constitutional authority to declare war and peace.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  legislation.                     Increasing Corporate Board Diversity     MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I also rise in  support of H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor  Protection Act, and, specifically, the Meeks-Maloney amendment that we  will consider today.   We show our priorities by our actions; and, today, we are not just  talking about diversity, we are acting to improve diversity in the  corporate boardroom.   I want to thank Mr. Meeks, the sponsor of this amendment. He and I  have worked on this issue a long time together, and I thank him for his  leadership.   The goal of our amendment, the Improving Corporate Governance Through  Diversity Act, is extremely important, increasing diversity on  corporate boards. This is something I believe in passionately; and  while we have made great progress, we still have a long way to go.   Getting more women, minorities, and individuals from historically  underrepresented communities into corporate leadership positions is  extremely important. Leaders set the tone, and they set the priorities.  [[Page H2823]]    Back in 2015, I asked the Government Accountability Office to look at  the gender makeup of corporate boards, and the results were  discouraging, and they convinced me that we need to do more.   Women make up roughly 47 percent of the workforce, yet they hold  roughly 29 percent of corporate board seats. The GAO found that even if  we assume that equal proportions of women and men started joining  boards starting right now, it would take more than 40 years for there  to be an equal number of women and men in the corporate boardrooms.   We can't wait 40 years for parity. Something needs to change.   But let's also be clear: Increasing diversity on corporate boards is  not just a moral issue; it is good for business, too. Study after study  has shown that companies with greater diversity on their boards perform  better financially, which is why investors want the companies they  invest in to make diversity a priority.   In fact, I started working on this bill at the request of investors  and investor organizations that wanted to more easily be able to track  diversity on boards.   This legislation would help investors accomplish this by requiring  public companies to report the voluntary, self-identified racial,  ethnic, gender identity, and sexual orientation composition of their  board members and executive officers in their annual proxy statement.                                time  1015    By putting this information in one place for investors, the bill  would help investors to quickly sort the companies that do and do not  have diverse boards.   The legislation would also establish a diversity advisory group at  the SEC, which would study strategies to increase diversity on  corporate boards because the truth is that making meaningful progress  on board diversity is going to require a range of different policies in  addition to the improved disclosures in this legislation.   The diversity advisory group at the SEC would continue to study these  issues and would continue to make recommendations of best policies for  the future.   I urge my colleagues to support this effort, support this bill,  support our amendment, and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1187.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 479, I call up the bill (S. 475) to amend title 5, United  States Code, to designate Juneteenth National Independence Day as a  legal public holiday, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Member have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on S. 475.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Today, I rise in strong support of S. 475, the Juneteenth National  Independence Day Act.   I thank my good friend and colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee, for  introducing the House companion bill, H.R. 1320, which has over 170  cosponsors.   This bill would establish Juneteenth, which is celebrated on June  19th, as a Federal holiday.   Our Federal holidays are purposefully few in number and recognize the  most important milestones in our country's history. I cannot think of a  more important milestone to commemorate than the end of slavery in the  United States.   At the end of the Civil War in 1865, hundreds of thousands of people  remained enslaved, despite the Emancipation Proclamation being issued  nearly 2 years earlier.   On June 19, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger traveled to Galveston,  Texas, and issued General Order Number 3, which declared that all  slaves are free. That is when 250,000 enslaved individuals in Texas  finally learned that they were free. The celebration that they held in  Galveston on that day is the basis for the Juneteenth celebrations  today.   Juneteenth is considered the longest-running African-American holiday  marking the end of slavery in the United States, and it has been  celebrated across the Nation for over 150 years.   First known as Jubilee Day, Juneteenth is marked by food, music, and  fellowship. These celebrations honor freedom, recognize life, and  uplift the complex history and the beautiful culture of the African- American community.   Forty-seven States and the District of Columbia have made Juneteenth  a public holiday, including my own State of New York.   While millions of Americans have celebrated this important day for  generations, the Federal Government has failed in its responsibility to  recognize its significance. Today, we can change that.   It is often said that those who do not remember their past are doomed  to repeat it. If we want to confront the sins of slavery and move  forward towards a more equitable, fair, and free society, it is  incumbent upon us to recognize not only our past evils, but the moments  of triumph over those evils.   Making Juneteenth a Federal holiday is a crucial step in remembering  our past, and it will undoubtedly help us build a better future.   I thank Senator Ed Markey for his longtime leadership on this bill.  As a result of his hard work, yesterday, the Senate unanimously passed  S. 475 to make Juneteenth an official Federal holiday. Democrats and  Republicans passed it unanimously.   Senator Cornyn, a conservative Republican from Texas, stated: ``The  freedom of all Americans that Texas celebrates every Juneteenth should  be celebrated all across the Nation. The passage of this bill  represents a big step in our Nation's journey toward equality.''   In this time of increasing partisanship, Senator Cornyn's strong  support speaks to the importance and urgency of this bill.   I also thank again my good friend, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,  who has been advocating for Juneteenth to be a Federal holiday for over  12 years. This bill would not be possible without her steadfast support  and hard work.   It is now our responsibility to swiftly pass this bill and finally  enshrine this important celebration in national law. As we strive  toward a more perfect Union, it is critical that we acknowledge the  national significance of Juneteenth. This day not only honors the past  and celebrates the present, but it offers an opportunity to reflect  upon ways to create an even more just society.   I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this  vitally important bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York.

In closing, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Sheila  Jackson Lee, who had the honor of presiding in the Speaker's chair over  this important historic legislation on which she worked for over a  decade. Her bill, H.R. 1320, to establish Juneteenth Independence Day,  has well over 166 cosponsors and bipartisan support.   I, likewise, want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus for their  leadership on this and for their leadership on so many other important  issues to our Nation.   Juneteenth is celebrated across our Nation. It marks the end of a  very dark chapter in our Nation's history and celebrates the promise of  a more hopeful and inclusive tomorrow. I am elated that this bill is  before the House.   I urge passage of S. 475. I urge bipartisan support, and I hope this  vote is unanimous and victorious.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, on that I demand  the yeas and nays.
