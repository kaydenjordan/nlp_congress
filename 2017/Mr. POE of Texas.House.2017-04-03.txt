 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking  member, Mr. Sherman, for his cosponsorship of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, North Korea was on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list  for 20 years. It was taken off in 2008 for purely diplomatic reasons.   North Korea agreed to freeze and disable its nuclear program as the  result of international efforts known as the Six-Party Talks. In  exchange, the United States decided to remove North Korea from the  State Sponsors of Terrorism list.   Fast forward 9 years later, North Korea remains off the list while it  races toward the capability to send a nuclear warhead to American  shores. There has been no secret about this. Little Kim has said he  wants to send intercontinental ballistic missiles to the United States.   North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests since 2008. Recent  satellite images suggest that it is preparing for yet another nuclear  test.   North Korea is also doing all the things that got it placed on the  State Sponsors of Terrorism list in the first place. North Korea  harbored Japanese Red Army terrorists who participated in the hijacking  of a jet in 1970. These terrorists are still living happily in North  Korea today. Press reports suggests that little Kim is even arming and  training Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists.   A U.S. district court actually found in 2014 that North Korea  materially supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah against Israel.   North Korea has also moved toward a new form of terrorism: cyber  warfare. We all remember the 2014 North Korea cyber attack against Sony  Pictures that included direct threats against its employees and a  warning to ``Remember the 11th of September 2001.'' In March of 2015,  North Korea launched a cyber attack against nuclear power plants in  South Korea.   North Korea is not just active over cyber. It has a long history of  actually killing folks, dissidents in particular, all over the world.  In February, North Korean agents killed little Kim's half brother in  Malaysia using a chemical VX nerve agent.   North Korea has helped Assad develop chemical weapons. Thankfully,  Israel took out those chemical weapons some time ago.   Mr. Speaker, North Korea's actions have not gotten any better. They  have only become more dangerous and more treacherous. In addition,  North Korea is working with Iran, the world's number one state sponsor  of terror, on developing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic  missiles.   It is clear that North Korea is a state sponsor of terrorism. At the  very least, the State Department should go back to the drawing board  and assess whether or not North Korea meets the criteria for  designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. And that is what this bill  does, H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation  Act.   It is high time we call out little Kim, the loose cannon of East  Asia, for what he is: a terrorist in a terrorist state.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, early this morning, Precinct 3  Assistant Chief Clint Greenwood put on his uniform, secured his badge  over his heart, and he headed off to work.   As he arrived at the courthouse at 7 a.m., shots suddenly rang out.  After the smoke cleared, Chief Greenwood was shot in the neck. His  fellow officers rushed to his aid, and he was airlifted to a nearby  Houston hospital, but it was too late. Texas lost another one of its  finest men in blue.   The suspect is still at large, but not for long. As the investigation  develops, it is still unclear if Deputy Chief Greenwood was  specifically targeted or if he was ambushed because he wore the  uniform. Law enforcement will do everything in their power to find and  apprehend the murderous outlaw.   Chief Greenwood dedicated 30 years of his life to the law. I knew  Clint when I worked as a judge in Houston, Texas. He was a prosecutor.  He was a defense lawyer. He worked for the sheriff's department, and  now more recently as a member of the constable's office. He was of  strong character and a proud Texas lawman.   Texas prays for Chief Greenwood's family and the Harris County,  Texas, constable's office. Our men and women who wear the badge are the  best we have. They protect and serve our communities. Chief Greenwood's  life may be gone, but his memory serves as a reminder of all those who  give their lives for the thin blue line. Back the blue, Mr. Speaker.  Back the blue.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
