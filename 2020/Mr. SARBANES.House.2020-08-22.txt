 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the committee  for yielding.   I support this bill strongly.   I want to speak a little bit to what the Postmaster General  acknowledged--admitted--yesterday. He called it a dip in service. He  finally admitted that after being pressed extensively on it.   I want to tell you what the dip looks like in my district.   So, in all of 2019, our constituent service folks opened 11 cases to  deal with delays and service problems with the mail--11 cases in 2019.  So far this year, there have been 106.   Now, I am not talking about people who are just calling in and  complaining because the mail is late and then they hang up the phone  and so forth. This is where they have got real concerns about what is  happening and they ask us to open a case. There have been 106 this year  compared with 11 last year, and 103 of those in the last 4 weeks.   That is not a dip in service. That is a collapse of service, and it  tracks exactly to the time that Louis DeJoy has been on the job.   Here is what is so terrible: When you attack the Postal Service from  within, which is what he is doing, it has the effect of trying to  separate the postal workers from the public that trusts them.    Over 90 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the Postal  Service. We have to restore that bond. That is what this legislation  does.
