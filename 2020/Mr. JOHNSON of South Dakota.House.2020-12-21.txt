 Mr. Speaker, I think it was Winston  Churchill who said you can always count on Americans to do the right  thing after they have exhausted all other options.   You know, Congress looks that way to me from time to time. This is  not the process or the timeline or the structure I have argued for.  This COVID-19 package doesn't have all the provisions that I have asked  for. It is clearly not a perfect bill.   Yet, it is the targeted and focused relief that our country needs. It  follows the framework that a bipartisan group of eight Senators and  eight House Members, including myself, unveiled a few weeks ago.   We knew then that it was not a perfect bill, but we knew it was the  way forward. I am proud of the role that I have played and that the  Problem Solvers Caucus has played in breaking this gridlock. I am proud  of the role that we have played in making sure that our economy and our  schools can stay open and that our testing and our vaccine deployment  can be ramped up.   Madam Speaker, this has been a messy week, but this is a good day for  America.
