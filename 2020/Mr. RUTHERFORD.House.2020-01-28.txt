 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of  Mayor Jake Godbold, who served the city of Jacksonville from 1978 to  1987 and, sadly, passed away last week.   Mayor Godbold, or simply ``Jake,'' as we all called him, was a man of  the highest integrity whose contributions to northeast Florida are  seemingly infinite.   One thing I will always remember about Jake was that when he spoke to  you, he made you feel as though you were the only person in the room. I  recall fondly my first interaction with the Mayor occurred actually  when I was a young patrolman on the north side of Jacksonville. And as  an officer, I soon learned every time the Mayor saw a police officer or  a firefighter, he would stop whatever he was doing and would take the  time to speak with that officer or that firefighter.   Jake loved our policemen, our firemen, and our city, and they all  loved him back. He will be dearly missed.               Honoring the Life and Legacy of Robert Shircliff     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Mr. Robert Shircliff of Jacksonville.   Bob lived his Christian faith and was well-known for his giving and  loving character. His extraordinary contributions and service to our  country and local community are truly legendary. Deeply beloved by the  people of Jacksonville, Mr. Shircliff passed away last week at the age  of 91.   He served on the boards of numerous civic groups, such as the  Community Foundation and led countless efforts to support institutions  like St. Vincent's HealthCare, the Jacksonville Symphony, United Way,  and the Cummer Art Museum, just to name a few.   Despite his success, he remained humble and grateful to those around  him. He once said, ``I've tried coming into the office on Saturdays and  changing the world, and I can't do it. But if I come in on Monday, and  I'm surrounded by really good people, anything can happen.''   On behalf of the Fourth District of Florida, I want to offer my  condolences to the many friends and loved ones of Mr. Shircliff. His  service, generosity, and leadership has made northeast Florida a better  place to live, work, and play.   And since Bob's arrival, heaven is truly a better place.                            ____________________
