 Mr. Speaker, how many people must die for Congress to  act and address the severe epidemic of gun violence in America?   We were devastated by the massacres in Newtown; Las Vegas; Orlando;  and most recently in Parkland, Florida. On the Hill today are the  courageous students from the Parkland high school, Marjory Stoneman  Douglas. They came to Washington with one message: for Congress to take  action now on gun violence.   Action doesn't mean holding moments of silence. Action doesn't mean  tweeting thoughts and prayers. Action means passing meaningful  legislation, like the overwhelming majority of Americans are pleading  with us to do.   We should start by banning weapons of war, like the AR-15 and high- capacity magazines. We should allow the CDC to once again research the  causes of gun violence that can better protect our communities. And we  should also act to pass legislation to require universal background  checks.   Yesterday, Democrats filed a motion to force a vote on universal  background checks. Not a single Republican has signed on to the motion.  I implore my Republican colleagues to sign up to call for action  because inaction means that more people will die and more families will  grieve and our students will continue to feel unsafe.                            ____________________
