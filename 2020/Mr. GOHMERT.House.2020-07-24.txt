 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa).  [[Page H3853]]                    Local Governments Need Coronavirus Relief Money     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Banks).             All Americans Should Root for COVID-19 Fight Success     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Shimkus).                      Honoring Gene and Kathleen Shimkus     Madam Speaker, I am greatly appreciative to hear that  about Mr. Shimkus' mom. What an extraordinary woman.   Mr. Shimkus and I both have been blessed in that regard. I know we  both miss our mothers.   My mother was an English teacher. Some people may find that hard to  believe. My mother never quit teaching English even though I had her as  a classroom teacher in the eighth grade, never quit teaching English. I  would come home from football practice and say, ``Oh, I am exhausted. I  am going to go lay down.'' And I would be hit with, ``Oh, what are you  going to lay when you get there?'' ``Okay. I am going to lie down. I  hope you are happy, mom.'' It is important to have a good, loving mom.   It is a blessing to be in a country where there has been more  freedom, more opportunity, more individual assets for more people than  anywhere else. But it is important to take stock because no country  lasts forever. That is just the way of history, and it is important we  learn from history, good and bad.    There are a lot of characters that are represented by statues in this  building that I have serious problems with, the  [[Page H3854]]  background, the things they did. But there is something to be learned  from everyone, the good, the bad, the ugly. It is important because if  you have a good basis in history, then it is easier to see the road  ahead and which roads lead to what.   Many in this country have begun to see that China really does intend  to displace the United States, not just grow alongside it as a  superpower but, ultimately, be the superpower.   I have an article here from a magazine by Charles ``Sam'' Faddis  titled ``The `United Front'--How China Has Co-opted The U.S. Media.''  It starts with a quote from Xi Jinping: ``Wherever the readers are,  wherever the viewers are, that is where propaganda reports must extend  their tentacles.''   The article then points out: ``We are now weeks into what amounts to  a nationwide insurrection,'' and it needs to be looked at.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate Congressman Bilirakis being  here tonight. Great observations, history of family devotion to this  country, very impressive. I appreciate the bringing up of the once  great cathedral being made into a mosque. I had seen it in the news. It  is very concerning.   You look at our country: Where are we going? It helps to know where  we have been.   Mr. Faddis points out that at this time of nationwide insurrection:  ``Monuments have been defaced, statues toppled, and the commercial  centers of our great cities gutted. Yet, throughout, most of our mass  media has characterized violence and lawlessness on an unprecedented  scale as `peaceful protests.' The scope of the destruction has been  concealed. The demands of the anarchists and Marxists rampaging across  America seemingly systematically mischaracterized simply as demands for  justice and reform.   ``What's going on? How, in a nation rooted in the rule of law and  respect for the democratic process, have we reached a point where  violence and lawlessness are not only condoned but championed? Why are  the guardians of the First Amendment seemingly in league with groups  dedicated to destroying existing social order?   ``Some of the explanation no doubt lies in the fact that much of what  passes for our mainstream media is simply so blind in its hate for  Donald Trump that it will support anyone and anything that seems to  oppose him. There are other factors at work, however, and some of what  is transpiring may, in fact, be due to a decidedly anti-American agenda  and the desire of a particular foreign actor not only to damage this  great Nation but to promote its own particular ideology.   ``The Chinese Communist Party uses propaganda and influence  operations as a means of projecting its power and weakening its  enemies. Chief amongst the targets for these kinds of operations is the  United States. These operations are not run on some kind of ad hoc  basis. They are coordinated and directed at a national level by the  CCP's United Front Work Department.   ``The CCP's United Front system mobilizes the party's `friends' to  strike the party's enemies. The system has existed for a long time, but  it has been greatly energized and expanded in recent years by Xi  Jinping. It operates inside foreign political parties, diaspora  communities, colleges, and corporations, all with the goal of promoting  the party's interests. The express goals of the United Front system  include undermining social cohesion, exacerbating racial tension, and  influencing politics.''   I want to insert parenthetically here, a lot of people were led to  believe that Vladimir Putin in Russia had a number one desire of seeing  Donald Trump elected President, but Russia also did some things to help  Hillary Clinton with her campaign.   But anybody who studies Putin and studies Russia would understand his  number one goal and some of the former communist leaders' goals in  Russia are not for an individual candidate. They want to see the United  States divided until it falls. They want to see the United States  crushed.   They were not able to do it from without, but they understand they  can be divisive enough to turn us on each other in such a way that we  would fall from within, as Lincoln said.   You know, if murder is going to be our lot, it is going to have to be  by suicide, and some seem to be helping that along.   In this article, Faddis goes on: ``Offices known as `Confucius  Institutes' on dozens of U.S. campuses have `longstanding and formal  ties' with the United Front Work Department. As of this writing, there  are 81 such institutes in the United States. The express purpose of  these institutes is to shape American attitudes toward the Chinese  Communist Party and Communism. The institutes are staffed by Chinese  nationals, and their purpose within the United Front system is to feed  American students and faculty members positive images of communism and  the Chinese Communist Party. The students whose minds are shaped then,  obviously, go on to careers not only in academia but throughout  America, including in the media.   ``Perhaps even more insidious than the obvious efforts of the  Confucius Institutes to mold the thinking of both students and  professors at institutions of higher learning across the Nation,  however, are the direct inroads the Chinese Communist Party has made  into the so-called mainstream media in this country. Armed with massive  amounts of cash and leveraging the lure of the Chinese market, the CCP  has, in essence, bought the voices of much of the `free press.'   `` `You often see representatives from American companies with  financial ties to China naturally become defenders of the CCP's  policies and spreading the CCP's propaganda'. . . .''   You have even seen that in professional sports right here in the U.S.   ``Most of the major American media outlets are owned by parent  companies. These companies all have significant business interests  inside China. They are dependent on Chinese goodwill and the approval  of the Chinese Government to safeguard those interests.   ``The New York Times. Carlos Slim, a Mexican billionaire, owns 17.4  percent of the company and votes for one-third of the board. Slim has  massive business dealings with Chinese companies tied to the CCP. Among  those ties is Huawei, which is currently subject to U.S. sanctions for  espionage and actions detrimental to American national security.''    With regard to The Washington Post: ``In 2013, Amazon CEO and  billionaire Jeff Bezos purchased The Washington Post for $250 million.  Bezos has direct and massive ties to the Chinese market, which is  controlled by the CCP. The production of Amazon's most popular products  like Echo and the Kindle takes place almost exclusively in Chinese  factories. When you purchase a Washington Post subscription, it comes  with an advertising supplement called `China Watch.' This supplement is  supplied courtesy of China Daily, a Chinese state-run media outlet.   ``CNN. The company is owned and run by WarnerMedia, which has  significant financial and organizational ties to the CCP. WarnerMedia  is invested in  [[Page H3855]]  China Media Capital, a media company overseen by the Chinese Communist  Party. CNN, via its President Jeff Zucker, is involved with NBA  broadcasts into China and efforts to expand NBA programming there.   ``MSNBC and NBC. Both MSNBC and NBC News are operated by NBC  Universal, a company with huge financial ties to the CCP. NBC is in  partnership with China's state-run media organization. Xinhua has been  identified by the U.S. State Department as a `foreign mission,' meaning  it is completely an arm of the CCP and does not function as an  independent news outlet. NBC Universal's Oriental DreamWorks is fully  owned by a Chinese investment group.   ``ABC. Walt Disney and ESPN are both owned by ABC. Both companies  have large investments in the Chinese economy. In 2019, when the NBA  refused to denounce Chinese actions in Hong Kong, ESPN's senior news  director instructed the network's staff to avoid discussing Chinese  politics or matters related to Hong Kong.   ``Bloomberg. Both former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and  his company Bloomberg LP are heavily invested in China. Bloomberg LP  sells terminals to its website in the Chinese market and helps finance  Chinese companies by sending billions of dollars from U.S. investors to  the Chinese bond market. Bloomberg LP supports 364 Chinese firms. Of  these, 159 are owned by the CCP. In 2014, Bloomberg killed an  investigation into the finances of the CCP elite. When the story was  ready for publication, Editor-in-Chief Matthew Winkler crushed it,  saying, `It is for sure going to, you know, invite the Communist Party  to, you know, completely shut us down and kick us out of the country.  So, I just don't want to see that as a story that is justified.'   ``In short, essentially all major American media outlets other than  those of a more conservative or libertarian bent are subject to  powerful Chinese influence. What they cover is what the CCP wants them  to cover. What they say is what the CCP wants them to say.   ``A recent example is telling. In a report looking at evening news  broadcasts from January 17 through March 13, the Media Research Center  found that out of 634 minutes of coronavirus coverage, just 3 minutes  and 14 seconds were in any way critical of the Chinese Government's  actions. In 20 percent of the stories, reporters cited Chinese  statistics. Those statistics, regarded as fraudulent by most objective  observers, went unchallenged 97 percent of the time.   ``This relationship between the U.S. news media and the CCP is only  getting cozier. Recently, the State Department asked all U.S. employees  of the Chinese state TV network CGTN to fill out detailed  questionnaires with personal information. Based on the reporting, at  least six former CNN reporters were found to now be working for the  Chinese company.   ``Perhaps, then, when we turn on the television and see the actions  of Marxists and revolutionaries being celebrated, we should not be  surprised. When we see the President and law enforcement vilified, we  should not be shocked. It's just Beijing and the CCP's minions doing  their job. It's the United Front.''   So, when you have got not the country but the Chinese Communist Party  and leaders in Russia wanting to see the United States collapse--and  especially China. They are very dependent upon our money and our  economy, but they are working hard and fast to get to a place where  they can see our economy fall and they survive as the lone existing  superpower.                                time  1430    It has been well over a year, as I recall, but there were three  people from Australia here, and I thought they would find it amusing,  and I related to them that I had been in a conversation with some other  Republican Members of Congress, and one of them said, Louie, we don't  have to worry. If we lose our freedom in the United States, we can all  just go to Australia. And that, I thought, would evoke a smile from all  of the Australians.   There was no smile. And one of them said, do you not understand, if  you lose your freedom here in the United States, China will take us  over before you could even think about getting there.   That was a sobering thought, and it still is.   It is also important to note, as in this article by Christopher  Holton, he points out in the headline, Eerie Parallels Between Antifa  and the Chinese Cultural Revolution.   He says: ``If you think the tactics and rhetoric of antifa and Black  Lives Matter demonstrators in America's streets are new, think again.  They're old.   ``The date is August 1966. Large numbers of students have organized  themselves into a violent social movement to promote communism.   ``The students ransacked whole villages, burned down homes and killed  thousands of civilians, all in the name of communism.   ``This activity 54 years ago happened in Communist China. The name of  the student movement was the Red Guards. They were inspired and  encouraged by the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party; a person  named Mao Zedong. He dubbed this violent reign of terror the `Cultural  Revolution.' ''   It sounds familiar.   ``The goal of the Cultural Revolution was to eliminate what Mao  called the ``Four Olds.'' The Four Olds were old customs, old culture,  old habits, and old ideas--everything that predated communism in China.  Mao saw them as a threat to his Communist rule, so he unleashed the Red  Guards to eliminate them. The Four Olds had to be replaced with new  customs, new culture, new habits and new ideas--communist customs,  communist cultures, communist habits, and communist ideas.   ``The Red Guards didn't start out by killing people and destroying  property. They started out with intimidation to back up Mao's Cultural  Revolution to change place names, especially street names. People even  changed their own names so as to break with any association with the  Four Olds.   ``The movement escalated from there. Anyone who seemed to cling to  any of the Four Olds was harassed and intimidated. Property damage was  next. Examples of old Chinese architecture began to be targeted for  destruction by Red Guards mobs. Chinese literature books were seized by  the Red Guards and burned. Artwork was destroyed by gangs of thugs who  would go into homes to search for anything considered old. The Red  Guards ransacked homes of those who were not considered reliable  supporters of the Communist Party. Ancient, sacred Chinese temples were  destroyed. Cemeteries were desecrated and corpses were even dug up and  torn apart. Monuments were taken down.   ``Does any of this sound familiar to you?   ``I'm sure it does. And that's not surprising.   ``Counterinsurgency experts, intelligence analysts, law enforcement  officials and political scientists alike throughout America and the  West are starting to wake up to the parallels between today's  insurrection and the Red Guards' reign of terror during Mao's Cultural  Revolution in China.   ``Antifa rhetoric parrots Mao's communist philosophies. Some antifa  affiliates have even called themselves `Red Guards'. Antifa's modern  roots in West Germany during the height of the Cold War included the  notorious Red Army Faction terrorist organization, which had a Maoist  orientation.   ``The antifa insurgents started by targeting Confederate monuments,  gaining sympathy, particularly from those on the left, such as liberals  and progressives. But it sure didn't stop there. Just as the Red Guards  did in China a half century ago, the antifa thugs have moved on to  statues and monuments of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham  Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Winston Churchill, Christopher Columbus, and  even Mahatma Gandhi.   ``Now they are calling for tearing down statues and depictions of  Jesus Christ.   ``There have been calls for renaming Columbus, Ohio, St. Louis,  Missouri, as well as U.S. Army forts named after generals who served in  the Confederacy during the Civil War.   ``When and where will it end?   ``It won't end if American Patriots who aren't paying close attention  don't wake up to the fact that what antifa is doing is waging a  Communist insurgency within our own country. We  [[Page H3856]]  must stop the mass virtue signaling and capitulation and stand up for  America, the greatest Nation on Earth.   ``Back in 1966, eventually even Mao and the Chinese Communist Party  leadership had to rein in the Red Guards so that they did not become  uncontrollable and threaten to compete for power. In just a matter of  weeks, they had murdered an estimated 10,000 people. Probably the only  reason this episode is not widely known is because 10,000 deaths during  the Mao Zedong era in China was barely a drop in the bucket. Mao was  the largest mass murderer of the 20th century, responsible for the  deaths of as many as 70 million people by forced starvation, exposure,  and execution. That's more than Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot combined.   ``One cannot help but be suspicious that, at a time when the Chinese  Communists have covered up the origins and spread of an unprecedented  pandemic and used force belligerently on their border with India, in  the South China Sea, in Hong Kong, and over the skies of Taiwan, an  insurrection reminiscent of the Chinese Cultural Revolution led by  American communists has sprang up seemingly out of nowhere. Who's been  supporting Maoists in America and the West? Who is educating and  indoctrinating them? Who is funding them? Who stands to benefit from  the chaotic insurrection? These are questions that must be answered. I  would not be surprised if the connecting of the dots leads to Beijing.    ``Meanwhile, today in America, many Democrat Party leaders have taken  a paternal, protective view of antifa, refusing to condemn their  violence and denying that they are a terrorist organization. Like the  Chinese Communist Party, the Democrats may find themselves wishing they  could reign in antifa as the violence escalates and further chaos  ensues in cities that have been dominated by Democrat rule for  decades.''   Rather eye-opening, and it should find people waking up across  America.   I go back to the summer I spent in the Soviet Union, when it was the  Soviet Union. I saw socialized medicine in its purest form, and I thank  God that our healthcare system was so much better. Of course, that was  before there was so much control here by the government, insurance  companies, pharmaceuticals.   It is a different system now. It is still better than what they have  got.   I have seen that in China, the system from inside, going into a  hospital in Shanghai. It is interesting, as a foreigner, I was taken  into this beautiful new little section where an MRI was conducted; not  on me, but somebody I was there visiting. And it looked like it was  really nice.   But then, to pay for the MRI, we had to go through the biggest part  of the hospital, where the Chinese people went, and it wasn't nice at  all. And I was glad to get out of there. It seemed filthy.   But it was very clear; if you are a foreigner, they didn't show you  this big nice--well, it wasn't that big, but it is going to look like  everything is modern, beautiful, wonderful. But for the people that are  citizens, it is just not so at all.   We need to wake up in this country. Violence is not the way to go. It  leads to an end. There will be an end and, as the Australians over a  year ago pointed out, you guys lose your freedom, and there really  isn't going to be a safe place because the Communist Party of China  will have big enough tentacles, no matter where you go.   It is supposedly no longer communist in Russia, but it certainly  appears to be totalitarian, under the vise grip of Vladimir Putin.   But it is one of the reasons we have to have patriots that will  defend our freedom, because if we are not willing to defend that with  which we have been endowed by our creator, then we won't keep it.   Some wonder, well, if it is really and truly an endowment bequeathed  to us by God, our creator, as the Declaration of Independence said,  then why do we have to fight for it? It is ours.   But in this world, like anything you inherit, if you are not willing  to fight for it, there are evil forces that will take it away. Jealousy  abounds in some people that are just mean. It is tough to come to grips  with that fact.   Some many people used to call them sociopaths. Then it became--I  think it was the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III or IV, maybe  III, got away from sociopath, psychopath, and we called them  personality disorders; antisocial personality.   But those personalities--as a judge that was trying to formulate the  appropriate sentence for a felon that had either been found guilty or  pled guilty before me, it is important to understand who is before you.  And when you hear testimony about the antisocial personality, that they  are not--the odds of rehabilitating them are not good, then you begin  to understand deterrents, general and specific deterrents need to be  guiding principles for their sentencing. Apparently, the mayor of New  York hasn't figured that out.                                time  1445    So, Madam Speaker, if you release somebody who is an antisocial  personality, they are likely to just keep repeating the violence. In  the same way if you just keep looking the other way from these people,  you will destroy--and I still will say it--the most free country, at  least it has been, with more opportunities.   Madam Speaker, it is still a place where you can tell your child that  if you want to be something badly enough and you work hard enough, you  have a real shot at doing that. We have still got that here no matter  what background you come from. It is worth fighting for, and it is  worth protecting.   We must suppress the violence and the victimization, especially in  minority communities in downtown urban areas. Whether it is antifa or  BLM, whatever the group is, the violence has got to stop. These people  are not inspired by Dr. King. They are anathema to what he preached as  an ordained Christian minister.   People have got to wake up. This country is at risk. Our freedom is  at risk.   This is the way you go. There are so many people, whether it is  George Soros or other billionaires, who are funneling money to make  this a Marxist country. Sadly for them, they didn't learn enough  history because the truth is, yeah, sure, the Marxists will take your  money, and they will use it to create a Marxist country. But once that  is achieved, the wealthiest don't end up in that tiny little group of  rulers. Of course, there is no middle class. It is all the little  rulers and then everybody else.   They say: Thank you for getting us to this Marxist level. Now you are  either going to die or you are going to a gulag, and we are going to  take your money from you.   That is how it works. Unfortunately, they haven't figured that out. I  hope they wake up before it is too late for them and realize how  fortunate they are to have been able to make the money they have in a  country that had the freedom where they could make that kind of money.  Unless they do, this country is in grave danger.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
