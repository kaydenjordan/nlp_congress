 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 891, I call up  the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 68) to direct the removal of United  States Armed Forces from hostilities against the Islamic Republic of  Iran that have not been authorized by Congress, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material in the Record related to S.J. Res. 68,  currently under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure, a resolution  that will allow Congress to stand up for its constitutional  responsibilities over war powers, a resolution that will send a clear  message that the American people don't want war with Iran and that  Congress has not authorized war with Iran.   In the few months since the House last took up legislation to address  the administration's policy toward Iran, much has shifted.   I think we are all relieved that tensions have ratcheted down. After  the strike that took out Qasem Soleimani, we appeared to be on the  brink of a direct conflict with Iran, but things have cooled off since.  Some will say this resolution is no longer needed or has no legal  effect because we are not shooting at Iran today. They say we are not  in hostilities with Iran.   But that is not an accurate reading of the law. The drafters of the  War Powers Resolution accounted for the situation we are in today. They  were clear that Congress' powers are not as narrow as the  administration would like us to believe and, apparently, as some  Members of this body would like us to believe.   The committee report from 1973 says, ``In addition to a situation in  which fighting actually has begun, hostilities also encompasses a state  of confrontation in which no shots have been fired but where there is a  clear and present danger of armed conflict.'' That sounds a lot like  what we are facing today, except shots have been fired on both sides.   Further, the President had to send 6,000 additional troops to the  Middle East after the Soleimani incident, precisely because there is a  clear and present danger of armed conflict.   Congress doesn't have to wait until the President alone decides to  use military force again. Indeed, it is our responsibility to do  something because we know that tensions could flare up again at a  moment's notice.                                time  1415    Iran has not been deterred, as the administration promised. Indeed,  there have already been four attacks on American personnel after the  President ordered Soleimani's killing, injuring more than 100 U.S.  servicemembers.   This isn't deterrence. The regime is again pushing ahead with  research into a nuclear weapon and expanding its stockpile of enriched  uranium.   Now, I don't like the Iranian Government. I don't like what they  stand for. I don't like what they do. But the reality is this:  Following the strike, we are now closer to a war with a country that is  closer to possessing a nuclear weapon.   The last few weeks have also shown the administration scrambling to  come up with a legal justification for the strike. Contrary to the  initial claims, it quickly became clear that there was no imminent  threat.   In fact, when the administration sent a legally required report to  Congress, laying out the legal and policy justifications, there was no  mention of an imminent threat--none whatsoever.   What was in that report, however, was an alarming claim that  underscores why it is so important to press ahead with this resolution.  According to the administration, the strike on Soleimani was legally  authorized by the 2002 Saddam Hussein war authorization. Let me say  that again: the 2002 Saddam Hussein, Iraq war authorization.   Madam Speaker, I was here in 2002 when the House considered that  resolution, and I can tell you: Congress did not intend for it to  authorize a war against Iran. Read it. Nowhere will you find any  mention of Iran.   Incidentally, the House has voted to repeal this out-of-date war  authorization, thanks to Congresswoman Lee's efforts, which I have  supported.   I have heard some arguments that the 2002 authorization wasn't just  about Saddam, but was also about terrorism, because that legislation  says Saddam Hussein might give al-Qaida weapons of mass destruction.  That finding was debunked a long time ago, and it still has nothing to  do with Iran.  [[Page H1617]]    Some also claim that because the forces in Iraq under the 2001 and  2002 war authorizations have acted in self-defense against Iraqi  militias backed by Iran, that somehow means that the 2002 AUMF can be  used to attack Iran directly.   Anyone who is confused about this needs to read the administration's  legal rationale more closely. They have been all over the map, trying  to untangle this confusion, but their official justification is clear.  It distinguishes the Soleimani killing from the defensive actions taken  against militias--apples and oranges.   The administration, and any administration, should not be relying on  the 2002 AUMF for anything, but we should all be able to recognize that  attacking Iran is very different from other uses of force in Iraq.   It is an absurd reading of the authorization, and if the  administration is going to lean on that outdated law for this, what  else do they plan to use it for?   Some executive branch officials, past and present, also argue that  the Constitution gives the President sweeping unilateral power to use  military force without coming to Congress. I will say that again:  without coming to Congress. But even among this group, it is hard to  find anyone who actually believes Congress authorized the strike  against Soleimani.   What has me worried is that the President made a decision to escalate  tensions with Iran; failed to consult Congress, even though he had  ample opportunity to do so; misled the American people about why the  strike was necessary; and then switched gears and conjured up this  dubious, after-the-fact legal justification.   Here is the reality: The American people don't want war with Iran.  The Congress has not authorized war with Iran. That should be crystal  clear.   Congress has the right to declare war. It is in the Constitution. It  doesn't say that the President has the right, any President. It doesn't  say the President has the right; Congress has the right.   We are trying to fulfill the Constitution. We are trying to take the  Constitution back to the way it was and the way it was interpreted.  Congress has the power to declare war.   Many of us are very concerned that since December 7, 1941, when  President Franklin Roosevelt stood up and declared war against Japan,  we have not had a declared war since then. So, what has that done? It  has really rendered Congress impotent. Congress, essentially, has no  say, and the President is the one who decides unilaterally.   That cannot be. That should not be. It is going directly against the  Constitution, and we should not stand for it any longer.   So, as I said, the American people don't want war. Congress has not  authorized war. That should be crystal clear.   However, since the administration is somehow claiming that Congress  has already authorized force against Iran, then it becomes that much  more important for Congress to go on record saying otherwise, and that  is what this joint resolution would do.   We passed a similar measure in January. At the time, my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle argued that the House version was  unenforceable because it was a concurrent resolution, that it would  never go to the President's desk and wouldn't have the power of law.   I disagreed with that assessment. In my view, the House version was a  clear exercise of Congress' authority over war powers. We don't have  authority over war powers only if the President says so. We have  authority over war powers because the Constitution says so.   The House and Senate have both acted, and the Supreme Court has made  clear that the President's Article II war powers are at their lowest  ebb when he acts against the express will of Congress. We have  expressed our will. The President does not have authority for war with  Iran.   But the legislation we are considering today takes a step further. It  is a joint resolution, not a concurrent resolution, so it will go  straight to the President's desk if it passes the House unamended.    It is important that Congress stands up for itself, but more  important is that Congress stands up for its constitutional authorities  and makes it clear that we don't want war and that we haven't  authorized war with Iran.   Advancing this measure would be the right thing to do under any  circumstances, but it is especially important in the face of an  administration that, again and again, tries to brush Congress aside as  though we are an annoyance rather than a constitutionally coequal  branch of government.   Now, I will be honest and say that this has been done by subsequent  administrations on both sides of the aisle. Well, we don't want it done  by any administration. Congress has the power to declare war--not a  President, Congress.   We are not an annoyance; we are a constitutionally coequal branch of  government. I am glad to support this measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a distinguished member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Omar), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California.                                time  1445     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to, again, state the main reason for us voting  on this. I am no fan of the regime in Iran. And I certainly was no fan  of Soleimani, who had blood on his hands and did all kinds of heinous  things. I don't care so much about them.    What I care about is us. What I care about is the Constitution of the  United States of America. It was drafted a certain way. It wasn't  drafted to say that the President, no matter who that President is, no  matter what party that President is from, the President has authority  to do whatever he likes.   It clearly says--and I said this before, but I think it is worth  repeating. It clearly says that Congress has the power to declare war.  Congress. And what we are trying to do on this side of the aisle is  trying to strike that balance, the checks and balances. We all learned  them when we went to school, checks and balances.   The Constitution doesn't say the President can do anything he wants  and the Congress must follow suit. It says that Congress has the sole  right to declare war.   It is really disturbing to me that subsequent Presidents--and this  isn't only the fault of one President or one political party. This is a  road that we all share blame for this--we have allowed our branch of  government to wither on the vine when it comes to declaring war, when  it comes to war powers.   We have essentially said that any President can just declare war, and  Congress has got to go along with it. If you don't go along with it,  somehow you are unpatriotic or you don't care about the country. Quite  the opposite. Quite the opposite.   We care about the country and we are patriotic, and that is why we  believe that the Constitution needs to be adhered to.   Now, I would also encourage my colleagues to look more closely at the  facts, instead of just accepting what the executive branch is saying  about reinterpreting the law.   As I said in my opening statement, the drafters of the War Powers  Resolution were clear, that the situation we are in today is in a state  of hostility. We are constantly today in a state of hostility.   The committee report passing the War Powers Resolution from 1973, in  the Congress, says: ``In addition to a situation in which fighting  actually has begun, hostilities also encompasses a state of  confrontation in which no shots have been fired, but where there is a  clear and present danger of armed conflict.''   Certainly, we are in that situation now. That is exactly the  situation we are in right now.   So Congress' powers are not as narrow as the administration would  like us to believe. I don't care who is President, and I don't care  about who is elected in Congress. What I care about is that Congress  fulfill its duties; fulfill its duties as the Constitution says that we  must.   So we are doing this again because the other body has not been  cooperative and doesn't seem to want to make a move on anything. We are  doing this because we have to do this. We are doing this because this  is important.   And no matter, again, 10 years from now, 20 years from now, there  will be other Members here, I would hope that whoever is President  then--no matter what party, whoever controls the majority of Congress-- no matter what party, this is not political. This is not about party.  This is not about trying to do anything, as far as I am concerned,  except reestablishing Congress' right to declare war.   I don't know what is more important than war and peace. I certainly  don't think Congress ought to start giving away its responsibilities.   I have been in this body a long time, and we have constantly argued  against the administration--no matter who was in that administration-- from usurping the roles that Congress has, from taking away  congressional power, not only on matters of peace and war, but on  everything; earmarks or anything you want to say.  [[Page H1621]]    Congress has just sort of said to the President: Go ahead, you make  the decision. We are just sort of along for the ride. We are kind of  observers. We are observers.   Well, we are not observers. We are people who care very dearly about  the Constitution.   And, again, I conclude by saying, Congress has the right to declare  war. Only Congress has the right to declare war. That is what we are  affirming today, and why I hope we get votes from both sides of the  aisle. This is not a political discussion. It doesn't matter who is in  the White House. It doesn't matter who is in Congress. What matters is  that Congress not cede its responsibility to any other branch but its  own.   Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, before I close, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I have said all along that this is not a partisan issue, and it  isn't. Executive branch officials from both parties have tried to  sideline Congress when it comes to war. It is time we said: ``Enough.''  It may be in the executive branch's interest to keep Congress out, but  that doesn't make it legal or make it right.   Madam Speaker, no one in this body mourns Qasem Soleimani, certainly  not me. No one doubts that he was a hardened terrorist with the blood  of Americans and others on his hands. But that is not the issue before  us today.   The issue is that the Trump administration decided to kill him  without authorization from Congress, without any prior consultation  with Congress, then misled the American people about why that was  necessary. And then, when the administration's explanation couldn't  withstand scrutiny, they tell us Congress had already authorized  military action against Iran.   Madam Speaker, I think we would know if we had voted to authorize  military action against Iran. Those aren't the kinds of votes you  easily forget.   So, today, we will vote on this resolution and send it to the  President's desk. And it carries with it a very clear, very important  message: Congress has not authorized war, and Congress has not  authorized war against Iran.   It is remarkable that we even need to say this, but as is often the  case, up is down, down is up, laws don't matter, and Congress doesn't  matter because the Constitution doesn't matter.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
