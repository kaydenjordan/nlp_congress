 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in support of confirming Jason  Scott Miller to be the Deputy Director for Management at the Office of  Management and Budget.   Mr. Miller has an extensive track record of tackling difficult  management challenges and driving innovation both in government and in  the private sector.   OMB is and will continue to be central to the administration's  efforts to combat the pandemic and spur economic activity in  communities all across our Nation.   Mr. Miller's diverse experience and commitment to getting results for  the American people will be an asset to the OMB as it takes on these  current challenges and those challenges yet to come.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the confirmation of  Jason Scott Miller as Deputy Director for Management at OMB.
