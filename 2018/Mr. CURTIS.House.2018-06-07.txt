 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of increased  funding for the Moab UMTRA project in the underlying legislation. This  bill would fund the site cleanup at $42 million, an increase of  approximately $4 million over last year's funding.   Located just across the street from Arches National Park, the Energy  Department is currently undertaking the largest uranium mill tailing  pile relocation in the United States. Once the cleanup is complete,  this valuable real estate can be used for a wide variety of economic  and other uses in the area.   I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Simpson on this issue as well  as his support of other programs that are important to the West within  his subcommittee. I urge my colleagues to support funding for the Moab  UMTRA project as well as the underlying legislation.    I would like to thank Chairman Simpson for his support of  the Moab UMTRA cleanup. I look forward to continuing to work on this  issue as well as other issues that can benefit our constituents and the  American people.   Again, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill.
