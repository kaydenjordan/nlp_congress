Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 6847, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are voting today on the Preventing Child  Exploitation Act, which rolls together four bills the House considered  and passed last year but the Senate failed to take up and pass. Each of  them will make important changes to Federal law to protect children.   I would like to thank my colleagues--Mr. Ratcliffe, Mr. Johnson, and  Mr. Sensenbrenner--for their excellent work in crafting and introducing  these bills with me and their critical efforts to move them through the  House earlier this Congress.   The first part of H.R. 6847 is the bill I introduced, the ``Roby  bill.'' It closes a significant loophole in pursuing offenders who  engage in sex tourism and prey on children abroad. Specifically, the  bill ensures that the definition of ``illicit sexual conduct'' includes  all potential situations where an adult defendant may abuse a child  under these circumstances. No longer will they be able to go and prey  on foreign children without facing the possibility of significant  punishment at home. They will also not be able to escape enhanced  sentences for doing so.   The bill also closes loopholes that permit those who sexually  degrade, humiliate, and abuse children under 12 to avoid sentencing  enhancements for repeat offenses.   Congress always intended for children to have the greatest  protections, and we must ensure that our laws reflect that intent.   The next part of H.R. 6847, the ``Ratcliffe bill,'' closes yet  another loophole regarding offenders who commit violent crimes while  they are in noncompliant status as sex offenders. Currently, this  enhancement applies only to those who committed crimes of violence  under Federal, Tribal, D.C., or military law, and the law of any  territory or possession of the United States.   This bill adds State crimes of violence as predicate convictions,  thus ensuring all sex offenders who have been convicted of crimes of  violence face heightened punishment where they fail to register.   Presently, certain recidivist provisions are not consistent with  respect to conduct covered when someone has a prior sex conviction  under Federal and State law, as opposed to military law. For instance,  under current law, an offender with certain prior military child  pornography convictions would not qualify for a sentencing enhancement  that someone convicted under a Federal statute would, even if their  conduct was the same. This bill fixes this and makes sure that those  recidivist enhancements are applied consistently.   The third part of H.R. 6847, the ``Johnson bill,'' fixes a judicially  created loophole in the Federal production of child pornography  statute. In United States versus Palomino-Coronado, the Fourth Circuit  reversed a conviction for production of child pornography for  insufficient evidence, allowing a defendant to walk free from  production of child pornography charges despite photographic evidence  he created that he had engaged in sexual abuse of a 7-year-old child.   In doing so, the court suggested that a defendant must initiate  sexually illicit conduct with the specific intent to create child  pornography. This decision has extremely undesirable consequences in  the prosecution of the production of child pornography. It has created  a new defense whereby a defendant can merely deny a preformed, specific  intent to record a sexual offense of a minor and escape Federal  conviction.   That is an outrageous result, and Congress' intervention is required  to fix the statute. The creation of child pornography must be  adequately deterred, and this fix ensures that it will be.   Finally, H.R. 6847 includes the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act,  introduced by Crime Subcommittee Chairman Sensenbrenner, the author of  the original Walsh Act. The bill reauthorizes the Sex Offender  Management Assistance Program and provides funding for the United  States Marshals Service, which is tasked with identifying and  apprehending unregistered sex offenders. It also adds new provisions  that aim to improve the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act  and make it easier for States to comply.   Thus far, 17 States, 108 Tribes, and 3 territories are in substantial  compliance with the law. The intent of this bill is to ensure many more  jurisdictions come into compliance.   Over the past several years, DOJ has worked closely with the States  to achieve this goal by promulgating flexible guidelines via the  continued hard work of the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing,  Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking, or the SMART  Office.   This bill takes several concrete steps to encourage compliance. For  example, it addresses concerns many have addressed about juvenile  offenders. It is important to keep in mind that only juveniles who have  committed the most serious sex offenses are subject to registration  under SORNA. Nevertheless, this bill lessens the amount of time a  juvenile who commits certain offenses and keeps a clean record must be  on the registry. If these youths keep a clean record for 15 years, they  may petition to leave the registry.   Additionally, the bill codifies 2016 DOJ guidelines which permit the  SMART Office to deem a State in substantial compliance with the act  even if it maintains a discretionary juvenile registry.   Further, the bill alleviates the cost of implementation by explicitly  permitting alternative means for in-person check-ins for registrants  and lessening the number of required check-ins. This is a reasonable  amendment that will help States with significant rural populations  achieve compliance.    I want to thank all my colleagues. I am glad to have had the  opportunity to introduce the comprehensive child protection bill,  which, as I have already noted, will strengthen Federal law to protect  children. I also want to, again, thank Mr. Ratcliffe, Mr. Johnson, and  Mr. Sensenbrenner for their work.   There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in  which it treats its children. I implore my colleagues to take that to  heart and support this vital, well-crafted, commonsense legislation. I  urge every person in this room to consider this bill, not just as a  Member of Congress, but as a parent, a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle,  or a friend. Please join me today in supporting this bill and  protecting our children.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, first, we need to make clear that this bill does not  expand law to go after teenagers for sexting. Under present law,  technically, such changes may be possible. However, we know of no  instance where the Department of Justice has pursued such cases.   When these bills were initially passed, the press falsely claimed  that they would make it possible for DOJ to go after teen sexting. This  is completely reckless journalism. Apparently, these journalists did  not participate in any sort of fact checking, which would have merely  consisted of opening a U.S. Criminal Code book. They also continually  cite State cases as examples of Federal prosecutors acting  aggressively, which is similarly extremely misleading. If our friends  across the aisle would like to draw our attention to any cases where  the Federal Government prosecuted consensual teen sexting, we would be  happy to look at them.   Last year, we offered to work on a provision to provide an  affirmative defense in this chapter of the code, despite no evidence  that it is necessary, but we were not taken up on our offer.                                time  1945    None of these bills, Mr. Speaker, create new mandatory minimum  sentences. Instead, they modify the existing statutory framework to  ensure the existing enhancements are applied equitably and to close  certain loopholes.   Some of the conduct covered is modestly expanded, but that is done  commensurate with the crime. These recidivism enhancements are for  these predatory crimes, especially where the defendant has previously  sexually abused a child, which is the case for the enhancement in 18  U.S.C. 3559(e).   Society's laws need to address the problems of the day and protect  the public, especially our children. Sex crimes against children are  ubiquitous. Their number, as we heard in our child protection hearing  last month, is growing.   Additionally, the offenses are becoming more depraved, and the  victims are getting younger. There is no sign of slowing down, and  present law does not appear to be keeping up with the numbers.   The gravity and growing prevalence of these crimes merit an  appropriate societal response to have a proper deterrent effect. The  enhancements provide this deterrent effect.   In addition, these child sex crimes are vastly underreported. In  these sexual exploitation crimes, the victims are often very young and  very impressionable. They are often scarred for life as a result of  horrific abuse. The punishment must fit the crime, especially where it  involves our children.   Again, my appeal to my colleagues is to consider this bill, not just  as a Member of Congress, but, again, as a parent, a grandparent, an  aunt, an uncle, and a friend. I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
