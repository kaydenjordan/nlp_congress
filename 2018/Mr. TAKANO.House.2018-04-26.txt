 Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a resolution to  recognize April 26 as International Chart Day, a celebration of charts,  data visualization, and infographics of all types.   An American public that is better equipped to understand what goes in  a good chart will be better equipped to spot and discard fake news. In  news reporting and academia, the use of properly sourced and formatted  charts help explain complex issues. Charts help the brain discern  patterns and trends that large amounts of data often hide.   The goal of International Chart Day is to study the history of data  visualization, celebrate innovations in infographics, and encourage  wider adoption of their use across society. My colleagues and I in  Congress are prolific creators of charts, many of which are archived on  the excellent blog ``Floor Charts,'' curated by William Gray. If you  are interested in joining in on the celebration, please share your  favorite charts online and use #chartday.                            ____________________
