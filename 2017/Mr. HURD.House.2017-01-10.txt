 Mr. Speaker, it is way past time that our government  reconsiders the way that it views technology. Adherence to decades-old  policy regarding technology costs our taxpayers billions of dollars,  stifles creativity, and needlessly prevents our government from  utilizing private sector technologies.   This bill, the Modernizing Government Travel Act, is simple. It will  allow Federal employees to utilize the services of innovative companies  while on official travel. Last Congress, as the chairman alluded to,  this bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support, 415-0.   Private sector companies have had a tremendous impact on the way that  people travel, and we should allow our government to recognize these  changes. By widening the scope of reimbursable forms of transportation,  we are encouraging the adoption of innovative technologies and  promoting competition.   The bill also requires agencies to report what type of transportation  their employees are taking while on official travel, and this data will  be publicly available, thus increasing transparency and accountability  in how taxpayer dollars are being spent.                                time  1645    H.R. 274, as amended, is a sensible piece of legislation that can  help modernize our government and ensure that the United States is  moving seamlessly into the 21st century.   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Moulton, for his  leadership on this important issue, as well as Representatives Meadows,  Bustos, and Swalwell for their support for this bill. I ask my  colleagues to join me in the support of H.R. 274.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  my colleague from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 39) to amend title 5, United States Code, to codify the  Presidential Innovation Fellows Program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 39         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Hurd) and the gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  [[Page H284]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  [[Page H284]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the government is many things. It is  large, it is complicated, and it is ineffective. I don't think anyone  would call it modern. While the world is rushing forward with things  like voice-based interfaces, autonomous vehicles, online retail, and  data analytics, government is stubbornly years, or even decades,  behind.   We do not have to accept it. One of the purposes of the Innovation  Initiative, our effort here in the House, is to bring government into  the modern age.   Right now, it can still take hours for citizens to get the IRS on the  phone to ask the most basic questions. Parents and students still deal  with the clunky user interfaces when applying for tuition assistance.  And the VA still uses a scheduling system that is a quarter century  old. It doesn't have to be this way.   We have a program right now, the Presidential Innovation Fellows  program, that brings in highly talented professionals from across the  country to help upgrade our government's use of technology. Now, these  are engineers, designers, innovators, and thinkers. They challenge the  old ways of thinking and introduce new approaches to make our  government work the way the American people deserve it to work.   I sponsored the TALENT Act to make sure this innovation program  continues into the future. By drawing on the great talent of the  American people, we can make government effective, efficient, and  accountable.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of the TALENT Act, a bill to ensure  that we continue to bring top private sector innovators into government  to help solve complex technological problems at Federal agencies.   The Presidential Innovation Fellows program was established by  President Obama in 2012 to identify and pursue projects that apply and  implement innovative private sector techniques in as little as 6  months. The program was made permanent by Executive Order 13704 in  2015, and would be codified by the bill before us today.   H.R. 39 would require the General Services Administration to continue  managing the program with guidance from an advisory board comprised of  representatives from different executive branch agencies. Over 100  Presidential Innovation Fellows have already been appointed to work  alongside dedicated civil servants at 25 Federal agencies and  departments.   At those agencies, fellows have been able to merge their experience  from top universities, pioneering companies, and successful nonprofits  with their desire to contribute to society through public service. This  collaboration has allowed the Federal Government to obtain new tools,  develop new technologies, and ultimately become more effective and  efficient.   Presidential Innovation Fellows have reshaped the way Americans  interact with their government in areas ranging from health care and  science to law enforcement and disaster response. Fifteen million  Americans can access their health data as a result of the program's  Blue Button initiative, and cancer patients can search for clinical  trials as part of work to support the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot  initiative.   Scientists can now obtain more weather data collected by NOAA, and  veterans can now more readily access custom prosthetic designs.   Citizens can review police records, including crime statistics and  data on officer-involved shootings. And FEMA and other first responders  can better target and prioritize their response to natural disasters.   All of these things have been made possible through the Presidential  Innovation Fellows program, and it is crucial that we continue our  support of these and other endeavors by ensuring its permanency.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 39.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, I am urging my colleagues to support H.R. 39, the TALENT Act,  introduced by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California. This bill  passed the House on a strong bipartisan vote in the 114th Congress, and  I am glad to be part of the team working to enact this important  legislation into law.   The TALENT Act makes permanent the Presidential Innovation Fellows  program that was created in 2012. This highly competitive program  recruits talented, private sector innovators and technologists from  across the United States.   Presidential Innovation Fellows serve in the Washington, D.C., area  for 12 months at an executive agency. These agencies include the  Department of Energy, NASA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Fellows bring with them their experience in the private sector to  help government turn ideas into tangible results that ultimately  benefit the American people. Since 2012, at least 96 top innovators  have participated in the program.   Past and current fellows have come from companies large and small and  hold degrees from top universities across the country. They have won a  variety of awards, including Fulbright scholarships, Silicon Valley  Business Journal's 40 Under 40 recognition, and Truman National  Security Project fellowships. These fellows truly are the best and the  brightest the United States has to offer, and they seek to utilize  their skills for the American people.    Presidential Innovation Fellows are giving the Federal Government the  tools it needs to successfully operate in the 21st century. Previous  projects completed by fellows include Uncle Sam's List. Fellows created  a database to offer a centralized information center in which agencies  can forgo buying new commodity IT and support services in favor of  existing services provided by the Federal agencies. This program has  saved an estimated $2.5 billion, and it is helping government become  more effective and efficient.   I commend Majority Leader McCarthy for the work to bring this  innovation to the government. Again, I urge support for this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from  California aware that I have no further speakers and I am prepared to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I just briefly congratulate everyone who  has been involved. As somebody who represents the bay area and  struggles with the innovation in the private sector there to integrate  it into the public sector at all levels of government, I really admire  the work by Mr. Hurd, the comments and the contributions by the  administration, and Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Hoyer.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on our side. I congratulate  Mr. Hurd.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to thank  for their years of service on such an important issue Mr. DeSaulnier  and Leader Hoyer and Leader McCarthy.   I would like to urge the adoption of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 39.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
