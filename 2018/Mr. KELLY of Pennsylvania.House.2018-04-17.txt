 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5443) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of  1986 to require electronic filing of the annual returns of exempt  organizations and provide for making such returns available for public  inspection, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5443         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MANDATORY ELECTRONIC FILING FOR ANNUAL RETURNS OF                     EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS.         (a) In General.--Section 6033 of the Internal Revenue Code       of 1986 is amended by redesignating subsection (n) as       subsection (o) and by inserting after subsection (m) the       following new subsection:        ``(n) Mandatory Electronic Filing.--Any organization       required to file a return under this section shall file such       return in electronic form.''.        (b) Inspection of Electronically Filed Annual Returns.--      Section 6104(b) of such Code is amended by adding at the end       the following: ``Any annual return required to be filed       electronically under section 6033(n) shall be made available       by the Secretary to the public in machine readable format.''.        (c) Effective Date.--        (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the       amendments made by this section shall apply to returns filed       for taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment       of this Act.        (2) Transitional relief.--        (A) Small organizations.--        (i) In general.--In the case of any small organizations, or       any other organizations for which the Secretary of the       Treasury or the Secretary's delegate (hereafter referred to       in this paragraph as the ``Secretary'') determines the       application of the amendments made by subsection (a) would       cause undue burden without a delay, the Secretary may delay       the application of such amendments, but not later than       taxable years beginning 2 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (ii) Small organization.--For purposes of clause (i), the       term ``small organization'' means any organization--         (I) the gross receipts of which for the taxable year are       less than $200,000, and        (II) the aggregate gross assets of which at the end of the       taxable year are less than $500,000.         (B) Organizations filing form 990-T.--In the case of any       organization described in section 511(a)(2) of the Internal       Revenue Code of 1986 which is subject to the tax imposed by       section 511(a)(1) of such Code on its unrelated business       taxable income, or any organization required to file a return       under section 6033 of such Code and include information under       subsection (e) thereof, the Secretary may delay the       application of the amendments made by this section, but not       later than taxable years beginning 2 years after the date of       the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 5443,  currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5443. This bill,  in short, would ensure that all nonprofits file their tax forms  electronically so that the charitable community can better assist those  in need.   First, I want to thank Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy today for  cosponsoring this important legislation with me.   This provision is identical to one that my colleague on the Ways and  Means Committee, Congressman Blumenauer, and I introduced in a larger  tax package, the CHARITY Act, along with Senators Thune and Casey on  the Senate Finance Committee in 2017.                                time  1430    Before I discuss this bill in greater detail, I want to look across  the room to my great friend, Mr.  John Lewis. It was in 2015 that Mr.  Lewis and I crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It was at that time that  Mr. Lewis stopped and spent some time with my grandson George. And as  we were walking across the bridge, George, who was 8 at the time, said:  ``Grandpa, we are actually going to do this. We are going to go across  the Edmund Pettus Bridge with Mr. Lewis.''   I said: ``That's right, George, we are.''   He said: ``Well, Grandpa, this is the 50th anniversary.''   I said: ``Yes, George, it is.''   He said: ``Well, can we come back for the 100th anniversary?''   I said: ``George, we will do that together. You and I will come  across the bridge at the 100th anniversary.''   He said: ``Grandpa, how old are you right now?''   I said: ``Well, George, I am 65.''   He said: ``Grandpa, it may be hard for you to get across that  bridge.''   I said: ``Georgie, don't worry. If I can't walk, you can push me  across.''   That was a great weekend for George. And for Mr. Lewis, I have always  felt he is such an iconic figure in this House for people who stood up  for civil rights. That weekend was one of the most gracious weekends  and best weekends with my son my grandson had. So I can't tell you how  much I appreciate being with you on the floor today.   When it comes to charity, the American people are truly unique. In  fact, Americans are the most generous in the world according to the new  Almanac of American Philanthropy. In a first-of-its-kind survey, the  almanac found that Americans out-donate Britain and Canada 2-to-1 and  nations like Italy and Germany 20-to-1. What is more, more than half of  almost every single income level in America donates to charity. That is  remarkable, and it makes me proud to be an American and proud of our  Nation's history of philanthropy.   In its earliest form, the word ``philanthropy'' comes from the Greek  term ``philanthropia,'' which simply meant ``love of mankind.'' The  meaning has evolved over time, but, from the earliest days of human  civilization, we have depended upon kindness directed towards strangers  and others. We define ``philanthropy'' today as the practice of  organized, systematic giving to improve the quality of human life  through the promotion of welfare and social change.   Throughout every age, American philanthropists have demonstrated the  power of giving to create great and meaningful change. In my own  congressional district in western Pennsylvania, we have many wonderful  organizations that demonstrate the power of giving each and every day.  In Erie, Pennsylvania, we have The Erie Community Foundation, the  United Way of Erie, and the Black Family Foundation.   As a businessman and leader in the energy sector, Pat Black and his  family started a small, private foundation in 1993. Here is one  individual who took it upon himself to create a charitable organization  to give back to his community. And we have many other good corporate  citizens in Erie, as well, such as Erie Insurance. More than half a  century ago, Erie Insurance's founder, H.O. Hirt, had a lifelong  concern for others who were less fortunate, and  [[Page H3372]]  today Erie Insurance and its employees follow Mr. Hirt's example and  continue this tradition of giving of food and clothing and other drives  that help out in the community.   And since it is tax filing week, all these charitable organizations  must file their tax forms, called 990s, which brings us back to why we  are here today on the floor considering H.R. 5443. Our bill would make  it mandatory that 990s be filed electronically going forward.  Electronic filing, or e-filing, is not only more efficient; it costs  taxpayers less and the IRS less to administer. This requirement will  boost transparency in the tax-exempt sector by requiring all nonprofits  to file their returns electronically.   Today, approximately 60 percent of all 990s are filed electronically,  but the remaining 40 percent are still paper filed and not released as  open data. In addition to requiring e-filing of the 990 form be  mandatory for tax-exempt organizations, the bill would make such  returns available to the public in a machine-readable format.   So why is this important? Better 990 information, when searchable and  available to the public, allows for better scrutiny and better  transparency. Jacob Harold, president of GuideStar, which collects and  disseminates information from nonprofits' returns, says: ``The more  easily people can access that data, the better.''   A readable, searchable format that will help improve efficiency and  accuracy and reduce fraud, e-filing has served as a highly effective  tool in exposing scam charities, and it will make it easier to catch  these few bad actors who are using tax donations for personal gain  only.   For example, in 2015, the Federal Trade Commission, the District of  Columbia, and all 50 States filed a lawsuit against four scam cancer  charities calling themselves the Cancer Fund. Their owners had used  over 95 percent of the $187 million in charitable donations for their  own personal benefit. This lawsuit took almost 4 years because of the  difficulty of analyzing thousands and thousands of pages of data that  were filed on paper.   Our bill will correct that. Hundreds of millions of dollars from  generous Americans were wasted because their donations were going to a  fraudster and not helping researchers to find a cure for cancer. To  take money away from cancer patients is just plain wrong and immoral.  Our bill wants to make sure this doesn't happen in the future.   Now, how would that happen? Changes could be brought sooner against  these scam charities, in less than 1 year instead of 4, if the return  information had been available electronically. There are countless  examples that prove that this can be the case. The State of Michigan is  a great model for just how valuable access to machine-readable data is.  To date, Michigan has shut down the most number of scam nonprofits out  of all 50 States. This is because of the Michigan attorney general's  ability to manipulate and analyze researchable data.    This bipartisan bill would help expose these shams nationally by  ensuring nonprofits are e-filing annual returns. Therefore, I urge my  colleagues on both sides to support this important good-government,  antifraud bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Yes, it is true, Americans are a charitable group. In fact, we are  the most generous people in the world. Our Nation's history of  philanthropy, charities, and loving people are the envy of the world.  In 2016 alone, Americans gave $390 billion, with 63 million Americans,  25 percent of the adult population, volunteering their time, their  talent, their energy, and their dollars to make a difference.   As a recent commentator noted, Americans have it in their DNA to be  philanthropic. Of all the countries, we are the most generous. Because  I know my colleagues have it in their DNA to support our Nation's  unique philanthropic history and charitable community, I urge them to  vote in favor of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
