 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the  retirement of Mr. Clyde Terry of Concord, NH.   Clyde started his career in 1982 as an administrative hearings  officer, protecting the rights of individuals who experience  disabilities in the State service systems.   He then worked as the director of policy and planning for the New  Hampshire Developmental Disabilities Council. He was promoted to  executive director where he assisted in the drafting of and advocated  for State and Federal legislation on issues impacting the lives of  people who experience disabilities and directed the 5-year State plan.   In 2010, he was named to the National Council on Disabilities by  President Barack Obama and was appointed its chair in 2015. Clyde also  served as the chair of the policy development and program evaluation  committee, and in both roles, he used his vast knowledge and experience  in New Hampshire to guide his work.   For more than 16 years, Clyde has led Granite State Independent  Living, a nonprofit that provides training and support services for  people experiencing disabilities. In this role, he aimed to break the  historical link between disability and poverty, adding education and  employment services to the organization's operations. Under his  leadership, Granite State Independent Living grew from three offices to  eight and increased staff to more than 850 full-time staff and personal  care attendants. This growth has made the organization a statewide  resource for seniors and those who experience disabilities, helping  them have access to competitive integrated employment and to live  safely, comfortably, and independently at home.   In addition, Clyde has been an incredible advocate for democracy and  equality in our elections, leading a national coalition of disability  organizations on election reform and election accessibility and  coauthoring ``Voters Denied Equal Access at the Polls; A Status Report  of the Accessibility of Polling Places in the United States.''   Clyde has helped people understand that all of our citizens deserve  equality, opportunity, and community participation. More and more  people are living lives of self-sufficiency and purpose because of his  hard work and commitment, and I have been honored to work with Clyde on  building a more inclusive New Hampshire and country.   I hope you will join me in honoring a dedicated Granite Stater, Clyde  Terry.                            ____________________
