 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Jimmy Burnsed, who has served as chairman of the Bryan County Board of  Commissioners for the past 12 years.   On December 31, 2016, he officially retired from serving on the  board. Beyond serving as chairman, Mr. Burnsed has dedicated an  admirable amount of his life to public service. Nearly 40 years ago, he  began serving on the City Council for Garden City, Georgia, before  serving 4 years as mayor. In 1989, he moved from Garden City to Bryan  County. In 2005, he ran and was elected chairman of the Board of  Commissioners.   Mr. Burnsed's accomplishments on the board since that time are  numerous. He worked to build a new administrative building for the  county to hold meetings and other events; he managed and planned the  infrastructure for Bryan County, which has grown more than 50 percent  in size during his tenure; and he helped to upgrade Bryan County's  trails, parks, and recreation centers. Mr. Burnsed always put the  community first and performed his duties in a way that would make any  constituent very proud.  [[Page H59]]    Jimmy Burnsed, you will be greatly missed.                            ____________________
