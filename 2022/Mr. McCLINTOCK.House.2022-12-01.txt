 Madam Speaker, whether in 60 seconds or 60 hours, it  is impossible to do justice to the heroism, patriotism, and service  that defines the life of Colonel Bud Anderson.   He flew 116 fighter combat missions over Europe in World War II, shot  down more than 16 enemy aircraft, and was decorated 25 times, including  two Legions of Merit, five Distinguished Flying Crosses, the Bronze  Star, 16 air medals, the French Legion of Honor, and the French Croix  de Guerre.   Chuck Yeager called him a ``mongoose'' and ``the best fighter pilot I  have ever seen.''   After distinguished service in Korea and Vietnam, he managed  McDonnell Douglas' legendary flight facility at Edwards Air Force Base.   He is still going strong at the age of 100, and today, I am pleased  to announce, at the request of Congressman LaMalfa and myself, that the  Air Force has just promoted him to the rank of Brigadier  General, effective December 14.    God bless you, General Anderson. Congratulations, and thank you on  behalf of a grateful Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I voted for this bill in committee  because it is a worthy objective.   Assisting prisoners to successfully reenter society, find jobs, and  take their place as law-abiding citizens is essential to the safety and  stability of our society.   But on further reflection, I have come to believe that this is a  program that the Federal Government should not be funding through  grants to local organizations.   Grants have become the third biggest expenditure of the entire  Federal Government, behind only Social Security and National Defense.   We give away a half-trillion dollars a year in this manner, that is  roughly $4,000 from an average family's taxes, with little oversight,  little accountability, little follow-up, and little results.   Reentry preparation should be a top priority of Federal and State  prison systems. State prisons are a State responsibility. They should  be funded by taxpayers of the individual States. Probation departments  exist precisely to promote reentry, and the model in this bill should  be considered by them.   Now, Federal prisons are our responsibility, and we also have  probation services that should be striving toward implementing concepts  in this bill.   If this measure funded Federal programs that expanded reentry  preparation within the Federal prisons and probation system, I would  strongly support it, but it doesn't. Instead, it takes the money of a  taxpayer in one State and throws that money at a nonprofit organization  in another State with the hope that some good will come from it. And  some might.   But more likely, it will disappear into the salaries of various  groups who will write glowing reports of their work and apply for more  grants next year. And if for some reason the Federal Bureau of Prisons  is unable to provide these services, then they should be competitively  bid out to contractors with specific performance measurements and  accountability.   Federal grant spending is completely out of control and it has to  stop. Reckless spending--all for good causes--I have never seen a grant  program that doesn't promise to do good things, but it is destroying  our prosperity. That spending is driving the worst inflation in 40  years and the most ruinous debt in our Nation's history. And it is hard  to find a grant program that actually delivers on its promises.   I think it is time that we began to spend taxpayers' money as  carefully as they spend what they have got left after we have taxed  them into debt.   This bill falls short of that responsibility.
