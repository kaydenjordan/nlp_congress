 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Until recently, recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals, or DACA program, have been able to secure mortgage insurance  from the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA.   In 2018, lenders began reporting to news sources such as, HousingWire  and BuzzFeed, that officials from the Department of Housing and Urban  Development had informed them that DACA recipients were not eligible  for FHA insurance.   HUD's conflicting responses to public inquiries on the matter left  uncertainty in the market over the past year. Then HUD sent a letter to  Representative Pete Aguilar 2 weeks ago confirming they had stopped  providing FHA insurance for DACA recipients' mortgages.                                time  1700    DACA recipients are individuals living in the U.S. under the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, program. They were brought to the  United States as children. They were children.   As individuals even within this administration have expressed, the  United States is the only place many of them know. It is their home.   DACA recipients are taxpayers, students, teachers, and soldiers. They  are our neighbors. They contribute to our economy and are pillars of  our communities. Yet, individuals now seek to deny DACA recipients  access to owning a home.   Our government insures mortgages through FHA to help low- and middle- income individuals buy a home. This program allowed DACA recipients to  buy their first homes. HUD's move to deny these young people access to  Federal insurance has already blocked people from homeownership.   That is why my colleague, Representative Pete Aguilar, and I have  offered the amendment here today. This amendment simply prohibits HUD  from using funds to deny DACA recipients access to FHA-insured  mortgages.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and provide  these individuals with access to homeownership.   Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Aguilar).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I do thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Diaz-Balart) for his kind words. I appreciate my good friend.   Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Price).    Mr. Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina, the gentleman  from California, and, again, my friend from Florida for their comments.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just close with saying this: Remember,  these are children who were brought to the United States through no  decision of their own. It was their parents'.   So many of us have children, and they don't get to make their own  decisions. We make the decisions when they are children on where they  go, where they live.   Mr. Chair, let's show some heart. Let's show some love to these young  people and allow them to pursue the American Dream. I urge its support.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
