 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate as in morning business for 1 minute.    Madam President, we have been hearing from the other  body a lot about how the Senate isn't taking up House bills. Now, that  seems to be as though the Senate is supposed to somehow be a  rubberstamp for the other body.   Well, we just celebrated Constitution Day last week, and the  Constitution doesn't provide for the Senate to automatically take up  bills from the other body. Maybe it is time for a reminder about how  the Founding Fathers intended the Senate to work, so I am going to give  a short quote by James Madison in the Federalist Papers, No. 62,  entitled ``The Senate'':         The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the       propensity of all single and numerous assemblies, to yield to       the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced       by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious       resolutions.    I am not saying that the House of Representatives passes intemperate  and pernicious resolutions, but at least the Founding Fathers thought  that could happen, and they had the Senate to be a check on the House  of Representatives, just as the House of Representatives can be a check  on anything that we do.   There are now over 80 bills that have passed both Houses, but there  are some that can't pass the Senate, and there are probably some the  Senate feels shouldn't even be brought up. The difference between the  House and Senate--and some contemplation by the Senate to be very  cautious--is how the Constitution meant the Senate was supposed to  work. I hope leaders of the House of Representatives will be reminded  of that from time to time. That is my purpose today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I want to address an issue for my  colleagues, something a lot of Senators have been talking about more  recently, and none too soon--the Mexico-Canada agreement with the  United States, a very important trade agreement.   President Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada signed the USMCA  on November 30, 2018, which was 43 weeks ago. More than 3 months have  passed since Mexico ratified the USMCA, and Canada's ratification is  well underway. However, the U.S. Congress must do its part, and time is  running short.   We have a limited opportunity to ratify the USMCA before election  politics get in the way of securing this very critical win for  literally every broad industry sector in America. I therefore urge the  administration and House Democrats not only to intensify discussions on  the USMCA but also to expedite those discussions and to present USMCA  to the Congress.   By now, everyone should know very well that Mexico and Canada are by  far America's most important trading partners. In 2017, America sold  more than a half trillion dollars of exports to Mexico and Canada.  Those were more exports than we sold to the next 11 largest export  markets combined. For Iowa, my State, 130,000 jobs were supported by  the $6.6 billion of exports to Mexico and Canada in the same year of  2017.   These numbers are not just academic statistics. During the August  State work period, I completed my 39th year holding Q and A's in every  one of Iowa's 99 counties, and I consistently heard from Iowans that  passing the USMCA ought to be a very top priority for the Congress.   I joined the former Governor of Iowa and former U.S. Secretary of  Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, at a dairy processing plant in Des Moines.  This meeting, with one Republican and one Democrat appreciating the  great contributions of Iowa agriculture to our Nation and to exports,  demonstrated what I heard at my town meetings--that passing the USMCA  should be a bipartisan priority.   In Cedar Falls, IA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Under  Secretary, Bill Northey, and I held a roundtable discussion with  various commodity groups about the farm economy and the certainty that  passing USMCA would bring to the agricultural community, particularly  to the family farmers.   USMCA was also a focal point when I held meetings at manufacturing  plants, such as Altec in Osceola, IA, and AIM Aerospace in Orange City,  IA. I can state firsthand that people in the real world--people living  outside of the Washington Beltway--want Congress to pass the USMCA as  soon as possible.   My county meetings help me better represent Iowans, and it is clear  to me that Iowans support the USMCA. We can't squander this opportunity  to update NAFTA, which has been critical to American farmers and  businesses but is now a quarter century old. Issues negotiated in the  USMCA were not issues 25 years ago, showing just how out of date NAFTA  is, as well as the importance of the USMCA.   USMCA will bring greater market access for agriculture and important  new commitments in areas such as customs, digital trade, intellectual  property, labor, the environment, currency, and nontariff trade  barriers. These updates and upgrades will translate into higher wages,  greater productivity, and consequently more jobs for Americans.   In fact, the independent U.S. International Trade Commission found  that USMCA will create nearly 176,000 new American jobs while adding  more than $68 billion to America's GDP.   Let's not forget, USMCA was a hard-fought negotiation. For Mexico,  two Presidents worked across opposing administrations to get this job  done. Canada initially held out of the agreement altogether, only to  sign on at the last possible opportunity.   It is easy for Members of Congress to talk about how we would have  negotiated the agreement differently. There is some talk like that  going on. That would be true whether you are a Republican or Democrat.  However, as the U.S. International Trade Commission report made very  clear, USMCA is a major advancement from the 25-year-old NAFTA  agreement. This is certainly true for labor and the environment, which  were mere side agreements to NAFTA 25 years ago. Now these issues  addressed in USMCA are some of the strongest obligations ever to have  been included in any U.S. trade agreement. Simply put, we can't let the  perfect be the enemy of the good, and calling the USMCA ``good'' would  be a serious understatement.   The administration did its job and brought us a modernized trade  agreement. Nevertheless, the administration has listened to the  concerns of House Democrats and has proposed actions to address those  concerns. For my part, I have kept an open mind throughout this  process, and I welcome any workable, bipartisan solutions. However,  given the political calendar that lies ahead, I need those solutions  promptly. We simply don't have any more time to spare.   Iowans and all Americans deserve some much needed certainty on access  to our half-trillion-dollar export markets in Mexico and Canada, and it  is the job of this Congress to deliver. The time for USMCA is right  now.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to address a matter relating to  the nomination of Daniel Jorjani to be Solicitor at the Department of  Interior. In March, I joined a bipartisan, bicameral letter to Interior  raising concerns about proposed updates to its Freedom of Information  Act, FOIA, regulations. These changes appeared to shift the burden of  identifying the location of agency hold records from the agency to the  public, set limits on requests when they involve processing a ``vast  quantity of material,'' and imposed a monthly limit on the processing  of records for a given requester--all of which have no identifiable  basis in the FOIA statute. Since then, reports indicated other  concerning FOIA policies at Interior that could result in unlawful  delays of FOIA responses--policies that were in place while Mr. Jorjani  served as Deputy Solicitor, with key FOIA responsibilities. Over the  weekend, Interior's inspector general confirmed an investigation into  the FOIA process at Interior. I look forward to reading the results of  this investigation and learning more about the development of these  policies. If confirmed as Solicitor at Interior, Mr. Jorjani would  oversee and resolve FOIA appeals, among other critically important  transparency policies. As we have seen in successive administrations,  FOIA requests are often viewed as the skunk at the picnic. But the  government's business is the people's business. Going forward, Mr.  Jorjani would do well to consult with Congress on any FOIA policy  matters at Interior to ensure compliance with the law. I intend to vote  for Mr. Jorjani today, but let me be clear: I will be holding him--and  any others under any administration--accountable to faithful compliance  with both the letter and spirit of FOIA.
