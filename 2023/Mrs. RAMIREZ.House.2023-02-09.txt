 Mr. Speaker, working people in America are counting on  Congress to not only protect but expand Social Security.   The fact that my Republican colleagues had even considered cutting  Social Security is unconscionable. From Humboldt Park and Belmont  Cragin, to Bensenville, West Chicago, and Elgin, the district I have  the distinct honor of representing is home to hardworking people who,  like everyone, deserve a safe, accessible, and affordable place to call  home.   Regardless of immigration status, working people in Illinois and  across the country have paid into Social Security, including  undocumented workers who pay into Social Security but can't claim the  benefit like everyone else.   It is a hard-earned benefit that people, especially our seniors,  count on to cover housing, which just keeps going up and going up.   In order for all people to build and sustain a better life, we need  to protect Social Security. We need to expand it.                            ____________________
