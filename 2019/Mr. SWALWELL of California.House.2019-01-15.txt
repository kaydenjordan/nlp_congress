 Madam Speaker, I rise to reject white  nationalism, to reject white supremacy, and to reject anyone who  supports these immoral ideas.   I reject   Steve King. So does America.   Do you know what? So do the people of Iowa's Fourth Congressional  District.   How do I know that? Because I was born there to a police officer as a  father and a mom who raised four boys. The way that they raised us is  the way that every family in cities like Ames, Algona, and Sac City  raised their kids: to love each other, to love God, to work together,  and to believe that, in a community, we come together and that love  always conquers. They reject the bigotry that they hear day after day  from their Representative.   I want to make sure that every person in the United States knows that  what was expressed by our colleague is an exception and does not define  the hardworking people of western Iowa.
