 Mr. Speaker, I, like so many in my community of  Minneapolis, are still traumatized. I watched horrified for 8 minutes  and 46 seconds as George Floyd's life was  [[Page H1061]]  taken from him, another innocent Black man murdered by the police in  our community.   Time and time again, we have witnessed the people who are sworn to  protect our communities abuse their power. My city is not an outlier,  but, rather, an example of the inequalities our country has struggled  with for centuries. Brutality against unarmed Black men and women is  not a new phenomenon.   Today, we find ourselves at a crossroad. Will we have the moral  courage to pursue justice and secure meaningful change? Or will we  succumb to this moment?
