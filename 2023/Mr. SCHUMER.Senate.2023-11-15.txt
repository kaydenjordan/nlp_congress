 Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 248,  H.R. 6363.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 248, H.R. 6363, a bill       making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year       2024, and for other purposes.                                Cloture Motion     I send a cloture motion to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The cloture motion having been presented  under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to       proceed to Calendar No. 248, H.R. 6363, a bill making further       continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2024, and for other       purposes.          Charles E. Schumer, Patty Murray, Jack Reed, Benjamin L.             Cardin, Maria Cantwell, Brian Schatz, Chris Van Hollen,             Martin Heinrich, Jeanne Shaheen, Amy Klobuchar,             Catherine Cortez Masto, Richard J. Durbin, Robert P.             Casey, Jr., Tammy Baldwin, Tina Smith, Angus S. King,             Jr., Margaret Wood Hassan.     I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, President Biden will meet face to  face with President Xi Jinping during the APEC summit in San Francisco.  One month ago, President Xi said during our bipartisan codel that there  are at least ``a thousand reasons'' for China and the United States to  have a good relationship. Today, President Xi has the chance to show he  is serious on at least a couple of those reasons.   Above all, I look forward to President Biden following up on our  codel conversation with President Xi in order to get serious on  combating the spread of fentanyl. Fentanyl was one of the biggest  issues we raised with President Xi during our bipartisan codel, and I  related to Jake Sullivan earlier this week that the President should be  strong on this issue during this meeting.   One specific issue we raised was for Chinese law enforcement to  coordinate with U.S. law enforcement and enforce laws already on the  books to stop the sale of precursor chemicals that go into the making  of fentanyl.   Let's be clear. Fentanyl is an American crisis with roots, in large  part, in China, where large chemical companies openly sell precursor  chemicals to buyers in places like Mexico, where it is manufactured by  gangs into fentanyl and then sold in the United States.   When my colleagues and I met with President Xi a month ago, we were  blunt on how fentanyl was devastating our communities and that China  must recognize its role in combating this crisis. I told President Xi  that China taking steps to crack down on the sale of precursor  chemicals would be a great, great deal for them. The benefit they would  see in the boost in American goodwill would far more than outweigh the  tiny cost on their economy. Any good businessman would see that this  would be a great trade.    President Xi seemed receptive to our concerns, and I believe that  there is a  [[Page S5516]]  good chance we will get some good news coming out of today's meeting.  So I thank President Biden for his leadership as he meets with Xi for  the second time in office. It was our experience that President Xi was  responsive when we spoke candidly with specifics. I know President  Biden will do the same today.                                  H.R. 6363    On the CR, Mr. President, last night, the House of Representatives  overwhelmingly passed a temporary extension of government funding into  early next year. The vote in the House was 336 to 95, with 209  Democrats and 127 Republicans voting in favor and 93 Republicans voting  against it.   Shortly after the vote, I moved to place the House-passed bill on the  Senate's legislative calendar, and I have just filed cloture on the  motion to proceed to get this process moving in the Senate.   Today, my Democratic colleagues and I will work with Republicans--and  I will work with Leader McConnell--to see if we can come to an  agreement to accelerate this bill's passage. If both sides cooperate,  there is no reason we can't finish this bill even as soon as today; but  we are going to keep working to see what is possible.   Now, the House's CR is far from perfect, but we are moving forward  because we believe it accomplishes two things that I and other  Democrats have been insistent on for weeks: It will avoid a government  shutdown, and it will do so without any of the cruel cuts or poison  pills that the hard right pushed for.   I think it was very important that Speaker Johnson recognized that  Democratic votes are necessary to pass anything of significance in  Congress. I have reminded him every time I have spoken to him that we  have to work in a bipartisan way to get anything done and, if he  follows the clarion call of the hard right, whose views are far away  from even the mainstream of his Conference, let alone the American  people's or the Senate's, that it would lead to disaster--the same  problems that we saw under Speaker Boehner, Speaker Ryan, and Speaker  McCarthy.   Thus far, the Speaker has heeded the lesson as we finish the  appropriations process. Bipartisanship is the only way forward, as he  once noted. When you have a Senate that is Democratic and a President  that is Democratic and a Republican House, particularly one that just  follows what the hard right wants, you will not get anything  accomplished.   Of course, the CR doesn't do everything we want. Above all, we must  finish working on President Biden's emergency supplemental request so  we can send aid to Israel, provide humanitarian aid for innocent  civilians in Gaza, stand with Ukraine, and provide funds for the Indo- Pacific. We will continue to work with Leader McConnell on a way  forward. We intend to move on the President's supplemental package  sometime in the coming weeks.   As everyone knows, the biggest holdup right now is the Republicans'  insistence that they will only approve Ukraine aid in exchange for  immigration items. We are going to work in the coming weeks, in good  faith, to see if there is any possibility for a reasonable, realistic  compromise that Democrats can support. To come to such a compromise,  both sides will have to give. It can't be one side all the way, as when  our Republican colleagues offered us, basically, H.R. 2, which we  totally opposed and had no input into. So I hope we can get this  reasonable, realistic compromise on the border done.   The bottom line is that we need to get Israel aid done; we need to  get Ukraine aid done; we need to get humanitarian aid done; we need to  get Indo-Pacific aid done. And linking any of these bipartisan issues  to extremist positions, to extremist poison pills on immigration or any  other issue, would be a colossal blunder that history will look very  unkindly upon. I hope we can come to a solution in the coming weeks.   In the meantime, the most important order of business is to keep the  government open. We will keep working over the course of the day to  fast-track the House's bipartisan CR bill. No drama, no delay, no  government shutdown--that is our goal, and we hope we have an agreement  very soon. To avoid a shutdown with no cuts in vital programs and no  poison pills is a very good solution for the American people.                                Student Loans    Mr. President, on the student debt CRA, today, Senate Republicans  continue their cruelty and their lack of connection with what people  want and need as they force a vote on a cruel measure to eliminate  President Biden's historic loan repayment program--a punch to the gut  for millions and millions of borrowers, the overwhelming majority of  whom are working class, poor, or middle class.   Let me be clear: I strongly--very strongly--oppose this terrible  Republican measure to deny American families relief from the crushing  burden of student debt.   My Republican colleagues like to talk a big game about helping  working families, but with this student debt Congressional Review Act,  they are actively trying to increase the pain on so many working  Americans, working Americans who need a hand in paying off their  student loans.   The hypocrisy is astounding on the other side of the aisle.  Republicans don't think twice about giving huge tax breaks to  ultrawealthy billionaires and large corporations, but when it comes to  helping out working families with student debt relief, suddenly, it is  too much money; it will raise the deficit; we can't afford it. Give me  a break. Cut taxes on multibillionaires, and tell a struggling student  who is making $30,000, $40,000 a year that they can't get a little help  on their student loans? That is so out of whack with what the American  people want and care about.   Let me be clear: The President's SAVE Plan is a major lifeline for  student loan borrowers to help get their financial houses in order.  Over 5.5 million Americans are signed up and benefiting from this plan.  So the worst thing we could do right now is let the Republicans' CRA  pass and pull the rug out from under these borrowers' feet with no  warning.    I strongly oppose this Republican CRA to overturn student debt  relief. Democrats will keep working to make sure relief reaches every  borrower in need.                             Military Promotions    Mr. President, on Senator Tuberville, yesterday, the Senate Rules  Committee reported out our resolution to quickly confirm the military  nominations being blocked by Senator Tuberville. I was proud to join  the Rules Committee to vote in favor of this resolution. Now that the  Rules Committee has acted, I will bring this resolution to the floor  soon so we can swiftly confirm the hundreds of military nominations  being held by Senator Tuberville.   You know, Mr. President, there has been a lot of negativity and  dysfunction in the Senate these days, but Senator Tuberville has  single-handedly brought the Senate to a new low. He should be ashamed  of himself. Patience is wearing thinner and thinner with Senator  Tuberville on both sides of the aisle. What Senator Tuberville is doing  is an anomaly in the history of this Chamber.   Of course, every single one of us, not just Senator Tuberville, has  issues we feel passionately about, we are certain we are right, as he  is in his anti-abortion stand. Every one of us could go and block all  of our generals, all of our admirals, and harm our military security  because we feel passionately and want to put our views above the views  of the rest of the Chamber and of the American people in this case. And  what would happen? We would have no military, basically. None. Our  national security would be at risk--severe risk--and our way of life  would change.   If every one of us had the temerity and recklessness to do what  Senator Tuberville has done--and, thank God, no one else has--of each  party, it would not only bring the work of this Chamber to a halt, it  would risk our national security; it would risk our American way of  life eventually. Current and former military officials have spoken out  again and again to talk about the devastating impact these holds have  on our readiness and our military families.   I wish we had not reached this point. I wish my Republican colleagues  could have importuned Senator Tuberville to drop his reckless holds,  but it has not happened. It has not happened. Although, there is still  some ray of hope, particularly based on what Leader McConnell said in  his statement in  [[Page S5517]]  the Rules Committee, that maybe, at the last minute, Republican  colleagues--which is their responsibility--can persuade their colleague  to back off, to find an off-ramp, to aim, as Leader McConnell said in  his speech at the Rules Committee, his hold at a policy official who  has real say on this issue, not at generals, admirals, and flag  officers who have worked so hard for our military and are now being  held back and whose families are in difficulty because of what he has  callously done.   So we still hold out some small hope that, in the next little, short  while, our Republican colleagues can persuade Tuberville to back off.  But if it does not happen, we intend to move this resolution to the  floor of the Senate to overcome Senator Tuberville's military holds.   I thank Chair Klobuchar and I thank Chair Reed for their good work on  moving this important resolution.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, we reached an agreement here, which I  will get to in a second. I just want to say a brief word about the vote  that just happened.   I am very glad that this CRA was defeated. There are millions of  students--poor, working class, some middle class, almost none wealthy-- who benefit from what the President has done. The very poor people,  they don't have to pay student loans. For most of the rest who are  working class and middle class, they pay about half of what they did.  It really is a change to help our young people. It is a good thing. It  is a good thing.    I want to say that I am very glad that this Chamber had the good  sense to defeat it, because I don't understand my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle who believe in ``we can cut taxes for the very  wealthy and decrease the deficit, but not help students with the big  loan burdens on their shoulders.'' But that is how it is.   President Biden has been really careful about doing this. I believe  it will be approved in the courts.   And, now, the 25.5 million students who have benefited from this and  millions more will continue. So this is a real victory for our young  people and for the future of America, so kids can afford to go to  college and then have decent lives, not burdened by huge amounts of  student debt after they graduate.   Now, the good news is--that was good news, at least in my opinion.  This is probably good news in many of our opinions, on both sides of  the aisle, that we have an agreement.                    Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 6363    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion with  respect to the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 248, H.R. 6363, be  withdrawn and that the motion to proceed be agreed to; further, that  the only amendment in order to H.R. 6363 be the Paul amendment, No.  1366; that there be up to 15 minutes for debate equally divided; that  upon the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate vote on or in  relation to the amendment; that upon disposition of the amendment,  there be up to 30 minutes for debate equally divided; that upon the use  or yielding back of the time, the bill be considered read a third time  and the Senate vote on passage of the bill as amended, if amended, with  60 affirmative votes required for passage, without further intervening  action or debate, and with 2 minutes for debate equally divided prior  to each vote.                    Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2670    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that following the  disposition of H.R. 6363, the Chair lay before the Senate the message  with respect to H.R. 2670, the National Defense Authorization Act,  which was received from the House; that the leader or his designee then  be recognized to make the compound motion under rule XXVIII; that the  Senate insist upon its amendment, agree to the conference with the  House, authorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees with the  ratio of conferees being 13 to 12; further, that if the compound motion  is agreed to, it be in order for the following Senators or their  designees to offer motions to instruct, which are at the desk:  Klobuchar, Rubio, Hickenlooper, Blackburn, Lankford, Lummis, Cramer,  Moran, Ernst, Hagerty, Braun, and Manchin; finally, that the Democratic  conferees be Senators Reed, Shaheen, Gillibrand, Blumenthal, Hirono,  Kaine, King, Warren, Peters, Manchin, Duckworth, Rosen, and Kelly; and  that the Republican conferees be Senators Wicker, Fischer, Cotton,  Rounds, Ernst, Sullivan, Cramer, Scott of Florida, Tuberville, Mullin,  Budd, and Schmitt.    Madam President, I have good news for the American  people: This Friday night, there will be no government shutdown.  Because of bipartisan cooperation, we are keeping the government open  without any poison pills or harmful cuts to vital programs--a great  outcome for the American people.   I am pleased that Speaker Johnson realized he needed Democratic votes  to avoid a shutdown. If the Speaker is willing to work with Democrats  and resist the siren's song of the hard right in the House, then we can  avoid shutdowns in the future and finish the work of funding the  government.   Today's CR is a good first step and a very good omen for the future.  I hope we see more bipartisanship down the line.   Every time I have gotten on the phone with the Speaker, I have  stressed we need bipartisanship if we want to finish the appropriations  process. I hope the new Speaker continues to choose the bipartisan  approach as he commendably has in his first foray.  [[Page S5529]]    Now, keeping the government open is a good outcome, but we have a lot  more to do after Thanksgiving. We must finish passing President Biden's  emergency supplemental with aid to Israel, Ukraine, humanitarian  assistance for innocent civilians in Gaza, and funds for the Indo- Pacific. We will keep working with Leader McConnell on a way forward.   I know that both sides genuinely care about providing aid to Israel  and Ukraine and helping innocent civilians in Gaza, so I hope we can  come to an agreement, even if neither side gets everything they insist  on.   We will also complete our work on the National Defense Authorization  Act before the end of the year. For now, I thank my colleagues for  voting to keep the government open. I thank Leader McConnell, Chair  Murray, Vice Chair Collins, and all of the appropriators. Again, no  government shutdown, no cuts to vital programs, no poison pills. This  is a great outcome for the American people.   Now, my colleagues, after this vote on the CR, we have one more vote,  to vote a conference on the NDAA. I urge everyone to stay here so we  can finish the next vote quickly, and then do the third vote without  further delay.   I yield the floor to the wonderful chair of the Appropriations  Committee who did so much to get us here.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 354.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 308.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 117.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, November 15, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 212, Roger F. Nyhus, of  Washington, to be Ambassador to Barbados, the Federation of Saint Kitts  and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, the Commonwealth of  Dominica, Grenada, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; that the  Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate;  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, on another matter, today, with a heart  full of gratitude, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to Laura  Lytle, who is retiring today as the Daily Press Media Gallery Director.   Laura is precisely my kind of Senate staffer: It was through her good  work that the press has been able for all these years to access the  Senate and keep the American public informed about our work.   Laura joined the Sergeant at Arms in May of 1994 as an intern in the  Press Gallery, taking on special projects to help the fine-tuned  machinery of the Gallery to function properly. Over the years, she  worked her way up the ladder and became the director of the Daily Press  Media Gallery in June of 2013.   It was Laura who was responsible for credentialing reporters for  daily newspapers, wire services, and online publications and has helped  facilitate press interactions with Members.   Without Laura, that crucial bridge between this Chamber and the  public that the press creates would not be possible. She has been the  facilitator and gatekeeper, and we are all so thankful for her service.   Laura, we wish you the very best on the next step in our journey. We  will miss you, and please know you always have a home here in the  Senate.                            ____________________     Madam President, I have eight requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
