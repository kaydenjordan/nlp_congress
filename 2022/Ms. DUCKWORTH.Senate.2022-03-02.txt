 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the  remarkable life of Sergeant Marlene R. Rittmanic, a 21-year veteran of  law enforcement who was fatally shot and passed away on December 30,  2021, while serving in the line of duty. Sergeant Rittmanic started her  remarkable career at the Iroquois County Sheriff's Police Department,  serving 7 years before transferring to the Bradley Police Department in  2007, for the last 14 years.   Throughout her years of protecting and serving, Sergeant Rittmanic  received the Officer of the Year Award for Kankakee County and  countless letters of commendation for her service to the community. She  will be remembered by her colleagues as a model officer and someone who  looked forward to making memories with her fellow officers as the  department's photographer, posting inspirational and team-building  photographs of the officers and the community.   Sergeant Rittmanic was not only a dedicated law enforcement officer,  but also a devoted wife and citizen who was loved and respected in her  community. Sergeant Rittmanic served in the U.S. Army and was a proud  disabled veteran. Sergeant Rittmanic, a poet, also penned the prophetic  poem, ``The Color We Bleed is That of Deep Blue,'' in 2001.   Sergeant Rittmanic was tragically killed in the line of duty while  fulfilling her oath to serve and protect the people of the Village of  Bradley, IL, and I am grateful for her years of service. She leaves  behind her wife, Lyn, and their 2 rescue dogs, Trigger and Abeline. May  her service, sacrifice, and kind spirit serve as an inspiration to us  all.                            ____________________
