 Mr. President, I was very pleased to be here for the  remarks of my colleagues and friends, and I would just respond by  saying that we are all for growth. We are all for growth of the  American economy. I think, on this side, we are just a little bit less  sure that you grow the economy by growing the share of the economy that  goes to the superrich and to big corporations or that you grow the  economy by growing benefits to corporations that move jobs from America  overseas, and I am pretty confident that on our side we don't believe  the  [[Page S7242]]  solution to the deficit is a tax bill that raises the deficit.
