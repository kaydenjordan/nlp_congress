 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from New York for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, this is Maleah Davis. We mourn her loss in Houston, Texas.  She was 4 years old.   My amendment provides funding to support and engage adult men and  young persons to reduce and prevent domestic violence against children.  In recent reports, 1,600 children died because of abuse or neglect.   This amendment will help ensure the safety of vulnerable children in  at-risk households who are powerless to get the help and attention they  need from our government.   To illustrate this, this is the case of Maleah Davis, a 4-year-old  girl who lived in Houston. In the past, Texas Child Protective Services  removed Maleah and her two brothers from their home over reports of  abuse but returned them again in February. They took them away from  their relatives and, along with a court judge, returned them to this  family.   Maleah's mother dated her boyfriend for years, and they had a son.  Maleah's mother had gone to a funeral out of town.   When the boyfriend initially reported that his girlfriend's daughter  was missing, he told detectives that he had been attacked, but  surveillance video shows him carrying a black bag out of the home.   The last time that Maleah was seen was going into that home.   The real question is whether or not the Child Protective Services is  really doing its job, whether or not it is dealing with educating these  families or intervening in these families to make sure a loving little  girl like Maleah Davis does not lose her life.   In addition to this funding to intervene in men and boys' lives to  prevent this kind of abuse and loss of life, and the tragedy of finding  the remains of little Maleah in a plastic bag along the highway in  Arkansas, I look forward to working with my colleagues on an overhaul  of children's protective services throughout the Nation, because, in  particular in Texas, 1,600 children die of abuse and neglect, many of  them in children's protective services.   I am delighted that my amendment passed.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Chairwoman Lowey's En Bloc Amendment  No. 2, which includes Jackson Lee Amendment No. 19.   I wish to thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole of the  Rules Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I thank Chairman Serrano and Ranking Member Aderhold for their hard  work in bringing Division A, the Commerce-Justice-Science portion of  this omnibus appropriations legislative package, to the floor.   Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment,  which is simple and straightforward and ensures that our government  works to protect our children.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 19, reprograms $2 million in the Office of  Justice Programs grant funding to support programs to engage adult men  and young persons to reduce and prevent domestic violence against  children.   This amendment will help ensure the safety of vulnerable children in  at-risk households, who are powerless to getting the help and attention  they need from our government.   To illustrate the need for this amendment, let me share with you the  tragic case of Maleah Davis, a 4-year old little girl who lived in  Houston.   In the past, Texas Child Protective Services removed Maleah and her  two brothers from their home over reports of abuse, but returned them  to the home in February.   Maleah's mother dated her boyfriend for years and they shared a  toddler son together.   Maleah's mother had gone out of town when she left her daughter under  her boyfriend's care.   When the boyfriend initially reported that his girlfriend's daughter  was missing, he told detectives he had been attacked by unknown men a  day earlier and that they kidnapped Maleah.   However, surveillance video outside of the home shows Maleah never  left their apartment after she followed him in, and shows him carrying  a laundry basket with a trash bag out of the building a day before he  reported her missing.   Maleah's remains were later discovered in a bag along Interstate 30  in Arkansas.   Although the case has not been completed yet, there are valuable  lessons that we can learn from Maleah's and similar cases.   There have been similar cases to Maleah where the caretaker initially  reports a missing child but we later learn that the caretaker is  actually the suspect and perpetrator of the crime.   Similar cases include 5-year old AJ Freund from Illinois, whose  father confessed to hiding his body in the basement, and 7-week old  Shaylie Madden from North Carolina, whose mother has been charged with  first-degree attempted murder.   The nation has learned from Maleah and other similar stories that we  must do everything in our power to protect at risk children.   Maleah Davis should be alive today.   Horrible cases such as this should not be happening in America; we  need to make sure our checks and balances are keeping our children  safe.  [[Page H4930]]    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership, and I want to thank the Appropriations Committee, and this  one in particular, for the great work that the committee is doing.   I have had the privilege of doing amendments under the CJS,  Agriculture, Interior, and let me express my appreciation for the added  $2 million for research in Historically Black Colleges, and  particularly the opportunity for my amendment to enable NIFA to  increase funding by $2 million to the 1890 institutions, which are 19  HBCU land grants to support educational research.   It is so very important as it relates to food and agriculture, in  particular, to make an increase so that the 1890 institutions can again  be at the forefront of research. One of the schools in my area, Prairie  View A&M, and Texas Southern University prepare the leaders for the  agriculture industry of the future. So this legislation provides  support for the many schools, such as Alabama A&M, Alcorn State  University, Prairie View A&M, Fort Valley State University, Kentucky  State University; and, of course, they enroll 40 percent of all African  American students.   So I am grateful for this amendment, and I ask my colleagues to  support the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Chair's En Bloc Amendment, which  includes Jackson Lee Amendment No. 91.   I wish to thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole of the  Rules Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Fortenberry for their hard  work in bringing Division B, the Agriculture and Related Agencies  portion of this omnibus appropriations legislative package, to the  floor.   Thank you for this opportunity to briefly explain my amendment.   The Jackson Lee amendment supports the work of the National Institute  of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) by making a modest increase in funding  to that office for the purpose of supporting agriculture research  programs at 1890s Institutions, which are land grant colleges at 19  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).   NIFA works to improve our nation's food production through  agricultural research, economic analysis, extension, and higher  education.   The NIFA was created at the time of the industrial revolution to  ensure that the nation would have a sufficient number of working farms  to provide a reliable supply of domestically produced food.   One of ways NIFA achieves its mission is by providing research grants  to education institutions, which include 1890s institutions created by  the Morrill Act of 1890.   Today, land-grant colleges and universities can be found in 18  states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   The list includes:   Alabama A&M University   Alcorn State University   Delaware State University   Florida A&M University   Fort Valley State University   Kentucky State University   Langston University   Lincoln University   North Carolina A&T State University   Prairie View A&M University in Texas   South Carolina State University   Southern University System   Tennessee State University   Tuskegee University   University of Arkansas Pine Bluff   University of Maryland Eastern Shore   University of the District of Columbia   University of the Virgin Islands   Virginia State University   West Virginia State University   HBCUs annually enroll 40 percent of all African American students in  4-year colleges and universities.   HBCUs are prominent among research institutions in fields such as:   animal sciences   sustainable agriculture and agriculture economics   toxicology and waste management   conservation and environmental management   business and industrial development   biomedical science   food and nutrition   plant and social sciences   international development   The demand for fresh fruits and vegetables as well as concerns for  the distance food travels before they reach the tables in urban areas  has led to the rise of urban farming.   HBCU agriculture research institutions are playing a significant role  in bringing urban farming to communities of color.  [[Page H4958]]    HCBU's agricultural research programs also assist people living in  densely populated areas to learn ways to eliminate food deserts,  increase public education regarding farming, develop a greater  appreciation for our nation's farmers, and provide new avenues for  careers for those graduating with agriculture degrees seeking to inter  into cutting edge agricultural research.   The funds provided by the Jackson Lee amendment would support  research and education into means for helping urban and suburban  communities maximize their green space by turning it into productive  farming resources to support access to affordable foods.   The funding can also help to develop new research efforts directed at  farming techniques for non-traditional farming space, such as those we  are now seeing being developed for urban centers.   Adoption of the Jackson Lee Amendment will benefit rural, suburban  and urban areas by maximizing the potential for farming activity in  areas where green space is limited, or land is underused.   I urge support of the Jackson Lee Amendment and thank Chairman Bishop  and his colleagues on the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee for  their work on this important legislation.    Madam Speaker, for a very long time, the entire  community, including his neighborhood, the Near Northside, mourned the  loss of a wonderful little boy by the name of Josue Flores.   We mourn with his family members and his neighborhood. What a loving  neighborhood.   We stood by the tree in the area in which he was murdered, stabbed  many times. There were investigations and arrests, and then there were  no arrests, and the community still mourned.   I want to applaud the Near Northside for continuing to remember Josue  Flores, as well the Safe Work Coalition, ensuring that no child would  ever walk home to be victimized in that neighborhood again.   Many law enforcement officers and civil rights groups and others work  together, civic neighborhood groups--the Near Northside Super  Neighborhood--but now there is finally an arrest. We hope that justice  is rendered for that family and justice is rendered for this whole act  that we hope never happens again.   We mourn him. We want it to be fair and just. But we want Josue  Flores to rest in peace and want this proceeding to move forward so  that this family can have peace and this neighborhood can be assured  that their children can be safe again.   I will work with them continuously, as we did, to ensure that law  enforcement is there for them and the community is there for them.                            ____________________
