 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair of the  House Judiciary Committee for yielding and for his leadership. I thank  my good friend and colleague Representative Cheri Bustos for  her leadership.    The people of America, the women of America have a right to be free  of sexual harassment. The women of America have a right to be free of  sexual assault. The women of America have a right to be free of a  hostile work environment. They deserve their day in court.   The process and practice of forced arbitration undermines these  rights without providing an adequate remedy. The American people are  being hoodwinked. The American people are being bamboozled. The  American people are being led astray by forced arbitration.   This practice of forced arbitration is unfair, unjust, unacceptable,  unconscionable, and un-American.   H.R. 4445 will make it unlawful.   I urge strong support for this legislation so that liberty and  justice for all can prevail.
