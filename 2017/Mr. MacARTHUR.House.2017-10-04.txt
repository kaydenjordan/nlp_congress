 Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Marshall) having assumed the chair, Mr. Mitchell, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the concurrent  resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the congressional budget for  the United States Government for fiscal year 2018 and setting forth the  appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
