 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 2. Title III  of this bill happens to fall under the House Foreign Affairs  Committee's jurisdiction.   There is undoubtedly a need to fix our broken immigration system. I  think that we can all agree. It is undoubtedly correct that Congress  needs to get involved in that. What Congress is not doing is talking  about coming together for comprehensive immigration reform. If we want  to get at the  [[Page H2275]]  heart of how to improve, in a humane way, and protect our borders, we  would be locked together to talk about comprehensive immigration reform  that will keep us true to who we are and our values.   Sometimes when I am listening to this debate and some of the policies  that are here, I am saying: Who are we? Who are we as a people, as a  nation? Do we practice what we preach, or do we say to others: Do what  we say, not what we do?   American values are important here. Title III seeks to codify and  reinstate the Trump administration's failed Migrant Protection  Protocols, known as MPP, and remain in Mexico policy. This is a  disturbing and ineffective policy that returned asylum seekers at the  border of Mexico and only allowed them to enter the United States for  their court proceedings. Listening to my colleague: Return them to  Mexico. That is it.   Because there are thousands of backlogged cases and too few judges to  effectively handle them, those that we return to Mexico, these asylum  seekers, are forced to live in Mexican border towns for long periods of  time. As a result of that, the exact same thing that my colleague  talked about, these border towns in Mexico are the ones that are  dangerous. They are the reason why people are raped. That is where the  violence and the crime is. They do not have, these towns in Mexico, the  capacity to safely house the thousands of people fleeing their  countries of origin.   We know that migrants face violence of all kinds, including murder,  rape, trafficking, and kidnapping as they await their court appearance,  the very things that we do agree is happening to these individuals, but  we put blinders on. Just send them back. That will solve the problem of  them living in tent encampments without adequate access to the basics.  Just send them back to Mexico. Let them stay there with no clean water,  no sanitation, no shelter, and no health services. Send them back. We  don't care.   The MPP puts tens of thousands of migrants in greater danger,  including families with children who we are supposed to care about. It  also puts America at odds with our regional partners in ways that were  and still are a detriment to our national security and our global  standing.   Like Mr. McCaul, I have been here for 25 years. I have many families  in my district who come to me all of the time with humanitarian  concerns, asking for us to pass comprehensive immigration reform.   While nations like Colombia and Peru took in millions of Venezuelans  crossing their border in desperate need of safety, America, the United  States of America, the most resourced Nation on Earth, a Nation of  immigrants, turn our backs on asylum seekers and our very own values in  the name of deterrence. Turn our backs. We don't care. Send them back.   As CARICOM continues to work in a regional and multilateral way to  find solutions to help Haiti, our neighbor in crisis, this body debates  unilateral action that fails to see the collective challenge facing  this hemisphere.   This bill is more than just shortsighted; it is cruel and harmful to  our interests. We should be embarrassed, absolutely embarrassed, that  Colombia's migration agency had suspended a program meant to return  Colombian nationals found at the U.S. border with Mexico due to ``cruel  and degrading treatment.'' Come on now.   We are facing a regional and global migration crisis. We have strong  and divergent opinions about improving an imperfect immigration process  and how to address the recent surge in migration since the pandemic.  But Title III of this bill seeks to codify and reinitiate failed  processes from the last administration that do not solve the real-life  challenges regarding the movement of people, those people fleeing from  instability and violence and lack of economic opportunity and education  in their home countries.   Why? Because, apparently, we don't care. We don't care. Send them  back. Who cares what happens to them? Send them back. We don't have  comprehensive immigration reform to make sure that we are working and  fixing the system because that is what we should be working on.   This isn't the first surge of migrants on our border, and it won't be  the last, particularly as climate change will further limit resources  and displace people across the region. To solve complex  multicountry challenges, we must invest in multilateral solutions. When  we invest in multilateral solutions, as we do in other parts of the  world, that is how we win--not America alone, America by ourselves.  That is not leadership. No one follows you if you are just by yourself,  not working with others and not working with our allies.    The Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection from the  Summit of the Americas in 2022 included proposals for collaborative  problem solving on this issue with leaders across the region to address  the root causes of forced displacement and irregular migration.   Working with our allies, as we are doing in other parts of the world,  as we are doing with our NATO allies, as we are doing with our EU  allies, as we are doing with our Indo-Pacific allies, we should be  doing the same thing with our Western Hemisphere allies.   Why? Because our strength is not rooted in the sticks that we use to  coerce outcomes. It is in the depth of our relationships and  collaboration across the region to address the root causes of forced  displacement and a regular migration, including by combating corruption  and impunity, upholding our obligations to protect refugees, and  partnering to promote opportunity and prosperity for people and  communities, especially those most vulnerable across the region.   When I get on my knees at night and pray, when I am in church and  pray, I pray for the poor and for those who cannot care for themselves.  When I read books that I believe in, they talk about taking care of the  poor, taking care of those who can't take care of themselves.   When I eat my dinner, my lunch, or my breakfast and I pray, I say:  Bless those who are hungry and have no food. Bless those who may have  food and no appetite. Bless those who have less than me.   We are the richest country in the world. Let's work toward resolving  the root causes.   This bill doesn't address the migration crisis. It only creates  further chaos by shutting the door on mechanisms that reunite families.  That is what I believe. That is what I pray. That is what I think  mankind is all about or should be all about, keeping people safe from  perilous journeys to our borders. These attempts to sow seeds of fear  and distrust about migrants are as counterproductive as they are  reprehensible.   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, the broader bill undermines Congress'  bipartisan work to grant humanitarian parole to hundreds of thousands  of Afghans. We have been working together on that, and we should be  working together to help those who are trying to cross the border from  our Western Hemisphere allies. But this also prevents and goes against  thousands of Afghans, Ukrainians, and others, by restricting DHS parole  authority.   If we are truly interested in a constructive agenda that is aimed at  providing viable and durable solutions to migration challenges, I stand  ready. Democrats stand ready to collaborate on addressing the root  causes of migration through congressional action, through working on  comprehensive immigration reform to try to make sure that we lead by  example and we live true to our values, that we become the shining  example for others in other countries who are looking at us to see how  we react to it.   We should do that by showing in a bipartisan way we are ready for  comprehensive immigration reform. We will do it in a bipartisan way. We  will do it so that we can also maintain our values and who we are--at  least who we say we are--as a nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove), an esteemed member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro), the ranking member on the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   The Foreign Affairs title of this bill should be about addressing the  root causes of migration; about fixing the crime, corruption, poverty,  and discrimination that causes people to flee north.   The men and women coming to our borders do so reluctantly. They do  not want the pain of leaving parents and children behind for an unknown  time while they seek refuge in an unfamiliar land. They want to see  their daughters when they come home from work, not on a video call.  They want to hear their siblings' voices at the dinner table, not on a  Zoom.   The way to address the root causes of migration is through aid,  assistance, investment, collaboration, and rule of law guidance. If we  refuse to fund such programs and efforts, we are being penny-wise and  pound-foolish; ignoring our hemispheric neighbors until they are  knocking on our front door. What we need to do is address the root  causes.    This legislation is not in line with national security interests, our  values, or our goals of curbing the migration crisis. It only  exacerbates the situation on the border while reinstating the same  inhumane policies that have endangered migrants. We have seen that done  by the former administration. We have seen the actions. We know who he  is, and we know why he put some of those policies forward.   I can't close without saying that Chairman McCaul is a good man. I  work with him on the committee. We talk and we debate and we do things.  I don't want this to end with anyone thinking that I don't think Mr.  McCaul is a good human being. He is. We do that together. However, I do  have questions.   I hear a lot of talk about President Biden and what he is doing or  what his motivations are, et cetera. I, too, have questions about the  policies of former President Trump. Coming from New York, I have been  around a lot and seen and heard his motivations, particularly as it  pertains to the bills that he put forward in regard to migration, and I  know what he thinks of immigrants.   I know what the former President thinks of immigrants. Why? Because  he said it. He has said things that have been shocking to me, that  reveal what he thought and why he put forward the principles that he  started. It is not me making it up. Over 34 times he called these  immigrants who are trying to come for better lives animals. That is not  how we should look at these poor individuals who are running from  crises, as they are doing in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Venezuela, and other  parts of Latin America.   I know because I come from New York. I have seen what he has done to  his own employees and how he has treated them. I know because I heard  from his own mouth, calling countries on the continent of Africa and in  the Caribbean and South America ``asshole countries.'' I know because  he also just wanted to put a ban on people because of their religious  beliefs. I know because even after people were convicted in the Central  Park 5 in New York, he still called them vicious names. I know his  motivations, and that is reflective in the policies that he has passed.   That is why we should not be supporting this bill. That is not who we  are as Americans. Let's fight to show the rest of the world who we  really are, that we want to take care, as that statue in New York City  stands with that lady holding the torch--give me your tired, your poor.  That is who we became as a country, not the motivations of the former  President and his policies.   This bill is a step in the wrong direction. It is in the wrong  direction. Our partners in the region are watching us very closely  today. I have been talking to those leaders. I have been talking to  people from the various countries in Central and South America, many of  whom are in my district. This is not the way to go.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members of this august body, let's not fall  into the same mistakes of the past. Let's sit down and figure out how  we can work together in a bipartisan way for a strong immigration  reform bill, so we can treat humans as humans, so we can show our  actions are similar to what we pray.   Whether we are in a church or a synagogue or a mosque, we pray for  the poor and the helpless; we want to make a difference. We have an  opportunity to  [[Page H2280]]  do that. We have an opportunity to make sure that we keep our borders  safe by dealing with the root causes of migration and treating people  in a humane way, not just considering those in law enforcement, but  thinking about the people. When I see their hands on the gates asking  for a better life, saying all I want to do is see my child have an  opportunity, and I am willing to go through whatever the process is.  Let's think about them. Let's think about those images. Let's think  about how we can do better.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1430
