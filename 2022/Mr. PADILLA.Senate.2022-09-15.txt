 Mr. President, I rise today because today is a  bittersweet day for me. I rise to recognize and express my gratitude  for the outstanding work of Vanessa Valdivia, who has served as my  communications director since my first day here in the Senate. I speak  for everybody in my office when I say we are going to miss her.   But I am also proud. Next week, she will begin work at the White  House as Special Assistant to the President and as Press Secretary to  the First Lady. I have no doubt that she will do great things in her  new role.   Since our first days in the Russell basement, in an office I had when  I was transitioning, Vanessa has brought her incredible experience, her  unique personality, and her tremendous passion to the job in helping me  communicate our work to the people of California. From my maiden speech  here on the Senate floor, during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic,  to crisscrossing the State on an infrastructure listening tour as we  were negotiating the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act here in  Washington, to ensuring that Californians were consistently informed of  the historic progress that we have made in this Congress, Vanessa has  been a key leader in my office and an adviser to me.   She is a California native and is the proud daughter of Mexican- Nicaraguan immigrants. Now, some of you may remember some of my remarks  during the confirmation hearings of now-Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson  when I said that, often, Americans of color needed to work twice as  hard to garner half the respect. Well, it comes as no surprise that  Vanessa has gained the utmost respect from her former bosses and  colleagues on the various Presidential and Senate campaigns that she  has been a part of and from the Senate offices that she has worked in,  including those of Senators Booker, Heinrich, and Peters in addition to  mine, and I have no doubt that she will bring the same work ethic and  savvy to serving the First Lady and the Biden administration.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to deliver the next part of my  remarks in Spanish.    (English translation of statement made in Spanish is as  follows:)         Vanessa, I wish you all the luck in your next chapter.       Don't forget your friends here in the Senate. I have no doubt       that you will continue to do great things working for the       First Lady and the Biden administration. Thank you for your       work for all of California.    Mr. President, let the record reflect that Vanessa Valdivia will be  deeply missed and that the State of California and the U.S. Senate  thank her for her service.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Tule River Tribe  Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act of 2022. This legislation would  finalize this multidecade effort by the Tule River Tribe to provide  clean drinking water to their people and uphold the Federal  Government's trust and treaty responsibilities.   The Tule River people are descendants of the Yokuts Indians, a large  group of Native Americans who occupied what is now known as the San  Joaquin Valley in California for thousands of years prior to contact  with settlers.   In 1856, the Federal Government established their reservation in  Tulare County, with the specific goal of providing the Tribe with  arable farmland and the water resources necessary to establish self- sufficiency. However, their land was fraudulently stolen from them, and  in 1873, President Grant issued an Executive order to create a new  reservation for the tribe. This land, which is the Tribe's current  reservation, is comprised of mostly mountainous lands that do not  provide sufficient irrigation opportunities or water storage  facilities. Today, the Tule River Tribe struggles to provide clean  drinking water to their people, and Tule Tribal citizens suffer from a  low standard of living as a result.   Since 1971, the Tribe has worked to establish its federally reserved  water rights to create the viable homeland they were promised and to  ensure that their citizens have enough water to meet their current and  future water needs. For decades, the Tribe has worked with the  Departments of the Interior and Justice as well as downstream water  users to advance a settlement agreement, thereby avoiding costly  litigation for both the Tribe and the U.S. Government.   I am proud to introduce this legislation to quantify the Tribe's  water right of 5,828 acre-feet per year of surface water and fund $568  million towards the construction of a water storage project. Our  legislation would also codify what is known as the 2007 Agreement with  downstream water users, who support this legislation. Finally, the  legislation would transfer approximately 9,000 acres of Federal land  currently in the Sequoia National Monument to allow the Tribe to  protect the watershed headwaters and 800 acres of grazing land to the  north and south of the reservation boundary.   It is long past time for the Federal Government to live up to its  trust and treaty responsibilities to the Tule River Tribe. We must  codify this water settlement and settle the Tule River Tribe's claims  against the United States. Access to clean drinking water now and in  the future is essential to the continued strength of Tribal nations and  to ensuring the sustainability and viability of future generations.   Water is a sacred and necessary resource for Tribal nations and for  all people. As California and the West continue to experience a  historic megadrought, enactment of our legislation would provide water  security to Tule River citizens now and into the future.   I thank Senator Feinstein for introducing this legislation with me in  the Senate. I would also like to thank the Tule River Tribe for their  decades of hard work to finalize this settlement and the downstream  water users, including the Tule River Association and the South Tule  Independent Ditch Company, for working with the Tribe to settle this  issue and avoid litigation.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Tule River  Tribe Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act of 2022 as quickly as  possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Tule River Tribe  Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act of 2022.
