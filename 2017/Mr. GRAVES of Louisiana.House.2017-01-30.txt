 Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the sponsor  and the cosponsors of this bill, Congressman DeFazio, Congressman  Kilmer, Congressman Huffman, and many others that are supporting this  legislation.   This is important in that it promotes regional management. Today,  this pertains to the Dungeness crab, a species that is largely native  to the West Coast. In this case, what this legislation does is provide  for regional management. It provides for an opportunity for the States  of Washington, Oregon, and California to manage this species.   The States are closer to the ground. They have closer, more intimate  relationships with their fishers, and they can ensure that what is  being done is in the best interests of those folks, the best interests  of the public that they are closer to, and the best interests of the  recreational and commercial fishers that fish this species.    I think it is fantastic. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, I think  this exact model should be expanded. I think this exact model should be  replicated not just in Washington, Oregon, and California; it should be  replicated elsewhere, similar to how it is replicated for the Atlantic  striped bass on the East Coast and the salmon in Alaska. This should be  replicated to allow for States to be able to work together for regional  management strategies to manage the species and to allow for more  intimate, better public input to make sure that you have the  appropriate balance between recreational and commercial fishers.   I, again, want to commend the sponsor of this bill, Ms. Herrera  Beutler, and all the cosponsors. This is exactly what we need to be  doing. We need to be expanding upon this model around the coastal  States of this country.   I urge adoption of this bill, I urge aggressive passage of this bill,  and I urge the Senate to pass it as well.
