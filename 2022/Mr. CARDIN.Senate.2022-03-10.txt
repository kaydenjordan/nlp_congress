 Madam President, I would like to take this  opportunity to pay tribute to a wonderful professor and man, Dr.  Stephen--``Steve''--J. Simpson, of Frostburg, who died on February 21,  2022, of pancreatic cancer. Dr. Simpson taught and inspired generations  of students at Frostburg State University--FSU--in a career there that  spanned four decades. He was a widely respected scholar of the American  Presidency and the intersection of media and politics.   Steve Simpson was born on October 10, 1951, in Abington, PA. He  received his undergraduate degree from Dickinson College and his M.A.  and Ph.D. in political science from Princeton University. Steve spent  many years as FSU's dean of the college of sciences and provost and  chief academic officer. While he excelled in these roles, his greatest  enthusiasm was for being a professor of political science. He wasn't  just an academic mentor to scores of students over the years; he was a  life mentor who encouraged them to aim high in life as well as in  school.   Steve was cheerful, kind, generous, and respectful to everyone whom  he met and knew. He was a devoted son, brother, husband, uncle, and in- law to many members of an extended second family. He loved to discuss  politics and play card games, especially pinochle with his mother-in- law Mary Morshead as his partner. He instilled in his nephews, John and  David Simpson, a love of history and politics, which they have since  passed on to their children. Steve loved to travel with his wife of  nearly 30 years, Lisa Morshead. They traveled to Colonial Williamsburg,  Sanibel Island, and Fort Myers for spring training. He could not shake  his Pennsylvania roots entirely, so he was an avid Phillies, not  Orioles, fan--but we won't hold that against him. His love of baseball  extended to participating in fantasy leagues. He claimed he disliked  pets but he loved and cared for three rescue cats and a dog. Steve had  a big heart.   On behalf of the Senate, I would like to extend heartfelt condolences  to  [[Page S1114]]  Steve's wife Lisa; his brothers William and Robert and their wives  Brenda and Carolyn; his nephews John and David and their wives Laurie  and Alison; the rest of his extended family and friends; and the FSU  community. Henry B. Adams wrote, ``A teacher affects eternity; he can  never tell where his influence stops.'' I hope that the family and  friends who mourn Dr. Stephen Simpson's passing can find solace in the  knowledge that he surely has affected eternity and his influence will  continue to ripple far and wide among the students he so ably taught  and inspired.                            ____________________
