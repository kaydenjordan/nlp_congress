 Mr. President, I would like to call attention to a  special event occurring this Saturday in Mississippi to honor 16 brave  servicemembers who lost their lives a year ago in a tragic military  aircraft crash.   I look forward to joining family members, Marine Corps leaders, and  the people of Leflore County, MS, to honor the 15 marines and one Navy  corpsman who died on July 10, 2017, when their Marine Corps KC-130T  ``Yanky 72'' crashed near Itta Bena, MS.   We have a responsibility to ensure we preserve the memory of those  who gave that last full measure of devotion for our Nation. Those we  lost last July include: Cpl Daniel Baldassare, SSgt Robert Cox, Capt.  Sean Elliott, Maj. Caine Goyette, GySgt Sergeant Mark Hopkins, GySgt  Brendan Johnson, Sgt Julian Kevianne, SSgt William Kundrat, Sgt Chad  Jenson, Sgt Talon Leach, Sgt Owen Lennon, Sgt Joseph Murray, Cpl Collin  Schaaff, Sgt Dietrich Schmieman, SSgt Joshua Snowden, and PO 2 Class  Ryan Lohrey.   Immediately after the accident and since then, first responders and  the citizens of Mississippi rallied in support of the fallen. The  unveiling of a permanent monument will culminate a significant effort  in Mississippi and across the Nation to memorialize these brave young  men.   I am proud of the people of my State for their commitment to remember  the fallen and to support their families. A recent Greenwood  Commonwealth editorial thoughtfully expresses the significance of this  work.   I ask unanimous consent that the July 11, 2018, Greenwood  Commonwealth editorial titled ``Open arms for families of the fallen''  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From the Greenwood Commonwealth, July 11, 2018]                      Open Arms for Families of Fallen         This weekend promises to be a highly emotional one for the       families of the 16 servicemen who lost their lives a year ago       when the transport plane on which they were flying fell out       of the sky for reasons still not publicly disclosed.        It also could be a very meaningful weekend for the greater       Greenwood community,  [[Page S4944]]       which has become associated with these 16 by a tragically sad       quirk of fate.        When the KC-130T with the call name of Yanky 72 was flying       over the Mississippi Delta on July 10, 2017, no one on board       or on the ground below could have imagined that its final       destination would be a remote soybean field on the western       edge of Leflore County rather than an airstrip in California.        It was a horrific accident, claiming the lives of everyone       on board--15 Marines and one Navy corpsman.        Some 200 family members of those who died, plus a large       number of the fallen servicemen's comrades, are expected to       start arriving Thursday in Leflore County. For the next 72       hours or so, they will be our guests while they remember,       grieve and perhaps connect with some of the good people of       this community who, though they didn't personally know the       16, responded as if they did.        Today, the Commonwealth publishes a special section that       not only explains what's planned to memorialize the 16, but       also gives some insight into who the 16 were, and tells how       some of their families have coped with their loss since that       fateful afternoon.        Certainly, service in the military comes with risks.       Everyone who signs up for it knows it, as do all of their       friends and relatives. But death is not an ordinary outcome       when you're just flying from one base to another. It would be       hard to get one's mind around losing a loved one in a       warzone, but losing one so unexpectedly as this has to be all       that much tougher.        A large group of state and local volunteers has organized       the Yanky 72 Memorial Weekend in a way that it hopes will       give some emotional aid to those who are grieving, while also       reassuring them that their sons, brothers, husbands and       boyfriends have not been forgotten, nor will they be.        The families will be given the space to grieve in private,       to visit the crash scene, to share their experiences with       others who had relatives on that plane, to do whatever it is       that would give them some consolation. Some may want to be       left alone; some may want to connect.        We know this community will respect their wishes and do       whatever it takes to make their weekend one in which they       feel surrounded by sympathy and love.        Saturday's public events, including the unveiling of a       permanent memorial in Itta Bena, will provide a way to       acknowledge appreciation for the ultimate sacrifice paid for       by these 16. It would be wonderful if a large number of       citizens from this community turned out.        For some of the fallen servicemen's families who come, this       may be their first and only trip into the Delta. Others may       make it a place of personal pilgrimage.        Whichever occurs, let's hope that we become the locus not       of painful memories but of comforting ones.                            ____________________
