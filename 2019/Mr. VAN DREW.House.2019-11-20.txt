 Mr. Speaker, I want to highlight three exceptional  young ladies who reside in my district in south Jersey. They are  pageant titleholders who work for the greater good of our community.   Madison Stiles is a Salem County native, who uses her title to  promote mental health awareness. She is an avid volunteer through her  community and is a fantastic advocate for the important subject of  mental health.   Miss Vineland 2019, Marissa Marchese, who resides in Vineland, New  Jersey, created a platform called ``Homeless Has a Face'' that allows  her to educate individuals on the harsh realities of being displaced  and share the stories of those who are not fortunate enough to have a  roof over their heads.   Lastly, but certainly not least, Jaslene Candelaria, at the young age  of 11, created a platform that collects stuffed animals, blankets, and  inspirational cards for cancer patients of all ages. Her goal is to  bring joy and smiles to patients, and she visits various hospitals  throughout her community to make sure to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I thank them all for their selfless and benevolent work  throughout their communities. Our future is in wonderful hands with  them. They are our heroes, and may God bless them.                            ____________________
