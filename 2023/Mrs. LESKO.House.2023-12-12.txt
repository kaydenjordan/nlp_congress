 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great  American woman who has served our Nation and my State so admirably  throughout many decades.   Sandra Day O'Connor is an American icon and was a trailblazer for  thousands of women to pursue and achieve their dreams.   This amazing woman was born in 1930 and grew up on the Lazy B Ranch  in southeastern Arizona. She went on to serve in the Arizona Attorney  General's office and then as the county's first female State senate  majority leader in the Arizona legislature.   After being elected as a judge to the Maricopa County Superior Court,  she was nominated by President Ronald Reagan as America's first female  Supreme Court Justice.   She always showed courage, leadership, and independence throughout  her time in government. Her contributions to the fabric of this Nation  will be cherished for generations to come.                            ____________________
