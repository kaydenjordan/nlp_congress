 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr.  Cheryl A. McConnell on her historic inauguration as the 29th and first  female president of Saint Joseph's University. She is to be inaugurated  on September 8, 2023.   Since joining Saint Joseph's University 3 years ago, Dr. McConnell  has served in integral roles as provost and senior vice president for  academic affairs. Her presidential inauguration is the result of an  exceptional 35-year career in higher education.   As a first-generation college graduate and dedicated leader of Jesuit  higher education, Dr. McConnell has demonstrated her commitment to  learning and uplifting the next generation. Among her many  accomplishments, she has created new, in-demand academic programs to  expand Saint Joseph's University's impact throughout the greater  Philadelphia community and has focused on diversity, equity, and  inclusion to create a more robust and productive learning environment.  Further, in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. McConnell's  leadership was essential to the university's response to keep students,  faculty, and staff healthy and safe.   I am proud that Saint Joseph's University has selected Dr. McConnell  as its next president and know she will continue the university's  commitment to academic excellence and service to generations of  students.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Cheryl A.  McConnell on her historic inauguration and continuing her career in  public service to students in Pennsylvania.                            ____________________
