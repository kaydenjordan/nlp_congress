 Madam President, while he is on the floor, I  congratulate the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership.  Sometimes he says too many cooks spoil the pot or whatever the phrase  is. There could be too many cooks but not in this case. Senator  Manchin, because of his senior leadership on the Energy Committee and  on this bill, has been really a bulwark in bringing it to this point. I  thank him for that. He has been excellent about including all sorts of  us in the bill.   We have an unusual assortment of U.S. Senators, outside sportsmen  groups, conservation groups, the President of the United States, and  all of the former Secretaries of the Department of the Interior from  Babbitt to Zinke, someone said, going alphabetically--we all support  this bill that came up last night with 80 different votes.   Among those who deserve a lot of credit is another Member of the U.S.  Senate who is also on the floor right now, Mr. Warner from Virginia. He  became interested in this bill as soon as anyone. He may have been the  first one to put his toe in the water. He and Senator Portman from  Ohio, they formed a very strong team to bring this bill forward.   Since then, Senators Daines, Gardner, Heinrich, and King all have  joined in, and then Senators Manchin and Gardner, especially, have  added the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I thank all of them for  their leadership.   I will speak just briefly about what we call the Great American  Outdoors bill, and I think it helps first to say what we are talking  about. We are talking about the Chilhowee campground on Chilhowee  Mountain at the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in  Tennessee. It was closed for 2 or 3 years. Why? Because the sewage  system didn't work. So 500 families who normally would use that  campground in the summer--go up there and have this majestic view of  the highest mountains in the Eastern United States--didn't have that  possibility.   The Great Smoky Mountains has about 12 million visitors a year. That  is three or four times as many as Yellowstone does or any of the  western parks because it is in the East. It has $224 million of  deferred maintenance like that campground. Its annual budget is $20  million a year. So you don't have to have gone too far in mathematics  in the Maryville City School system to understand that it will probably  take 15, 20, 25 years, or never to be able to get rid of the deferred  maintenance in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, our most  visited national park.   Now, that is a massive disappointment to people who consider our  national parks as our greatest treasures, to go there and find a  campground closed, a bathroom that doesn't work, a bridge that is  closed, a road with a pothole, a trail that is worn out, and visitor  centers that are dilapidated, as they are in some of our centers around  the country. This is what we are talking about.   This is what we are talking about. We are talking about deferred  maintenance, things that are broken and  [[Page S2782]]  don't work and interfere with the ability of the American people to go  outdoors. Of all the times in our recent history when people would like  to go outdoors, it would be right now, just to get out of the house and  get away. Of all the times when we need some extra jobs, it would be  right now, when we have 14 percent of the people in Tennessee out of  work. Some of them could go to work on the roads and the bridges and  the trails and the potholes and the sewage systems and the other things  that need to be fixed, if we had the money.   So that is the first thing this bill is about. It is about the  deferred maintenance in the national parks--but not just in the  national parks. With President Trump's enthusiastic support, we have  added to the bill, as it has made its way through the Senate, other  public lands; for example, the Fish and Wildlife Service lands, the  U.S. Forest Service lands, the Bureau of Land Management lands, and the  Bureau of Indian Education schools. There are lots of Indian schools  that are rundown and need to be fixed.   All of those are part of this bill, which is why, among the 800  organizations--800 outside groups--who have called all of us and asked  us to vote last night, among the most enthusiastic are the fishermen  and the sportsmen--the Ducks Unlimited, headquartered in Memphis. They  are really for this bill because we want to use the public lands. We  want them preserved. Fishermen want access to their streams. Tourists  want to be able to drive to the top of Newfound Gap in the Great Smoky  Mountains or to see the Grand Canyon or to visit Pearl Harbor or to  walk on the National Mall. All of these are part of our deferred  maintenance problem.   So there are two parts to the bill. The first is the Land and Water  Conservation Fund. Now, this is a fund that was created in 1964. It was  a pretty good idea, I have always thought. You take an environmental  burden--drilling offshore for oil and gas--and you create an  environmental benefit--take some of the money and use it to buy  treasured lands.   Senator Daines of Montana points out that 80 percent of the access to  good fishing in Montana comes with funding for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund. So for 64 years we have had some money come through  Congress for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but--the problem  is--not all of the money that Congress intended, because in 1964  Congress said, Set aside a certain amount of money, about $900 million,  for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, put it in the Treasury, and  then spend it for this purpose: half to the States for their land  acquisition and half to the Federal Government. But Congress didn't  ever appropriate all that money.   We took that back up in 1985 and 1986 with President Reagan's  Commission on Americans Outdoors, which I chaired and Gil Grosvenor  from the National Geographic was the cochairman.   The No. 1 recommendation for President Reagan's Commission on  Americans Outdoors was to permanently fund the Land and Water  Conservation Fund. This bill does that. We permanently authorized it  earlier in this Congress. This year we will permanently fund it.   The second part is to restore our parks and our public lands. In that  case, as I just described, whether it is the national parks or the  fishing or the access roads or the bridges or other rundown and worn- out trails or buildings or sewage systems, at the rate we are going, it  will take about 15 to 20 years, maybe longer--maybe never--to finish  all that deferred maintenance, but, with this bill, we should reduce  that substantially.   The idea is to take about up to $14 billion over 5 years and use it  to pay for deferred maintenance. Now, how do we pay for that? Well, we  pay for it with real money. We pay for it with earnings from energy  exploration on Federal lands.   Now, this is not a new concept. As I mentioned, the Land and Water  Conservation Fund put that into law in 1964: environmental burden,  environmental benefit. It is also not a new concept for all the coastal  States in our country because we take money--I think it is 27 percent  of the money we get from drilling just off the coastal States--and we  give it to those States.   We also take some money from drilling in what we call an area beyond  the 3-mile limit for southern States and give them 37 percent of that  money. We also take some money from drilling, say, in Wyoming and give  Wyoming 50 percent of that money--or in Alaska, 90 percent of that  money.   The difference is, we do all of that before we give the rest to the  Treasury. So the idea that we are spending real money from energy  drilling in a new and different way is stretching it a little bit  because we already spend a lot of money that we earn from energy  exploration on Federal lands by giving it to States before we give the  rest of it to the Treasury. The difference here is, after we give the  rest of it to the Treasury, we are going to take half of that for 5  years and use it for deferred maintenance. Senator Portman, who used to  be Director of the Office of Management and Budget, calls it using real  money to reduce an unpaid debt.   Now, it is absolutely true that the way the Congressional Budget  Office looks at that, it is not offset. But there is a difference of  opinion here. President Trump looks at it in a different way. He thinks  it is real money for deferred maintenance. The Office of Management and  Budget disagrees with the Congressional Budget Office. They approve  this spending. The President's budget includes this spending.   We are spending, as I said earlier, money that we already--the same  kind of money we spend that we give to States before we give it to the  Federal Government.   So, if I am walking down Broadway in Maryville, TN, where I am from,  and I am trying to say to them ``Where does this come from?'' we would  say that we use real money. We use money from energy exploration on  Federal lands. We are going to use it for 5 years--in the case of  everything but the Land and Water Conservation Fund for 5 years. If we  don't have the money, we don't spend it. If we do have the money, we do  spend it.   As a result of that, we are going to be able to fix those broken  bridges, those sewage systems, those dilapidated visitor centers, those  roads with potholes, those trails that are worn out. Instead of maybe  never fixing them or doing them at a rate of 20 or 25 years, we will be  able to cut in half that deferred maintenance backlog and reduce  substantially the time it takes to make these public lands the kinds of  lands that all of us expect when we go to visit.   So I am delighted to be in full support of this. I thank Senator  Warner, Senator Portman, and all the others who have worked so hard on  it. I hope that the vote we had last night, with 80 Senators of both  parties in support of moving ahead with the bill, signals that, as we  go through the other procedural efforts this week, we will have  significant bipartisan support, send it to the House where an identical  bill is being introduced, and send it to the President.   President Trump is fully in support of it. In fact, without him and  his Office of Management and Budget, we wouldn't have a chance to do  it.   More than 2\1/2\ years ago, Secretary Zinke, a big fellow from  Montana who was the Interior Secretary, came down to Tennessee and  asked me if I would get involved in this because it was so important.  He said that he had talked to Mick Mulvaney, who was then in the Office  of Management and Budget, and to the President and they wanted it done.   So I got involved. I found myself in pretty good company with Senator  Warner and a lot of other folks, and here we are today. So I hope we  have great success with this bill. I know the people of Tennessee are  looking forward to it.   I would be remiss if I didn't point out--I pointed out that, with the  Smokies, our backlog is about $224 million, and our annual budget is  about $20 million, so we will never get the backlog fixed if we don't  pass a bill like this or this bill.   The same applies to other public lands in our State. The Cherokee  National Forest, which is the largest piece of public land in  Tennessee, will get help with their $27 million maintenance backlog to  make sure their access roads and trails are kept open for 3 million  visitors each year. That is about as many visitors as many of our most  popular western parks have.  [[Page S2783]]    The Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge will get help with their $8.4  million maintenance backlog to make sure the hunters and fishers can  safely use the boat ramps and the boat docks   I yield the floor.    Madam President, U.S. Senator Tim Scott, who is an  African-American Republican from South Carolina, once told our Bible  study that police in his hometown had stopped him several times for  being a ``Black man in the wrong place'' even though, at the time, he  was serving as chairman of the Charleston City Council.   During these last few days, I have been thinking a lot about what Tim  Scott told us, and I wondered how many White Americans know things like  that happen--White Americans like me. I wondered how I would feel if I  were stopped for being a White man in the wrong place in my hometown,  especially if most of the people in the town were Black. Would I feel  hurt? Scared? Disillusioned? Angry? Weary? Disappointed? Intimidated?  Probably all of those things.   One result of George Floyd's killing is that Black Americans are  telling more stories like Tim Scott's. A professor of religious studies  in Nashville wrote in The Tennessean that he carries a licensed firearm  with him when he goes for a run. A columnist remembers that, as a 6- year-old, a White woman outside a Dallas gas station restroom said to  him: Now, you don't belong here.   Well-educated Black businessmen count the times they have been  profiled because of their race. One of my friends in Memphis, who is  now vice president of Memphis's largest hospital, told me that when he  went to Memphis State in the 1960s, it was clear to him that almost  everyone thought that he didn't belong there.   During my lifetime, I have seen profound changes in racial attitudes.  In 1958, when I enrolled at Vanderbilt University, I had no Black  classmates. African Americans couldn't sit at lunch counters in  Nashville. Blacks driving across Tennessee couldn't stay in most  motels; they couldn't eat at most restaurants; they couldn't ride at  the front of most public buses.   Then, in 1962, in the spring, the Vanderbilt University Board of  Trustees changed its policy and admitted Black undergraduate students.   In August of 1963, I remember standing in the back of a huge crowd  late that month. I was an intern in the U.S. Department of Justice, and  I heard a booming voice--which was Dr. Martin Luther King's voice--say:  ``I have a dream.''   In 1968, I was a Senate aide here, and I remember being in the room,  which is today the Republican leader's office, where Senators were  around a big table, and Senator Everett Dirksen and then-President  Lyndon Johnson were writing the Civil Rights bill.   During the 1980s, I saw Tennessee adopt a Martin Luther King holiday  and swear in its first Black supreme court justice. In the 1980s, the  University of Tennessee hired its first two Black vice presidents, and  it hired its first Black basketball coach who, as a teenager in Alcoa,  once sat in the ``colored'' section at UT football games.   I saw the Voting Rights Act help to elect thousands of African- American public officials, including President Barack Obama and Senator  Tim Scott. Last week, I asked Senator Scott if I could tell the story  that he told us privately in the Bible study. He said: Sure. It  happened again just last month.   So despite a half century of profound change, an African-American  U.S. Senator is stopped again by police for being a Black man in the  wrong place in his hometown. So what do we do now? Bringing those who  killed George Floyd to justice will help. Dealing firmly with looters  who hijack peaceful protests will help. Some new laws and government  actions will help, such as criminal justice reform and permanent  funding for historically Black colleges that became law in this  Congress. It would also help to open schools and colleges in August and  to open them safely because a good education is the surest ticket to a  better future for minority students, and those students will suffer  more from schools being closed.   Benjamin Hooks, the former NAACP president from Memphis--he was the  national president of the NAACP; he lived in Memphis. He taught  students this. Dr. Hooks said: America is a work in progress. We have  come a long way, but we have a long way to go.   That long way to go, I would say, will not be as easy as passing  laws. It will take changing behavior. One way to do that could be last  week's peaceful protest organized by Nashville teenagers, which was a  textbook example of First Amendment citizenship, and it hopefully will  encourage more victims of racism to tell their stories and more White  Americans to adjust our attitudes.   I am grateful that Tim Scott gave me permission to tell his story.  Perhaps a good first step to changing attitudes toward racial  discrimination would be for each of us who is White to ask ourselves  this question: How would I feel if police in my hometown repeatedly  stopped me for being a White man or a White woman in the wrong place,  especially if most of the other people in the town were Black?   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 12 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.
